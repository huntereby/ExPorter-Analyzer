One-fifth of those who were ambulatory before their hip fracture require long-term care afterward. Beyond their age, other lifestyle factors make veterans particularly susceptible to osteoporosis, including smoking, alcohol consumption, and an inactivity. Moreover, many Vietnam veterans were exposed to environmental factors during the war, such as the dioxin TCDD (found in Agent Orange), which put them at much greater risk for osteoporosis. Recently, the VA amended its adjudication regulation to establish a presumption of service connection for osteoporosis for former Prisoners of War (POWs) who were detained or interned for at least 30 days, and more recently, for those diagnosed with posttraumatic stress dis-order (PTSD), and whose osteoporosis is at least 10% disabling.

A subset of APOBEC3s (A3s) were initially discovered to potently restrict HIV-1, including A3G, A3F and A3H. However, A3 activity can be a double-edged sword. If not properly regulated, DNA-editing A3s that also have access to the nucleus can deaminate self-genomes, potentially instigating cancer. In this proposal we are leveraging our complementary strengths through a multi-disciplinary approach combining structural biology, biophysics, enzymology, chemistry and virology, to characterize the molecular interactions and differential specificities of A3s to nucleic acids and HIV-1 Vif, which will provide epitopes that once characterized will be target sites for future therapeutic development.",1922833 (contact),"SCHIFFER, CELIA A.

The urgent need for novel therapeutic intervention strategies is underscored by what has become regular outbreaks of Ebola virus (EBOV), each threatening a potential pandemic of global proportions. Given the rapid progression of the virus and the vulnerabilities in the immune response, a fast- acting, immune system-independent medical countermeasure is proposed that targets EBOV matrix protein (i.e. VP40) as an essential viral protein to produce infectious viruses. This novel approach for a potent, fast-acting therapeutic that is a selective antagonist of Ebola VP40 and viral particle assembly will enhance survival for infected people in hot zones of an Ebola outbreak. We have published our validated drug discovery assay for compounds that will inhibit the function of EBOV VP40 in viral particle assembly.

To this end I have recently developed a multi-cellular integrated brain (miBRAIN) immuno-glial-neurovascular unit that includes all of the brain-resident cell types that recapitulates key phenotypic and functional phenotypes of the human brain, with enhanced in vivo-like signatures compared to their monocultured counterparts, that I propose to combine with custom microfluidic devices I invented to create and validate 3D-miBRAIN-Chips towards matching human BBB permeability and selectivity in vitro.

Radiation can damage tumors in a way that renders them more responsive to immunotherapies, however conventional radiation therapy typically cannot treat all tumor sites in patients with metastatic disease because of toxicities and the inability to target small tumors that are not identified on imaging scans. Targeted radionuclide therapies injected into a patient’s vein go throughout the body to preferentially deliver radiation to tumors wherever they are located and here we will (1) determine the effect of this type of treatment on the susceptibility of tumors to immune response; and (2) test the effectiveness of this type of treatment when combined with the most common form of immunotherapy in order to determine which combinations should be most beneficial in patients with metastatic or recurrent head and neck cancer.",12660124 (contact),"MORRIS, ZACHARY SCOTT (contact)",NA,2016-08-02,2027-07-31,90Y;Albumins;analog;Anatomy;anti-PD-1;anti-PD1 therapy;anti-tumor immune response;Antigen Presentation;Binding;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;checkpoint inhibition;chelation;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clonal Expansion;Combined Modality Therapy;curative treatments;Data;Development;Disease;Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm;Dose;dosimetry;effectiveness testing;exhaust;exhaustion;External Beam Radiation Therapy;follow-up;Generations;Goals;Grant;Halogens;Head and Neck Cancer;Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma;Image;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immune response;Immune Tolerance;Immunity;immunogenic cell death;Immunologics;immunoregulation;Immunotherapy;improved;in situ vaccine;in vivo;Infiltration;Inflammation;insight;Interferons;Ligands;Location;Malignant Neoplasms;Metastatic/Recurrent;Modality;Modeling;mouse model;Mus;Mutation;neoantigens;Neoplasm Metastasis;neoplastic cell;next generation;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;Outcome;patient derived xenograft model;Patients;Phase;phase I trial;pre-clinical;preclinical study;Preclinical Testing;Predisposition;Publishing;Radiation;Radiation therapy;Radioisotopes;Radionuclide therapy;receptor;Recurrence;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Reporting;research clinical testing;response;Safety;Scanning;Site;Surface;T cell clonality;T cell infiltration;T-cell receptor repertoire;T-Lymphocyte;targeted treatment;Testing;Therapeutic Effect;Toxic effect;Translations;Treatment Protocols;tumor;Tumor Antigens;Tumor Immunity;tumor microenvironment;tumor xenograft;Tumor-infiltrating immune cells;Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes;Universities;uptake;Veins;Wisconsin,Project 1: Priming and propagating immunity against head and neck cancer using targeted radionuclide therapy,278595,ZCA1,ZCA1-RPRB-7,6224,NA,8,228754,124353,NA,353107

There is evidence to suggest that atypical neurodevelopment of the amygdala, as well as its modulatory brain circuits, can be detected soon after birth in children exposed to AMD. However, there is a critical need for refined characterization of neurodevelopmental trajectories from birth to early childhood that can potentially mediate poor mental health outcomes after AMD exposure, especially in low-resource settings. Here, two early-career investigators from South Africa aim to delineate deviations in growth trajectories and functional and morphological integration across the amygdala, insular and prefrontal cortex following AMD exposure. A further key aim is to determine whether environmental adversities aggravate AMD-related neurodevelopmental deviations in a LMIC setting. We propose to include 6 longitudinal neuroimaging datasets that are actively contributing to ENIGMA-ORIGINs for a cross-national analysis of amygdala, insula, and prefrontal neurodevelopment related to AMD exposure in children 0-6 years of age. AMD exposure will be defined by clinically relevant thresholds in each sample. Standardized protocols for harmonized image processing are to be applied to T2-weighted, T1-weighted, and resting state brain scans. Non-linear longitudinal growth trajectories will be estimated for regions of interest, and their intercepts and asymptotes will be compared between AMD-exposed and unexposed children. The two groups will also be contrasted on indices of intrinsic network connectivity and coordinated structural expansion across regions. The aggregation of data across four continents will give the power necessary for analyses stratified by sex and child age, mediation analysis on child internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, and exploration of interactions between AMD and socio-economic status in linear mixed models. Finally, we will utilize a unique LMIC birth cohort with AMD assessment and repeated child brain imaging to examine prevalent environmental adversities such as food insecurity, intimate partner violence, and single/unplanned parenthood as moderators of AMD-related changes to neurodevelopment. This project will provide important insights into critical periods in neurodevelopment for early manifestations of psychopathology after exposure to AMD in the global as well as LMIC context. It will provide a first explorative answer as to whether and how socio-economic advantage can provide a protective buffer against deviations in early brain development following AMD exposure. South African research capacity will grow through mastery of advanced neuroimaging techniques that can eventually be applied to many different types of local environmental adversities and allow us to participate in ENIGMA as equitable, valuable partners. Finally, the project is designed to establish the principal investigators as the world leaders on the impact of maternal depression on early brain development in low-resource settings.",77917779 (contact);12430999,"GROENEWOLD, NYNKE  (contact);IPSER, JONATHAN CLAUDE","KING, ERIN MICHELE",2022-09-09,2027-06-30,6 year old;Address;Africa;Age;Amygdaloid structure;antenatal;Anterior;Attenuated;Birth;boys;Brain;Brain imaging;Brain region;Brain scan;Buffers;career;Child;Childhood;clinically relevant;cohort;Country;critical period;Cues;Data;Data Aggregation;Data Set;Databases;design;Development;early childhood;Education;Equity;experience;Exposure to;Family;food insecurity;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Funding;girls;Goals;Growth;High Prevalence;Household;image processing;Income;indexing;infancy;Infant;insight;Insula of Reil;Intercept;interest;International;Intervention;intimate partner violence;life span;Link;low and middle-income countries;Low income;low socioeconomic status;maternal depression;Mediating;Mediation;Mediator;Mental disorders;Mental Health;Modeling;Morphology;National Institute of Mental Health;neural correlate;neurodevelopment;neuroimaging;Nonlinear Dynamics;novel;novel strategies;Outcome;Prefrontal Cortex;Principal Investigator;Protocols documentation;Psychopathology;Regulation;Research;Research Personnel;Resource-limited setting;Rest;Risk;Risk Marker;Sampling;sex;Socioeconomic Status;socioeconomics;South Africa;South African;Standardization;Symptoms;Techniques;Testing;United States National Institutes of Health;Work,Early brain development in children born to depressed mothers in high and low income settings,131022,ZMH1,ZMH1-ERB-N(05),NA,NA,3,345273,19323,364596,NA

We have developed state of the art methods based on evolutionary conservation to identify when a conserved RNA sequence includes a conserved structure (R-scape), and to predict the RNA structure of those that have one (CaCoFold); these methods are more accurate and have fewer false predictions than other previous methods, which makes them suitable for the detection and analysis of conserved RNA structures in complex eukaryotic genomes. We propose three lines of research: to systematically identify novel structural RNAs in vertebrates with special emphasis on the experi- mental characterization of those involved in human health and disease; to produce novel methods to accurately determine their 3D structure; and to produce next generation methods exploiting pre-covariation signals to detect novel primate-speciﬁc structural RNAs relevant to human health.",6625694 (contact),"RIVAS, ELENA  (contact)","SAKALIAN, MICHAEL",2022-09-15,2026-07-31,3-Dimensional;Adopted;Algorithms;Amino Acid Sequence;Attention;Bacteria;Base Pairing;Bioinformatics;Biological;Biological Process;Biology;causal variant;Cell Extracts;Cell Physiology;Cells;Characteristics;Chromatography;Complex;computerized tools;Computing Methodologies;Coupled;deep learning;Detection;Disease;Enzymes;Escherichia coli;Evolution;Exhibits;expectation;fungus;Genetic Epistasis;Genetic Transcription;Genome;genome wide screen;genome-wide;Genomics;Health;Human;Human Biology;Human Genome;improved;insight;Knowledge;Left;Life;Machine Learning;MALAT1 gene;mammalian genome;Markov Chains;Mediating;Methodology;Methods;MicroRNAs;model organism;Mutation;Names;next generation;novel;Peptides;Phylogenetic Analysis;Phylogeny;Play;Positioning Attribute;preservation;Primates;programs;protein structure prediction;Proteins;Publications;Publishing;Recording of previous events;Reporter Genes;Research;Ribosomal RNA;RNA;RNA Splicing;Role;Saccharomyces cerevisiae;Sequence Alignment;Signal Transduction;Small Nucleolar RNA;Structure;System;targeted treatment;Technology;Telomerase;Testing;therapeutic development;three dimensional structure;tool;Transcript;Translations;Triplet Multiple Birth;Untranslated Regions;Untranslated RNA;Variant;vertebrate genome;Vertebrates;virtual;Virus;Work,Discovery of structural RNAs involved in human health and disease,144423,MSFB,Macromolecular Structure and Function B Study Section[MSFB],NA,NA,3,234586,113989,348575,NA

For this purpose, we will leverage breakthrough technology allowing silencing of thousands of genes in millions of individual cells, followed by RNA-seq profiling, thus creating the first generation of genome- and proteome-wide network models that can effectively predict the probabilistic, time-dependent response of mammalian cells to small molecule and genetic perturbations, as well as their ability to plastically reprogram across the relatively small number of molecularly distinct states detected in virtually all human malignancies.",7827402 (contact),"CALIFANO, ANDREA  (contact)","DUECK, HANNAH RUTH",2015-08-14,2029-07-31,Address;Affect;Behavior;Biological Assay;cancer cell;cell behavior;Cell model;Cells;CRISPR interference;curative treatments;Data;Educational process of instructing;Etiology;Event;expectation;forging;Funding;Generations;Genes;Genetic;genetic regulatory protein;Genetic Transcription;Genome;Goals;Human;Individual;Intervention;knock-down;Learning;learning network;Logic;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammalian Cell;Mediating;Molecular;Molecular Profiling;Mutation;Nature;network models;Normal Cell;novel;Organ;Pharmaceutical Preparations;pharmacologic;Physiological;Population;predictive modeling;Process;programs;Proteins;Proteome;quantum;Reagent;Regulation;Research;response;Series;Signal Transduction;Signaling Protein;single-cell RNA sequencing;small molecule;Statistical Models;synergism;Technology;Time;transcriptome sequencing;transdifferentiation;tumor;tumor microenvironment;virtual,Predicting Cancer Cell Response to Endogenous and Exogenous Perturbations at the Single Cell Level,197745,ZCA1,ZCA1-GRB-I(M1),NA,NA,10,570000,367650,937314,NA

Chronic inflammation is linked with MM in European Americans and our preliminary data has identified an immune mutational signature, active in early pre-clinical disease phases that is increased in AA, and could explain the AA excess risk. By extracting these early mutational signatures from whole genome sequencing data of bone marrow samples along with assessments of the immune microenvironment and the gut microbiome we aim to establish a link that could be manipulated to minimize racial disparities in this devastating cancer. 1",10891158 (contact),"MORGAN, GARETH JOHN (contact)","CAGA-ANAN, EMILIE CHARLISSE F",2021-08-11,2026-07-31,"16S ribosomal RNA sequencing;Address;Adenine;Affinity;African American;African American population;Age of Onset;Alabama;American;anti-cancer research;Antigens;biobank;Biocompatible Materials;Biological;Biometry;Bone Marrow;Cancer Center;Chronic;Chronology;Clinical;Collection;Comprehensive Cancer Center;Computational algorithm;Cross-Sectional Studies;Data;Data Set;Deaminase;Disease;Disparity;DNA;early onset;effective intervention;Environment;Environmental Exposure;Epidemiology;Etiology;European;Event;Exposure to;Fingerprint;Generations;Genetic;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;genetic variant;genome sequencing;Genomics;Goals;gut microbiome;gut microbiota;high risk;Immune;Immune response;immunological status;Immunologics;Immunosuppression;Incidence;Indiana;Individual;Induced Mutation;Inflammation;Infrastructure;insight;Intervention;Knowledge;Link;Longitudinal cohort study;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center;microbiome;Molecular;Molecular Abnormality;Monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance;Multiple Myeloma;Mutation;New York;Pathogenesis;Pathologic Mutagenesis;Phase;Play;pre-clinical;premalignant;Process;Prospective, cohort study;Race;racial difference;racial disparity;racial diversity;racial population;Reaction;reconstruction;response;Risk;Role;Sampling;Series;Shapes;Structure of germinal center of lymph node;System;T cell response;T-Lymphocyte;Therapeutic;Time;tumor-immune system interactions;Universities;whole genome",Mutographs differentiating the racial and temporal incidence of multiple myeloma,249981,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-OBT-B(55)R],NA,NA,4,804205,249948,1054153,NA

Because widescale screening for CRE colonization remains impractical for most U.S. hospitals, hospitals miss critical opportunities to identify patients at high risk of CRE colonization and infection early, when it is still possible to prevent deleterious patient outcomes. We propose to leverage state-of-the-art machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques on electronic health records (EHRs) to improve identification of CRE-colonized and infected patients by: (a) developing and validating natural language processing classifiers to detect established and new CRE risk factors from free-text, narrative EHR data; (b) using NLP-derived variables with EHR structured data to predict CRE colonization at admission; and (c) developing machine learning-based models to predict which CRE-colonized patients will progress to infection during the hospital stay, in order to guide precision medicine-based approaches for interventions.",14296775 (contact),"GOODMAN, KATHERINE ELIZABETH (contact)","WILLIS, TAMARA",2021-09-30,2026-09-29,NA,Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify patients at high risk of potentially preventable carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) infection,28363,HCRT,Healthcare Research Training [HCRT],NA,NA,4,106460,8517,114977,NA
