Autoresuscitation is the reflex process that allows babies to recover successfully from apneas, and serotonin, a neurotransmitter in the brain, plays an essential role organizing and driving this reflex, yet it seems likely that many babies who died of SIDS lacked sufficient serotonergic neuron function in the brainstem, which may be the reason that autoresuscitation fails in these babies. We have discovered a set of neurons, we call `para- serotonergic neurons,' that may transform into serotonin-producing cells as part of a compensatory neural adaptation to stress that promotes a normal autoresuscitation response and reduces the chance of SIDS, and we propose deep functional and molecular characterization of these cells, motivated by their potential as a therapeutic target for pediatric disorders involving cardiorespiratory dysfunction.",1896284 (contact);7934510;7680410,"DYMECKI, SUSAN M.

However, the supply-chain of UDCA is limited and is driven by either (i) the inhumane/illegal harvesting of bile acids from bears, or (ii) semi-synthesis from starting materials isolated from animal gall bladders. The research proposed here will give Metselex an economical and sustainable source for UDCA via a synthetic metabolic pathway in yeast. Metselex is developing new first-line drugs to combat neurodegenerative diseases. Acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases are the leading causes of death and disability in the USA and world. The economic burden on society that results from treatment costs and lost productivity is substantial. Current estimates of the cost of care are almost $1T per year for chronic neurodegenerative patients in the US, including $600B just for Alzheimer’s Disease, growing to $2T by 2050 The research proposed here will enable the large-scale production of new UDCA-derived therapeutics for these diseases that will result in better patient outcomes. Success of Metselex’s drug development pipeline depends on an economical source of UDCA, which will be produced on this effort.

This project advances IPV response intervention by providing a low-cost combined IPV and mental health response intervention that has the potential to expand critical services to women experiencing IPV in informal settlements—women who are more likely to be experiencing IPV and less likely to have access to these services—and to help reduce IPV and psychological distress for these women.",16325196 (contact),"WINTER, SAMANTHA C.

The financial transfer will be “labelled” with one-time message that the transfer is intended for them to visit and care for their hospitalized infant. This simple intervention will test the hypothesis that low- income mothers do not have access to crucial caregiving behaviors linked to improve preterm infant health and development—breastfeeding and skin-to-skin care—because of the acute financial stress faced after preterm birth limits their ability to visit the hospital.,10510585;12173461 (contact),"MCCONNELL, MARGARET ;PARKER, MARGARET GRAHAM KEMPER (contact)","GUMINA, DIANE LAURA",2022-09-01,2027-08-31,"Accident and Emergency department;Acute;Address;Adherence;arm;Attention;Back to Sleep;Behavior;Birth;Breast Feeding;breast pump;caregiving;Caring;Child;Child Care;Child Development;Child Health;Childhood;Clinical;cognitive function;Control Groups;cost;Cost Analysis;Development;Developmental Disabilities;Disparity;economic disparity;effectiveness testing;enhanced care;Equity;Failure;Family;feasibility trial;Financial Hardship;group intervention;Health;Health Benefit;health care availability;health care service utilization;Health Promotion;Health system;hospital readmission;Hospitalization;Hospitals;Hour;Human Milk;improved;Incidence;Income;Infant;Infant Care;Infant Development;Infant Health;innovation;interest;Intervention;Label;Length of Stay;Link;Location;Low income;lower income families;Massachusetts;maternal caregiving;Mediating;Mediator;Medicaid eligibility;Medical Care Costs;Memory;Mental Depression;Mental Health;milk production;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality;Mothers;Neonatal Intensive Care Units;neurodevelopment;Outcome;Physiological;Pilot Projects;Population;Pregnancy;Premature Birth;Premature Infant;primary outcome;program costs;programs;psychologic;Psychological Impact;Quality of Care;randomized trial;Randomized, Controlled Trials;Reduce health disparities;Reporting;Research;Risk;Rural;secondary outcome;Shoulder;Skin;Skin Care;sleep position;socioeconomic disparity;standard care;standard of care;Stress;suburb;Testing;Time;Training;Transportation;treatment arm;treatment as usual;United States;Visit",Effect of support for low-income mothers of preterm infants on parental caregiving in the NICU,109293,HHD,Healthcare and Health Disparities Study Section[HHD],NA,NA,3,536910,142196,679106,NA

We are investigating whether synthetic sugars molecules resembling the target sugars can ‘trick’ the immune system into producing antibodies that will bind the similar-looking sugar molecules on the HIV spike surface.

However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.

We identify immune and epigenetic factors that imprint an immunological memory in alveolar macrophages during prior influenza infection, that causes these cells to mount an early and exaggerated inflammatory response upon subsequent secondary bacterial infection, resulting in sepsis and severe disease.
