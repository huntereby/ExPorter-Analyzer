Here, we will test our hypothesis that anti-amyloid antibodies with higher binding affinities for vascular amyloid are more likely to cause ARIA by comparing the biological and pathological binding characteristics of 4 clinical anti-amyloid antibodies to parenchymal plaque and vascular amyloid in human AD brain tissues and staining in amyloid mouse models. In addition, we will compare in vivo the ability of the murine analogs of 3 of the anti-amyloid antibodies to both lower plaque and vascular amyloid burden and induce ARIA in 5XE4 mice and, test antibody cocktails containing an anti-amyloid antibodies and either an anti-APOE mAb or an anti-complement C1s1 antibody to mitigate ARIA.",6803422 (contact),"LEMERE, CYNTHIA A (contact)","YIN, XILING",2024-06-01,2029-05-31,abeta accumulation;Abeta clearance;Acceleration;Aducanumab;Adverse effects;Affinity;aged;Alleles;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Alzheimer&apos;s disease brain;Alzheimer&apos;s disease model;Amyloid;Amyloid beta-Protein;Amyloid deposition;analog;Antibodies;Antibody Affinity;antibody immunotherapy;antibody test;Antibody Therapy;Apolipoprotein E;apolipoprotein E-4;Autopsy;Binding;Biochemical;Biological;Blocking Antibodies;Blood - brain barrier anatomy;Blood Vessels;brain tissue;Cells;Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy;Cerebrovascular system;Characteristics;Classical Complement Pathway;Clinic;Clinical;Combined Modality Therapy;Complement;Complement Activation;Complement component C1s;Deposition;Disease;Edema;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Excision;extracellular;Extravasation;Face;Health;Hemorrhage;high risk;Human;Image;Immune;immune activation;Immune response;Immunohistochemistry;Immunoprecipitation;Immunotherapy;Impaired cognition;Impairment;improved;in vivo;Inflammation;Inflammatory Response;Injections;Measures;Mediating;Medicare;Methods;Modeling;Monoclonal Antibodies;monomer;mouse model;Mus;Neuroglia;neuroinflammation;novel;Passive Immunization;Pathologic;patient subsets;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Phase III Clinical Trials;phase III trial;Positron-Emission Tomography;Press Releases;prevent;Proteins;Recombinants;recruit;Reporting;research study;Risk;Safety;sample fixation;Senile Plaques;side effect;Signal Transduction;Site;Stains;Swelling;targeted treatment;Testing;Time;Uncertain Risk;vascular inflammation;β-amyloid burden,Understanding and Mitigating Vascular Side-Effects Associated with Anti-Amyloid Immunotherapy,136122,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1 BN-M (91)],NA,NA,1,477204,354397,831601,NA

There are no licensed human vaccines or antiviral drugs for the alphaviruses and the trivalent veterinary vaccine, given against VEEV, EEEV and WEEV, is poorly immunogenic, requiring frequent boosts. Together, these alphaviruses possess potential for use in biowarfare/bioterrorism and also present a threat for large-scale outbreaks. Based upon recent advances in understanding of the virulence mechanisms of each of these viruses, we propose to generate highy attenuated, immunogenic and stable live attenuated vaccines that can be used either as veterinary or human vaccines.

Interestingly, recent reports show that MF treatment before and after ischemic injury reduces stress and inhibits inflammatory responses. Recent published work by our group and as well as current preliminary data reveal that MF promotes the activation of counteractive mechanisms which drastically reduce tobacco smoke (TS) and e-cigarette (e-Cig) toxicity at both the brain and cerebrovascular levels, protects BBB integrity, and improves stroke outcome. Ultimately our data suggest that repurposing MF could provide a suitable prophylactic and/or post stroke therapeutic agent to be utilized for a high risk, stroke-prone populations of smokers and possibly early stage former smokers.  To this end, the goal of our current research endevour is to understand further the mechanisms and extent to which metformin can prevent/reduce BBB damage and subsequent ischemic stroke injuries in high risk populations of smokers and vapers. We are concurrently exploring the inhibition of pathological mechanisms related to the dysregulation of Nrf2, which is similarly involved in TS/e-Cig cerebrovascular impairments.",2095306 (contact);8344050,"ABBRUSCATO, THOMAS J (contact);CUCULLO, LUCA","HEWETT, SANDRA JEANNE",2020-07-01,2025-05-31,Address;Animals;Anti-diabetic Drugs;artery occlusion;Attenuated;Behavioral;Blood - brain barrier anatomy;Blood capillaries;Blood Vessels;blood-based biomarker;Brain;brain endothelial cell;Brain Injuries;brain tissue;Cardiovascular system;Caring;Carotid Arteries;Cell Separation;Cerebral Ischemia;cerebrovascular;Chronic;chronic stroke;Clinical;Clinical Research;comorbidity;Data;Disease;Dose;Edema;effectiveness evaluation;Electronic cigarette;electronic liquid;Endothelium;environmental tobacco smoke exposure;Evaluation;Female;fluoro jade;former smoker;Gender;Goals;Grant;Health;Hemorrhage;high risk;high risk population;Histologic;Hour;Impairment;improved;In Vitro;in vivo;Infarction;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Response;inhibitor;Injury;Investigation;Ischemia;Ischemic Brain Injury;ischemic injury;Ischemic Stroke;Laboratories;Link;Lipids;male;Measurement;Mediating;Meta-Analysis;Metabolic;Metformin;Mitochondria;Molecular;Molecular Target;mortality;Mus;Neurologic;Neurons;neuroprotection;never smoker;NF-kappa B;Nicotine;Nicotine Withdrawal;nuclear factor-erythroid 2;Outcome;oxidative damage;Oxidative Stress;Oxidative Stress Induction;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Plasma;Population;post stroke;preclinical study;prevent;prophylactic;Proteins;Publications;Publishing;Reactive Oxygen Species;Recovery;Reperfusion Injury;Reporting;Research;response;restoration;Risk;Risk Factors;Signal Pathway;Small Interfering RNA;Smoke;Smoker;Smoking;Stains;stress reduction;Stroke;stroke outcome;stroke risk;stroke therapy;System;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Agents;Thrombomodulin;Time;Tobacco smoke;tobacco smoke exposure;Tobacco smoking behavior;Toxic effect;treatment group;vaper;vaping;vapor;vascular endothelial dysfunction;vascular inflammation;Withdrawal;Woman;Work,Repurposing Metformin to Offset Stroke Risk and Injury in Comorbid Populations of Smokers,117906,DDNS,Drug Discovery for the Nervous System Study Section[DDNS-R],NA,NA,5,371537,196915,568452,NA

These studies will not only establish a much-needed better understanding of the gut reservoir and the mechanisms that facilitate their long-term persistence, but further tests the ability of promising and novel therapeutic approaches to eradicate this important reservoir.",10446692;9286260 (contact);8709368,"ARCHIN, NANCIE MARIE;ROAN, NADIA R (contact);SHEIKH, SHEHZAD Z.","NGUYEN, KHOA DINH DANG",2022-07-15,2027-04-30,Adhesions;Adjuvant;Affect;Animal Model;antagonist;Antibodies;antiretroviral therapy;attenuation;Autologous;Autopsy;Back;Bioinformatics;Biological Markers;biological sex;Biopsy;Blood;Blood specimen;Bromodomains and extra-terminal domain inhibitor;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;Cell Differentiation process;Cells;Chimera organism;chimeric antigen receptor T cells;Chronic;Clinical;Clonal Expansion;Clonality;cohort;Colon;cytokine;cytotoxic;Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes;deep sequencing;design;Development;efficacy evaluation;engineered T cells;Engineering;Environment;ESR1 gene;Estrogens;Female;Frequencies;Gene Expression;Genetic Transcription;Gifts;Growth Factor;gut homeostasis;Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor;HIV;HIV Antigens;HIV Infections;hormone therapy;humanized mouse;ileum;Immune;Immunosuppression;improved;in vivo;Individual;inhibitor;Knowledge;latent HIV reservoir;Maintenance;male;Mediating;men;Metabolism;Methods;Mitogens;Modeling;Molecular;Morphogenesis;multiple omics;Myeloid Cells;next generation;NF-kappa B;nonhuman primate;novel;novel marker;novel therapeutic intervention;Pathway interactions;Patients;peripheral blood;Persons;Phenotype;Play;Postmenopause;Premenopause;Property;Proteins;Proteome;Proviruses;purge;receptor;Recording of previous events;recruit;Resistance;response;Role;sex;Shock;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;single-cell RNA sequencing;Site;SIV;Specimen;Surface;T cell response;T-Lymphocyte;Technology;Testing;Tissues;tool;Transcript;transcriptome;Transforming Growth Factors;treatment response;Viral;Viral Load result;Viral reservoir;Virus Diseases;Woman,"Multiomics characterization, induction, and elimination of the HIV gut reservoir",131526,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-IDIB-J(50)R],NA,NA,3,588660,107067,695727,NA

We propose to use the clinically tested p38 inhibitor, Ralimetinib, to divert the immunosuppressive TME by combining it with CAR T cells, which enhance tumor antigen presentation, provoke type I IFN signatures in TME and hence eliminates resistant tumor cells to prevent the acquired resistance.

Currently, there is only a single mass spectrometer at the University of Rochester (UR) available for proteomic experiments. This instrument is currently being used at full capacity and lacks functional capabilities that are required or advantageous for several ongoing NIH-funded projects being conducted by the user-base of the UR Mass Spectrometry Resource Laboratory (MSRL). The proposed purchase of the timsTOF HT mass spectrometry system will facilitate proteomic experiments at UR by providing researchers a suite of novel tools that take advantage of the Trapped Ion Mobility (TIMS) analyzer and Parallel Accumulation and Serial Fragmentation (PASEF) features of the instrument. Specifically, the rapid sequencing speeds of the instrument will greatly alleviate project backlogs, reduce turnaround times and bring down the per-experiment costs of proteomics projects. These capabilities will enhance the ability of UR researchers to conduct large-scale proteomic experiments that require high proteome coverage and large number of samples and replicates. A number of projects described by the users of this instrument have clinical implications and will be analyzing proteomes within disease models that have direct relevance to the development of therapies that can improve human health.

IPV is produced by inactivating purified virus by prolonged incubations with formalin which reduces the immunogenicity and leads to a relatively high price per dose compared with OPV.  In an SBIR Phase II funded by NIAID, we developed an improved polio vaccine that is safer to the population than OPV and safer and less costly to manufacture than IPV. The vaccine, ultraIPVTM, is killed using a novel UVC-inactivation process that is quick, reproducible, and produces more doses per milligram of virus than formalin inactivation. In this application, we propose to perform key IND-enabling studies to increase the value and attractiveness of the vaccine. Our long-term goals are to obtain IND approval, complete a Phase I clinical trial, and then out-license ultraIPVTM to a manufacturing partner. In this project, we will produce near- GMP vaccine material at a contract lab for safety and immunogenicity testing in GLP animal studies and prepare documents for IND approval to start clinical trials.",1946392 (contact),"TOBIN, GREGORY JOHN (contact)","PARK, EUN-CHUNG",2015-05-15,2025-05-31,Amino Acids;Animal Model;Animals;Attenuated;biosecurity;Body mass index;Cells;Clinical Trials;Consumption;Containment;Contractor;Contracts;cost;Coupled;Data;Development;Dose;Engineering;Ensure;Environment;Epitopes;experience;Formalin;Formulation;Freezing;Funding;Future;Generations;Goals;Human;Human Resources;Immunization;Immunize;immunogenicity;improved;Inactivated Vaccines;Incubated;Injections;interest;irradiation;Licensing;manufacture;manufacturing facility;manufacturing organization;manufacturing process;manufacturing scale-up;meetings;member;method development;Methods;milligram;National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease;novel;novel vaccines;Oral Poliovirus Vaccine;Outcome;Output;pathogen;Pathogenicity;Phase;Phase I Clinical Trials;Phenotype;Poliomyelitis;Poliovirus Vaccines;Population;Price;Process;Production;Rattus;Reaction;Recommendation;recruit;Reporting;Reproducibility;Resistance;Running;Safety;safety assessment;safety study;Series;Serum;Small Business Innovation Research Grant;Talents;Technology;Technology Transfer;Testing;Toxicology;Update;Vaccination;vaccine candidate;Vaccines;Virus;Well in self;Wistar Rats,Nonclinical Development of an Improved Polio Vaccine,120260,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-AIDC-P(11)],NA,NA,6,684443,172578,917012,NA

The first is the potential for illness and injury directly or indirectly related to hazardous material exposure. The second is occupational and environmental health disparities (Strategic Plan Goal 4 for Promoting Translation), particularly as they affect the Hispanic/Latino population of Southeast Michigan. The third problem is the opioid epidemic, an emerging environmental health issue (Strategic Plan Goal 5 for Promoting Translation). We propose to conduct training in health and safety in order to address the potential for illness and injury directly or indirectly related to hazardous material exposure by conducting training in health and safety. We will address occupational and environmental health disparities by continuing and expanding collaborative partnerships with community groups and other NIEHS-WTP grantees for the purpose of delivering health and safety training to underserved populations. The opioid crisis will be addressed by developing and delivering population-specific curricula that address treatment and prevention of opioid addiction, including alternatives for pain management. In addition, we propose to develop, pilot, evaluate and scale a peer recovery support program that will help workers seek services to address opioid addiction. All of the above programs will be evaluated to provide feedback for continual improvement of curricula and delivery methods. This will include monitoring trainee perceptions of quality, appropriateness, and usefulness as well as assessing new curricula and training delivery methods; evaluating the long-term impact of training on worker and organizational outcomes using innovative and conventional quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods. Worker trainers will be involved in evaluations when possible.

Here we develop a novel Raman arthroscopic diagnostic platform to “optically biopsy” cartilage for quantification of biomarkers for determining its composition, structure, and material properties in health and disease. Raman monitoring of cartilage can provide: 1) objective assessments of the efficacy of current and emerging cartilage therapies over the hierarchy of R+D cartilage model systems—ex vivo tissue explants, in vivo animal studies, clinical trials—thus advancing the next generation of PTOA interventions into the clinic, and 2) a safe, effective medical platform for clinical practice, enabling rapid and efficient identification of PTOA cartilage lesions and monitoring of neocartilage regeneration during routine arthroscopy.",11720223 (contact);16110853;1922545,"ALBRO, MICHAEL B (contact);BERGHOLT, MADS SYLVEST;SNYDER, BRIAN D","PINTUCCI, GIUSEPPE",2022-08-02,2027-05-31,"Amides;Animals;Anisotropy;Arthroscopy;articular cartilage;Autopsy;Biochemical;Biochemistry;Biological Markers;Biological Models;Biopsy;Bioreactors;Carboxylic Acids;Cartilage;cartilage degradation;cartilage regeneration;cartilage repair;cartilage transplantation;chondroprotection;Chronic;Clinic;Clinical;clinical diagnostics;clinical practice;Clinical Trials;Coculture Techniques;cohort;Collagen;Computer software;Contusions;cytokine;deep learning;Development;Diagnosis;diagnostic biomarker;diagnostic platform;Disease;Effectiveness;effectiveness evaluation;efficacy evaluation;Engineering;Evaluation;evidence base;experience;Extracellular Matrix;Fingerprint;Functional disorder;GAG Gene;Health;Histopathologic Grade;Human;Hyaline Cartilage;Hydroxyl Radical;Image;image guided;improved;In Vitro;in vivo;in vivo imaging;Individual;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Injury;innovation;instrumentation;Intervention;Investigation;joint function;joint injury;Joints;Lasers;Least-Squares Analysis;lens;Lesion;Light;light scattering;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measurement;Measures;Mechanics;Medical;Methods;model development;Modeling;Molecular;Monitor;Morphology;Natural regeneration;next generation;novel;Operative Surgical Procedures;Optical Biopsy;Optics;Organ Culture Techniques;Outcome;Patients;Performance;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacotherapy;Photons;Physiological;Polymers;pre-clinical;preservation;preventive intervention;Property;Raman Spectrum Analysis;randomized, clinical trials;Reader;Reconstructive Surgical Procedures;Regression Analysis;repaired;Replacement Arthroplasty;Residual state;response;response to injury;Sample Size;Sheep;Site;Specimen;Standardization;Stifle joint;Structure;Sulfate;Surface;Synovial Membrane;System;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Time;tissue culture;Tissue Engineering;tissue regeneration;tissue repair;Tissues;tool;Translations;Trauma;Traumatic Arthropathy;Traumatic injury;treatment research;treatment response;Visualization;Water",Arthroscopic Raman Monitoring of Cartilage Content for PTOA Diagnosis and Chondroregenerative Treatment Response,81393,IGIS,Imaging Guided Interventions and Surgery Study Section[IGIS],NA,NA,3,451102,134193,585295,NA
