Whereas we used to conceive of most microbes as disease-causing enemies, we now understand that microbes are essential for promoting health and might also contribute to ameliorating disease. A growing body of research seeks to uncover how microbes interact with each other in multispecies communities and cohabitate with their multicellular human hosts. If we better understand how microbial communities interact, through modeling these interactions and dissecting the mechanisms at this interface, we will open the door to therapies that prevent or correct microbial community dysfunction to promote health and treat disease. The fourth installment of the Microbiome conference will focus on the latest approaches to study and treat the wide-range of microbial associated diseases, integrating the disciplines of clinical research, microbiology, immunology, ecology, bioinformatics and genomics. The integration of a wide variety of disciplines will promote new interactions seldom achieved at other microbiome meetings.

It is crucial that healthcare providers are aware of and address these disparities when treating vulnerable populations; however, healthcare professionals lack training and awareness regarding opioid harm reduction strategies in these priority populations and may be influenced by stigmatizing attitudes. To address this, the Auburn University Harrison College of Pharmacy (HCOP) Center for Opioid Research, Education, and Outreach (COACH) will host a series of three annual conferences among an interdisciplinary mix of healthcare professionals focused on safe opioid use and harm reduction strategies in vulnerable populations with three objectives: 1) describe current guidelines for safe opioid prescribing and harm reduction strategies; 2) apply safe opioid practices to older adult, racial and ethnic minority, and LGBTQ+ patient cases; and 3) establish a network of interdisciplinary healthcare professionals for future collaborative research, education, and outreach efforts in priority populations.",15034961 (contact),"HOHMANN, LINDSEY  (contact)","KATO, ELISABETH",2024-09-30,2027-09-29,NA,"Auburn University Harrison College of PharmacyCenter for Opioid Research, Education, and Outreach Multi-Year Conference Plan",29600,HEOR,Healthcare Effectiveness and Outcomes Research[HEOR],NA,A1,1,50000,0,50000,NA

Ensysce Biosciences has created two complementary, novel technologies that control the release of known opioids and limit their use to oral administration. The abuse resistant features of Ensysce Biosciences’ TAAP™ and MPAR are built into the chemical modification of each prodrug. Our TAAP (Trypsin Activated Abuse Protection) prodrugs are “activated” by our own body to release clinically effective opioid drugs when swallowed and exposed to a ‘food digesting’ enzyme call trypsin found only in the gastrointestinal track. MPAR (multi-pill abuse resistance) involves regulation of the opioid delivery through the use of an added trypsin inhibitor in combination with the TAAP prodrugs, providing oral overdose protection to our opioid products. We have combined our TAAP oxycodone prodrug, PF614 with the trypsin inhibitor, nafamostat to produce PF614-MPAR. This combination with overdose protection has been evaluated in a two-part Phase 1 study which defined the 25 mg dosage strength combination. PF614-MPAR has shown to have a good safety profile and all the similar features of PF614 alone, with added overdose protection. The objective of this proposal is to advance the clinical development of PF614-MPAR through a multi-ascending dose study to move this highly novel opioid with overdose protection to a NDA and FDA approval as quickly as possible.",9552251 (contact),"KIRKPATRICK, LYNN  (contact)","RAMEY, TANYA S",2024-09-01,2027-05-31,abuse liability;addiction;Address;Anticoagulants;Asian;attenuation;Back;Biological Availability;Biological Sciences;capsule;Cessation of life;Chemicals;Clinical;clinical development;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;commercialization;Consumption;cost;Country;Data;Deglutition;design;Development;dosage;Dose;Drug Kinetics;Ensure;Enzymes;Exposure to;Fasting;Fentanyl;Food;Formulation;Future;Gastrointestinal tract structure;Goals;human study;Ingestion;Intravenous;Japan;Marketing;Modification;Molecular Weight;new technology;novel;novel therapeutics;Opiate Addiction;Opioid;opioid abuse;Opioid Analgesics;opioid overdose;Oral;Oral Administration;Overdose;overdose death;Oxycodone;Pain;pain relief;Patients;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;phase 1 study;Physiological;pill;Plasma;preclinical study;prescription opioid;prescription opioid abuse;prevent;Prodrugs;Publishing;Regulation;Regulatory Pathway;Resistance;Safety;safety assessment;Small Intestines;Societies;synthetic opioid;System;Tablets;Technology;Therapeutic Equivalency;Time;Titrations;Trypsin;Trypsin Inhibitors;United States;Work;Writing,PF614-MPAR: clinical development of opioid with oral overdose protection,59791,NIDA,Medication Development Research Study Section[NIDA-L],NA,A1,1,3810579,762116,4572695,NA
