With current patching treatment, the success rate is about 60-80% with 20-25% recurrence following the treatment, leaving about one third of affected children with amblyopia that persists into adulthood. Visual suppression plays a critical role in developing amblyopia, failure of treatment, and regress following the treatment. This project aims to comprehensively investigate the neural basis of how and where amblyopic suppression occurs in the brain.

COPD profoundly impairs quality of life as it limits ability to work, to maintain physical exertion and to engage in social activities. Hospital-based rehab can decrease the need for inpatient and outpatient medical care and can improve exercise capacity, quality of life and, possibly, decrease mortality. Unfortunately, access to hospital-based VA rehab is insufficient and, over time, the few veterans who attend experience progressive loss of functional gains. We reason that our proposed home-based exercise program augmented by patient-tailored, RAS-enhanced music will overcome the many limitations of hospital-based rehab. Through our innovative program, we expect to enhance the benefits of rehab and better maintain them over time.

Unfortunately, remarkably few studies have evaluated smoking cessation interventions for PLWHA and the available literature indicates that both behavioral and pharmacological smoking cessation interventions yield modest effect sizes and quit rates that are considerably lower than in the general population. A sizable literature, including studies by our research team, indicates that using the nicotine metabolite ratio (which represents the speed at which smokers metabolize nicotine; NMR) to personalize the selection of medications for tobacco use and the MAPS intervention to augment adherence to these medications can optimize treatments for tobacco use among PLWHA. As such, this trial will test these intervention optimization strategies to determine if individually or together these interventions can represent an effective approach to treating tobacco use in this population of smokers. As a major advance for this area of work, we will use rigorous methodology to evaluate these optimization strategies (i.e., a randomized design, biological verification, an ITT approach, and 6-month outcome assessments) and, overall, our approach is consistent with the MOST framework, which has been used to identify intervention components that maximize cessation outcomes. This trial will also assess theoretically derived and empirically based mechanisms through which these optimization strategies affect cessation and explore sub- groups who are more or less responsive to these strategies. In the end, this trial will determine if getting the right medication to the right person and helping to make sure they adequately use the medication optimizes tobacco cessation treatments among PLWHA in order to improve health outcomes for this population.",2131801;6440897 (contact),"GROSS, ROBERT ;SCHNOLL, ROBERT ADAM (contact)","KAUFMAN, ANNETTE R",2019-09-13,2025-08-31,"Address;Adherence;Affect;Aftercare;Age;antiretroviral therapy;Area;Behavior Therapy;Behavioral;Biochemical;Biological;Budgets;Cardiovascular Diseases;CD4 Lymphocyte Count;Characteristics;Clinical Trials;Combined Modality Therapy;Control Groups;Counseling;Data;Dependence;design;Effectiveness;efficacious intervention;Evaluation;Evidence based intervention;Expectancy;follow-up;France;Gender;General Population;genetic variant;Health;Hepatitis C Therapy;HIV;HIV Infections;HIV/AIDS;improved;indexing;Individual;individualized medicine;Intervention;Life;Life Expectancy;Literature;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Mediator;medication compliance;Mental Depression;Metabolism;Methodology;Modeling;modifiable risk;Motivation;multiphase optimization strategy;Nicotine;nicotine patch;nicotine replacement;nicotine use;novel;Outcome;Outcome Assessment;Participant;personalized approach;personalized medicine;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacogenetics;pharmacologic;Pharmacotherapy;placebo controlled trial;Population;Prevalence;Problem Solving;prospective;psychiatric comorbidity;Public Health;Race;Randomized;randomized, clinical trials;Reporting;Research;Risk;Risk Factors;Safety;Self Efficacy;Sex Orientation;side effect;Site;Smoke;Smoker;Smoking;smoking cessation;Smoking Cessation Intervention;Speed;standard care;Subgroup;substance use;systematic review;Testing;therapy adherence;Tobacco;tobacco abstinence;tobacco cessation intervention;Tobacco Dependence;Tobacco smoking behavior;Tobacco use;Tobacco Use Cessation;Toxic effect;Treatment Effectiveness;Treatment Efficacy;treatment optimization;Treatment outcome;treatment research;Underserved Population;varenicline;Variant;Virus;Work",Testing Novel Pharmacogenetic and Adherence Optimization Treatments to Improve the Effectiveness of Smoking Cessation Treatments for Smokers with HIV,243914,ZCA1,ZCA1-RTRB-U(A1),NA,S1,6,88909,55568,144477,NA

The attack is accomplished by “killer CD8” T-cells that enter and destroy the malignant cells. To mount an effective attack, killer T cells need to be present in sufficient quantities and be able to renew themselves, and pathways that prevent their function need to be blocked. Some years ago, we discovered that “TET” proteins modify DNA; more recently, we showed that reducing TET protein function in T cells improves anti-cancer responses. Here we will study mouse and human T cells that infiltrate tumors to investigate how this happens, in a project very relevant to cancer immunotherapy.",1890226 (contact),"RAO, ANJANA  (contact)","ZAMISCH, MONICA",2020-07-01,2025-06-30,Alleles;alpha ketoglutarate;anti-cancer;anti-PD-1;anti-PD-L1;Antibodies;Antigens;Antitumor Response;Biological Process;Blocking Antibodies;cancer cell;cancer immunotherapy;cancer infiltrating T cells;Cancer Patient;cancer therapy;CAR T cell therapy;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;CD8B1 gene;Cell Differentiation process;Cell Lineage;Cell Physiology;Cell Proliferation;Cell Surface Receptors;cell type;Cells;chimeric antigen receptor;chimeric antigen receptor T cells;Chronic;chronic infection;Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia;Clinic;CTLA4 gene;cytokine;Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes;Data;demethylation;Development;Dioxygenases;Disease remission;DNA;Effectiveness;Enzymes;exhaust;exhaustion;Exhibits;Exposure to;FOXP3 gene;Functional disorder;Genetic Transcription;genome-wide;Goals;Hematologic Neoplasms;Human;human model;Immune;immune checkpoint blockade;Immune response;Immune system;Immunosuppression;Impairment;improved;Infiltration;inhibitor;innovation;Iron;Ligands;loss of function;Malignant Neoplasms;Memory;methyl group;Molecular;mouse model;Mus;Mutation;Myeloid Cells;Myeloid-derived suppressor cells;Oxidases;Oxidoreductase;Oxygen;Paper;Pathway interactions;patient subsets;Patients;PD-1/PD-L1;Peptides;Phenotype;Population;prevent;Production;programmed cell death ligand 1;programmed cell death protein 1;Proliferating;protein function;Protein translocation;receptor;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Rejuvenation;response;restraint;Role;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Solid Neoplasm;Specific qualifier value;stem;success;T cell infiltration;T-Lymphocyte;TCF Transcription Factor;Testing;Time;Transplantation;tumor;Tumor Antigens;Tumor Escape;tumor microenvironment;Tumor Promotion;Tumor-associated macrophages;Up-Regulation;Virus Diseases,Exploring the potential of TET inhibition in cancer immunotherapy,247500,TTT,"Transplantation, Tolerance, and Tumor Immunology Study Section[TTT]",NA,S1,5,63733,35619,99352,NA

We developed this process as part of two NIDILRR SBIR projects; one that enables teens with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) to build workplace readiness skills, and one that enables teens with vision impairments (VI) to build skills for the transition to independent adult living. Our Phase I project will answer two Specific Question:  § To what extent do college bound students with ADHD or ASD students find an AIF story  game to be a usable and engaging system to practice College Readiness executive  functioning skills?  § To what extent do non-experts find the Training Guide and Skill Charts useful for helping  college bound students with these disabilities improve these skills? These questions will be answered through four Specific Aims (SA). In SA-1, we define the specifications for the prototype AIF story game. In SA-2, create the prototype AIF story game. In SA- 3, create the Training Guide and Skill Charts. In SA-4, we assess the prototype’s usability and engagement by recruiting CBASD students and their parents to use the AIF story game and then measure the student’s rating of the story’s usability and engagement, and their parents rating of the usefulness of the Training Guide and Skill Charts. Progress: We have had numerous meetings between our development staff and the Expert team (research scientists and teachers) to identify the specific executive functioning skills that will be practiced in the AIF story, and to create the outline of the story and of each chapter in the story. We have not encountered any administrative or technical challenges yet; our primary concern is the commercial challenges that lay ahead. There are many several go-to-market alternatives; we need to determine which is the most appropriate. Team: Luke Voelk, Chief Technical Officer, is a cofounder of our company, and was entrepreneur lead in an NSF iCorp program for our other product, BuddyBooks. Luke will be the iCorp C-level Corporate Officer, as he has a strong background in customer discovery and product development. August Voelk, Product Manager, will be our Technical Lead. August has managed five AIF projects for students with disabilities, including the two mentioned above, from product definition to customer pilots. Our Industry Expert will be Mark Ventre, one of the investors in our company, and the former COO of a Special Education company that was strategically acquired. The three team members have confirmed that they are committed to the time requirements of the program. 2 I-Corps Team and Project Plan (5 pages) 1. I-Corps Team Appropriate Team Members & Appropriate Background Our iCorps Team combines the expertise of one of our three founders (CLO), our company’s product manager (TL), and an industry expert (IE) who has significant experience in bringing technology products to market. Luke Voelk (CLO) is Chief Technical Officer and cofounder of ObjectiveEd. Luke was the Entrepreneurial Lead in an NSF iCorps program for our BuddyBooks product, that uses AI to help students with dyslexia improve their reading skills. He is well-versed in use of a Business Model Canvas and has decision-making authority within the company to implement changes in direction regarding the overall commercialization strategy for the project. He implemented a pivot in the NSF project. At ObjectiveEd, Luke architected and created the technology infrastructure for the NSF-SBIR funded project, BuddyBooks. Prior to BuddyBooks at ObjectiveEd, he led the development team to bring to market over 20 skill-building apps for students with vision impairments (VI). The development staff, and the Product Manager, report to Luke. Prior to eSped, Luke was Director of Engineering at eSped, an EdTech company in the Special Ed market. Luke has a B.S. in Computer Science and Physics from Wesleyan University. August Voelk (TL) is the Product Manager for the AIF projects and has been with ObjectiveEd for 3 years. August was the Technical Lead for the NIDILRR IMPACT Program, a mini-bootcamp that helped our company understand the pain points and stakeholders AIF stories created for students with vision impairments. August coordinates the development and support teams to ensure the delivery of valuable and innovative new products, trains teachers and specialists in the use of our products, conduct seminars at key conferences and conducts in depth market research to develop new product opportunities. He graduated Franklin and Marshall College with a BA in Business and Economics. Luke and August have worked together at ObjectiveEd for 3 years. In addition to bringing the 20 skill- building VI games to market, they launched the two NIDILRR AIF story games to Special Ed departments in public schools. They launched BuddyBooks into both the public-school Special Ed market and the homeschool market (as a consumer product). While Luke (CLO) and August (TL) are both visionaries on product direction, Luke’s strengths include knowing how to translate customer dreams into deliverable products. August’s strengths are ensuring the products achieve the specific requirements and delight the customer. One example of a conflict between Luke and August is our product launch into the homeschool market for BuddyBooks. Luke’s analysis from NSF iCorps process led us to the homeschool market, while August perceived it as too distracting from the public-school market. Instead of Luke simply forcing the company to pursue the homeschool market, he presented the business case and convinced the other two founders, the board, and the other programmers that this was the proper path. Mark Ventre will be our team’s Industry Expert. Mark was the Chief Operating Officer for eSped, a company that provided compliance tracking and state/federal reporting for Special Education Departments. eSped provided services to over 1,000 school districts and managed reporting for 500,000 3 students and was the largest vendor in several states. eSped was strategically acquired by Frontline Education in 2016. Mark managed the company growth from startup to acquisition. Mark participated in the seed funding round for ObjectiveEd. Mark has reviewed the iCorps documents in the FOA and has availability consistent with the program timeframe. Deep commitment to the time-intensive requirements All team members are aware of 25 hours/week time commitment, and as a company, we are aware of the impact of the time commitment from our experience with NSF iCorps and NIDILRR bootcamp. In the two prior courses (NSF, NIDILRR), our understanding of the market evolved from the beginning of the course to its completion. We realized how we missed identifying all stakeholders, which exposed additional distribution channels, partnerships and revenue opportunities. We discovered the importance of certain factors – like acquiring proof of efficacy from the Dept. of Education, that opened additional grant funding for school districts to purchase our product. We were slightly skeptical of the business model canvas, when we started the NSF iCorp; we felt our prior Special Ed market experience was sufficient. We became advocates for this approach after seeing how effective it was for our company. We know the iCorps process will result in a deeper understanding of our market, which is needed for a successful Phase II proposal, and of course, a viable business. We are confident that if the Business Model Canvas identifies that we need to pivot, we’ll pivot. This administrative supplement will allow us to do sufficient customer investigation so that our research and development efforts are focused where the need is greatest. That ensures more college-bound students will be helped, and the company will achieve profitability sooner. During the NSF iCorps process for BuddyBooks, we acquired far more than the 100 required customer interactions. Not only did we have many Zoom conversations in the first week, but over the next two months, we attended 4 conferences and conventions to talk, face-to-face, to dozens of different types of stakeholders (competitors, parents, students, conference organizers, distribution partners, book publishers, teachers, tutors, principals, etc.). We understand the value of in-person customer discovery. 2. Potential Commercial Impact Market Opportunity College is one of life’s most important gateways to independence, success, and economic security, and college-bound students with ASD or ADHD are matriculating to college in record numbers. Despite being intellectually capable, many of these students do not make it to graduation. Only 44% of college students receive their degree – significantly less than the 60% graduation rate for all disability groups and the 67% rate for the general population. However, research consistently shows that these students need better transition planning throughout high school and continued accommodations in college, as they need to master self-regulation and executive function skills. Traditionally, counselors or teachers provide these skills. However, almost half of the public vocational rehabilitation agencies do not have sufficient staff to serve all clients properly. In some regions of the nation, there are no counselors and most Special Ed teachers are not trained to provide these skills. It is left to the parents, or other non-experts, who may not have the expertise, to prepare their student for college. Hence, there are two major problems that these college-bound students with ASD or ADHD face: § They need to master executive function skills. 4 § There are insufficient qualified counselors to provide this needed training. The Solution: College Readiness Stories (CRS) CRS is a transformative computer-mediated learning system for these students to independently improve college readiness skills. Research Scientists who study college readiness, and practicing transition counselors who provide college readiness training, have decades of experience in helping students build these skills. We capture their decades of experience and transform it into a virtual adventure story and a guide for non-experts, such as parents or Special Ed teachers. Instead of the student encountering difficult situations once they begin college, where multiple wrong decisions could result in the student getting bad grades, or dropping out of college, the student will encounter similar situations first in a safe, non-judgmental virtual story. Their “poor” decisions will result in bad outcomes, so the student can learn from their mistakes. Students will use the system independently, and won’t be as dependent on finding the excellent, but rare, counselor that will guide their transition. The system will include a Training Guide to empower the non-expert, such as a Special Ed teacher or parent, to assist the student and explain how the student can better manage difficult situations. CRS is implemented as an Accessible Interactive Fiction story game. We created our first two AIF stories as NIDILRR SBIR Phase I projects, where we realized how impactful this concept is. From testing with two different student populations, vision impairment and autism spectrum disorder, we found students enjoy learning using AIF stories, and teachers found significantly more student engagement. Market Size Based on 15% of college students having ADHD or ASD, with about 5 million students starting college each year, there are approximately 750,000 potential users (high school or starting college) who can benefit from a solution. Our conversations with these potential buyers indicate a $75 price per student per year is acceptable, yielding a total addressable market of $56 million per year. The Users The primary users for the system are the college-bound students and the non-experts who provide help to them. The Customers & Value Proposition The benefit of CRS is that more students will build executive functioning skills than the current methods (due to the counselor shortage) and that will result in more students graduating college. The customers that will benefit from this value proposition are:  § Special Ed departments, that want students to enroll in college and achieve their goal of graduating  from college. CRS will give students the confidence that they will succeed in college.  § Universities and colleges that provide accommodations and support services to ADHD and ASD  students. If students were well-prepared, through AIF stories, for the college workload, there would  be fewer students dropping out or failing out. Colleges suffer financially when students leave  without graduating.  § Community colleges that offer students 2-year degrees, as a stepping-stone to a university B.A. or  B.S. They want to prepare their students properly. Their reputation is based on the percentage of  students graduating.  § Parents who want their children to obtain a college education. 5 § College bound students, with plans to use their degree to improve their life, and not let their ASD or  ADHD limit their opportunities. § Vocational Rehab agencies, who help transition-age students (16-21 years old) prepare for post-  high school life. They are evaluated by their funders for the number of “successful” clients. § Department of Education agencies in each of the 50 states, whose mission is to improve education  outcomes for both secondary and post-secondary students. Competition In most cases, executive functioning and time/task management is not emphasized in high school for students and is not addressed as part of a Special Ed curriculum. Some colleges offer freshman orientation classes where executive function skills are discusses, and some colleges offer personalized counseling assistance as part of their accommodations for students with special needs. These services provide brochures and videos to emphasize the importance of these skills and may include role-playing. CRS’s competitive advantage is that students will experience situations in a virtual adventure, so they learn from their mistakes. We intend to conduct efficacy studies that should show an improvement in executive functioning skills, such as the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) test. As a company, our key differentiators are (1) we are already a trusted supplier of digital curriculum for students with a range of disabilities to the Special Ed department of school districts, and (2) we have expertise in converting peer-reviewed research findings into educational products for students. We use these research findings to build software, often scaffolding on state-of- the-art (SOTA) commercially available technology as part of the solution, which reduces the time and the costs to get a product to market. Management Team Our company has been selling digital curriculum for students with disabilities to community agencies and school districts since 2021, and we have over 150 customers, including 4 of the largest 10 school districts including the Los Angeles USD. Our company has won numerous awards for EdTech innovation, such as the 2022 Global EdTechX Startup Winner, and the EdTech 2023 Breakthrough Award. Our management team has a combined 50 years of experience in the Special Education technology market. Intellectual Property Our company protects its Intellectual Property using two strategies and will use them with this CRS. Patent-based: We have filed for several provisional patents for our innovations, and will do the same for CRS. Trade-secrets: While the OED user interfaces and functionality could be duplicated in areas that are not copyright and patent protected, there are significant trade secrets that we vigorously protect. We have accumulated significant “know-how” during research and development of our AIF products – not just how to do things, but what not to do and what does not work optimally. For example, not all students in rural and low-income communities have access to the Internet at home. We’ve built technology to accommodate for this limitation. Partnerships & Collaborations We are partners with some of the largest research centers and advocacy groups for ASD (such as the National Autism Center/May Institute), the National Disability Institute and will do the same for ADHD. We collaborate with the Council for Exceptional Children, and many state-level agencies for Special Ed Directors, such as the Texas Council of Administrators of Special Education. We have developed relationships with several state-based vocational rehabilitation agencies for services for people with 6 disabilities, such as the Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission and the Michigan Dept of Blind Services (who is helping to connect us with the Michigan Rehabilitation Services agency). Fundraising potential Our company has raised about $1.8M seed capital through angel investors, who are familiar with the prior successes of the founding management team. We will investigate a Series A after the CRS product has completed Phase II and we want to scale marketing and sales efforts. We do not foresee additional capital requirements until then; revenue from existing products sold to school districts is sufficient to maintain company viability. 3. Project Plan Our SBIR Phase 1 project will create one AIF story for a college-bound student to demonstrate feasibility and usability. We expect the story to be ready in the February timeframe and to begin testing it as a pilot study in March/April. The Principal Investigator (PI) will perform the following assessments after the student has used the AIF story: Tool Who? Description TOOL1 PI to student Survey for students to rate items that focus on their motivation to use the AIF story, its ease of use and accessibility, and if they would recommend it to others, what they liked and didn’t like. SUS1 PI to student The System Usability Scale, where the student rates the usability of the AIF story. TOOL2 PI to parent Survey for parents to identify the usefulness of the Training Guide, suggest improvements, and if they would recommend the use of the AIF story to other parents of college-bound students. SUS2 PI to parent SUS where the parent rates the usability of the Training Guide. In Phase II, we will create at least 8 multi-chapter stories that a student would use over one to two semesters, to build and practice skills. Project/Performance Site Once these stories are complete, we will test it with sufficient students (350) to obtain Dept of Education’s What Works Clearinghouse Tier 1 proof-of-efficacy. We will conduct this with several school districts and agencies who are already customers of our other products for students with disabilities, such as Pittsburgh Public Schools.

A key early step in the progression to metastatic disease is an increase in cell state plasticity that allows some cancer cells to adapt to new environments and take on new migratory and invasive capabilities. This flexibility involves changes in non-permanent, but relatively stable chemical modifications to the DNA packaging material and a loss of control over which genes are expressed and by how much.

The proposed study will uncover the molecular basis for specific race-related differences in PCa immunobiology, which could provide key insights into immune determinants contributing to PCa mortality disparities.

We propose a mechano-genetics process in which genetic changes are caused by tissue stiffness including compression in mitosis, and to test our hypothesis and clarify aspects of mechanism, we will develop and apply a novel approach with gene editing that allows us to see genetic changes in real-time, in single cells under physical duress.",1923930 (contact),"DISCHER, DENNIS E.

Studies proposed here will uncover novel mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of gut barrier dysfunction in elderly patients and will also establish a fundamental basis for developing new effective therapeutics to improve gut barrier integrity by targeting intestinal epithelial mitochondria via circHIPK3 and HuR.",14269371 (contact),"XIAO, LAN  (contact)","FLORES, ROBERTO L",2024-09-01,2029-08-31,Affect;Age;age related;aged;Aging;aging population;Area;Bacteria;Biogenesis;Cell Line;circular RNA;Clinical Research;comorbidity;Complex;Data;driving force;effective therapy;Elderly;Endotoxins;Enhancers;Environment;Epithelial Cells;epithelial repair;Epithelium;Event;Exhibits;Exons;Functional disorder;gain of function;gastrointestinal epithelium;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Goals;healthy aging;Homeostasis;Host Defense;Human;human old age (65+);HuR protein;immunosenescence;Impairment;improved;in vivo;Infection;infection risk;Injury;intestinal barrier;intestinal epithelium;Intestines;Knockout Mice;Knowledge;Leaky Gut;Link;Literature;loss of function;Mammalian Cell;Messenger RNA;MicroRNAs;Mitochondria;mitochondrial metabolism;mouse model;mRNA Precursor;mRNA Stability;mRNA Translation;Mucous Membrane;Mus;Natural regeneration;novel;novel therapeutics;old mice;older patient;Operative Surgical Procedures;Organ;Organoids;overexpression;Paneth Cells;Pathogenesis;Pathologic;Pathology;Patients;Play;Populations at Risk;Porifera;Post-Transcriptional Regulation;post-trauma;posttranscriptional;preservation;prevent;Process;Regulation;response;Risk;Risk Factors;RNA;RNA-Binding Proteins;Role;Sepsis;Site;Small intestine mucous membrane;Stress;Stroke;Surface;systemic inflammatory response;Testing;therapeutically effective;Tissues;Trans-Activators;Transcript;Transcription Process;Transgenic Organisms;Translations;Trauma;Untranslated RNA;wound,Roles of circHIPK3 and HuR in aging gut barrier function,84613,DHMI,"Digestive System Host Defense, Microbial Interactions and Immune and Inflammatory Disease Study Section[DHMI]",NA,A1,1,358985,199237,558222,NA

Lifelong insulin therapy is required, although patients remain at risk for both chronic diabetic complications and potentially fatal hypoglycemia. Prior to clinical onset of T1D there is an asymptomatic phase of many years during which β-cell mass and function progressively declines but glucose homeostasis remains normal. This ‘pre-symptomatic’ phase presents a window for therapeutic intervention. Indeed, immune therapies under investigation have shown some success in blunting β-cell decline, with antiCD3 recently receiving FDA approval. However, there are limited means for detecting and tracking the development of insulitis in this ‘pre-symptomatic’ T1D window to guide therapeutic interventions. Further, there is a complete lack of means to track the response to preventative treatment, prior to T1D onset. Clinical imaging modalities have been investigated to detect signatures of insulitis and β-cell decline but have either shown limited success in human subjects or are not practical for widescale deployment. Ultrasound imaging presents many advantages for clinical deployment, including widespread availability and absence of ionizing radiation. Gas-filled microbubble (MB) contrast agents are clinically approved, and are used in detection, therapy and monitoring of a wide range of diseases. We previously used contrast-enhanced ultrasound to detect signatures of insulitis in pre-clinical models based on factors such as altered pancreas perfusion or microvascular leakiness that occur during T1D. While these studies provide support for using contrast-enhanced ultrasound to guide and track therapeutic interventions in ‘pre-symptomatic’ T1D, there exists high potential for further advancements. A key limitation of pancreas imaging in T1D is that islets of Langerhans represent only a few % of the pancreas volume, diluting any disease signature by background signal and reducing sensitivity. Thus, high-resolution approaches are needed to view the specific disease signatures in T1D. Ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) is an emerging super-resolution microvascular imaging technique that provides microvessel-level spatial resolution noninvasively in vivo, thus potentially enabling the resolution of specific T1D disease associated changes in the pancreas. Our overall goal is to apply ULM and signal processing in combination with novel ultrasound contrast agents to detect disease signatures associated with T1D, to provide image-based guidance and tracking of therapeutic interventions. We will conduct 3 specific aims:  Aim 1: Ultrasound localization microscopy of vascular impairments in the pancreas. The pancreas microvasculature and blood flow change during T1D progression. We will perform ULM with size isolated MBs (SIMBs; 1, 3 & 5 µm diameter), where SIMBs are highly echogenic and will optimize ULM efficiency. ULM will be used to noninvasively map the pancreas microvasculature and flow dynamics to identify vascular impairments associated with insulitis in T1D progression, using murine models. These measurements will be compared with histological analysis of islet microvasculature and insulitis. Aim 2: Mapping the distribution of nanodrop accumulation and microvascular leakiness across the pancreas. Increased microvascular permeability occurs in the pancreas upon chronic inflammation during T1D. Nanodrops (NDs) accumulate within the islet microenvironment during T1D and provide contrast following acoustic vaporization. We will synthesize long-circulating ‘size-isolated’ NDs (SINDs; 0.2, 0.6 & 1.0 µm diameter), that vaporize at clinical MI (<0.7) and provide improved stability. We will characterize the biodistribution of these SINDs and their specificity to accumulate within the infiltrated islet microenvironment, using both ultrasound contrast imaging with histological analysis, in murine models of T1D. We will also assess conditions where ND vaporization minimizes transient or permanent impact on the islet microenvironment.  Aim 3: Apply molecularly targeted microbubbles and nanodrops to the inflamed and infiltrated islet microenvironment. We will target best performing, optimal sized SIMBs to endothelial cell surface markers of inflammation by incorporating peptide ligands against P-, E- and L-selectin. We will use a buried-ligand surface architecture, where the ligand is protected from complement activation by a PEG overbrush, but which can bind its target marker upon application of ultrasound radiation force. Additionally, we will develop an individual bubble tracking approach to determine binding strength of adherent MBs. We will characterize the sensitivity and specificity of target binding in vitro, and perform similar measurements in vivo in models of T1D.  Impact: Assessing inflammation and immune infiltration in the islet microenvironment using contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging represents a fundamentally new paradigm for diagnosing and tracking T1D progression during the pre-symptomatic phase of disease. The development and application of size isolated microbubbles, nanodrop agents and functionalized microbubbles, and use of super-resolution ULM techniques, represents further innovations which will have broader impact. Therefore, outcomes of this project will aid in diagnosing both the pace of T1D progression and the efficacy of any preventative treatment prior to clinical onset. There also exists viable routes to the clinic for both the contrast agents and ULM techniques for early disease monitoring.",9757676 (contact);10535979;14111043,"BENNINGER, RICHARD KP (contact);BORDEN, MARK ANDREW;SONG, PENGFEI","ARREAZA-RUBIN, GUILLERMO",2024-06-01,2028-05-31,Acoustics;Architecture;Beta Cell;Binding;Biodistribution;Blood flow;blood glucose regulation;Blood Vessels;Cell surface;Chronic;Clinic;Clinical;clinical imaging;Complement Activation;Complications of Diabetes Mellitus;contrast enhanced;contrast imaging;Contrast Media;Detection;Development;Diagnosis;Diameter;Disease;Drops;Endothelial Cells;Functional Imaging;Gases;Goals;Histologic;human subject;Hypoglycemia;Image;imaging modality;Imaging Techniques;immune cell infiltrate;Immunotherapy;Impairment;improved;In Vitro;in vivo;in vivo Model;Individual;Infiltration;Inflammation;inflammatory marker;innovation;Insulin;insulin dependent diabetes mellitus onset;Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;insulitis;Investigation;Ionizing radiation;islet;Islets of Langerhans;L-Selectin;Ligands;Maps;Measurement;meter;Microbubbles;Microscopy;Microvascular Permeability;Molecular Target;Monitor;mouse model;nano;novel;Outcome;Pancreas;pancreas imaging;Patients;Peptides;Perfusion;Phase;Pre-Clinical Model;Preventive treatment;public health relevance;Radiation;Recommendation;Resolution;response;Risk;Route;Sensitivity and Specificity;signal processing;Signal Transduction;Specificity;structural imaging;success;Surface;Techniques;Text;Therapeutic Intervention;ultra high resolution;Ultrasonography;ultrasound;vaporization,Developing ultrasound contrast agents and signal processing for structural and functional imaging in type 1 diabetes,140904,IPCA,Imaging Probes and Contrast Agents Study Section[IPCA],NA,NA,1,547800,110493,658293,NA

Project Narrative Copper, because of its function as a redox cofactor and its prevalence in enzymes that catalyze reactions with oxygen (O2) or oxygenated substrates, is an essential micronutrient for most aerobic organisms, and hence for human health. Organisms sense nutritional Cu deficiency and respond by turning on a suite of genes, which in Chlamydomonas is dependent on a transcription factor, CRR1, to facilitate copper economy and copper- dependent metabolism. CRR1 is degraded and economy measures are turned off in copper-replete cells. In this project, the investigators will dissect the signaling pathway that responds to copper supply, leading potentially to the discovery of a copper sensor and a mechanistic understanding of the connection between copper-deficiency and hypoxia.",1863252 (contact),"MERCHANT, SABEEHA  (contact)","MASKERI, BAISHALI",1989-06-01,2028-06-30,26S proteasome;Aerobic;Affinity;Algae;Animals;Binding;Bioenergetics;Biology;Cells;Chemistry;Chlamydomonas;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Co-Immunoprecipitations;cofactor;Complex;Copper;Cullin Proteins;cytochrome c oxidase;Cytochromes c6;Data;Development;Enabling Factors;Enzymes;Eukaryota;F-Box Proteins;Family;Feedback;gain of function;Genes;genetic analysis;Genetic Screening;Half-Life;Health;heme a;heme biosynthesis;Hemeproteins;Homeostasis;Human;hypocupremia;Hypoxia;Immunofluorescence Immunologic;Immunoprecipitation;in vitro testing;Individual;Iron;knowledge base;Life;Location;Maintenance;Malnutrition;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Measures;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolism;Micronutrients;model organism;Modeling;Modification;Monitor;multicatalytic endopeptidase complex;mutant;Mutation;Mutation Analysis;Nutrient;nutrition;Nutritional;operation;Organism;oxidation;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxygen;Pathway interactions;Photosynthesis;Physiological;Planets;Plants;Plastocyanin;Post-Transcriptional Regulation;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Prevalence;Property;Proteins;Proteomics;Reaction;Regulation;Regulon;Reporter;Research Personnel;Respiration;response;Response Elements;sensor;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Site;Site-Directed Mutagenesis;Solubility;Supplementation;Testing;Thylakoid Membranes;tool;transcription factor;Transcriptional Activation;Trees;ubiquitin-protein ligase;uptake;Work;Zinc deficiency,Nutritional Cu Signaling and Homeostasis,42143,MSFA,Macromolecular Structure and Function A Study Section[MSFA],NA,A1,29,295828,165237,461065,NA

Project Narrative Injury to transplanted organs around the time of the surgical transplant procedure increases the risk that the recipient's immune system will attempt to reject the graft and this increases the rate at which grafts fail over many years. We hypothesize that if we treat the graft before transplantation surgery with drugs delivered directly to the lining of the graft blood vessels—particularly drugs that reduce specific changes induced by injury that increase the host immune response—we can break the link between early injury and rejection/graft loss. Specifically, we propose to do this by means of nanoparticle drug carriers that have been modified to bind to the cells that line the blood vessels and are introduced while a human kidney or heart (experimentally using organs declined for transplantation) is attached to a pump that circulates washed red blood cells, a therapy already being tested in clinical transplantation, and load these nanoparticles to deliver forms of RNA therapeutics that temporarily or permanently reduce the level of certain injury-induced proteins that have been shown to boost immune responses.",1930382 (contact);6214835,"POBER, JORDAN S (contact);SALTZMAN, W.

The most common CFTR mutation, F508del, results in a channel that fails to correctly fold/traffic. FDA- approved compounds that improve the folding/trafficking of misfolded CFTR have been identified as part of a highly effective modulator therapy (HEMT) - referred to as correctors. These correctors are highly efficacious in improving lung function. Unfortunately, adverse events (AE) have been reported in a subset of CF patients taking these correctors, including headache, hypertension and mental health issues. We demonstrate CFTR correctors inhibit small (KCa2.x) and intermediate (KCa3.1) conductance, Ca2+-activated K+ channels (KCa) while also potentiating the large (BKCa; KCa1.1) conductance KCa. Our studies will define the mechanisms by which CFTR correctors modulate KCa channel function and how this affects ion transport across human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEs), vascular reactivity and neuronal action potential firing. As this HEMT represents the standard of care for CF patients it is critical to understand the mechanisms underlying the AE reported, both in the short- term, so they may be mitigated, and in the long-term such that next-generation HEMT may be developed – improving the lives of CF patients.",1935058 (contact),"DEVOR, DANIEL C (contact)","LACHOWICZ-SCROGGINS, MARRAH ELIZABETH",2024-08-01,2028-04-30,absorption;Action Potentials;Acute;Adverse event;Affect;Affinity;airway surface liquid;Anxiety;Aorta;Arteries;Biochemical;Blood Vessels;brain fog;bronchial epithelium;Calcium-Activated Potassium Channel;Cell Physiology;Cells;Chemosensitization;Cyclic AMP;Cystic Fibrosis;cystic fibrosis patients;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator;Delta F508 mutation;Dependence;design;disease-causing mutation;drug action;Electrophysiology (science);Epithelial Cells;FDA approved;fluorescence imaging;Forskolin;Frequencies;Headache;Hippocampus;Human;Hypertension;Impairment;improved;In Vitro;Ion Transport;Light;Mediating;Mental Health;Mesenteric Arteries;Molecular;Moods;Mus;Mutation;Myography;neuronal excitability;Neurons;next generation;patch clamp;Patch-Clamp Techniques;patient subsets;Pharmacologic Substance;Physiology;Potassium Channel;pressure;Proteins;pulmonary function;Quality of life;Reporting;response;Role;Series;Sleeplessness;standard of care;Techniques;Therapeutic;Time;trafficking;Treatment Efficacy;Vascular Smooth Muscle;Vasodilation;VX-770,Modulation of Ca2+ -activated K+ channels by CFTR Correctors,171413,LCMI,"Lung Cellular, Molecular, and Immunobiology Study Section[LCMI]",NA,A1,1,385348,227355,612703,NA

Adoptive immunotherapies are currently hampered by the absence of specific targets, most of which are often shared with healthy tissues and thus lead to immunosuppression/toxicity. Here, we will develop new gene editing strategies to generate a “stealth” hematopoiesis that is resistant to immunoglobulin-based drugs/CAR-T cells. Our strategy allows targeting multiple genes essential to leukemia survival, thus poorly amenable to escape mechanisms. It could be rapidly implemented in allogeneic-HSCT protocols currently used as standard treatment for high-risk subtypes of AML, like those with FLT3 mutation/ITD. Moreover, since our selected targets (FLT3, KIT and CD123) are expressed at high levels in a spectrum of several hematologic malignancies, our strategy could provide more efficacious yet less toxic therapeutic options for several blood cancers.",16109696 (contact),"GENOVESE, PIETRO  (contact)","CARDONE, MARCO",2024-07-03,2029-06-30,Achievement;Acute leukemia;Acute Myelocytic Leukemia;Address;Adenine;Adoptive Immunotherapy;Affect;Allogenic;Amino Acid Substitution;Amino Acids;Antibodies;Antigens;base editing;base editor;bi-specific T cell engager;Binding;Biological Assay;Blood;Bone Marrow Transplantation;CD34 gene;Cells;chimeric antigen receptor T cells;Clinic;Clinical;Cytokine Receptors;Data;Diffuse;disabled;Disease;Down-Regulation;Electroporation;Endowment;Engineering;Engraftment;Enzymes;Epitopes;Essential Genes;Extracellular Domain;FLT3 gene;gene-editing approach;Genes;Genetic Engineering;Genetic Transcription;genome-wide;Goals;Guide RNA;Hematologic Neoplasms;Hematopoiesis;Hematopoietic;Hematopoietic Neoplasms;Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation;Hematopoietic stem cells;High Pressure Liquid Chromatography;high risk;IL3RA gene;immunogenicity;Immunoglobulins;Immunosuppression;Immunotherapy;Impairment;In Vitro;in vivo;in vivo Model;Interferons;KIT gene;Lead;Lentivirus Vector;leukemia;Libraries;Ligands;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;manufacturing process;Medical;Messenger RNA;metabolic fitness;Modeling;Monoclonal Antibodies;Mutate;Mutation;Myelogenous;Myeloid Cells;Nature;Neoplasms;novel;novel strategies;nucleotide analog;Outcome;Parameter Estimation;patient derived xenograft model;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physiological;Population;preservation;Procedures;Prognosis;protein expression;protein function;Protocols documentation;receptor;reconstitution;Regulation;Relapse;research clinical testing;Residual Neoplasm;Resistance;response;risk minimization;Risk Reduction;Sampling;scale up;screening;Specificity;standard care;Standardization;Survival Rate;System;Target Populations;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic antibodies;Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies;Time;Tissues;tool;Toxic effect;Transplantation;tumor;Tumor Escape;Validation;Variant;Work;Xenograft procedure,Multiplex Epitope Editing to Enable Novel Immunotherapies for Acute Myeloid Leukemia,286036,CIC,Cellular Immunotherapy of Cancer Study Section[CIC],NA,A1,1,499183,281206,780389,NA

Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) is a key stimulator and intraocular injections of VEGFA antagonists provides great benefits. However, outcomes are suboptimal because other vasoactive factors contribute in some patients and because patients and physicians have difficulty maintaining the frequency of injections needed to control neovascularization (NV) and exudation. While Faricimab, which targets both VEGF-A and angiopoietin 2, may have slightly greater durability than specific VEGF-A antagonists, it does not provide better efficacy and there are many patients treated with Faricimab who have suboptimal outcomes. Treatments that target other contributing factors in addition to VEGFA and provide sustained release to reduce treatment burden are needed and this proposal addresses both of those needs. In the previous grant period, we demonstrated that AXT107, a collagen IV-derived 20-mer peptide mimetic, strongly suppresses NV and vascular leakage in models relevant to nAMD, DME, and PDR and elucidated part of its mechanism of action; it binds integrins αvβ3 and α5β1 and blocks their co-receptor functions resulting in suppression of VEGF and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signaling and conversion of angiopoietin 2 (Ang2) from a Tie2 antagonist to a Tie2 agonist. When injected into the vitreous of rabbits, AXT107 self-aggregated into a gel that slowly eroded providing sustained release and prolonged suppression of NV and vascular leakage. This led to clinical trials in nAMD and DME which demonstrated sustained suppression of exudation in many patients, but in some patients the gels were not compact and fragmented, resulting in dispersion of particles into the anterior chamber, occluding trabecular meshwork and increasing intraocular pressure. These studies have helped to validate αvβ3 and α5β1 as important therapeutic targets, but also demonstrated that more knowledge is needed to better understand exactly how they interact with RTKs, which interactions are important, and rationally design an antagonist that can be provided by sustained delivery. AXT107 is still a clinical candidate if a new sustained delivery approach can be developed, but in addition, it provides a tool along with newly developed analogs to further explore the mechanism by which antagonism of αvβ3 and α5β1 suppresses NV and exudation providing new knowledge that can guide development of improved next generation antagonists of αvβ3 and α5β1. Thus, this proposal will explore detailed mechanisms by which signaling through αvβ3 and α5β1 promote retinal/choroidal NV and exudation and how best to utilize that knowledge for design of therapeutic peptides, while at the same time solving issues related to delivery of AXT107 to allow additional clinical testing.",1872342 (contact),"CAMPOCHIARO, PETER A (contact)","GORDIYENKO, NATALIYA",2019-03-01,2028-06-30,Address;Agonist;analog;Angiopoietin-2;Animal Model;antagonist;anterior chamber;Antibodies;bevacizumab;Binding;Binding Sites;Blindness;Blood Vessels;Choroidal Neovascularization;clinical candidate;Clinical Trials;Collagen;Collagen Type IV;design;Development;diabetic;Diabetic Retinopathy;EGF gene;EGF-Like Domain;Endothelial Cells;Extravasation;Exudate;Exudative age-related macular degeneration;Flow Cytometry;Formulation;Frequencies;Gel;Grant;HGF gene;Immunofluorescence Immunologic;improved;In Vitro;in vivo;Injections;Integrin alpha5beta1;Integrin alphaVbeta3;Integrin Binding;Integrins;KDR gene;Knowledge;Label;Ligands;macular edema;Medical;MET gene;Modeling;Molecular Conformation;Molecular Mechanisms of Action;mouse model;neovascularization;next generation;ocular neovascularization;Oryctolagus cuniculus;Outcome;particle;Particulate;Pathway interactions;Patients;peptide drug;Peptides;peptidomimetics;Phosphorylation;Physicians;Physiologic Intraocular Pressure;Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor;Play;proliferative diabetic retinopathy;ranibizumab;rational design;receptor function;Recurrence;research clinical testing;Retina;Role;Signal Transduction;targeted treatment;Therapeutic;therapeutic target;therapy development;Time;TNFSF15 gene;tool;Trabecular meshwork structure;Vascular Diseases;Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors;vasoactive agent;VEGFA gene;Vision,Integrin-binding Peptide for Ocular Neovascularization and Macular Edema: Molecular Mechanism of Action,28996,PED1,Pathophysiology of Eye Disease - 1 Study Section[PED1],NA,A1,5,250000,137500,387500,NA

Over the last decade the importance of the spleen has been highlighted as a reservoir for the majority of monocytes trafficking to the heart in response to ischemic damage. In this proposal, we will utilize advanced nanomaterials as tools to localize inhibitors to the spleen to dissect the mechanisms by which HDACs modulate the cardiac inflammatory affect after MI.",7812979;2452632 (contact),"MCCARTHY, JASON R.;MENICK, DONALD R.
