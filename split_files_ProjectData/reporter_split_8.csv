Infection with T. gondii can cause severe and potentially fatal brain and eye disease, especially in immunocompromised individuals. Worldwide, T. gondii is also a leading infectious cause of blindness in otherwise healthy individuals. The current ﬁrst-line therapy for T. gondii is a combination of the drugs pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, but this regimen suffers from a number of shortcomings. These drugs must be taken for weeks to months, frequently cause toxic side effects, and are incapable of eradicating chronic infection. We need new medicines for T. gondii that are safer, better tolerated, more effective, and can be given for shorter durations.  To this end, Dr. Alday and his colleagues have screened the 68,689 compounds in the Global Health Chemical Diversity Library (GHCDL) to ﬁnd those that inhibit the growth of T. gondii. In doing so, 359 hit compounds were found that strongly inhibit the growth of this parasite. The potency of each of these has been measured and a subset of 73 highly potent and selective compounds selected for further study. All compounds in the GHCDL were chosen for their drug-like physicochemical properties that predict good absorption and distribution when taken orally. Therefore it seems reasonable to hypothesize that within the 359 compounds that strongly inhibit T. gondii growth are those that will be effective against toxoplasmosis when given orally and thus excellent starting points from which to develop new drugs. Dr. Alday's research will systematically evaluate this hypothesis in three parts. First, the potency of all 73 compounds will be veriﬁed. An initial study of the structure-activity relationships of the three most promising will be done. Secondly, Dr. Alday will determine the mechanism of action for the top 10 most promising compounds by creating resistant mutants and identifying relevant mutations using whole-genome sequencing. Finally, the effectiveness of the top 10 compounds will be tested in mouse models of infection.  Dr. Alday is a physician-scientist at Oregon Health & Science University and the Portland VA Medical Center. Clinically, he is trained in internal medicine and infectious disease (ID), rotates on the inpatient ID consult service, and has an outpatient ID clinic. His PhD is in biochemistry, with a focus on the physical chemistry of protein-protein and protein-small molecule interactions. This unusual background gives him a strong background from which to pursue the work described in this CDA application. He has worked in the Portland VAMC Experimental Chemotherapy Lab with Dr. Michael Riscoe and Dr. Stone Doggett over the past three years, developing proﬁciency in the molecular and biochemical methods needed to evaluate drugs and their mechanism of action in protozoan parasites. The work proposed in this CDA will provide Dr. Alday with further training in drug design, evaluation of drug mechanisms, and in vivo efﬁcacy studies he needs to become an independent VA investigator. As part of this training grant, he has assembled a team of senior scientists and physician-scientists with expertise in molecular parasitology and drug development. Collectively, they have mentored dozens of trainees towards independence. This panel will meet formally every six months to review Dr. Alday's progress. Additionally, this panel will provide input regarding experimental approaches, review manuscripts prior to publication, and give advise about career development. Dr. Alday will take graduate-level classes in pharmacokinetics and genome sequencing and present his work at scientiﬁc meetings. Prior to the end of this CDA, Dr. Alday will have identiﬁed promising lead compounds ready for advancement down the drug development pathway as well as new targets for future drug development efforts. Moving these leads forward will form the basis for VA Merit Review and NIH R01 grant applications that will establish him as an independent clinician-scientist devoted to caring for veterans afﬂicted by infectious diseases through service and research.",12105076 (contact),"ALDAY, PHIL HOLLAND (contact)",NA,2020-01-01,2024-12-31,absorption;acute infection;Anti-Infective Agents;Antibiotics;Applications Grants;Biochemical;Biochemistry;Biology;Blindness;Brain;Brain Diseases;career development;Caring;Cells;Cessation of life;Chemicals;chemotherapy;chronic infection;Clinic;Clinical;Communicable Diseases;Consult;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cyst;Data;Development;disability;Diversity Library;Doctor of Philosophy;Dose;Drug Combinations;Drug Design;drug development;Drug Evaluation;Drug Kinetics;drug mechanism;Drug resistance;drug testing;Effectiveness;effectiveness testing;efficacy study;Essential Genes;Evaluation;experimental study;Eye diseases;forward genetics;Future;Genetic;genetic approach;Genome;genome sequencing;global health;Grant;Growth;Health;Health Benefit;Healthcare Systems;HIV;Human;Immunocompromised Host;immunosuppressed;Immunosuppression;improved;in vivo;in vivo imaging system;Individual;Infection;infection burden;Inpatients;insight;Internal Medicine;K-Series Research Career Programs;Knock-out;latent infection;Lead;Libraries;Manuscripts;Measures;Medical;Medical center;Medicine;meetings;member;Mentors;Methods;Molecular;Monitor;mouse model;Mutagenesis;mutant;Mutation;new therapeutic target;novel;novel therapeutics;Open Reading Frames;Oral;Oral Administration;Oregon;Organ;Outpatients;Parasites;Parasitic infection;Parasitology;Pathway interactions;Pharmaceutical Chemistry;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physical Chemistry;Physicians;Population;Positioning Attribute;pressure;prevent;Property;prophylactic;Protein Chemistry;Proteins;Protozoa;Publications;Pyrimethamine;reactivation from latency;Regimen;Research;Research Personnel;Resistance;resistant strain;Resources;Risk;Rotation;Savings;Science;Scientist;Senior Scientist;Serum;Services;side effect;Single Nucleotide Polymorphism;Site-Directed Mutagenesis;small molecule;Solid;Source;Stem cell transplant;Structure-Activity Relationship;Sulfadiazine;System;Testing;Time;Tissues;Toxoplasma;Toxoplasma gondii;Toxoplasmosis;Training;Transplantation;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Veterans;whole genome;Work,Development of new drugs for Toxoplasma by advancing hits from the Global Health Chemical Diversity Library,4940,ZRD1,ZRD1-INFB-K(01)1,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA

To translate this discovery into improved care for stress-related disorders we will further examine the role of estrogen signaling in animal models of stress-induced neuropsychiatric disorders. This will position us to then identify a pharmacological approach to target estrogen receptors selectively in the brain, thus conferring efficacy for stress-related disorders in both men and women without peripheral side effects.

Further, United States military veterans have an increased risk of suicide compared with the general population, and approximately 18 to 22 veterans die from suicide each day. It has been reported that up to 90% of individuals who complete suicide have an underlying psychiatric disorder, mainly PTSD or depression. Recent evidence indicate that inflammation, as manifested by increased levels of pro‐inflammatory cytokines contributes to the pathophysiology of suicidality. However, there is a critical need for studies that are designed to determine the role of specific components of the immune system in suicidal behavior in order to identify novel therapeutic targets.

Here we have discovered the regulation of PI3K signaling by a novel scaffolding molecule, IQGAP1 which brings all components of PI3K pathway in close functional proximity for concerted and spatial generation of the second messenger phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate in any subcellular compartments, including plasma membrane and endosomes. PIPKI scaffolded by IQGAP1 in cytosol is also present in the nucleus. In the nucleus, PIPKI and its PIP2 product controls gene expression through a poly (A) polymerase Star-PAP and the tumor suppressor p53. PIP2 associated with Star-PAP and p53 serve as substrate for a novel nuclear PI 3- kinase, which is counteracted by nuclear PTEN. This has identified a novel nuclear PI stress signaling pathway encompassing PIPKI, Star-PAP, p53, IMPK and PTEN.

Narrative Delirium is the most common complication of surgery and anesthesia in older patients and is associated with serious morbidity, including accelerated decline to dementia. Using biomarkers in plasma as well as MR imaging of cerebral volume, this proposal will investigate occult cerebral neurodegeneration pathology characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders as a risk factor for postoperative delirium, and whether surgery- induced inflammation and delirium lead to neural injury that accelerates neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. By elucidating mechanisms of and plasma biomarkers for postoperative delirium, this work will help improve risk prediction and the cognitive outcomes of vulnerable older surgical patients.

Current therapies only delay the progression to ESRD and do not arrest the disease. Therefore, there is urgent need for new therapeutic approaches for DN. This proposal will explore the therapeutic modality of a newly identified translational variant of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in chromosome 10), PTEN-Long, in rodent models of DN. Also, its role in activation of platelet- derived growth factor receptor-b for progression of DN will be investigated.",1891344;1867548 (contact),"GHOSH CHOUDHURY, GOUTAM ;SHARMA, KUMAR  (contact)",NA,2011-07-01,2024-12-31,20 year old;Accounting;Address;Affect;age group;AKT inhibition;Automobile Driving;Binding;cell injury;Cell Membrane Permeability;Cells;Chromosome 10;Codon Nucleotides;Complex;Complications of Diabetes Mellitus;cost;CRISPR/Cas technology;Data;db/db mouse;demographics;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;diabetic;Diabetic mouse;Diabetic Nephropathy;diabetic rat;Disease;Dissociation;Down-Regulation;End stage renal failure;Epithelial Cells;Event;Exposure to;falls;Fibronectins;FRAP1 gene;Glucose;Healthcare;Human;Hyperglycemia;Hypertrophy;Immune;Immunofluorescence Immunologic;Immunohistochemistry;Immunoprecipitation;inhibitor;Kidney;kidney cell;kidney cortex;Kidney Diseases;Knock-out;Maps;mesangial cell;Methods;military veteran;Modality;Modeling;Molecular;morphometry;Mus;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;pandemic disease;Pathogenesis;Pathologic;Pathology;Patients;Permeability;Persons;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1;Platelet Activation;Platelet-Derived Growth Factor;Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor;prevent;Process;Protein Dephosphorylation;protein expression;Protein Isoforms;Protein Tyrosine Kinase;Proteins;PTEN gene;Recombinant Proteins;Recombinants;Regulation;Renal function;Renal Tissue;Reporting;Resources;response;Rodent;Rodent Model;Role;Signal Transduction;Small Interfering RNA;small molecule;Streptozocin;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Agents;therapeutic protein;Transfection;transfection/expression vector;Transforming Growth Factors;Translations;Tricarboxylic Acids;Tubular formation;Type 2 diabetic;Tyrosine Phosphorylation;United States;Variant;Veterans;Western Blotting,Mechanisms of Renal Cell Injury,926,ZRD1,ZRD1-NEPH-D(01),NA,NA,12,NA,NA,NA,NA

One of the main challenges in CKD is impaired phosphate homeostasis. Given the considerable negative sequelae associated with hyperphosphatemia, such as increased cardiovascular mortality, reducing plasma phosphate is a critical goal of therapy. Renal phosphate reabsorption is mediated by the sodium- phosphate cotransporters Npt2a and Npt2c. The former mediates the majority of renal phosphate reabsorption (~75%). We identified that pharmacological inhibition of Npt2a, via a novel orally absorbable Npt2a inhibitor, causes phosphaturia, reductions in plasma phosphate levels and suppression of parathyroid hormone, but also increases urinary excretion of sodium and chloride.

The long term consequences of TBI may extend beyond the associated neuro- cognitive deficits as recent studies have indicated that the risk of cardiovascular mortality is markedly increased in subjects with a history of TBI. This mortality risk is associated with increased plaque build-up in the arteries suggesting that TBI promotes atherosclerosis. However, the causal relationship between TBI and vascular disease is not clear. If there is a causal relationship between TBI and vascular disease, this will have immediate implications for preventive therapies.

Successful completion of these aims will establish a critical link between UV exposure and melanomagenesis as mutation of CA and AC dinucleotides are common diver mutations in the BRAF proto-oncogene.",11381034;7030839 (contact),"ROBERTS, STEVEN A;WYRICK, JOHN J (contact)","HUMBLE, MICHAEL C",2021-04-01,2026-01-31,Acute;Adenine;Bioinformatics;BRAF gene;Bulla;Bypass;Cells;Characteristics;Clinical;Cutaneous Melanoma;Cytidine;Cytosine;Data;Deamination;density;Deoxyribonuclease I;Dinucleoside Phosphates;Disease Progression;DNA biosynthesis;DNA Damage;DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase;driver mutation;Epidemiology;Etiology;experimental study;Exposure to;Genetic Transcription;Genome;genome sequencing;genome-wide;genome-wide analysis;Genomics;High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing;Human;In Vitro;Incidence;Induced Mutation;insight;Lesion;Light;Link;Location;Maps;Melanoma;melanomagenesis;Methods;Molecular;Mutagenesis;Mutation;novel;Nucleotide Excision Repair;Nucleotides;Oncogenic;Physiological;Play;Polymerase;Proto-Oncogenes;Pyrimidine Dimers;Rad30 protein;Rare Lesion;Recurrence;regional difference;repaired;Reporter;Resolution;response;Role;Skin;Skin Cancer;skin organogenesis;Somatic Mutation;Sunburn;Sunlight;Thymine;tumor;tumor progression;ultraviolet;Ultraviolet B Radiation;ultraviolet damage;ultraviolet lesions;Ultraviolet Rays;UV induced;UV Mutagenesis;UV Radiation Exposure;UVA induced;whole genome;Yeasts,Genome-wide analysis of the formation and mutagenesis of atypical UV photoproducts in skin cancer,32814,CE,Cancer Etiology Study Section[CE],NA,NA,4,272461,144404,416865,NA

Hepatic insulin resistance plays a key role in this metabolic dysfunction and is a significant long-term healthcare issue to the VHA due to increased risk of developing additional pathologies and mortality. A key player in the development of hepatic insulin resistance is mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) due to its ability to regulate lipid metabolism. Our preliminary data suggests that mTORC1 also plays a divergent role in the catabolism of unsaturated fatty acids leading to an overall hypothesis that mTORC1 regulates the ability of mitochondria to shift fatty acid substrate preference through catabolism of these fatty acids and that dysfunction in this pathway leads to hepatic insulin resistance.

If a cell lacks either receptor, it is unlikely that it can be infected by most strains of HIV-1. Interestingly, some individuals have a mutation in the gene that encodes the CCR5 receptor, and are unable to become infected with certain strains of HIV-1. Developing methods to induce this mutation, called the CCR5-delta 32 mutation, in the stem cells of HIV-1 infected patients who do not have the mutation would potentially allow them to stop taking anti-retroviral medications without suffering any negative effects. We propose to develop a method that replaces the normal CCR5 gene with one carrying the CCR5-delta 32 mutation into stem cells using a newly discovered enzyme called CasX. We will also determine how many stem cells carrying two copies of the mutation are needed for an HIV-1 patient to stop taking anti-retroviral medications and still maintain a healthy immune system.",2020433 (contact),"HOWELL, ALEXANDRA L (contact)",NA,2021-01-01,2027-12-31,Adaptive Immune System;Alleles;Anti-Retroviral Agents;antiretroviral therapy;Area;Autologous;Autologous Transplantation;Bacteria;Bacteriophages;base;Binding;CCR5 gene;CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes;Cell surface;Cell Transplantation;Cells;Cellular Immunity;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Code;Communicable Diseases;Complex;Data;Derivation procedure;Development;DNA;DNA annealing;DNA Repair;DNA Sequence;endonuclease;Enzymes;Eukaryotic Cell;Event;Excision;Family;Flow Cytometry;gene editing technology;gene transplantation for gene therapy;gene-editing approach;Generations;Genes;Genetic Diseases;Genomic DNA;Goals;Guide RNA;Hematopoietic stem cells;Hepatitis B Infection;HIV;HIV Infections;HIV resistance;HIV-1;Hot Springs;Human;human disease;Human Genome;human pathogen;Humoral Immunities;hydraulic fracturing;Immune;Immune system;Immunodeficient Mouse;In Vitro;in vivo;Individual;Induced Mutation;Infection;Infusion procedures;innovation;Integrase;interest;Interruption;Isoptera;Lentivirus;Location;Malignant Neoplasms;mathematical model;Measures;Mediating;metagenomic sequencing;Metagenomics;Methods;Mus;mutant;Mutation;next generation;next generation sequencing;novel;nuclease;Null Lymphocytes;patient subsets;Patients;peripheral blood;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;preclinical study;Process;Puromycin;receptor;Recombinants;resistance allele;Ribonucleoproteins;RNA;Single-Stranded DNA;Site;Sorting;Specificity;stem cells;System;Technology;Therapeutic;Time;tool;trial planning;Umbilical Cord Blood;Validation;Viral Genome;Viral Vector;Water,Developing novel CRISPR/CasX editors to generate a CCR5/null immune system,5248,ZRD1,ZRD1-INFA-K(01)1,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA

These antigens function in key steps in tumorigenic pathways including cell adhesion, signaling, and immune response. Highly novel click chemistries and nanoparticles will be employed to generate multivalent/fluorescent/radiolabeled peptides and Abs to detect aggressive tumors, reduce tumor growth, and increase immune response in vivo. In terms of human health, the probes will improve the standard of care of patients in that they will be well tolerated in humans and radioactive versions will rapidly clear the body avoiding radiation damage.

There is a type of fat called “beige” fat that has the capacity to burn calories and secrete hormones that improve metabolism. Individuals who have more “beige” fat are protected from developing diabetes and heart disease. The genes responsible for making this type of fat are not known, but our studies find that a one of them is a special gene that doesn’t code for a protein. This gene, called LINC00473, may be an organizer of proteins that help burn fat in the mitochondria. We believe that understanding the function of this gene can help us understand how beige fat forms, and how it functions to improve metabolism.

Elucidating the mechanisms of these conditions will result in unprecedented knowledge of thyroid physiology and provide scientific rationale for targeted treatments.,7368573;10432942;1872745 (contact),"BIANCO, ANTONIO C;DUMITRESCU, ALEXANDRA MIHAELA;REFETOFF, SAMUEL  (contact)","BURCH, HENRY B",1979-07-15,2027-12-31,Acids;Affect;Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome;analog;Area;boys;Brain;Cardiac;chromosome 14 uniparental disomy syndrome;Chromosomes;Clinical Skills;cofactor;cognitive function;Collaborations;combination gene therapy;Combined Modality Therapy;Complementary DNA;Complex;CRISPR/Cas technology;Defect;Dependovirus;Diagnosis;Dimerization;Disease;DNA Sequence;effectiveness evaluation;Family;Functional disorder;Funding;Gene Combinations;Gene Dosage;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Regulation;gene therapy;Genes;Genetic;Genetic study;genome editing;Genomic Imprinting;Goals;Gorilla gorilla;Grant;Hereditary Disease;hormone analog;Hormone Responsive;Human;Impairment;improved;In Vitro;in vivo;Individual;Inherited;innovation;insight;Iodide Peroxidase;Knockout Mice;Knowledge;Laboratories;LDL-Receptor Related Protein 2;Link;loss of function;Lymphocyte;Mediating;Membrane;Metabolic;Methylation;MicroRNAs;Molecular;Mus;mutant;Mutation;novel;Organ;Organoids;Pathway interactions;Patients;Peripheral;Phenotype;Physiological;Physiology;pre-clinical;Pre-Clinical Model;Primates;Process;programs;Proteins;Puberty;Publications;Research;Research Personnel;Research Proposals;Resistance;resistance mechanism;Role;Sampling;Satellite Viruses;selenoenzyme;Serum;Short Tandem Repeat;success;Syndrome;Tandem Repeat Sequences;Technical Expertise;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Thyroid Diseases;Thyroid Function Tests;Thyroid Gland;Thyroid Hormones;Thyrotoxicosis;Thyrotropin;Tissues;tool;Transplantation;Untranslated RNA;Variant;X Chromosome,Thyroid Physiology Studies of Inherited Disorders,15070,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-EMNR-B(02)M],NA,NA,50,415343,265820,681163,NA

Genetic predisposition is a risk factor for development and rupture of intracranial aneurysms.

Our proposal will validate new genetic findings we obtained by analyzing large families with multiple members over many generations presenting with intracranial aneurysms. We will use cellular and animal models to investigate the contributions of these candidate genes to the development of brain vessels, aiming to understand how they regulate blood vessel formation in the brain. We aim to understand how dysfunction of these genes disrupts brain blood vessel structure, understand in detail how specific cells in the brain vessels change as a consequence of the mutations we identified and the mechanisms that are involved, aiming to establish how this might contribute to the formation of intracranial aneurysms.

Preliminary research included in this grant suggests that oxidative mitochondrial DNA damage may play a role in mediating the pathogenicity of pneumococcal infection.

Binge drinking is highly prevalent in active military duty personnel and veterans. More than 40% of military veterans have a lifetime history of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Thus, alcohol misuse exerts a large burden, especially within the VA. How individuals respond to their first experiences with alcohol is related to their risk for developing an AUD, including frequent early adult binge drinking (King et al., 2011; McCarty et al., 2004). Understanding the brain circuitry that underlies this dangerous pattern of drinking is an important first step in learning about vulnerability factors for AUD. We propose to identify brain regions engaged during binge drinking and manipulate specific brain circuits to determine what role they play in binge drinking. We will learn which circuits are engaged early, and this informs us of mechanisms that are involved in risk for AUD.

Also, aging Veterans have a high prevalence of medical and psychiatric disorders that can further aggravate sleep disruption. This research program will use cutting edge approaches to determine if disruption of hypothalamic neurogenesis causes the dysfunction of critical sleep-regulatory systems and consequent sleep disturbance in aging; and if sleep disruption in aging could be mitigated by improving hypothalamic neurogenesis and anti-inflammatory measures.

It is increasingly appreciated that adult humans have ‘brown fat’—highly metabolically active fat depots that metabolize lipids to generate heat. Brown adipose depots also clear glucose and triacylglycerols form circulation, secrete beneficial hormones, and contribute in other ways to overall health. Recent observations show that white fat, e.g. abdominal and subcutaneous, can transdifferentiate to a brown-like phenotype. This may be an attractive strategy to reduce body fat and improve metabolic health.

Yet, little is known about how the breathing and the brain progressively adapt to chronic hypercapnia. Here, we will utilize a human-like animal model (goats) and apply cutting-edge approaches to measure changes in gene expression within the brain that are altered during different stages of chronic hypercapnia, how these gene expression patterns may be further altered when the hypercapnia is made worse, and if brain inflammation plays an important role in the adaptive response to hypercapnia.

Changes in bone mass and structure occur with age and are common in both women and men, resulting in increased risk for debilitating pain, bone fracture, and delayed healing. With aging, resident stem cells in bone lose their ability to maintain the tissue and bone degeneration takes place over time. My preliminary results suggest that during aging, the level of a protein, Cyr61 (also known as CCN1), becomes depleted in bone. The proposed research will investigate this protein and determine if it's required for normal function of bone-specific stem cells and whether replenishing it during aging restores their function in bone.

Our proposal tests chromatin modifying compounds, including clinical inhibitors of EZH2 and menin, hypothesizing that these agents will transdifferentiate MES NB models into an ADR-like state, thereby increasing expression of targets critical to both small molecule inhibitors and to immunotherapies, leading to enhanced responses, meeting the NIH mission of improving patient outcomes.",1940040 (contact),"WEISS, WILLIAM A (contact)",NA,2017-09-18,2029-02-28,Address;Adrenergic Agents;Antibodies;ARID1A gene;ATRX gene;CAR T cell therapy;CD47 gene;Cell Line;Cell model;Cell surface;Cells;chemical genetics;Chemicals;chemotherapy;Child;Childhood Extracranial Solid Tumor;Chromatin;Clinical;Collaborations;Combined Modality Therapy;Complex;CRISPR screen;CRISPR/Cas technology;Data;Dependence;Development;Down-Regulation;Embryonal Neoplasms;Enhancers;Enzymes;Epigenetic Process;epigenetic therapy;EZH2 gene;FDA approved;GD3-synthase;Genes;Genetic;genetic approach;Genetic Transcription;Genetically Engineered Mouse;genome-wide;Germ Lines;Glycolipids;histone methyltransferase;Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase;Human;Immunocompetent;Immunotherapy;Impairment;improved;In Vitro;in vivo;inhibitor;inhibitor therapy;interest;Lysine;meetings;member;Menin;Mesenchymal;Mesenchymal Differentiation;Mission;MLL gene;Modeling;mouse model;Mutation;MYCN gene;NBPhox protein;Neuroblastoma;neuroblastoma cell;NOTCH3 gene;novel;Pathogenesis;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Peptides;Play;Polycomb;pre-clinical;programs;Proteins;Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases;Resistance;resistance mechanism;response;Role;Scaffolding Protein;small hairpin RNA;small molecule;small molecule inhibitor;Surface;targeted treatment;Testing;Therapeutic;therapy resistant;transdifferentiation;Transferase;tumor growth;United States National Institutes of Health,Targeting neuroblastoma cell state plasticity,217959,ZCA1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZCA1 RPRB-J (O1)],7274,A1,6,585652,39000,NA,624652
