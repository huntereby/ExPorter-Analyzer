Gene expression changes conferred by molecular alterations to the genome, known as epigenetic modifications, underlie affective states, including reward seeking and fear learning and memory. There is growing evidence that these changes, and the physiological responses to stress, are regulated differently in men and women. This proposal specifically manipulates Cdk5 in order to pinpoint the role of epigenetic regulation of this single gene following different types of stress. The experimental strategy will complement 30 years of existing literature on the role of Cdk5 in male brain.",10862823 (contact),"HELLER, ELIZABETH A (contact)","LEINWAND, SARAH GOLDBERG",2023-01-01,2027-10-31,Abstinence;Acetylation;Affective;anti-depressive agents;Attenuated;Behavior;Behavioral Paradigm;Blood;Brain;Brain region;cell type;Cocaine;cocaine exposure;cocaine reward;cocaine seeking;cocaine self-administration;Cognition;Complement;conditioned fear;Corpus striatum structure;Corticosterone;CREB1 gene;Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5;Cyclin-Dependent Kinases;Data;Deacetylation;Development;Dopamine;Emotional;Emotions;EP300 gene;Epigenetic Process;epigenetic regulation;excitatory neuron;fear memory;Female;Fright;Gene Activation;Gene Expression;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Genome;genome-wide;HDAC3 gene;Hippocampus;Histone Acetylation;Histone H3;histone modification;Histones;in vivo;Individual;inhibitor;innovation;interest;Knock-out;knowledge integration;Lead;Learning;Literature;Lysine;male;Measures;Memory;memory encoding;memory retrieval;men;Messenger RNA;Modeling;Modification;Molecular;mRNA Expression;Mus;Negative Valence;Neurons;Nucleus Accumbens;Outcome Measure;overexpression;Pharmaceutical Preparations;phosphoproteomics;Phosphorylation;Physiological;Prosencephalon;protein activation;protein expression;Protein Kinase;Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases;Proteins;Protocols documentation;recruit;Regulation;Reporting;Repression;Research;response;Rewards;Rodent;Role;roscovitine;Serine;sex;sexual dimorphism;Signal Transduction;Stress;Synaptic plasticity;tau Proteins;tau-1;Testing;Tissues;tool;Transcriptional Regulation;Western Blotting;Woman,Epigenetic regulation of Cdk5 in cognition and emotion,126027,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-MDCN-P(57)S],NA,NA,2,323100,201938,525038,NA

Lack of understanding about neurobiological mechanisms whereby vagal activity modulates chronic pain poses a significant hurdle for improving chronic pain management through the regulation of interoceptive inputs. Here, we focus on studying neural mechanisms of vagal modulation in a mouse model of temporomandibular disorders (TMD). TMD are the most prevalent orofacial pain conditions that involve the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), chewing muscles, and associated head and neck musculoskeletal structures and patients with TMD suffer from myofascial pain, limited mandibular motion, and TMJ sounds and the prevalence among U.S. adults is about 25% who experiencing TMD at least once in their lifetime and among them over 35 million suffer from TMD pain and resulting severe psychosocial and economic burden is more than $60 billion per year. Here, we will study functional neural mechanisms of interoception inhibiting pain.

Although NPF cannot be prevented, modifiable positive psychological factors (PPF; e.g., optimism, positive affect, and purpose in life) predict improved recovery and physical activity (PA) in non-CA patients, and therefore this study will test whether PPF predict long-term post-CA recovery—independent of NPF—and whether PA may be a behavioral mechanism underlying these associations.

The proposed research addresses these concerns by (a) introducing a novel human development paradigm for the study of police behavior that focuses on how and to what extent LEOs identify with MMY and (b) assessing the technological viability of using broadcast police communications (BPC) for large scale analysis of police behavior, where BPC are analyzed as pre-reflective accounts of LEO thought processes, representing both reactive and stable coping mechanisms (i.e., speech acts) for ensuring the safety of LEOs and the public at large. Accordingly, we propose (1) using this novel data source to understand how LEOs and MMYs come to perceive each other, (2) test a similarly novel survey instrument for measuring LEO identification with minority youth, in the process determining how much meaningful information can be reliably extracted from audio recordings of BPC for identifying racial discrimination in policing without the need to access highly sensitive police records or video recording data.",14845978;9873628 (contact),"GRAZIUL, CHRISTOPHER ;SPENCER, MARGARET BEALE (contact)","GILLMAN, ARIELLE SAMANTHA",2021-01-27,2025-12-31,acronyms;Address;Adopted;Adverse event;Affective;Archives;automated speech recognition;Behavior;Behavior assessment;Belief;Chicago;combat;Communication;Communities;Complex;coping mechanism;Coping Skills;Country;course development;Data;data quality;Data Sources;Development;Dimensions;Ecosystem;effective intervention;Ensure;Evaluation;Event;experience;Exposure to;Expressed Sequence Tags;Focus Groups;Frequencies;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Health;Hour;Human;Human Development;human subject;improved;Individual;insight;instrument;Intervention;Interview;Language;Law Enforcement;Law Enforcement Officers;lens;Life Cycle Stages;Link;Machine Learning;Measures;member;Methodology;Minority;minority children;Minority Men;Modeling;Motivation;Natural Language Processing;Neighborhoods;novel;Outcome;Perception;Personal Satisfaction;perspective taking;phenomenological models;Police;Predisposition;prevent;Process;psychosocial;Public Health;public health relevance;Race;racial discrimination;racial disparity;Records;Research;Research Activity;Research Personnel;response;Rest;Risk;Safety;Scientist;social;Source;Speech;Stress;Stressful Event;Surveys;Systems Theory;Technology;Technology Assessment;Testing;Time;Training;Trauma;Trust;United States;Variant;Video Recording;Work;Youth,Primed to (re)act: Can changes in procedural language prevent adverse events between police and minority male youth?,15064,CLHP,Community-Level Health Promotion Study Section[CLHP],NA,NA,4,365361,186348,551709,NA

T2D disparately affects minority populations, with Hispanics being one of the highest at-risk populations. Evidence from both epidemiological and lipidomic studies have shown that specific lipids and their constituent components are important factors in the development of T2D. The human lipidome is made up of thousands of different lipid species, the simpler constituent components of classical lipid measures like HDL. By focusing on biologically simple lipid species, we hope to more rapidly identify genes influencing lipid variation and T2D. We will use whole genome sequencing to identify novel genes underlying the relationship between human lipid variation and T2D in extended pedigrees of Mexican American individuals, and functionally assess identified targets.

We also found that sorting the animal's cortical sensory responses and behavioral choices by arousal state (as measured by pupil diameter) revealed an inverted U, with optimal responses and performance occurring at intermediate levels of arousal. Here we will address the cellular, network, and neuromodulatory mechanisms underlying the determination of optimal state for neural and behavioral performance. We hypothesize that neuromodulatory transmitter systems are in constant flux and that these fluctuations in release cause ongoing and influential changes in the operating properties of the cerebral cortex. We will use a variety of state-of-the-art techniques, including whole cell recording, two-photon imaging, and optogenetics, to reveal the precise cellular, network, and neuromodulatory mechanisms underlying rapid state control in awake, behaving mice.

Other manifestations of candidiasis include mucosal infections in the oral and vaginal cavities. C. albicans is nearly unique amongst fungi in its ability to thrive in and on human hosts; there are few other fungal species that can do so effectively.

One population of memory cells, called memory T cells, come in a variety of “flavors” which exhibit distinct functional properties – one major subdivision is into memory T cells that patrol the body incessantly (recirculating memory cells) and ones that stay in tissues long-term (resident memory cells) , which can promptly respond to local infections. Key to immune “memory” is that these T cell populations last long-term (decades in humans, years in mice) and preserve their distinct “identities” (e.g. as recirculating or resident cells): however, while this has been a topic of considerable interest for decades, discrepancies in published studies need to be resolved in order to determine how memory T cells are maintained. We will use sophisticated genetic models, as well as pharmaceutical treatments, to accurately determine how distinct subsets of memory T cells are sustained by the soluble factors (called cytokines) IL-7 and IL-15 and how the “identity” of recirculating and resident memory cells is maintained by expression of a DNA binding protein called KLF2 and some of the genes it regulates.

Because the homologous receptor in humans also binds soluble oligomers of beta amyloid, this research can offer mechanistic explanations for synapse and memory loss in human AD and may lead to new drug targets for treatment.",1933620 (contact),"SHATZ, CARLA J (contact)","GRAY, ERIN EMILY",2020-03-01,2025-12-31,3-Dimensional;abeta oligomer;Actins;Adult;Affinity;Age Months;Aging;Alleles;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Alzheimer&apos;s disease model;Alzheimer&apos;s disease patient;Amyloid beta-Protein;Anatomy;APP-PS1;Autopsy;autosomal dominant Alzheimer&apos;s disease;Binding;Biochemistry;Brain;cell type;Cells;Cerebral cortex;Clinical Trials;cofilin;Communication;Complement;critical developmental period;Dementia;depolymerization;Deposition;Development;Disease;Drug Targeting;early onset;Electrophysiology (science);Event;experience;experimental study;Family;frontal lobe;Frontotemporal Dementia;Gene Expression;Gene Family;Genes;Genetic;Genetic study;Genetic Transcription;genome wide association study;glial activation;Goals;Health;hippocampal pyramidal neuron;Histocompatibility;HLA-A gene;Homologous Gene;Human;human induced pluripotent stem cells;Immune;Immune signaling;Immune system;Immunoglobulins;Immunohistochemistry;Immunologic Receptors;In Situ Hybridization;in vivo;induced pluripotent stem cell;Inflammation;interest;Learning;Leukocytes;Ligands;Link;Mediating;Mediator;Memory;Memory Loss;Methods;MHC Class I Genes;Molecular;mouse model;Mus;nanomolar;Nerve Block;Nervous System;neural;Neurobiology;Neurofibrillary Tangles;Neurons;neurotransmission;new therapeutic target;novel;novel therapeutics;old mice;Organoids;Outcome;Pathologic;Pathology;Pathway interactions;pharmacologic;postnatal;Process;Prosencephalon;protein aggregation;Proteins;receptor;Recombinant Proteins;Research;Resolution;RiboTag;Role;Sampling;Senile Plaques;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Structure;Synapses;synaptic function;Synaptic plasticity;synaptic pruning;System;targeted treatment;tau Proteins;tau-1;Testing;Transcript;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing;Transgenic Model;Validation;vision development;Visual System,Innate immune signaling at the synapse in development and pathological Alzheimer’s disease,65206,CMND,Cellular and Molecular Biology of Neurodegeneration Study Section[CMND],NA,NA,5,250000,159395,409395,NA

We will conduct interviews with leaders of these organizations to identify the advanced primary care infrastructure they have sought to implement as well as implementation barriers, and we will interview Medicare beneficiaries living with Alzheimer’s disease (or Alzheimer’s disease related dementias) and their caregivers to better understand their unmet care needs and how these needs differ across the four types of physician organizations.",10140480 (contact),"TIMBIE, JUSTIN W.
