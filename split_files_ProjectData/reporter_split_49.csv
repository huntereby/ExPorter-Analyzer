The problem is pervasive—nearly 70% of all composite restorations are replacements for failures. High-risk patients, such as the 4 million U.S. children and more than 100 million adults who do not receive regular dental care, are particularly vulnerable. The leading cause of failure is decay at the interface between the composite and tooth. This interface is initially sealed by an adhesive but the adhesive seal is weak and readily degraded. The proposed project will result in the following patient benefits: 1) substantial reduction in bacteria that infect the tooth margin; 2) ability to repair tooth structure damaged by bacteria, acids, and enzymes; 3) a self-strengthening adhesive that resists degradation; and 4) ~90% reduction in unreacted adhesive that could leach into the tissues of the mouth.",1870140 (contact);10551147,"SPENCER, PAULETTE  (contact);TAMERLER-BEHAR, CANDAN","LOPEZ, ORLANDO",2020-08-12,2025-07-31,Acids;Address;Adhesives;Adult;Amalgam;Anti-Bacterial Agents;antimicrobial;Bacteria;Biodegradation;cariogenic bacteria;Characteristics;chemical property;Child;Clinical;Composite Resins;composite restoration;Data;demineralization;Dental Care;Dentin;design;Deterioration;Engineering;Environment;Enzymes;Failure;Feedback;Fracture;high risk;Hydrolysis;improved;In Situ;in vivo;Infiltration;Injury;interfacial;life span;Liquid substance;Measurement;mechanical properties;Mechanics;Mediating;meetings;Microbial Biofilms;Modeling;monomer;novel;Oral;Oral cavity;Patients;Peptides;Performance;Plant Resins;Polymer Chemistry;Polymers;predictive modeling;Process;Proliferating;Property;Psychological reinforcement;Recurrence;remineralization;repaired;Resistance;restoration;restorative material;Risk;seal;Secondary to;Streptococcus mutans;Structure;System;Tissues;Tooth Loss;Tooth structure;Virulence;Viscosity,Peptide-Polymer Engineering Dentin/Adhesive Interfacial Bond Integrity,25476,ODCS,"Oral, Dental and Craniofacial Sciences Study Section[ODCS]",NA,NA,10,186200,95893,282093,NA

Our goal is to elucidate the mechanistic role of TET proteins in ascorbate-mediated AML sensitivity, identify rational drug combination treatment strategies using ascorbate as an adjuvant, and optimize the bioavailability of ascorbate to increase its efficacy as a TET cofactor for AML therapy.",12051333 (contact),"CIMMINO, LUISA  (contact)","XI, DAN",2023-08-01,2028-07-31,Acute Myelocytic Leukemia;acute myeloid leukemia cell;Adjuvant;Adjuvant Therapy;Adult;Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia;Adverse effects;Age Years;Aggressive behavior;Alleles;alternative treatment;analog;Animal Model;Antineoplastic Agents;Antioxidants;aqueous;ascorbate;Ascorbic Acid;Biological Assay;Biological Availability;Bone Marrow Transplantation;cancer cell;Cell Line;Cell model;Chemicals;Chemistry;chemotherapy;clinical translation;cofactor;combinatorial;Combined Modality Therapy;Data;Dedications;demethylation;Dependence;Diagnosis;Disease;DNA;Dose;Drug Combinations;Drug Kinetics;Elderly;Elderly Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia;Enzymes;epigenome;Foundations;Functional dependence;functional restoration;Gene Expression;Gene Silencing;Genetic;Genetic Screening;Goals;Growth;Hematologic Neoplasms;Hematopoietic;Heterozygote;Human;Hypermethylation;Impairment;improved;in vivo;Infusion procedures;Lesion;leukemia;leukemia treatment;Leukemic Cell;Libraries;lipophilicity;Liposomes;loss of function;loss of function mutation;Measures;Mediating;Micronutrients;Modeling;Molecular;mouse model;Mus;mutant;Mutation;Myeloid Cells;novel;novel strategies;Oncogenic;oxidation;patient subsets;Patients;pharmacologic;Physiological;preclinical efficacy;Prognosis;programs;Property;Proteins;rational design;Research;Residual state;Role;screening;self-renewal;Sodium;Surface;synergism;targeted treatment;Testing;Tetanus Helper Peptide;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Agents;therapeutically effective;Treatment Efficacy;Treatment outcome;treatment response;treatment strategy;tumor;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;uptake;Water;Xenograft procedure,Enhancing TET activity for the treatment of hematological malignancy,282453,DMPC,Drug Discovery and Molecular Pharmacology C Study Section[DMPC],NA,NA,2,217313,116262,333575,NA

Benner NARRATIVE  The recent disappointing response of the CDC to the emergency created by the ""Wuhan coronavirus"" (2019- nCoV) reflects the fact that the CDC is not supported by basic science related to nucleic acid chemistry, and that the CDC is constructively unaware of what science is presently available to them to meet their needs. Specifically, had the CDC used two new technologies (self-avoiding molecular recognition systems, SAMRS, and artificially expanded genetic information systems, AEGIS) in their assays, the CDC would (at the time of this writing) be distributing robust kits to detect coronavirus, and an as yet unknown number of unnecessary deaths would have been spared. This project will provide the basic science research needed to support AEGIS and SAMRS, as well as to support their general use across many applications, to speed and lower the cost of regulatory approval of diagnostics kits, and to increase manufacturing robustness of multiplexed pathogen detection products. 1",6299669 (contact),"BENNER, STEVEN A (contact)","SASTALLA, INKA I",2021-08-12,2025-07-31,2019-nCoV;Animals;Basic Science;Biological Assay;Businesses;care costs;Cessation of life;Chemistry;Clinical;Communities;Computer software;cost;COVID-19 detection;Data;deep sequencing;Democracy;Demography;design;Diagnostic;Diagnostic Reagent Kits;Diagnostics Research;Disease;DNA;Dropout;Drops;economic impact;Emergency Situation;emerging pathogen;Enzymatic Biochemistry;Enzymes;Epidemic;Experimental Designs;experimental study;Failure;flexibility;Foundations;Future;genetic information;Guidelines;Human;improved;Information Systems;innovation;Knowledge;Learning;Malaise;manufacture;Manufacturer;Medicare;meetings;melting;Mission;Molecular Diagnosis;Molecular Evolution;molecular recognition;National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease;new technology;Nucleic Acids;Oral;pandemic disease;Paper;pathogen;Pathogen detection;Patients;Physicians;prevent;Process;Rectum;Regulation;relative cost;Reproducibility;Research;Research Personnel;Resistance;Resource-limited setting;Resources;response;restraint;RNA;Sampling;Science;Specific qualifier value;Speed;statistics;Symptoms;System;Temperature;Testing;Thermodynamics;Time;Travel;Vagina;Writing,Basic Research for Diagnostics and Surveillance in Lower Resource Environments,135146,EBIT,Enabling Bioanalytical and Imaging Technologies Study Section[EBIT],NA,NA,4,427581,243507,671088,NA

Protein function is critically dependent on the folding of their constituent polypeptides into active three-dimensional structures through the interactions of molecular chaperones. Protein homeostasis is achieved by balanced synthesis, folding, translocation and degradation of proteins. Experimental evidence accumulated in the recent past has revealed that failure of protein homeostasis in aging leads to some of the most devastating diseases affecting humanity. The latter include common neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease, common metabolic disorders such as Diabetes and a host of other age- related conditions. The Cold Spring Harbor Meeting on Protein Homeostasis in Health and Disease brings together experts in diverse aspects of protein folding, the cellular response to protein misfolding and diseases and therapeutic approaches for age-associated diseases of protein homeostasis. As such it serves as the premier clearinghouse for ideas on how to eventually translate the basic discoveries in the area to future treatments of recalcitrant diseases.",7039607 (contact),"STEWART, DAVID J.

This work seeks to identify whether dysregulation in emotion regulation neural circuitry two weeks following trauma predicts PTSD and other post-trauma symptom twelve months later among urban Black adults. Moreover, we will examine how environmental risk (e.g., discrimination) and protective factors (e.g., neighborhood cohesino) in the months following trauma impact neurobiological stress systems and how this interplay impacts neural health and risk for chronic distress. These data will advance our understanding of both socioenvironmental and neurobiological factors associated with vulnerability to specific trauma-related pathology and provide an important step toward identifying appropriate early interventions in the wake of trauma.",9625726;2121304 (contact),"DEROON-CASSINI, TERRI A.;LARSON, CHRISTINE L (contact)","TUMA, FARRIS K",2021-09-16,2026-07-31,Accident and Emergency department;Acute;Adult;adverse outcome;Affect;African American;allostatic load;Amygdaloid structure;Anxiety;Arousal;Behavioral;Biological;biological adaptation to stress;Biological Markers;Black American;Black race;Brain;brain health;Child Abuse and Neglect;Chronic;Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder;community advisory board;community violence;Complement;culturally appropriate intervention;cytokine;Data;deprivation;Disadvantaged;Discrimination;Distress;Early identification;Early Intervention;emotion regulation;Endocannabinoids;Environmental Risk Factor;ethnic minority;ethnic minority population;Event;experience;Exposure to;Goals;Health;high risk;Hospitals;Image;improved;indexing;Individual;Inflammatory;innovation;intersectionality;Intervention;Knowledge;Light;Link;Machine Learning;Measures;medical schools;Mental Depression;Mental disorders;Mental Health;minority stress;Nature;Neighborhoods;neural;neural circuit;neurobehavioral;neurobiological mechanism;Neurobiology;neuroimaging;neuromechanism;Outcome;Pathology;Patient Self-Report;pediatric trauma;physical conditioning;Play;Population;post-trauma;Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders;Predictive Factor;predictive marker;preventive intervention;Process;Prognosis;protective factors;Public Health;Quality of life;Race;racial minority;racial minority population;Recording of previous events;Recovery;recruit;Regulation;Research;resilience;resilience factor;Resources;Risk;Risk Factors;Risk Marker;risk prediction;Role;Sampling;Sensitivity and Specificity;Social Environment;socioenvironmental factor;Specific qualifier value;Stress;stress management;stressor;suicidal risk;Survivors;Symptoms;System;Trauma;trauma exposure;trauma symptom;United States;urban setting;violence exposure;Visit;Wisconsin;Work,Risk and Resilience in Urban Black American Acute Trauma Survivors,128982,APDA,Adult Psychopathology and Disorders of Aging Study Section[APDA],NA,NA,4,595918,117493,713411,NA

Although not detected by the threshold audiogram, this nerve damage is likely a major contributor to difficulties understanding speech in a noisy environment and may also instigate changes resulting in tinnitus and hyperacusis. Our Research Center aims to understand the prevalence of cochlear synaptopathy, measure/infer its consequences to suprathreshold sound processing, and to identify diagnostic markers. Therapies to reconnect nerves and sensory cells are on the horizon, and proper diagnostics are key to the design of clinical trials.

Collectively, these approaches will build a framework for elucidating the mechanisms of human development and improve stem cell models of morphogenesis and disease.",14317208 (contact),"SMITH, QUINTON  (contact)","SALAZAR, DESIREE LYNN",2023-08-01,2028-07-31,bioscaffold;Cells;Chemicals;Clinical;Communication;Cues;Developmental Biology;developmental disease;Disease;Embryo;Extracellular Matrix;gastrulation;Germ Layers;Goals;holistic approach;Human Development;human induced pluripotent stem cells;improved;induced pluripotent stem cell;Investigation;matrigel;mechanical signal;Mechanics;Metabolic Diseases;Microfluidics;Modeling;Morphogenesis;Organ;Organoids;paracrine;Patients;Pattern;Population;Process;regenerative approach;Regenerative Medicine;Role;self assembly;self organization;self-renewal;Specific qualifier value;stem cell fate;stem cell model;stem cell niche;Technology;Tissue Engineering;Tissues;tool;Variant,Physicochemical control of multilineage emergence,151099,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-CDB-L(55)R],NA,NA,2,250000,118649,368649,NA

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has improved and extended the lives of people with HIV, PWH. However, milder chronic HIV associated neurocognitive impairments (NCI) of varying severity known as mild HAND or HIV-NCI persist. HIV-NCI affect 15-40% of PWH and because they persist for life, can worsen with age, and affect adherence to medications, they can significantly reduce quality of life and increase mortality risk. NCI progression appears to correlate with increased HIV in the CNS despite ART. Ongoing low level neuroinflammation also mediates HIV-NCI. Many PWH have opioid use disorder, a comorbidity in PWH that can potentially exacerbate NCI. Our exciting and novel results suggest that buprenorphine, an established opiate substitution therapy (OST) that is used to treat addiction and withdrawal, prevents/reverses cognitive impairment in EcoHIV infected mice, by reducing inflammatory HIV infected/uninfected monocyte entry into the brain, limiting viral seeding of CNS reservoirs, and thus the neuroinflammatory and viral neurotoxic activities that mediate HIV-neurocognitive impairment. Our proposed studies are to characterize the mechanisms by which buprenorphine can mitigate cognitive impairment in PWH with and without OUD.

Allergen-specific IgE is largely responsible for the clinical manifestations of allergic reactions, such as life-threatening anaphylaxis. The affinity of the IgE plays a major role in determining the outcome of a patient after exposure to food allergen. IgE that is of high affinity can trigger anaphylaxis, while IgE of low affinity poses little risk and may even be preventative.

The established link between dietary salt with CVD and CKD, particularly in older adults, highlights a critical biomedical research need for strategies to counteract the adverse cardiorenal consequences of high dietary salt; and we have identified beta-hydroxybutyrate, a liver-derived ketone body, as a potential target to counteract the adverse cardiorenal effects high dietary salt. Using a randomized placebo-controlled crossover design study, we will test the hypothesis that concurrently giving a ketone monoester supplement (exogenous source of beta- hydroxybutyrate) with high dietary salt (10 days) will attenuate the effects of short-term high dietary salt on cardiorenal health (blood pressure, peripheral vascular function, kidney injury biomarkers, and kidney blood flow) in older adults.",14673380 (contact),"ROBINSON, AUSTIN TYLER (contact)","GAO, HONGWEI",2024-08-01,2026-07-31,Acute;Adult;adult obesity;Adverse effects;Adverse event;adverse outcome;Affect;Aging;American;American Heart Association;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;arterial stiffness;Attenuated;beta-Hydroxybutyrate;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biomedical Research;Blood flow;Blood Flow Velocity;Blood Pressure;blood pressure control;blood pressure reduction;blood pressure variability;Blood Vessels;brachial artery;cardioprotection;Cardiorenal syndrome;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cardiovascular Physiology;Cause of Death;Chronic Kidney Failure;Consumption;Creatinine clearance measurement;Crossover Design;Data;Diet;dietary;dietary guidelines;dietary salt;disorder risk;Doppler Ultrasound;Excess Dietary Salt;Exercise;Fasting;feeding;Female;Femur;Food;Funding;Future;Glomerular Filtration Rate;Goals;Health;Hepatic;high salt diet;Human;human data;Hypertension;improved;Individual;Injury to Kidney;innovation;Intervention;ketogenic diet;Ketone Bodies;Ketones;Kidney;Knowledge;Laboratories;Leg;Link;Liver;Lower Extremity;male;Masks;Measures;Mediating;modifiable risk;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality;Movement;novel strategies;older adult;Oral;Organ;Outcome;Peripheral;Physiologic pulse;pilot trial;Placebo Control;Plasma;Postmenopause;prevent;Process;Production;Productivity;protective effect;Public Health;Publications;Publishing;Randomized;Rattus;Recommendation;Regulation;renal artery;Research;Research Design;Research Personnel;Rest;Restaurants;Risk;Risk Factors;Rodent;salt intake;Secure;Sodium Chloride;Source;Stimulus;Supplementation;Techniques;Testing;tool;Translating;United States;Upper Extremity;urinary;Vascular Diseases;Vasodilator Agents;young adult,Dietary Ketone Supplementation as a Novel Strategy to Attenuate the Adverse Vascular and Renal Consequences of High Dietary Salt in Older Adults,87524,IVPP,Integrative Vascular Physiology and Pathology Study Section[IVPP],NA,A1,1,157892,86056,243948,NA

According to Foundation Medicine (FM) it is estimate that KRAS mutation frequencies of approximately 50% exist in colorectal cancers. KRAS mutations are present in approximately 25% of all tumors, making them one of the most common gene mutations linked to cancer. They are frequent drivers in lung, colorectal and pancreatic cancers. KRAS drives 32% of lung cancers, 40% of colorectal cancers, and 85% to 90% of pancreatic cancer cases. Mutations G12C, G12D/V and G12/13R are some of the most common KRAS mutations but G12D and V dominate colorectal and pancreatic cancers which is the largest and what we are targeting in this proposal. This work involves breakthrough technology which can target hard to treat KRAS mutations such as G12D and G12V where there are no currently approved drugs to treat this deadly disease.

Coccidioidomycosis is a significant source of morbidity, mortality and cost within endemic regions. Disease presentation can range from asymptomatic to life threatening disseminated disease in immunocompromised individuals. It is also estimated that between 15%- 30% of community acquired pneumonia is attributable to coccidioidomycosis within endemic regions. Those on immunosuppressive therapies, such as those receiving organ transplants, are at risk for severe Coccidioides infections. The development of an ex vivo cytokine release assay has several potential benefits to aid in the diagnosis, management and distribution of coccidioidomycosis. It could be used to test for previous infection in populations or in individuals. This use could help establish prevalence in geographic areas and determining the measures to take before beginning immunosuppressive therapy. The test could also have prognostic value, as development of a lasting cellular immune response has been associated with positive outcomes. The presence or absence of an adaptive cellular immune response and the ability to reliably monitor it will be critical to the development and monitoring of individuals that will receive a future coccidioidomycosis vaccine.",16284884 (contact),"HOLBROOK, ERIC  (contact)","RITCHIE, ALEC",2023-08-01,2026-07-31,Academic Medical Centers;Acute;acute infection;Antibodies;Antifungal Therapy;Antigens;Area;arid land;Arizona;Biological Assay;Blood specimen;care costs;Caring;Cell Survival;Cellular Immunity;Characteristics;climate change;Clinical;clinical care;Coccidioides;Coccidioides immitis;Coccidioides posadasii;Coccidioidomycosis;community acquired pneumonia;cost;cytokine;Data;Dedications;Delayed Hypersensitivity;desert fever;Detection;detection assay;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;diagnostic development;Diagnostic tests;Disease;Epidemiology;Evaluation;fungus;Future;Geographic Locations;geographic population;Goals;Grant;Health Care Costs;high risk;Hour;Hypersensitivity skin testing;Immune response;Immunity;Immunocompromised Host;immunological status;immunosuppressed;Immunosuppression;Incidence;Individual;Infection;Interferons;Laboratories;latent infection;Life;Marketing;Measures;Methods;Monitor;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality;North America;novel;novel diagnostics;Occupations;Organ Transplantation;Outcome;pathogen;Patient Care;Patients;Performance;Persons;Phase;Physicians;Population;post-market;predictive modeling;Predictive Value;Prevalence;Preventive;prognostic;prognostic value;prototype;Public Health;Reaction;Recombinants;recruit;response;Risk;risk mitigation;risk stratification;ROC Curve;screening;Screening procedure;Serodiagnoses;Serology test;Serum;Shipping;Solid;Source;South America;Specificity;Standardization;stem cells;Stratification;Stress;T-Lymphocyte;Temperature;Testing;Therapeutic immunosuppression;tool;Travel;Tuberculosis;United States;Universities;vaccine trial;Vaccines;Whole Blood,Development of Coccidioides Cytokine Release Assay,152654,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-DCAI-E(13)],NA,NA,4,656761,262704,983736,NA
