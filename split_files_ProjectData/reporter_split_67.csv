In addition to the instructions carried in our DNA for making normal cellular proteins, we have many stretches of DNA in our genome that encode retrotransposons, which are similar to retroviruses, but they don’t infect other cells. A special ability of retrotransposons is that they can take copies of their DNA and insert those copies into new locations in our genome. This process can create mutations in our DNA, leading to cancer and other diseases. In addition, retrotransposon DNA, just like our DNA, makes proteins. Unfortunately, we know very little about the effects of these retrotransposon proteins in our cells, but we know that many types of diseased cells make much more of these proteins than healthy cells. Retrotransposon proteins also increase in cells as we age. The diseases associated with increased retrotransposon proteins include neurodegeneration, autoimmune disease, and others. The primary reason we know so little about retrotransposon proteins and their effects in our cells is because we lack reliable methods to study them. The lack of methods to study these proteins arises from the fact that there are so many copies of retrotransposon DNA in our genome, which makes conventional DNA editing technologies unfeasible. We propose to develop a novel method to eliminate retrotransposon proteins using molecules called “nanobodies”, which can be modified and introduced into cells to eliminate specific proteins. We can also use nanobodies to track retrotransposon proteins in cells to see where they go and what other proteins they interact with. Developing this new system will advance our ability to study and understand the effects of retrotransposon proteins on our health and how they influence aging and disease.",12232541 (contact);16311865,"COOK, PAMELA  (contact);DRUMMOND, JAMES","BARNES, CHARLES ASHLEY",2024-08-01,2026-07-31,Activities of Daily Living;Affect;Affinity;Age;Aging;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis;Antibodies;Antigens;Ataxia Telangiectasia;autism spectrum disorder;Autoimmune Diseases;Bacteriophages;Binding;Biological;Brain;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Extracts;Cell Line;Cell Physiology;Cells;chromatin remodeling;Chromosomal Rearrangement;Codon Nucleotides;Complementary DNA;Complex;cooking;Development;Disease;Disease Progression;DNA;Drug Industry;Embryonic Development;enzyme activity;Epilepsy;experience;experimental study;Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Engineering;Genetic Transcription;Genome;Genomic DNA;Goals;Health;Homeostasis;Human;Human Genome;Immobilization;Immunologist;Immunoprecipitation;In Vitro;Inflammation;Instruction;Interferons;Intrabody;Kinetics;knock-down;Knock-out;knockout gene;Length;Libraries;Lipids;Location;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammalian Cell;MCF7 cell;Mediating;Methods;MicroRNAs;Modeling;Monitor;mRNA sequencing;Multienzyme Complexes;Mutation;nanobodies;Nerve Degeneration;neuropathology;novel;novel strategies;Nucleic Acids;Open Reading Frames;Parkinson Disease;Pathogenesis;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Peptides;Phage Display;Phenotype;Physiology;Plasmids;Pregnancy;Process;protein purification;Proteins;pseudotoxoplasmosis syndrome;Qualifying;Recombinant Proteins;Recombinants;recruit;Reporting;Research Personnel;Retrotransposon;Retroviridae;Rett Syndrome;RNA;RNA Interference;Role;scaffold;Schizophrenia;small hairpin RNA;Small Interfering RNA;Somatic Cell;Spontaneous abortion;Stretching;Suggestion;System;Systemic Lupus Erythematosus;Technology;Testing;Time;Tissues;Transgenic Mice;Translations;ubiquitin-protein ligase;Ubiquitination;Up-Regulation;Vaccines;Western Blotting,Development of a novel model to study the effects of LINE-1 retrotransposons in disease and normal physiology using nanobodies,155785,GCAT,"Genomics, Computational Biology and Technology Study Section[GCAT]",NA,NA,1,125000,51238,176238,NA

Our work will investigate the cause of this brain injury and ultimately, if we are correct, help avoid or decrease it.

Importantly, as for DS-AD, increased APP gene dose is necessary for DS-AD-related phenotypes in models. Nevertheless, existing models fail to demonstrate the amyloid plaques, congophilic angiopathy and tau pathology of DS-AD. Given the importance of these lesions we propose to create them by genetically modifying the TcMAC21 model of DS through humanizing the Aβ sequence in mouse APP and introducing a wild type of human Tau transgene. We will seek internal validation in Aim 1 and external validation in Aim 2. Go/NoGo criteria for internal validation in Aim 1 and milestones for both Aims are defined.

This can be seen through Nobel prize-winning work on asymmetric hydrogenation, metathesis, and C-C coupling reactions. There remains a conscious effort to produce enantioselective transformations that occur with high selectivity and atom-economy in order to furnish enantioenriched biomolecules. By use of transition metal catalysts, chemists have uncovered the functionalization of C-H bonds that previously were deemed inert. A particular motif of interest for small-molecule and natural product design are nitrogen-containing heterocycles. These strained ring systems such as cyclopropenes, azetidines, and cyclobutanes, all have been exploited in medicinal chemistry for their physicochemical properties and applications as functional group bioisosteres. Our program has a strong interest in utilizing the transformative power of hydroacylation—a process where C-H bond activation occurs with C-C bond formation, to introduce a creative method for resolving chiral strained rings.
