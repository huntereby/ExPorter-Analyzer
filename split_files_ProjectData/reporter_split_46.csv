The only protein toxin secreted from Hp, which is called the Vacuolating Cytotoxin, assists the bacterium in establishing infection within the stomach and contributes to the severity of gastric disease. Studies to identify the detailed mechanism by which this toxin interacts with and enters gastric cells will, not only provide additional insights into how Hp infection leads to gastric disease but will also provide necessary clues for future work to mitigate the effects of the toxin during bacterial infection within the human stomach, using structural-based drug design, building upon knowledge obtained from completing the studies proposed in this application.",1860793 (contact),"BLANKE, STEVEN R.

Obesity, insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia all precede the diagnosis of T2D and are long known to promote inflammation and ultimately lead to microvascular complications in adults. More recently, research has identified brain-related complications in adult-onset T2D, including reduced regional brain structure and function, impaired cognition, and increased lifetime risk for Alzheimer’s disease. Alarmingly, an increasing number of children and adolescents are being diagnosed with T2D, likely due to the growing prevalence and earlier onset of obesity. Youth-onset T2D appears to have a more aggressive course than adult-onset T2D, with early onset and rapid increase in complications. In addition, a few small studies of youth-onset T2D have reported robust differences in regional brain structure and cognition, suggesting that brain effects may follow the same aggressive course as the more typical complications. Unfortunately, little is known about the risk factors associated with alterations in brain structure and function in youth with T2D.

Building on these promising results, we will conduct a trial that will assess the clinical benefit of blocking Hsp90 using onalespib along with chemoradiation in brain tumors and which bears promise of providing a new treatment option for patients with glioblastoma as well as providing valuable new information related to whether onalespib can block its targets in tumor tissue that can benefit studies in other cancers which are exploring the effects of Onalespib.",7017702 (contact);9807245,"PUDUVALLI, VINAY K (contact);SAMPATH, DEEPA","UNDALE, ANITA H",2019-01-01,2025-07-31,Address;Adjuvant;Adult;Affect;Aftercare;aggressive therapy;Alkylating Agents;angiogenesis;Animal Model;Animals;antitumor effect;blood-brain barrier crossing;Brain Neoplasms;Bypass;cancer cell;Cancer Center;Cell Line;Cell Survival;Cells;chemoradiation;chemotherapy;Chemotherapy and/or radiation;Client;Clinical;Clinical Trials;co-clinical trial;Combination Drug Therapy;Complex;conventional therapy;Correlative Study;CRISPR/Cas technology;cytotoxic;Data;Defense Mechanisms;Development;Development Plans;DNA;DNA Repair;DNA Repair Gene;Drug Kinetics;ds-DNA;efficacy evaluation;efficacy trial;Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor;epidermal growth factor receptor VIII;Evolution;Funding;Future;Generations;Glioblastoma;Glioma;glioma cell line;Grant;Growth;Heat shock proteins;Heat-Shock Proteins 90;Heat-Shock Response;Heterogeneity;HSP 90 inhibition;Human;improved;improved outcome;In Vitro;in vivo;Individual;inhibitor;insight;Institution;Invaded;knock-down;Malignant neoplasm of brain;Malignant Neoplasms;Maximum Tolerated Dose;Mediating;Mediator;member;Methylation;MGMT gene;Microdialysis;migration;Mismatch Repair;Modeling;Molecular Chaperones;mouse model;Mus;neoplastic cell;Newly Diagnosed;Normal Cell;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;novel therapeutics;Oncogenic;Oncology;Oncoproteins;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;overexpression;Pathway interactions;patient subsets;Patients;Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacodynamics;pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics;Phase;phase 2 study;Phase I Clinical Trials;phase I trial;phase II trial;Plasma;Positioning Attribute;pre-clinical;Primary Brain Neoplasms;Process;protein complex;Protein Family;Proteins;radiation effect;Radiation therapy;Radiation-Sensitizing Agents;Randomized;Recurrence;Recurrent tumor;Resistance;resistance mechanism;response;Role;Sampling;Schedule;Serum;Signal Transduction;Slice;Specimen;stem cells;Stress;temozolomide;therapy outcome;therapy resistant;Tissues;Toxic effect;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing;Treatment Failure;trial planning;tumor;tumor growth;tumor heterogeneity;Tumor Tissue;Up-Regulation;Zebrafish,A Novel Hsp90 Inhibitor as a Chemo and Radiosensitizer in Adults with Glioblastoma,235673,ZCA1,ZCA1-RPRB-F(O2),NA,NA,6,350159,191486,541645,NA

Based on a novel pipeline that we called Spliced_immuneTargetFinder, we identified splice variants of cell surface proteins highly expressed in AML and we aim to investigate the relevance of these targets, opening new avenues for AML pathogenesis and treatment.",11085824 (contact),"PERNA, FABIANA  (contact)","SOMMERS, CONNIE L",2023-08-01,2025-07-31,Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia;Acute Myelocytic Leukemia;acute myeloid leukemia cell;Address;Affect;Alternative Splicing;Antibodies;Antibody-drug conjugates;Antigen Targeting;Antigens;Apoptosis;Area;Biological;Biological Assay;Biology;cancer cell;candidate validation;CAR T cell therapy;CD34 gene;Cell Fractionation;Cell Line;Cell membrane;Cell Proliferation;Cell surface;Cell Surface Proteins;Cells;chimeric antigen receptor;chimeric antigen receptor T cells;Clinical;clinical application;clinical practice;Code;combinatorial;comparison control;Custom;data integration;Data Set;Development;diagnostic tool;Digestion;Disease;DNA Sequence Alteration;efficacy evaluation;Engineering;Epigenetic Process;epigenomics;Event;extracellular;Flow Cytometry;Fostering;founder mutation;Future;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Genome;Genomics;Goals;Hematopoietic Neoplasms;Hematopoietic stem cells;IL3RA gene;immune modulating agents;immunodeficiency;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;In Vitro;knock-down;Laboratories;Lead;lead candidate;leukemia;leukemia treatment;Leukemic Cell;leukemogenesis;loss of function;Lymphoma;Malignant Neoplasms;Messenger RNA;Methods;Modality;Molecular;Multiple Myeloma;Mus;mutant;Mutate;Mutation;Myeloproliferative disease;new therapeutic target;NK cell therapy;Normal tissue morphology;novel;Oncogenes;Outcome;Pathogenesis;patient prognosis;Patients;Peptide Hydrolases;Phase I Clinical Trials;Post-Translational Protein Processing;protein expression;Protein Isoforms;Proteins;Proteome;Recurrence;Refractory;Relapse;RNA Splicing;Role;Safety;Sampling;selective expression;Shapes;small hairpin RNA;Solid Neoplasm;solute;Spliceosomes;SRSF2 gene;Stains;Surface;Surface Antigens;Survival Rate;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing;Translations;Tumor Burden;tumor immunology;Umbilical Cord Blood;Variant;Viral;Work,Alternatively spliced cell surface proteins as drivers of leukemogenesis and targets for immunotherapy,280367,ZCA1,ZCA1-SRB-A(J1)S,NA,NA,2,162550,57250,219800,NA

The inability to properly respond to DNA damage severely reduces organismal fitness and leads to a number of deleterious human disorders, such as premature aging, cancer, neuro-developmental diseases, and infertility. Further, multiple therapeutic approaches currently in development, including stem cell reprogramming and genome editing strategies, are strongly inhibited by the p53 pathway, and recent evidence suggests that many “successful” stem cell reprogramming events actually have accidentally inactivated this key checkpoint. Therefore, a vigorous examination of the complex gene networks controlled by p53 is timely and prudent.

Once a universally fatal diagnosis, dramatic improvements in three staged palliative operations now allow the single right ventricle (RV) to functionally support the total circulation. Despite these strides in medical care, the mortality rate of these infants remains as high as 25 to 35% during the first year of life and continues with a high mortality rate for the rest of their life. High mortality may in part be related to RV performance in these challenging infants. The major objective of the proposed study is to assess for the first time in a single blinded randomized control trial (RCT), whether intramyocardial injection of MSCs is beneficial for HLHS patients. The study is randomized so that during the Stage II operation, half the patients will receive MSC treatment and the other half will receive standard of care.

Current immunosuppressive strategies rely primarily on broad pharmacologic inhibition of lymphocyte function, which is incompletely effective at preventing rejection while increasing the risk for infection and tumors. Thus, new approaches for specific and durable allograft-specific immunosuppression are critically needed. We propose to utilize a pMHCII-based allogeneic 5-module chimeric antigen receptor-cytotoxic T cell (5MCAR-CTL) system to target and eliminate alloreactive T cells.

Information and insights gained from this project will help us better understand the biological chemistry of iron, so that we can learn from Nature to create a more efficient and healthier society and perhaps alleviate the damage from cancer and other diseases that occurs when some of these enzymes fail.",1932793 (contact),"CRAMER, STEPHEN P.

Such data can provide unique illumination into factors on where we live, work, and play which can be used to better understand and address health disparities across noncommunicable disease, infectious disease and injuries in the Kenyan context. However, the data are often unstructured and can have complex relationships with health outcomes, making the use of modern data science approaches critical. DSSD leverages strong investment across biomedical, public health, data science and artificial intelligence investment at both partners (NYU School of Medicine is 11th in the nation for NIH funding, NYU is home of the AI-now institute and Moi University has a strong NIH funding record) as well as a broader network of academic, industrial and non-governmental organizations (IBM, Deep Learning Indaba, DataKind, AI.Kenya and Aga Khan University Nairobi and Karachi), opening a wide pool of potential, strong trainees from both data science and health backgrounds. To develop capacity, priority will be given to Moi affiliates, Kenyan citizens and then others from anywhere in Africa while also prioritizing diversity. A complementary team of 23 mentors at NYU and Moi committed to training and career development will offer resources across social determinants, biomedical sciences, statistics, epidemiology, data management, analytics and ethics. First, the program will provide long-term development of a cohort of PhD, postdoctoral and Faculty fellow trainees who will benefit from interdisciplinary training that carefully layers a core set of competencies in data science across data management and wrangling, prediction and analytics and data communication and ethics, with didactic and experiential training in social determinants as well as best practices in responsible conduct of research, reproducibility and community-engaged, ethical data science at NYU. Second, the program will leverage international standard biostatistics and informatics faculty and programming at Moi with trainees equipped in advanced data science coursework at NYU, to expand the base of local expertise and capacity in data science by developing MSc and PhD data science tracks at the Institute for Biomedical Informatics and Biostatistics programs at Moi University within 5 years. Finally, continuing education opportunities and networking will occur through workshops bringing together experts in health and data science in Kenya and surrounding areas. Programs will be evaluated annually by our Internal Advisory Board and Training Advisory Committee.

Thus, bleeding in severe HA-patients (HAPs) is currently prevented by regular infusions of a therapeutic (t) FVIII protein (tFVIII) product.

Although there are several FDA- approved ALK inhibitor pills available for treating this disease, essentially all ALK-mutant lung cancers will develop resistance to these drugs. We have developed a novel ALK cancer vaccine which extends lifespan in mouse models of ALK-mutant lung cancer.

Finally, simultaneous population recordings across brain regions involved in sound localization will provide a wide-ranging perspective of how populations interact across brain regions involved in sound localization.

Using a novel technology for quantifying the presence of ß cell DNA (based on ß cell-specific methylation patterns), we have found that the pancreas of patients with T1D is enriched for cells that contain the unmistakable DNA methylation signature of ß cells, yet do not stain for insulin, as well as experiments using a genetically engineered mouse model for interferon-driven islet inflammation suggest that loss of insulin is associated with inflammatory cytokines.
