Over the past forty years, research on the mechanisms of action of addictive drugs have focused on pharmacology and behavioral pharmacology studies. With the rapid growth in molecular and systems neuroscience in the last two decades and the completion of the human genome more than a decade ago, integration between behavioral or physiological responses and molecular, genetic and cellular responses to addictive drugs is increasingly possible, opening new avenues for the understanding of drug use and drug abuse. Together with the development of increasingly sophisticated preclinical models of the disorder in rodents, amalgamation of these disciplines into contemporary research into the biobehavioral basis of the vulnerability to develop drug addiction requires a profound appreciation for the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. The theme of the proposed lecture course is to provide young and emerging scientists with the most up-to-date and exhaustive information on how tissues, cells and genes respond to drugs of abuse differently between individuals across species. This week-long residential course is targeted to both new and experienced investigators, and combines formal presentations and informal discussions to convey the merits and excitement of behavioral, cellular and molecular approaches to drug addiction research. The course will stress the significance of this approach not only to the most costly neuropsychiatric disorder, addiction, but its applicability to learning, memory, and other disciplines of neuroscience. Research on the psychological, neural, cellular and molecular and cellular changes that occur in response to drugs is critical for clarifying whether adaptive processes are diverse for each stage of addiction and for each drug of abuse. Ultimately, new treatments for these disorders are likely to emerge from a better understanding of the processes that go awry in vulnerable individuals during the transition from controlled to compulsive drug seeking and taking.",7039607 (contact),"STEWART, DAVID J.

PARP- mediated ADP-ribosylation has widespread roles in fundamental cellular processes: from DNA repair and transcriptional regulation to the regulation of protein stability and mRNA translational regulation. PARPs are clinically relevant, and small molecule inhibitors are sought-after drug targets. Currently, there are several FDA-approved inhibitors of the founding member PARP1, which have demonstrated tremendous clinical success in the treatment of certain forms of ovarian and breast cancer. In recent years other, lesser-studied PARP family members (e.g. PARP7 and PARP14) as well as enzymes that recognize and reverse ADP- ribosylation, have emerged as exciting new therapeutic targets for cancer and inflammatory diseases.

Uterine fibroids (UF) are a highly common and costly gynecologic condition that disproportionately affect Black women with regard to incidence, severity, treatment, and outcomes. Recent data suggest that substantial Black/White disparities in UF exist within VA. As one-third of women Veterans using VA health care are Black and this proportion is increasing, understanding the drivers of these disparities within VA is of critical importance. This study will use mixed methods to investigate mechanisms underlying Black/White disparities in UF-related outcomes in VA, including modifiable differences by race in pathways to treatment and interactions with the healthcare system. This work addresses multiple HSR&D priority areas including women’s health, health equity, and healthcare access and will make a substantial impact by informing development of patient-centered interventions to eliminate disparities.

The cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) was initially recognized as a xenobiotic enzyme that metabolizes xenobiotics. CYP1B1 is better known for its extrahepatic functions, whereas the role of CYP1B1 in the liver fibrosis has not been reported. The goal of this study is to test our hypothesis that CYP1B1 has a cell-type specific role in liver fibrosis. We hypothesize that CYP1B1 has a cell-type specific role in HSC activation and liver fibrosis. Specifically, we hypothesize that HSC and/or HEP ablation or pharmacological inhibition of Cyp1b1 inhibits HSC activation and liver fibrosis. Mechanistically, inhibition of Cyp1b1 attenuates HSC activation by suppressing the intestinal trehalase, leading to the accumulation of trehalose, a non-reducing disaccharide that inhibits HSC activation and liver fibrosis. Our study will uncover a previously unrecognized endobiotic function of CYP1B1 in liver fibrosis mediated by the liver-intestine organ crosstalk and the trehalose metabolite. Pharmacological inhibition of Cyp1b1 and/or the use of trehalose represent novel strategies for the clinical management of liver fibrosis.",7365315 (contact),"XIE, WEN  (contact)","DOO, EDWARD",2023-04-15,2027-03-31,Ablation;antifibrotic treatment;Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons;Attenuated;Autophagocytosis;bile duct;Cell Separation;cell type;chronic liver injury;Clinical Management;Cytochrome P450;Data;Disaccharides;Enzymes;Estrogens;Extracellular Matrix Proteins;Extrahepatic;FDA approved;Fibrosis;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Heme;Hepatic;Hepatic Stellate Cell;Hepatocyte;Human;in vivo;inhibitor;Intestines;Knock-out;Knockout Mice;Ligation;Liver;Liver Cirrhosis;Liver Failure;Liver Fibrosis;Mediating;Metabolic;metabolomics;Mixed Function Oxygenases;Molecular;Molecular Biology;Mus;Myofibroblast;NADP;nonalcoholic steatohepatitis;novel;novel strategies;Organ;Pathogenesis;Pharmaceutical Preparations;pharmacologic;Portal Hypertension;prevent;Prevention;Primary carcinoma of the liver cells;Production;promoter;Reporting;Retinoids;Role;Testing;Testosterone;Thioacetamide;Trehalase;Trehalose;Wilms Tumor Genes;WT1 gene;Xenobiotics,Cellular and Metabolic Basis of the Role of CYP1B1 in Liver Fibrosis,135538,XNDA,Xenobiotic and Nutrient Disposition and Action Study Section[XNDA],NA,NA,2,261118,138989,400107,NA

Discovery of the fat-derived hormone leptin generated excitement as a weight loss therapy until it became clear that because of obesity-associated leptin resistance, leptin does not reliably lower body weight in humans with obesity. Oxytocin (OT) is an attractive therapeutic agent to treat obesity because it reduces body weight in diet-induced obese (DIO) rodents even in the presence of leptin resistance, and elicits cardioprotective effects in genetically obese rodents. We will determine if activation of hypothalamic OT neurons elicits cardioprotective effects in DIO mice and whether elevations of heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) in DIO rodents are ameliorated by systemic OT alone or as an adjunct with beta-3 receptor agonists.

A critical strategy in the battle against DM is the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), an evidence-based intervention that significantly delays or prevents Type 2 diabetes through the promotion of diet change, exercise and modest weight loss. However, weight loss from the DPP among AAs is about half that of White participants, and suboptimal AA attendance is a critical contributor. We propose to conduct a study that will address social determinants (SD) that challenge DPP attendance with underserved African Americans from a safety net hospital. We will examine DPP attendance and weight loss with participants randomized to 3 groups: standard DPP, a culturally-tailored DPP to address acceptability, and a culturally-tailored DPP enhanced to address socioeconomic-related barriers to DPP participation. This novel study is the first to tailor the DPP to address SD cultural and socioeconomic barriers that limit DPP attendance and reduce its effectiveness on outcomes. The proposed multidimensional, SD tailored DPP has great potential to be a feasible and scalable model to reduce DM risks among urban, African Americans and ultimately reduce DM disparities.",9017092 (contact),"BERKLEY-PATTON, JANNETTE YVONNE (contact)","ARTIS DICKERSON, SHAVON",2020-04-01,2026-03-31,"Address;Affect;African American population;Amputation;arm;Behavior;Black church;Blood Pressure;Body Weight decreased;Cardiovascular Diseases;Caring;Clinical;Communities;community engaged approach;Community Health Aides;community setting;comorbidity;cost;Diabetes Mellitus;diabetes prevention program;Diet;Dimensions;Disparity;Dose;Economics;Effectiveness;Evidence based intervention;Exercise;experience;Face;financial incentive;flexibility;follow-up;Food;Glycosylated hemoglobin A;Health;health disparity;Health education;Health Food;Health Resources;Hospitals;Hybrids;Improve Access;improved;improved outcome;Intervention;intervention program;Language;lens;lifestyle intervention;Literature;Low income;Mediator;Modeling;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;novel;Obesity;Office Visits;Outcome;Overweight;Participant;Patients;Persons;Physical activity;Physicians;Pilot Projects;Population;prevent;primary outcome;process evaluation;Randomized;randomized trial;Randomized, Controlled Trials;Religiosity;Reporting;Resources;Risk;Risk Factors;safety net;secondary outcome;social culture;social determinants;social health determinants;Social support;sociocultural determinant;socioeconomics;success;Testing;Text;theories;Time;translational study;Translations;Visit;weight loss program;Work",Addressing Social Determinants of Health to Improve Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Among Underserved African Americans,124664,CLHP,Community-Level Health Promotion Study Section[CLHP],NA,NA,5,422007,204751,626758,NA

To improve such treatments, a better understanding of the long-lasting changes in neuronal communication that occur following chronic alcohol exposure is critical.  It has been theorized that the transition from casual to compulsive drinking is driven by poor decision-making, a phenomenon particularly strong during adolescence and whose influence diminishes with age. The initial loss of control over alcohol consumption may be caused by the weakening of the frontocortical-reflective system, and by the concomitant strengthening of the amygdala-impulsive system.  The objective of this project is to test the existence of a cellular correlate of this theory in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) by examining how nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons compute competing cognitive and emotional information coming from the prefrontal and amygdala regions, respectively, and how binge alcohol drinking controls this phenomenon.

Building on prior data supporting our hypotheses about MBSR, GAD, and sex differences in fear and extinction neurocircuitry as well as novel whole brain functional connectivity analyses, we propose a rigorous neuroimaging study to examine how MBSR works, focusing on MBSR induced neural mechanisms that drive response to MBSR in patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and the degree to which sex differences in MBSR response are explained by sex differences in these mechanisms, in line with moving mind body interventions for common problems such as GAD towards precision medicine.",12624587;6099787 (contact),"RAIO, CANDACE M;SIMON, NAOMI M (contact)","QUINLAN, ERIN BURKE",2021-07-15,2026-04-30,Adherence;Affect;Amygdaloid structure;Animals;Anxiety;anxiety reduction;Attention;attentional control;Awareness;Behavioral;Brain;Brain region;Clinical;Clinical effectiveness;conditioned fear;Conditioned Stimulus;Coupling;Cues;Data;Diagnosis;Education;emotion regulation;Emotional;Emotions;evidence base;Exhibits;Expectancy;Extinction;follow-up;Fright;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Future;Generalized Anxiety Disorder;Hippocampus;Human;improved;insight;Intervention;Knowledge;Learning;learning extinction;Literature;Measures;Memory;men;Methodology;Methods;Mind-Body Intervention;mind/body;mindfulness-based stress reduction;National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health;neural;neural circuit;neural network;neurobiological mechanism;neuroimaging;neuromechanism;Neuronal Plasticity;novel;Outcome;Participant;Patients;Phase;precision medicine;Prediction of Response to Therapy;predictive modeling;Prefrontal Cortex;Premenopause;Primary Care;Process;Randomized;reduce symptoms;Research;research and development;response;Rest;restoration;rumination;Science;sex;Sex Differences;Standardization;Stress;stress reduction;success;symptomatic improvement;Synapses;Testing;therapy development;Time;treatment response;Woman;Work,Elucidating Neural Mechanisms and Sex Differences in Response to Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction in Generalized Anxiety Disorder,11257,NPAS,"Neural Basis of Psychopathology, Addictions and Sleep Disorders Study Section[NPAS]",NA,NA,4,408120,283643,691763,NA

We will characterize the pathways leading to excessive MAVS signaling and the mechanisms by which PINK1 limits MAVS aggregation.

This study aims to elucidate the effects of APOE RNA expression in AD. We have observed that not all APOE mRNA extend to their full length to produce the apoE protein. This anomaly may be caused by the presence of APOE's ε2/ε3/ε4 allele variants that alter RNA transcription through epigenetic mechanisms. We hypothesize that APOE full- length mRNA is the only functional RNA for producing apoE protein and that ε2/ε3/ε4 can differentially modulate production of functional APOE mRNA to modify AD risk. Our short-term goals are to establish an association between the expressions of APOE RNAs, ε2/ε3/ε4 alleles, and AD risk; decipher the molecular mechanisms that regulate APOE RNAs production.

In some patients, NASH leads to liver failure or cancer. Women of reproductive age have lower rates of NASH. However, this protection is lost after menopause when NASH rates equal or exceed those for men. There is evidence that estrogen, in combination with growth hormone (GH), work together at the level of the liver to protect both men and women against NASH.
