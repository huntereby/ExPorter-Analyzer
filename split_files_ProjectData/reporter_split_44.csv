Although anti-retroviral therapy has reduced the risk of cryptococcal meningitis (CM) in resourced areas, CM continues to ravage HIV-infected patients in Africa, Asia and other areas, even with increased availability of anti-retroviral and anti-fungal therapy. The 6- month survival of CM in resource-limited settings is 45-55%. This is worse than glioblastoma multiforme (66% 2-year survival). At present, there is no way to identify patients who will develop cryptococcosis. The goal of this application is to identify a risk profile to help determine which patients are at risk for CM.

To facilitate early and accurate detection of infected wounds at the POC, we propose a smartphone-based screener that jointly analyzes a combination of photographs and a thermal image of a wound using deep learning methods. Our proposed system will detect infections in both debrided and undebrided wounds and recommend evidence-based best care and when to refer infected wounds to experts, standardizing the quality of care provided by non-expert wound caregivers. 1|Page",14301060 (contact);12509014,"AGU, EMMANUEL  (contact);GIATSIDIS, GIORGIO","LASH, TIFFANI BAILEY",2022-09-01,2026-05-31,Accident and Emergency department;accurate diagnosis;Affect;Agreement;Algorithms;Amputation;Appointment;Bacteria;beneficiary;Blood Tests;Caregivers;Caring;Cellular Phone;chronic wound;Classification;Clinic;clinical application;clinical decision support;cost;Data Set;Debridement;deep learning;Detection;detector;diabetic;Diabetic Foot Ulcer;Diagnosis;digital health;Emergency Care;Emergency medical service;evidence base;evidence based guidelines;Excision;foot;healing;Home;Home visitation;Hospitals;Image;Image Analysis;improved;Infection;infection risk;Lead;Lighting;limb amputation;Machine Learning;machine learning algorithm;Manuals;Measures;Medicare;Methods;Modeling;novel;Operative Surgical Procedures;Patients;Pattern;Performance;Persons;point of care;Positioning Attribute;pressure;Process;Quality of Care;Quality of life;Recommendation;Recurrence;Redness;Reporting;Research;Resolution;response;Running;Sensitivity and Specificity;Sepsis;Services;Site;smartphone application;Specificity;Standardization;standardized care;success;System;Temperature;Testing;Thermometers;Time;Tissues;Transportation;Trauma;Ulcer;validation studies;Venous;Visit;Visiting Nurse;Visual;wasting;Work;wound;wound care;wound healing;Wound Infection;wound treatment,Smartphone-based wound infection screener and care recommender by combining thermal images and photographs using deep learning methods,31910,CIDH,Clinical Informatics and Digital Health Study Section[CIDH],NA,NA,3,397004,161739,558743,NA

After surgery, patients suffer from pain, fatigue, and disturbed sleep for weeks to months and up to 32% of patients develop postoperative complications which lead to unplanned readmissions and a 6-fold increase in mortality risk.

The use of such algorithms for cardiothoracic surgery patients will have significant public health impact, potentially enabling earlier detection of postoperative complications, greater reduction in the severity of complications, earlier outpatient intervention that can improve recovery, and/or greater decreases in unplanned hospital readmissions.",12679678;11371047 (contact),"LI, XIAO ;YANG, CHI-FU  (contact)","LIU, SONGTAO",2022-07-01,2027-06-30,algorithm development;Algorithms;Biometry;Cardiac Surgery procedures;Cardiovascular system;Caring;Classification;Complication;cost;COVID-19;COVID-19 detection;COVID-19 early detection;critical period;Data;Detection;Development;Early Diagnosis;experience;Family member;Fatigue;Frequencies;Future;Goals;Health;Health Care Costs;Health Personnel;Health Status;Heart Diseases;high risk;Home;hospital readmission;Hospitals;improved;improved outcome;innovation;Intervention;Learning;Link;Lung;Lung Diseases;Lyme Disease;Machine Learning;machine learning algorithm;Methods;Monitor;mortality;mortality risk;novel;operation;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Outpatients;Pain;Patient Discharge;Patient Monitoring;Patient Outcomes Assessments;Patients;Pattern;personalized care;personalized predictions;Physiological;Pilot Projects;Postoperative Care;Postoperative Complications;Postoperative Period;postoperative recovery;preemptive intervention;Public Health;Quality of life;randomized trial;real time monitoring;Recovery;Research;Resolution;Severities;Signal Transduction;Sleep disturbances;Symptoms;System;Telemedicine;Testing;Thoracic Surgical Procedures;Time;Validation;Viral;Visit;wearable data;wearable device,Using Wearable Technology to Assess Recovery and Detect Post-Operative Complications Following Cardiothoracic Surgery,159170,BTSS,"Bioengineering, Technology and Surgical Sciences Study Section[BTSS]",NA,NA,3,530858,156282,687140,NA

We identified Heat shock protein (HSP)-70 as being highly expressed by models of both PTCL and CTCL, developed a panel of antibodies of which one, known as clone 239-87, specifically recognizes HSP70 only on cancerous T- cells but not normal T-cells, and found that this antibody showed promising activity against both PTCL and CTCL models as an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), and as a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) guided T-cell. Further studies are proposed that will broaden our understanding of the role of HSP70 in T-cell lymphomas, study the activity of various HSP70-targeted ADCs and CAR T-cells both alone, and in rationally designed combinations against cell lines, and validate the efficacy of the best approaches in vivo, with the ultimate goal of moving at least one of these to the clinic to improve outcomes of the many patients with PTCL and/or CTCL who need new treatment options.",11101912;1886333 (contact),"IQBAL, JAVEED ;ORLOWSKI, ROBERT ZYGMUNT (contact)","HU, ZHANG-ZHI",2022-07-20,2027-06-30,Address;Adoptive Cell Transfers;African;African ancestry;Amanitins;anaplastic lymphoma kinase;Antibodies;Antibody-drug conjugates;Area;Asian;B-Cell Lymphomas;B-Cell NonHodgkins Lymphoma;B-Lymphocytes;beta-Chemokines;Binding;Biological Assay;biomarker driven;Blood;cancer cell;Cancerous;CAR T cell therapy;Cell Line;Cell model;Cell surface;Cells;Cellular biology;chemokine receptor;chimeric antigen receptor;chimeric antigen receptor T cells;Classification;Clinic;Clinical;Codon Nucleotides;Country;Cutaneous;Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma;cytotoxicity;Data;Deacetylase;Development;Diagnosis;differential expression;Disease;Dose;Doxorubicin;Drug Approval;Effectiveness;efficacy evaluation;efficacy validation;Exclusion;experimental study;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profiling;Genetic;Genomic approach;Genomics;Goals;Growth;Heat-Shock Proteins 70;Hematologic Neoplasms;Heterogeneity;Human;Immunophenotyping;improved;improved outcome;In Vitro;in vitro activity;in vitro Model;in vivo;in vivo Model;Incidence;Industry;inhibitor;Interferons;Janus kinase;Ki-1 Large-Cell Lymphoma;kinase inhibitor;Link;lymph nodes;Lymphoma;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediator;Medical;Membrane;Messenger RNA;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Profiling;Monoclonal Antibodies;Morphology;Mus;Mycosis Fungoides;neoplastic;new therapeutic target;Non-Hodgkin&apos;s Lymphoma;non-Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma patients;Normal Cell;Normal tissue morphology;novel;novel therapeutics;Nuclear;Oncogenes;Oncogenic;Outcome;Pathway interactions;patient derived xenograft model;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Pattern;Peripheral;peripheral blood;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physiological;Population;Prognosis;Protein Overexpression;Proteome;Proteomics;rational design;Regimen;Relapse;Research;Role;Sampling;Schedule;Sezary Syndrome;Signal Transduction;Skin;STAT protein;statistics;Subgroup;synergism;System;T cell therapy;T-Cell and NK-Cell Neoplasm;T-Cell Lymphoma;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies;therapeutic target;Thymus Gland;TNFRSF8 gene;transgene expression;translational approach;tumor;United States;Variant;vector;Vorinostat;Work;Xenograft procedure,Role of Heat Shock Protein 70 as a Mediator and Therapeutic Target in T-cell Lymphomas,266612,DT,Developmental Therapeutics Study Section[DT],NA,NA,3,338991,120725,459716,NA

Recent publications indicate that post-ABI castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients significantly benefit from docetaxel, though for a limited time. Our goal is to find ways to prolong the efficacy of docetaxel in post-ABI CRPC patients being treated at the VA. We propose the use of a drug candidate that specifically targets galectin-1, which plays important roles in tumor transformation, tumor cell proliferation, migration, survival and drug resistance.

Create a Project Plan that will document  plans, progress, accomplishments, and setbacks in achieving each program objective. • Objective 2 – Program Administration: Establish the foundational resources, including, but not  limited to, personnel, supplies, training, authority, and agreements, needed to fulfill the project plan. • Objective 3 – Education, Outreach and Technical Assistance: Provide opportunities for education,  outreach, and technical assistance on the Produce Safety Rule and Virginia’s produce regulatory  program to produce farms, prioritizing covered farms. • Objective 4 – Farm Inventory: Establish a complete and accurate inventory of produce farms, that  captures at least the minimum required data elements, which can be used to implement  corresponding objectives. • Objective 5 – Inspection Program: Conduct produce safety rule inspections that focus on quality  and national consistency. Establish an annual inspection work plan that utilizes inspection  frequency and risk-based prioritization. • Objective 6 – Compliance and Enforcement Program: Establish a compliance and enforcement  regulatory program focused on quality and national consistency that utilizes compliance and  enforcement action(s) that will result in the greatest protection of public health. • Objective 7 – Produce Related Event Response Planning and Implementation: Fully integrate with  the Virginia Rapid Response Team to identify, coordinate, and implement produce related  response activities that benefit public health outcomes. Develop specific mechanisms to  coordinate with other local, state, territory, and federal agencies for produce safety activities  where gaps may currently exist. Together, these seven objectives will further enhance the current produce safety regulatory program in Virginia so that high rates of compliance with the FDA’s Produce Safety Rule will be achieved. Additionally, they will encourage the safe production of fruits and vegetables, promote understanding and minimize the risk of serious adverse health consequences or death from consumption of contaminated Virginia grown produce as well as to ensure the further integration into a Nationally Integrated Food Safety System (IFSS). It is anticipated that through education and training along with enforcement and compliance of the FDA Produce Safety Rule, there will be less foodborne illness outbreaks nationwide traced back to raw produce grown in the Commonwealth of Virginia and less illnesses and deaths of Virginia residents consuming locally grown produce.

For instance, in anorexia nervosa, rigid pursuit of weight loss leads to serious physical and psychiatric outcomes, and even death; in obsessive-compulsive disorder rigid compulsive behaviors (e.g., excessive checking, cleaning) lead to severe impairment. In order to ultimately design more effective treatments, this project addresses the critical need to identify distinct biological and behavioral decision-making processes that keep people with anorexia nervosa and other related psychiatric disorders (e.g., obsessive-compulsive disorder) stuck pursuing harmful goals.",11051812 (contact),"HAYNOS, ANN FRANCES (contact)","CHAVEZ, MARK",2022-09-15,2027-05-31,Address;Anorexia Nervosa;Area;Automobile Driving;Behavior;Behavior Control;Behavior Disorders;Behavioral;biobehavior;Biological;Body mass index;Body Weight decreased;Brain;Budgets;Categories;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Clinical;Cognitive;cognitive control;cohort;comparison group;Compulsive Behavior;computational neuroscience;Computer Models;Conflict (Psychology);Corpus striatum structure;cost;Dangerousness;Data;Death Rate;Decision Making;design;Diffusion;Disease;Dorsal;Eating Disorders;Ecological momentary assessment;Economics;effective therapy;executive function;follow-up;Food;Functional disorder;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Future;Goals;habit learning;Habits;Hyperactivity;Impairment;Individual;insight;Internet;Intervention;Interview;Lead;Link;Mental disorders;Metric System;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality risk;neural;neuroeconomics;Neurophysiology - biologic function;Neurosciences;novel;Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder;Outcome;Parietal Lobe;Participant;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Persons;Phenotype;predict clinical outcome;Prefrontal Cortex;Process;prototype;Psychiatric therapeutic procedure;psychologic;Reaction Time;recruit;Research;response;reward circuitry;Rewards;Role;Science;severe psychiatric disorder;Specificity;standard care;Symptoms;System;Testing;Time;Training;translational neuroscience;Weight maintenance regimen,Rule-Based Decision-Making: A Novel Neuroeconomic Mechanism of Anorexia Nervosa,126978,APDA,Adult Psychopathology and Disorders of Aging Study Section[APDA],NA,NA,3,433837,211554,645391,NA
