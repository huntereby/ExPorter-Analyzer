We hypothesize that to widen the use of epigenetic perturbants as potential therapeutics, a new generation of inhibitors needs to be developed with much more specific effects on the transcriptome, corresponding to a paradigm shift from “multigenic” to “oligogenic” HDAC inhibitors. In this application, we propose to develop a novel strategy to identify “oligogenic” HDAC complex inhibitors, investigate how these new compounds affect the transcriptome, and understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these activities, which might in turn help developing a second generation of epigenetic perturbants with improved therapeutic properties.",2094159 (contact),"VIDAL, MARC  (contact)","AMIN, ANOWARUL",2022-02-01,2027-01-31,Address;Affect;anti-cancer;Binding;Biological;Biological Availability;Biological Models;Cancer Death Rates;cancer immunotherapy;cancer type;Cell Line;Cell Physiology;Cells;Complex;Data;Deacetylase;Development;drug discovery;Enzymes;Epigenetic Process;experimental study;FDA approved;Future;gene repression;Generations;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Hematopoietic Neoplasms;Histone Deacetylase;Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor;Human;Human Pathology;immune checkpoint blockade;Immunotherapy;improved;In Vitro;in vivo;inhibitor;Invaded;Investments;Learning;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammalian Cell;Modeling;Molecular;Multiple Myeloma;neoplastic cell;neuroblastoma cell;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;paralogous gene;Pathway interactions;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Phosphotransferases;promoter;Property;protein complex;Proteins;Public Health;Regulation;Reporter;Reporter Genes;Repression;small molecule;small molecule libraries;Specificity;Substrate Specificity;T-Cell Lymphoma;targeted cancer therapy;targeted treatment;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissues;Transcriptional Regulation;transcriptome;transcriptomics;tumorigenesis;tumorigenic;Work;Yeasts,Selective disruption of histone deacetylase complexes using protein interaction modulators,266194,GCAT,"Genomics, Computational Biology and Technology Study Section[GCAT]",NA,NA,3,362988,283131,646119,NA

Some cancers, including lung cancer, have been shown to be susceptible to a novel, oxidative-stress dependent form of cell death, termed ferroptosis, so enhancing ferroptosis may be an alternative therapeutic strategy to target tumors that are resistant to conventional therapy. Using cutting-edge, preclinical mouse models that closely mimic human lung cancer, this work will determine if induction of ferroptosis impedes tumor development and investigate how specific common cancer mutations protect against ferroptosis to promote tumor growth, with the goal of providing deeper insight into a novel mechanism of cell death that can be harnessed for future cancer therapies.",15582994 (contact),"WU, KATHERINE  (contact)","DAMICO, MARK W",2023-04-04,2026-04-03,Address;Antioxidants;Automobile Driving;Buffers;cancer cell;Cancer Etiology;cancer therapy;cancer type;carcinogenesis;Cell Death;Cell Death Induction;Cell Line;Cell Respiration;Cell Survival;Cellular Membrane;Cellular Stress;Cessation of life;Chemicals;chemotherapy;Chemotherapy and/or radiation;Clinical;Clinical Research;Coenzyme Q10;conventional therapy;cost;Data;Development;dietary antioxidant;Disease;Disease Progression;Enzymes;experimental study;Fatty Acids;Fellowship;Future;gain of function;Genes;Genetic;genetic manipulation;Genetic Transcription;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Glutathione;Goals;Growth;Homeostasis;Human;Immunotherapy;improved;In Vitro;in vivo;in vivo Model;insight;interest;Investigation;Iron;iron metabolism;Kinetics;Knowledge;Lipid Peroxidation;Lipid Peroxides;Lipids;Literature;loss of function;Lung Adenocarcinoma;lung cancer cell;macromolecule;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Malignant Neoplasms;Medical;Membrane;Metabolic;Metabolism;metabolomics;Modeling;Molecular;Monitor;mouse model;mutant;Mutate;Mutation;Neoplasm Metastasis;neoplastic cell;novel;Output;oxidation;Oxidation-Reduction;oxidative damage;Oxidative Stress;Pathway interactions;peroxidation;Phosphotransferases;Play;Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids;pre-clinical;Pre-Clinical Model;preclinical study;Predisposition;Production;Prognosis;programs;Proliferating;public health relevance;Publishing;Reactive Oxygen Species;Regulation;Reporting;Resistance;response;Response Elements;Role;Rupture;screening;sensor;Signal Transduction;STK11 gene;Study models;Testing;tetrahydrobiopterin;Therapeutic;therapeutic biomarker;therapeutic target;transcription factor;transcriptomics;Translating;tumor;Tumor Burden;tumor growth;tumor progression;Tumor Promotion;tumorigenesis;United States;Work,Dissecting the role of redox homeostasis and ferroptosis in lung cancer,275258,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-F09A-R(20)L],NA,NA,2,53974,0,53974,NA

Despite many years of hard and clever work, the regulation of latency and reactivation still eludes us. This proposal tests an integrative model in which the efforts to silence the infecting virus by the infected cell are successfully counteracted by the virus in most cells. However, these efforts are not counteracted in the neurons to be latently infected, such that the persistence of the virus in the latent state is secured. Reactivation of latency would then occur when this silencing of the viral genomes is locally disrupted in the domains of the nuclei of the latently infected neuron where the latent genomes sit.

To broaden the application of late-stage functionalization, we are inventing catalysts that have a higher tolerance for pre- existing reactive functionality and effect novel site-selectivity; control over three-dimensional outcomes; and C(sp3)–H cross-couplings with O- , N- , and C-containing complex fragments.  ",3096775 (contact),"WHITE, MARIA  (contact)","YANG, JIONG",2017-05-01,2027-04-30,3-Dimensional;Alcohols;Alkylation;Amination;Area;base;Biological;Biological Process;Carbon;catalyst;chemical synthesis;Chemistry;commercialization;Communities;Complex;Coupling;drug candidate;drug discovery;Electronics;empowerment;Foundations;functional group;Hydrocarbons;Hydrogen Bonding;Individual;Industrialization;innovation;invention;Iron;Ligands;Manganese;metal complex;Metals;Natural Products;novel;Outcome;oxidation;Palladium;Pharmaceutical Preparations;phthalocyanine;physical property;Process;programs;Property;Reaction;scaffold;Site;small molecule;Sulfoxide;Technology;Therapeutic;Work,Selective C(sp3)-H Oxidations and Functionalizations with Tunable Metal Catalysts for Synthesis,122525,MRAB,Maximizing Investigators’ Research Award B Study Section[MRAB],NA,NA,8,370800,178675,549475,NA

Whereas there is general agreement that atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease, multiple large clinical trials of drugs that globally inhibit inflammation have failed to get FDA approval due to them having modest or no beneficial effects on the incidence of a fatal or non-fatal heart attack or stroke, and an increase in lethal infection because patients are immuno-compromised. We postulate that a major reason for the failure of global anti-inflammatory agents is because they inhibit not only detrimental chronic pro-inflammatory responses that exacerbate atherosclerosis, but also evolutionarily conserved beneficial acute inflammatory processes necessary for resistance to infection, resolution of inflammation, and tissue injury-repair processes important for enhancing the stability of atherosclerotic lesions and reducing the chance of rupture or erosion. Studies in this proposal will use novel mouse models and analysis methods to determine if selective inhibition of interleukin- 6 (IL-6) trans signaling, which is believed to be a key mediator of the transition from acute (beneficial) to chronic (detrimental) inflammation, promotes formation of more stable atherosclerotic lesions and a reduced probability of lesion rupture or erosion but without impaired immuno-competence. If so, results would be of major significance in that they would suggest that human clinical trials should focus on testing selective IL-6 trans inhibitors not global inhibitors of IL-6 responses as is currently the case with a recently initiated large Phase 3 clinical trial.",6398572 (contact),"OWENS, GARY K (contact)","HASAN, AHMED A K",2023-04-15,2027-03-31,Acute;Adrenal Cortex Hormones;Adverse effects;Age;Agreement;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Antibodies;Antibody Therapy;Aorta;Apolipoprotein E;Arterial Fatty Streak;Arteries;Atherosclerosis;blood lipid;Cardiovascular system;Cause of Death;Cell Count;Cell Lineage;Cell Separation;cell type;Cells;Cessation of life;Chronic;chronic inflammatory disease;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Collagen;Complex;Coronary artery;Coxibs;cytokine;Development;Diet;Disease;Disease Progression;Dose;Endothelial Cells;Event;expectation;Failure;Family;Fc Receptor;feeding;Frequencies;glycoprotein 130;high risk;Human;IL-6 inhibitor;IL6 gene;IL6ST gene;Immune;immune resistance;Immunocompetence;Immunocompromised Host;immunodeficiency;Impairment;Incidence;indexing;Infection;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Response;inhibitor;injury and repair;insight;Interleukin 6 Receptor;Interleukin-1 beta;Interleukin-1 Receptors;Interleukin-6;Intervention Studies;Investments;Knock-out;LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins;Lesion;Lesion by Stage;Lipids;Macrophage;Maintenance;Mediator;Medicine;Methods;Methotrexate;mouse model;multiplexed imaging;Mus;Myocardial Infarction;Nature;neutralizing antibody;novel;older patient;Paper;pathogen;Pathogenesis;patient population;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase III Clinical Trials;Phenotype;Play;Prevention;primary endpoint;Probability;Process;protective effect;PTPRC gene;Receptor Signaling;Resistance to infection;Resolution;response;Role;Rupture;Safety;Secondary to;Signal Transduction;single-cell RNA sequencing;Smooth Muscle Myocytes;Stroke;systemic inflammatory response;Tamoxifen;Testing;therapeutically effective;tissue injury;tissue repair;Transducers;United States;western diet,Role of IL-6 trans signaling in atherosclerosis development and late-stage pathogenesis,164367,AVI,Atherosclerosis and Vascular Inflammation Study Section[AVI],NA,NA,2,489012,300742,789754,NA

Additionally, TNB students across intersections of racial/ethnic identities and socioeconomic status may be differentially impacted by these policy environments due to unique structural vulnerabilities, although no studies have explored this. The objectives of this project are thus to use unprecedented, national data from over 300 institutions to fill this gap and discern the role of campus policy environment in TNB mental health disparities across intersecting social positions, with the goal of informing campus-level interventions for an increasing and diverse population of TNB college students.",78951665 (contact),"PAGLISOTTI, EVEN  (contact)","SWEENEY, MAGGIE",2024-01-01,2025-05-31,Address;Administrator;Adult;Affect;Area;Attention;Birth;Black race;career;Caring;Categories;Characteristics;cisgender;Classification;Climate;college;Color;Communities;Community Services;Counseling;Data;Data Set;Databases;Disparity;Environment;Epidemiologic Methods;Equity;ethnic identity;Ethnic Origin;experience;Exposure to;Future;Gender;gender affirming care;Gender Identity;Goals;Grant;Health;health disparity;health equity;Health equity research;Health Surveys;high risk;improved;improved outcome;Individual;innovation;Institution;Insurance Coverage;interest;intersectionality;Intervention;Light;Literature;low socioeconomic status;marginalization;Medical;Mental Depression;Mental Health;Mental Health Services;Methods;Mind;minority stress;Modeling;multilevel analysis;multiple data sources;National Institute of Mental Health;nonbinary;novel;Outcome;Pattern;peer;Personal Satisfaction;Policies;Politics;Population Heterogeneity;Professional counselor;Race;racial population;Research;Research Design;Research Personnel;Research Support;Resources;Risk;Role;Sampling;Scientist;sex assigned;Sexual and Gender Minorities;Shapes;social epidemiology;Social status;Socioeconomic Status;Sports;Strategic Planning;structural determinants;Students;Subgroup;suicidal;Testing;theories;Training;transgender;Underserved Population;United States National Institutes of Health;university student;Variant;Woman;Work;young adult;Youth,"An intersectional approach to transgender and/or nonbinary college student mental health: The role of gender identity, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and campus policy",135609,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1 F18-E (20)],NA,NA,1,35325,2826,38151,NA

Specifically, our published and preliminary data show that: (A) beneficial SSRI effects (anxiolytic, anti-depressive, anti-nociceptive) result from SERT antagonism in the GI epithelium and may involve vagal- and 5-HT3-mediated signaling and; (B) surprisingly, detrimental SSRI effects result from ENS or CNS SERT antagonism (anxiety, dysmotility, pain), implying that selective pharmacologic blockade of GI epithelial SERT could be beneficial for treating DGBIs +/- mood disorders without producing negative and efficacy-reducing effects linked to systemic SSRI exposure. We now propose to: (Aim 1) elucidate the roles of vagal signaling in linking gut epithelial 5-HT to beneficial effects on GI motility and pain sensitivity as well as mood; (Aim 2) examine how ENS SERT ablation affects DGBI symptoms and mood, to determine if avoidance of ENS SERT antagonism is necessary to prevent the negative and efficacy-reducing effects associated with systemic SSRI use and; (Aim 3) determine whether a state-of-the-art SSRI delivery platform that we have recently created, that maximally disperses and retains SSRI locally on the intestinal epithelium and minimizes systemic absorption, provides the beneficial mood effects of SSRIs while avoiding deleterious effects on GI pain, GI motility and mood.",9107599;1870450;8602461 (contact),"ANSORGE, MARK SASCHA;LEONG, KAM W;MARGOLIS, KARA GROSS (contact)","SHEA-DONOHUE, TEREZ",2024-03-01,2029-02-28,Ablation;absorption;Acute;Adverse effects;Affect;affective disturbance;antagonist;Anti-Anxiety Agents;antinociception;Anxiety;base;bench-to-bedside translation;Brain Stem;Central Nervous System;Chronic;Clinical Research;Cognition;comorbidity;Constipation;Data;Defect;depressive symptoms;Development;Diagnosis;Diarrhea;Disease;Disease remission;disorder risk;disorders of gut-brain interaction;Drug Delivery Systems;Drug Design;Drug Kinetics;Enteral;Enteric Nervous System;Epithelium;Esthesia;experimental study;FDA approved;fetal;Functional disorder;Future;gastrointestinal;gastrointestinal epithelium;gastrointestinal function;Gastrointestinal Motility;gastrointestinal symptom;gut-brain axis;Individual;intestinal epithelium;Link;Mediating;Mental Depression;Modeling;Mood Disorders;mood regulation;mood symptom;Moods;Morbidity - disease rate;Motility;motility disorder;Mus;nanoneedle;nanoparticle;novel;novel therapeutics;Outcome;Pain;pain sensitivity;particle;Patients;pharmacologic;Play;prevent;Publishing;Recurrence;Regulation;Resolution;reuptake;Role;Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor;Serotonin;Signal Transduction;Symptoms;System;Testing;Time;Translating;transmission process;Vagotomy,Differentiating the roles and underlying mechanisms of serotonin in the gut epithelium and ENS to create a novel drug delivery system to treat disorders of gut-brain interaction and mood dysfunction,136292,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1 KUDS-W (03)],NA,A1,1,554970,137912,692882,NA

The surprisingly high incidence of LBW and PTB is driven primarily by birth outcomes among low-income, disproportionately Black, mothers, pointing to social and economic determinants of health. This study uses the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, a nationally representative, longitudinal dataset to: (1) compare the effects on birth outcomes of individual ESPs and ESP combinations; (2) determine the extent to which improvements to healthcare access, food insecurity, psychological distress, and prenatal health behaviors mediate the relationship between ESP generosity and birth outcomes; and (3) identify whether ESP generosity effects are moderated by poverty level, race, marital status, and/or education. By improving scientific knowledge of which ESPs or ESP packages work best in general, for specific health risk-factors, and for specific groups, this research will support the funding, design, and delivery of policies and interventions that promote economic security and reduce rates of, and inequalities in, LBW and PTB.",14503854 (contact),"REYNOLDS, MEGAN  (contact)","CHINN, JUANITA JEANNE",2023-04-10,2027-02-28,Address;adverse birth outcomes;Affect;Birth;Black race;COVID-19 pandemic;Data;design;Diet;disadvantaged women;Disparity;Disparity population;economic determinant;Economics;Education;Failure;Fetal health;food insecurity;Funding;Goals;graduate school;Health;Health behavior;health care availability;health determinants;Health Promotion;Household;improved;improved outcome;Incidence;Income Tax;Individual;Inequality;innovation;Intervention;Knowledge;Link;Living Costs;Living Standards;longitudinal dataset;Low Birth Weight Infant;Low income;Low Income Population;lower income families;Marital Status;Marketing;Maternal and Child Health;Measures;Mediating;Mediator;Mothers;novel;nutrition;Outcome;Outcomes Research;panel study of income dynamics;Play;Policies;Policy Maker;population health;Poverty;Pregnant Women;Premature Birth;prenatal health;prevent;programs;psychological distress;Quasi-experiment;Race;Reduce health disparities;Research;Rewards;Risk;Risk Estimate;Risk Factors;Role;safety net;Security;social;social determinants;Social Policies;Social status;socioeconomic disadvantage;socioeconomics;Stress;Subgroup;unemployment insurance;United States;United States National Institutes of Health;Unmarried;Variant;Wages;Woman;Work,Economic security policy and birth outcomes among socio-economically disadvantaged women,107077,SSPA,Social Sciences and Population Studies A Study Section[SSPA],NA,NA,2,227700,86827,314527,NA

Genome mining and microbial engineering have consistently been efficacious tools for natural product dug discovery and development. Current advances in molecular genetics, such as fast, accurate, and affordable sequencing technologies, enable us to further tap into the potential of microbial natural products for drug discovery. These technological advances leave room for significant advancement in microbial production and engineering. Currently, there is a bottleneck in natural product drug discovery brought on by a shortage of well-studied bacterial hosts available for heterologous expression of unexplored gene clusters. The lack of diverse and well- studied host strains results in minimal yield production platforms, which limit the ability to utilize microbes for natural product drug discovery and development. The research outlined in this proposal aims to test and develop a Burkholderia bacterial host from strain FERM BP-3421, a strain proven capable of producing medicinally relevant compounds in gram per liter scale. Development of this Burkholderia strain increases the diversity of well-studied host strains available to the scientific community.

According to the World Health Organization, almost 80 million people have been infected with the HIV virus since the beginning of the epidemic, and almost 40 million people have died of HIV. Sub-Saharan Africa remains most severely affected, with nearly 1 in every 20 adults living with HIV and accounting for nearly 71% of the people living with HIV worldwide. Many conferences around the world address a plethora of issues related to the treatment of HIV/AIDS, but few do so by addressing the underlying biology of the virus, and even fewer do this by putting the molecular biology of the virus and its interaction with its human host in the broader context of how all retroviruses, irrespective of host, function and evolve. A key to the success of the Cold Spring Harbor annual retroviruses conference is that the majority of oral presentations are given by graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty chosen on the basis of scientific merit, ensuring that the conference showcases the latest developments which are often yet to be published. Participants come from academic centers, research institutes and industrial centers around the world to present and discuss their findings. Many of the currently important treatments for HIV/AIDS were first presented or proposed at this conference in past years. Importantly, this application requests support for junior scientists who might not otherwise be able to attend to actively participate in the meeting.

By linking experimental and informatics expertise, we will leverage data to make more informed choices in choosing to study chemicals that show strong empirical support for GxE, rather than interrogate the same set of usual suspects. This addresses a critical public health need in the face of a growing chemical exposome, where certain chemicals may elicit severely adverse health effects that differ across populations.",6098123 (contact),"WRIGHT, FRED A.
