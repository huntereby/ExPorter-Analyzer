However, adipose tissue plays many beneficial functions, and healthy adipose tissue can actually protect from metabolic diseases. Adipose tissue health means that all the types of adipose tissues present in the body function correctly. During fasting, adipose tissue must be able to provide muscles, heart and liver with sufficient fuel to maintain blood glucose levels. Also, a distinct type of adipose tissue, called beige or brown, must be present to help control body temperature. Beige fat also has the capacity to burn calories and secrete hormones that improve metabolism. The proper functions of adipose tissues are controlled by the brain, which detects the need for fuel, or the outside environmental conditions. The brain communicates to adipose tissues via nerves, which secrete a neurotransmitter called noradrenaline. We have found that human fat cells have an enzyme, called MAOA, that can degrade noradrenaline. The levels of this enzyme in adipocytes can have a great impact on how the brain communicates not only to adipocytes, but to organs surrounded by adipose tissue such as the heart and major blood vessels. To study the importance of this enzyme we developed a unique model in which we can grow human fat in mice. Our current results suggest that MAOA in human adipocytes can control adipocyte beiging, and is therefore probably very important in controlling whole body metabolic rate. The studies proposed in this grant will determine whether human adipocyte MAOA can affect the levels of noradrenaline sufficiently to affect adipose tissue function and influence propensity for weight gain and glucose metabolism. If we find that human adipocyte MAOA is capable of affecting metabolic rate, we will design ways to target its activity to improve weight loss and ameliorate metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, fatty liver and heart disease.",1863603 (contact),"CORVERA, SILVIA  (contact)","HAFT, CAROL R",2023-09-01,2027-08-31,Acceleration;Adipocytes;Adipose tissue;Adrenergic Agents;Adrenergic Receptor;Affect;anti-depressive agents;Basal metabolic rate;Biological Availability;Blood Glucose;blood glucose regulation;Blood Vessels;Body Temperature;Body Weight decreased;Brain;Calories;Cells;Closure by clamp;Communication;comparison control;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cues;Dependence;design;Development;disorder risk;Enzymes;Experimental Models;Exposure to;Fasting;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Fatty Acids;fatty liver disease;Forms Controls;Genes;glucose disposal;glucose metabolism;Grant;Health;Heart;Heart Diseases;Homeostasis;Hormone secretion;Human;Human body;Hybrids;Hyperglycemia;Immunocompromised Host;Implant;implantation;improved;in vivo;insulin sensitivity;knock-down;Knock-out;Lipolysis;Liver;Measures;Mediating;Mesenchymal Stem Cells;Metabolic;Metabolic Diseases;metabolic rate;Metabolism;Methodology;Modeling;monoamine;Monoamine Oxidase A;Mus;Muscle;nanoparticle;Nerve;nerve supply;Neurons;Neurotransmitters;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Norepinephrine;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;NRIP1 gene;Obesity;Organ;Organ Temperatures;overexpression;pharmacologic;Physiological;Play;Positioning Attribute;Predisposition;Probability;Proteins;Recycling;Respiration;response;Role;Signal Transduction;Site;stem cell differentiation;Stimulus;subcutaneous;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Thermogenesis;Tissues;Vascularization;virtual;Weight Gain;Work,Human adipose tissue in control of sympathetic tone and metabolic rate,137403,POMD,Pathophysiology of Obesity and Metabolic Disease Study Section[POMD],NA,NA,2,417600,278793,696393,NA

Among ICU admissions, 30-50% carry reservoirs of bacteria in the nasopharynx (determined by swabs). Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) adds $1 billion to the cost of ICU care annually in the US. Inhaled delivery of TRL1068 can be readily included in the treatment by plugging the nebulizer device into the ventilator. From a regulatory perspective, treatment of hospital acquired pneumonia provides high potential benefit at minimal risk and the high incidence allows for efficient clinical trials. Exacerbation of COPD by bacterial infection is a more complex indication, but one which affects a large population for whom inhaled delivery (hand held nebulizer) offers a substantially more convenient treatment option, addressing a potential market of over $5 billion.

Noninvasive methods that sample only the top layer of the skin for molecular (non-histological) analyses are not widely used for melanoma diagnosis, likely due to collection of biomarkers from superficial skin rather than from melanocytes that are deeper under the skin. In this proposal, we propose development of a new laser microbiopsy that will allow tissue extraction beyond the epidermis, where melanocytes are located, with less pain compared to traditional biopsies. This minimally-invasive laser microbiopsy can be used for histological and molecular diagnostics, which will hopefully allow for comprehensive melanoma screening to reduce the disease burden.",15903564 (contact);8768455,"PAREKH, SAPUN H (contact);TUNNELL, JAMES W","CHUAQUI, RODRIGO F",2024-08-08,2027-07-31,Address;Adopted;Adult;Affect;Animals;Benign;Biological Markers;Biopsy;Biopsy Specimen;burden of illness;Cancer Detection;Cell Culture Techniques;Cells;Cessation of life;Clinic;Clinical;Collection;Computer Models;conditioning;Cone;Cytology;Data;Dependence;Development;Device Designs;Devices;Diagnosis;Diameter;Disease;dosimetry;Early Diagnosis;Ensure;Epidermis;Excision;experimental study;Family suidae;Feasibility Studies;feasibility testing;Flow Cytometry;Future;Genetic;genetic analysis;genetic approach;Genetic Markers;Geometry;Harvest;Histologic;Histology;Histopathology;Human;Ice Cream;Image;Immunofluorescence Immunologic;improved;in silico;Individual;Lasers;Lesion;Light;Lighting;Malignant Neoplasms;Mass Spectrum Analysis;mechanical properties;Mechanics;melanocyte;Melanoma;melanoma biomarkers;meter;Methods;Microscope;microscopic imaging;Microscopy;minimally invasive;Modeling;Mole the mammal;Molecular;Molecular Analysis;molecular diagnostics;Morphology;new technology;Operative Surgical Procedures;Optical Coherence Tomography;optical imaging;Optics;Outcome;Pain;Pain Free;Pathologic;Pathology;Penetration;Performance;Phase;Physiologic pulse;preconditioning;Primary Cell Cultures;Procedures;Process;Property;Protein Analysis;Proteins;Punch Biopsy;RNA;Sampling;screening;Screening for Skin Cancer;Screening procedure;Shapes;Skin;Skin Cancer;Slide;Specificity;Stains;standard of care;stem;Stratum Basale;Stratum corneum;Surface;Survival Rate;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Time;tissue culture;Tissue Harvesting;Tissue Viability;Tissues;tool;transcriptomics;tumor;United States Preventative Services Task Force;Visual;Work,Precision Tumor Sampling of Melanoma Using Laser Microbiopsy,291212,ZCA1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZCA1 TCRB-J (M1)],NA,NA,1,148244,55366,203610,NA

Furthermore, while it is the gold standard, the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) used to diagnose GDM has many limitations: 1- it is not clear that the OGTT represents true physiologic glucose variation with the glucose load provided, 2- debate exists as to what cut-offs should be employed for diagnosis of GDM, 3- it is unclear if earlier performance of OGTT can use the same thresholds for diagnosis and whether earlier diagnosis can be used to improve important maternal and neonatal outcomes.

SCH presents with a range of morbidities, and although recent years have witnessed a scale-up of MDA for SCH control worldwide, no single direct morbidity marker has been adopted to monitor the clinical impact of these interventions. It is widely appreciated that the critical infection levels associated with SCH morbidity are poorly understood and evidence-based targets for control are lacking. On the other hand, while MDA has contributed to reduction of prevalence and intensity of SCH & STH over the decades, it is acknowledged that MDA alone is unlikely to interrupt transmission of these diseases. Other control measures such as provision of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) are needed, but the threshold of WASH levels/indicators that are associated with the greatest impact of MDA need to be ascertained. Proper disease surveillance encompassing robust monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities for all control measures including WASH and vector control remains a key ingredient in ensuring the success of control programs and activities against these diseases. Planning for control interventions including MDA to control S. mansoni requires accurate testing and mapping to determine local parasite prevalence. Although Kato-Katz is recommended by the WHO for detection of intestinal schistosomiasis, there is increasing appreciation that the sensitivity of Kato-Katz stool analysis will continue decline, especially as more MDA programs are expanded and progressively lower egg densities are observed. New and improved diagnostics are therefore needed to ensure and to support successful disease surveillance, M&E of control programs. At the same time, pharmacovigilance for new treatments or formulations and other alternative control interventions including snail control also remain central in efforts to interrupt transmission. The proposed 4 studies that are interconnected and targeting SCH & STH in western Kenya will evaluate and monitor morbidity, evaluate new diagnostic tools and interventions including WASH and snail monitoring to reduce or interrupt transmission, and evaluate safety, efficacy and impact of new treatments or new formulations of existing treatments for SCH as they become available.",11377322 (contact),"ODIERE, MAURICE REUBEN (contact)",NA,2022-09-30,2027-09-29,NA,"RFA-GH-22-001, Monitoring morbidity, evaluation of new diagnostic tools; interventions to reduce or interrupt transmission, and improving surveillance for intestinal schistosomiasis.",2386,ZGH1,ZGH1-HMS(02),NA,NA,3,NA,NA,314000,NA

Importantly, acquired drug resistance drives almost universal treatment failure. We propose that the therapeutic responses to TKIs involves induction of tumor-derived signals that instruct participation of both anti- and pro-tumorigenic immune cells. This project uses novel murine models of EGFR, ALK and RET-driven LUAD to identify tumor-derived signals and host immune cells that contribute to the TKI response. Also, pretreatment tumor specimens from patients will be analyzed for specific immune cells that predict the duration of response.

Preliminary evidence suggests that individuals with PD+TBI have poorer outcomes and reduced brain volume compared to PD patients without TBI. However, a comprehensive and systematic study of mild-moderate TBI impact on neuropsychological outcomes, QoL, and brain morphometry in Veterans with PD is needed.

Compared to the general population, Veterans have a greater risk of AD, likely in part due to their increased incidence of traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and other vascular-related health issues. Based on available data, 423,000 new cases of AD are anticipated in Veterans by 2020, including 140,000 cases directly attributable to military service. Thus, the discovery of effective therapies to prevent or delay the onset of AD in Veterans is critical. The goal of our study is to evaluate the efficacy of a purified form of the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) called icosapent ethyl (IPE), on improving brain blood flow, spinal fluid markers of AD pathology, and cognitive performance in middle-aged, cognitively-healthy Veterans with increased risk of AD.

To inform dietary recommendations and federal nutrition policy, we propose a 1-year randomized controlled trial to test the impact of milk type (whole versus 1%) on adiposity (waist-to-height ratio, body mass index, tri-ponderal mass index, and waist circumference), dietary intake (energy, total and saturated fat, added sugars, overall diet quality), vitamin D status, cardiometabolic health (blood lipids, glucoregulatory indices), neurocognitive development, and microbiota, based on baseline and follow-up assessments in 500 children followed from 2 to 3 years of age. 1",10229471;8018856 (contact),"PATEL, ANISHA INDRAVADAN;RITCHIE, LORRENE D (contact)","EVANS, MARY",2023-09-15,2028-06-30,"1 year old;2 year old;3 year old;5 year old;Adolescent obesity;Adult;adult obesity;Affect;Age;Appetite Regulation;blood lipid;Body mass index;Brain;Calories;Cardiometabolic Disease;cardiometabolism;Caring;Cattle;Characteristics;Child;Childhood;Clinical;comorbidity;Consumption;Development;Diet;dietary;Dietary intake;disorder risk;drinking;Energy Intake;Ensure;Epidemic;Essential Fatty Acids;evidence base;excessive weight gain;Fatty acid glycerol esters;follow up assessment;follow-up;Food;Growth;Guidelines;gut microbiota;Health;Health Personnel;Height;Home;Hormones;Household;Human Milk;indexing;infancy;Infant;Insulin Resistance;Intake;Leptin;Measurement;Measures;Metabolic;microbiota;microbiota composition;Milk;milk fat;milk intake;Neurocognitive;Nursery Schools;Nutrient;nutrition;Nutrition Policy;Obesity;obesity in children;obesity prevention;Observational Study;Outcome;Outcome Study;Overweight;Parents;Participant;pediatrician;Policies;Preschool Child;Prevalence;primary outcome;programs;Proteins;Public Health;Randomized;Randomized, Controlled Trials;Recommendation;recruit;Risk Factors;Role;Satiation;saturated fat;School-Age Population;secondary outcome;Source;Standardization;sugar;Surveys;Testing;Time;Toddler;Underweight;Vitamin D;waist circumference;Weight;Woman","Milk Type in Toddlers (Milk-TOT) Study: Impact of Whole versus Low-fat Milk on Child Adiposity, Health and Development",131217,HSDO,Human Studies of Diabetes and Obesity Study Section[HSDO],NA,NA,2,432458,233047,665505,NA

Development of effective, personalized treatment options for chronic pelvic pain is critically important. There is increasing evidence supporting use of non-pharmacologic therapies in chronic pelvic pain and other conditions, but their use is frequently hampered by limited availability of providers, particularly in underserved areas, lack of insurance coverage, and out-of-pocket costs.

The widespread cancer screening has reduced the mortality of this disease. Nevertheless, the gains are highly dependent on the specificities of the breast anatomy. The breast imaging community is very aware of the limitations of mammography and breast tomosynthesis (limited angle x-ray tomography of the breast) in regard to breast cancer detection, especially in the dense and extremely dense breast women. As a result, additional breast imaging modalities are used with increasing frequency, but there is no standalone imaging modality for addressing the dense breast issue. Breast ultrasound solutions are used in various settings but are limited in that they augment mammography. Breast MRI solutions are effective but costly to acquire and maintain. Dedicated breast CT has been studied at several sites with promising results. However, the inherent shortcomings of the current renditions of breast CT have hindered its clinical impact. We have devised a new methodology of CT image acquisition (dubbed narrow-beam CT) with the specific aim of resolving the dense breast problem. Through the Phase I period of this Phase II project, we built and tested a prototype narrow-beam CT system. A final version of this modality is currently being assembled in the laboratory. This new R44 grant proposal seeks to develop the finishing touches on the necessary hardware, perform necessary advancements in software. In addition, we will perform a first-in-patient pilot study to gain insight about the viability of this solution through clinical comparisons between breast CT and mammography/tomosynthesis in non-contrast (screening) setting, and comparisons between contrast enhanced breast CT and contrast enhanced MRI in diagnostic settings.",15936102 (contact),"GHAZI, PEYMON  (contact)","ZHAO, MING",2022-02-28,2026-06-30,3-Dimensional;Achievement;Address;Anatomy;Applications Grants;Architecture;attenuation;Awareness;Benign;Biopsy;Breast;Breast biopsy;Breast Cancer Detection;breast density;breast imaging;Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Breast Microcalcification;Cancer Detection;cancer diagnosis;Clinical;commercialization;Communities;Computer software;Computing Methodologies;contrast enhanced;contrast enhanced computed tomography;cost;Data;Dedications;design;Detection;Development;Devices;Diagnostic;Digital Breast Tomosynthesis;Digital Mammography;Disease;Dose;Electronics;Evaluation;Feasibility Studies;Frequencies;Goals;Hybrids;Image;Image Guided Biopsy;image reconstruction;Imaging Device;imaging modality;imaging system;Imaging technology;Immobilization;improved;Injections;Inpatients;insight;Laboratories;Legal patent;Lesion;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Breast Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammary Gland Parenchyma;Mammary Ultrasonography;Mammography;Methodology;Methods;Modality;mortality;Noise;novel;Outcome;Output;Patients;Performance;Phase;photon-counting detector;Pilot Projects;Property;Prospective Studies;prototype;R44 grant;reconstruction;Reporting;Resolution;Roentgen Rays;sample fixation;Scanning;screening;Screening for cancer;Series;Shapes;Site;Small Business Innovation Research Grant;Specificity;Structure;System;Technology;temporal measurement;Testing;Time;tomography;tomosynthesis;Touch sensation;ultrasound;United States;Validation;Woman;X-Ray Computed Tomography;X-Ray Tomography,A comprehensive imaging solution for dense breast cancer screening and diagnostics,261381,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1 ISB-Z (10)],NA,A1,2,827052,232938,1134189,NA

As such, they will provide an advantage over currently available approaches for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other dementias. Successful completion of the two proposed aims will result in NT preparations with safer, more effective activity profiles for delivering small molecule drugs and biologicals in AD. Overall, this Phase I project will enable us to optimize the size, stability, drug loading efficiency, and RGD-dependence of SMC-101 NTs and their ability to undergo transcytosis in vitro (AIM 1).

Xylazine extends the high or euphoria of opioids, affording greater profits for traffickers. No approved antidote for xylazine exists. Further, an agent reversing both opioid and xylazine overdose is an unmet clinical need. Our Solution: NarcoBondα2/µO - a “nanosponge” containing decoy receptors for fentanyl (mu opioid receptor) and xylazine (α2A-adrenergic receptor -α2A) safely corrals these drugs in the peripheral blood, sparing the patient from the high CNS concentrations that depress respiration and cause death.

This work aims to develop a multicultural mobile phone application and environmental health literacy (EHL) materials for raising EDC awareness and literacy and reducing environmental exposures. We propose to do this by assessing a population of African Americans’ routine exposures and providing personalized exposure reduction recommendations (via science-backed research and focus groups); providing culturally appropriate, personalized, interactive environmental health education pertaining to environmental exposures targeted to a minority population; and tracking EHL and lifestyle improvements over time. Completion of this proposal will allow Million Marker to empower individuals in minority communities to increase their EHL and reduce their harmful exposures.

TB causes high morbidity and mortality. The global burden of TB continues to increase with the emergence of multidrug-resistant and extremely drug resistant M tuberculosis strains, and the lack of an effective vaccine that protects adults from mycobacterial infection and TB disease. The current application seeks support to develop an effective and durable vaccine that can protect our Veterans. As M tuberculosis is transmitted through aerosols and infects the lung mucosa, the challenge is to install immune effector cells at the site of infection. Our research group has developed ways to install pathogen-specific immune effectors in the lungs, which is the major route of mycobacterial infection. Using the new insights, we will develop and test a durable vaccine against TB in a preclinical animal model.

Here we will advance Petri’s proprietary bacterial therapeutic for HCU treatment by scaling up manufacturing, testing safety and efficacy, and preparing for human studies.",78115737 (contact),"SCHINAMAN, JOSEPH MOELLER (contact)","BARDHAN, SUJATA",2022-05-05,2026-06-30,Adherence;Amino Acids;Antibiotic susceptibility;attenuation;bacterial vector;Betaine;Biological Models;Biological Products;Biological Response Modifier Therapy;biomaterial compatibility;Catalysis;Classification;Clinical;Clinical Research;clinical translation;Clinical Trials;Cognitive deficits;Cystathionine;cytokine;Data;design;Detection;Development;Diarrhea;Diet;Dietary intake;dietary restriction;Dietary Supplementation;Doctor of Philosophy;Dose;Drug Kinetics;Effectiveness;efficacy study;efficacy testing;Engineering;Engraftment;Ensure;enzyme therapy;Enzymes;Excretory function;expression vector;eye center;Fermentation;Formulation;gene therapy;Genes;Genetic Models;genomic data;Goals;gut microbiome;Homocysteine;Homocystinuria;Human;in silico;In Vitro;in vitro testing;in vivo;Inflammatory;Investigational Drugs;Lead;lens;Long-Term Effects;manufacturing organization;manufacturing scale-up;Measures;meetings;Metabolic;Metabolic Diseases;Metabolic Pathway;Methionine;Methods;Microbe;microbial;microbial genomics;Modeling;mouse model;Mutation;Nausea;novel;novel strategies;Odors;Patients;Performance;Phase;phase 1 study;Plasma;pre-Investigational New Drug meeting;Preclinical Testing;Prevalence;Process;Production;programs;research clinical testing;Research Contracts;Rodent;Safety;safety testing;scale up;Schedule;side effect;small molecule therapeutics;standard of care;Standardization;stroke incidence;Testing;Therapeutic;therapeutic enzyme;therapeutic protein;thrombotic;Tissues;Toxicology;Transgenic Organisms;treatment strategy;uptake;vector;Vitamin B6;Work,Live microbial therapeutics: an enhanced treatment paradigm for classical homocystinuria,107885,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1 EMS-S (10)],NA,A1,2,671152,268461,1000496,NA

American Indians, in general, experience a disproportionately high mortality rate. The average life expectancy for American Indians is 71.4 years old, while the US general populations’ life expectancy is 75.5 years old. American Indians have a 638% greater mortality rate due to alcoholism, a 400% greater mortality rate due to tuberculosis, a 291% greater mortality rate due to diabetes, and a 215% mortality rate due to accidents as compared to the U.S. general population. The ITCA American Indian Research for Health (AIRCH) was established in 2000 to reduce health disparities among American Indians and Alaska Natives by engaging tribes in research that is scientifically sound. ITCA works to improve the capacity of tribes in Arizona, including areas related to health. With over 60 staff and 30 projects, ITCA provides on- going technical assistance and over 100 annual trainings to Tribes in program planning and development, research and data collection, and resource development. The overall goal of the American Indian Research Center for Health is to support health research projects that benefit Tribal Members, develop relationships to enhance tribal governance and partnerships in health research, conduct research that honors Tribal sovereignty, and promote a cadre of AI/AN researchers in health disparities research. The University of Arizona and ITCA missions and activities differ in deliberate ways and the AIRCH unites our Tribally governed 501(c) 3 and our research intensive institution to provide a collaborative service to our 21 member Arizona Tribes, and the Arizona AIAN population. The institutions are fully committed to the continuing success and impact of AIRCH and are prepared to provide resources to aim of advancing the impact of health research benefiting Tribal constituents and to support Native students and faculty.",14593095 (contact);9659556,"DADGAR, MARIA  (contact);SOLOMON, TESHIA G.

The historical cases of mistrust of research from non-community members has promoted negative publications and promote stereotypes of AI/AN.

PfSPZ vaccines are manufactured from live Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ) currently in mosquitoes and in the future in vitro. We propose to de-couple the upstream stages of vaccine manufacturing by culturing Pf ookinetes in vitro, then purifying and cryopreserving the ookinetes prior to their use in PfSPZ vaccine production. With cryopreserved ookinetes that are viable upon thawing from stable storage conditions we will be able to initiate PfSPZ production campaigns without need for fresh blood and serum and gametocyte production currently needing ~30 days. Likewise, front-end manufacturing of PfSPZ in vitro will be highly standardized and the culturing time greatly reduced with the underlying aim of developing a scalable manufacturing schema.",1978462 (contact),"HOFFMAN, STEPHEN LEV (contact)","MO, ANNIE X Y",2023-09-06,2025-08-31,Address;African;Anopheles Genus;Antigens;Biological;Biological Assay;Bioreactors;Blood;Chitinase;comparative;Complex;cost;Country;Cryopreservation;Culicidae;density;Dissociation;Divorce;Excision;extracellular;feeding;Female;flexibility;Fluorescent Dyes;Future;Germ Cells;Goals;Good Manufacturing Process;Grant;Human;In Vitro;Infection;large scale production;Link;Location;Magnetism;Malaria;malaria infection;malaria transmission;Malaria Vaccines;male;manufacture;matrigel;Membrane;Membrane Proteins;Methods;Motility;Nature;Oocysts;Parasites;Parasitic infection;Plasmodium falciparum;Plasmodium falciparum vaccine;Pregnant Women;prevent;Process;Production;Protocols documentation;Quality Control;Readiness;Serum;Specific qualifier value;Sporozoite vaccine;Sporozoites;Standardization;Structure;Survival Rate;Testing;Time;timeline;transmission process;uptake;Vaccination;vaccine efficacy;Vaccine Production;Vaccines;Work;zygote,Modularizing manufacture of PfSPZ vaccines: ookinete production for PfSPZ manufacture in mosquitoes and in vitro,179439,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-DCAI-D(10)],NA,NA,2,181745,77790,277702,NA

Here, I propose to (1) study how dynamics in a specific inhibitory network supports motor learning and recovery and (2) probe the impact of activating these inhibitory networks on learning and recovery.

The GripTract system is a disposable endoscopic accessory that enables physician-controlled tissue manipulation to facilitate complex polypectomy procedures like endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) – a technique that reduces the risks of reseeding potentially malignant lesions or producing incomplete resections. GripTract enables en bloc resection of these large polyps without occupying the working channel. This Phase IIB tests the GripTract system clinically in lower GI procedures.

The intervention's expanded social network recruitment will facilitate conversations between peers that will help to change norms around discussing HIV testing, increase HIV-related social support, and reduce HIV-related stigma among network members. These changes in stigma and support will in turn increase the likelihood that the members of these social networks will engage more in HIV testing and treatment services, ultimately leading to reduced HIV transmission and improved HIV health outcomes not only among individuals who had previously avoided engagement in testing and treatment, but also among the broader communities in which the intervention is implemented.",15182487 (contact),"WILLIAMS, LESLIE DENISE (contact)","GREENWOOD, GREGORY",2024-07-15,2029-04-30,"Address;Adoption;Africa South of the Sahara;arm;barrier to care;barrier to testing;Behavior;Businesses;care outcomes;Caring;Characteristics;Clinic;Clinical Trials;Communities;Counseling;design;Disparity;Education;Effectiveness;Epidemic;Evaluation;Event;Exclusion;experience;Family;Feeling;Female;follow-up;Friends;Future;gender disparity;Goals;Health;Health behavior;Health Promotion;HIV;HIV diagnosis;HIV Infections;HIV risk;HIV Seropositivity;Human immunodeficiency virus test;implementation science;improved;improved outcome;Individual;Infection;Intervention;intervention participants;Interview;Link;male;member;men;Methods;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality;Newly Diagnosed;novel;Outcome;Participant;Patient Recruitments;peer;peer influence;Perception;Personal Satisfaction;Persons;Pilot Projects;Process;Qualitative Methods;Randomized;randomized trial;Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance;Reaction;recruit;Reporting;Research;Risk;Risk Behaviors;scale up;Services;Sex Behavior;Sexual Partners;Site;Social Network;social stigma;Social support;South Africa;staff intervention;standard of care;success;Testing;testing services;Time;transmission process;treatment services;trial comparing;Viral Load result;Woman","Site-randomized Trial of a Novel Social Network Recruitment Intervention to Locate More Undiagnosed Positive Cases of HIV, Increase HIV Testing among Men, and Reduce HIV-related Stigma in South Africa",136871,PPAH,Population and Public Health Approaches to HIV/AIDS Study Section[PPAH],NA,NA,1,562199,127122,689321,NA
