These individuals and their students, in turn, have been at the center stage of the biomedical sciences, as evidenced by the fact that developmental biologists have: 1) provided mechanistic understanding of fundamental biological processes (e.g., pattern formation, organogenesis, tissue polarity, epigenetics, aging, cell death); 2) discovered morphogens, microRNAs, and defined the major signaling pathways used by cells to communicate with each other; and 3) have provided the foundations for stem cell biology, tissue engineering and the context to understand human birth defects and disease. Developmental Biology continues to expand into new areas of research such as regeneration, stem cells, systems biology and growth control.

While peptide presentation by classical MHC-I molecules is well understood, very little is known about how MHC-E presents non-self peptides because MHC-E generally presents a self-peptide contained within classical MHC-I proteins to natural killer cells as a self-protective mechanism and to better understand why CMV is the only known vaccine platform capable of eliciting MHC-E-restricted CD8+ T cell responses to any antigen, we will study the molecular antigen-presenting mechanisms that enable CMV to elicit these responses and how these T cells recognize HIV-infected cells. 1",7862633 (contact);9845039,"FRUH, KLAUS J (contact);SACHA, JONAH B.","PARK OCHSNER, SUSAN SOO",2023-09-25,2028-07-31,AIDS vaccine development;Antibodies;Antigen Presentation;Antigen Presentation Pathway;antigen processing;Antigens;Bacteria;Binding;Biology;CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;CD94 Antigen;Cell Line;cell type;Cells;cellular targeting;Clinical;Complex;CRISPR screen;Cytomegalovirus;Cytoprotection;Data;design;Endoplasmic Reticulum;Epitopes;experience;Frequencies;Gene Deletion;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Gene Modified;Gene Targeting;Genes;genetic testing;Goals;Heterophile Antigens;Histocompatibility;Histocompatibility Antigens Class II;HIV;HIV vaccine;Human;Image;Immune response;Immunity;immunodeficiency;Immunologics;Immunology;Immunotherapeutic agent;In Vitro;in vivo;Infection;Integration Host Factors;International;Lentivirus;Macaca mulatta;Mediating;MicroRNAs;Modeling;Molecular;Monitor;monocyte;Mycobacterium tuberculosis;Myelogenous;Myeloid Cells;N-terminal;Natural Killer Cells;novel;novel vaccines;Outcome;Parasites;Pathogenicity;Pathway interactions;Peptides;Phase;Plasmodium knowlesi;posters;prophylactic;Protein Sortings;Proteins;Reagent;Recombinants;Research;Research Personnel;response;Rhesus;Role;seropositive;Signal Transduction;Site;SIV;small hairpin RNA;Sorting;Structure;Surface;T cell differentiation;T cell response;T memory cell;T-Cell Receptor;T-Lymphocyte;Techniques;trafficking;transcriptomics;translational immunology;Translations;Vaccine Design;vaccine platform;Vaccines;vector;vector vaccine;Vesicle;Viral;Viral Genes;Viral Proteins;Virulent;Virus;Work,Non-canonical epitope presentation and antigen processing by MHC-E,175459,CMIA,Cellular and Molecular Immunology - A Study Section[CMIA],NA,NA,2,502320,199392,701712,NA

This rapid growth has led to concerns within VA related to the adequacy of non-VA provider networks and a need to develop appropriate measures of network adequacy. In the context of these questions is also the need to better understand organizational decision-making processes regarding Community Care at the local level as these decisions affect which Veterans receive care within the VA or in the community.

We have used population genomics to identify Mtb genes undergoing diversifying selection in clinical strain since the onset of antibiotics. By phenotyping isogenic Mtb strains engineered to carry clinically prevalent variants, we have uncovered a new form of altered drug susceptibility, a recovery phenotype that we call antibiotic resilience. Mtb strains with resilience mutations which are subject to a period of drug exposure recover and begin to grow significantly more rapidly than wildtype strains. We have identified clinically prevalent resilience mutations in four essential regulators and their binding sites; we further find that these regulators regulate each other in modulate expression of key cell growth and division genes. Here we will mechanistically dissect the transcriptional regulatory network underlying antibiotic resilience through three aims: (1) “Define the resilience regulatory response under drug and host relevant conditions” in which we will generate and transcriptionally profile Mtb strains with resilience mutations; (2) “Determine the mechanistic basis of network-associated transcription factor functions under drug- and host-relevant conditions” in which we will use biochemical and structural approaches to determine the functions of the regulators with novel mechanisms of action and the impact of the clinically prevalent variants; and (3) In mouse models, “Test the hypothesis that antibiotic resilience mutations allow Mtb to escape drug and host selection in vivo”. These studies will elucidate the genomic and protein changes underlying resilience, a clinically relevant, previously unrecognized form of drug escape in Mtb, and our findings may inform future treatment and surveillance strategies for TB.",6799828 (contact),"FORTUNE, SARAH  (contact)","ROBINSON, RICHARD THOMAS",2024-06-01,2029-04-30,Acceleration;Address;Antibiotics;Bacteria;bacterial genetics;Binding Sites;Biochemical;Cell Cycle;Cell division;cell growth;Cell Survival;cell type;Cells;Cellular biology;Clinical;Clinical Research;clinically relevant;Data;defined contribution;DNA biosynthesis;DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase;Drug Exposure;Drug resistance;Drug resistant Mycobacteria Tuberculosis;drug sensitivity;Engineering;Exposure to;Fortune;Future;Gene Expression Profile;Genes;Genetic;Genetic study;Genetic Transcription;Genomics;Growth;Homeostasis;Human;Immune;improved;in vivo;insight;Intercistronic Region;knock-down;Knowledge;M. tuberculosis genome;Modeling;Molecular;mouse model;Mutate;Mutation;Mycobacterium tuberculosis;network models;novel;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacotherapy;Phenotype;Population;Predisposition;pressure;Proteins;Recovery;Regimen;Regulatory Pathway;Relapse;resilience;response;Reverse engineering;Risk Factors;Role;Series;Stress;Structural Biochemistry;structural biology;Structure;surveillance strategy;Survivors;System;Testing;Titrations;transcription factor;transcription regulatory network;Treatment Failure;Treatment outcome;treatment response;treatment strategy;tuberculosis treatment;Variant;Work,Molecular basis of antibiotic resilience in Mycobacterium tuberculosis,184469,AIRT,Anti-Infective Resistance and Targets Study Section [AIRT],NA,NA,1,670551,178318,848869,NA

We hypothesize that (1) providing UBI of $500 per month for six months will result in increased healthcare utilization among chronically-ill, older and aging, low-income Black men; and (2) the effect of UBI will depend on whether an individual has a recent history of incarceration, such that no incarceration history combined with UBI will demonstrate the best study outcomes. Empirical research examining UBI among older Black men and its capacity to overturn structural racism are lacking in the extant literature—much of the health disparities research intended to inform health and economic policy originated from limited perspectives of older and aging Black men—Dr. W.E.B.

However only recently did we come to understand that the host has a defense system based on small RNAs for combating unchecked proliferation of these genomic parasites. To date we know very little about how this defense system evolves within and between populations to combat new and active transposable elements, or about the actual mechanisms of transposable element suppression by this system. This proposal aims to address this shortfall by developing a comparative genomics approach to the small RNA defense system, both within populations and between species.

Effective BTHS therapies are lacking due to incomplete understanding of the leading pathogenic mechanism. We propose expeditious pre-clinical testing of drugs targeting an entirely new pathogenic mechanism that have not been tested as BTHS mitigators. The mechanism is based on a newly discovered role of the major biochemical process of remodeling of essential and unique mitochondrial phospholipid, cardiolipin.
