The goal of this project is to define neural mechanisms through which a common lipid signaling pathway drives antinociception by altering the excitability of specific supraspinal pathways sensitized by chronic pain. Findings of this project have promising potential for uncovering preclinical and clinical drug targets within sensory-discriminative and affective supraspinal circuits that could lead to novel approaches exploiting lipid signaling pathways for treating chronic pain.,8503004 (contact);1879170,"SHEETS, PATRICK L (contact);TAYLOR, BRADLEY K.","GREENWELL, THOMAS",2020-04-01,2025-03-31,Absence of pain sensation;Acute Pain;Affective;Agonist;Amygdaloid structure;Analgesics;antagonist;antinociception;Attenuated;attenuation;Behavior;Behavioral;Brain;Cell Nucleus;chronic pain;chronic pain management;Clinical;Clinical Treatment;conditioned place preference;Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone;Coupled;Data;designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs;Development;Dimensions;Drug Targeting;Electrophysiology (science);Emotional;FDA approved;Genes;Genetic;Goals;GTP-Binding Proteins;Hypersensitivity;immunoregulation;Induced Neurons;Inflammation;Inflammatory;inflammatory pain;Infusion procedures;Injections;Injury;Knowledge;Label;Link;Lipids;Literature;Lysophospholipids;Mechanics;Mediating;Microinjections;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Profiling;mouse model;multiple sclerosis treatment;Mus;nerve injury;neurochemistry;neuromechanism;Neuronal Dysfunction;Neurons;neurophysiology;novel;novel strategies;optogenetics;Pain;pain behavior;pain model;pain reduction;painful neuropathy;Pathway interactions;Peripheral;Pharmaceutical Preparations;pharmacologic;Pharmacology;Population;pre-clinical;protein kinase C-delta;receptor;Receptor Activation;Reporting;Role;Sensory;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Slice;Somatostatin;Sphingolipids;sphingosine 1-phosphate;Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptor;Synapses;Tactile;Testing;tissue injury;Transgenic Mice;Transgenic Organisms;Translating,Lipid signaling in supraspinal pain pathways,112632,SPS,Somatosensory and Pain Systems Study Section[SPS],NA,NA,5,348096,98409,446505,NA

The mechanisms underlying this relationship remain largely unknown. TBI causes early and late impairment of cerebrovascular function, much in the same way that dementia disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia were associated with early development of impaired vascular function. Our overall goal is to test the hypotheses that long-term mild TBI (mTBI)-induced cognitive dysfunction is due, at least in part, to persistent cerebrovascular dysfunction and that early onset mTBI will contribute to worse cerebrovascular and cognitive function with concomitant hypertension. We will use a validated model of diffuse mTBI in rats using fluid percussion injury. We will measure cognitive function using novel object recognition tasks. We will measure cerebrovascular function in living animals using magnetic resonance imaging and by measuring reactivity of blood vessels isolated from the brain. We will determine the relationship between cerebrovascular function and cognitive function and evaluate whether aerobic exercise training will attenuate the effects of mTBI. In rats genetically predisposed to develop hypertension, we will also compare cerebrovascular and cognitive function with mTBI versus those without. The proposal is significant in filling in our knowledge gaps about how mTBI causes impaired cognitive function as well as understanding the underlying causes on how TBI induces impaired cerebrovascular function. If successful, the study will uncover important new treatment pathways that could be used to prevent impaired cognitive and cerebrovascular function following TBI.",2048186;8009610 (contact),"LIFSHITZ, JONATHAN ;MIGRINO, RAYMOND QUEZON (contact)",NA,2021-04-01,2025-03-31,Acute;Aerobic Exercise;Affect;Afghanistan;Aging;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Alzheimer&apos;s disease related dementia;Animals;Attenuated;base;Blood Vessels;Brain;Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor;Carbon Dioxide;Cardiac;cardiovascular effects;cardiovascular risk factor;Cardiovascular system;cerebral artery;cerebral autoregulation;cerebrovascular;Cerebrovascular Disorders;Cerebrum;Chronic;chronic traumatic encephalopathy;cognitive function;Coronary artery;Data;Dementia;Development;Diffuse;Disease;disorder risk;early onset;Echocardiography;Endothelium;exercise training;Exposure to;fluid percussion injury;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Goals;Histopathology;Hypertension;hypertensive;Impaired cognition;Impairment;improved;in vivo;Inbred SHR Rats;Injury;insight;Iraq;Knowledge;Link;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measures;Mediating;mild traumatic brain injury;military veteran;Modeling;Molecular;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality;Neurons;neurovascular;neurovascular coupling;normotensive;novel;object recognition;Organ;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Perfusion;persistent symptom;Physiological;pressure;prevent;Rattus;Regulation;rehabilitation strategy;Reporting;response;Rest;Role;service member;sham surgery;Soldier;Sprague-Dawley Rats;stressor;Structure;synergism;Testing;Traumatic Brain Injury;Vascular blood supply;Vascular Dementia;Vascular Diseases;Veterans;Work;Youth,Mechanistic role of vascular dysfunction in TBI-mediated cognitive dysfunction,2691,RRD1,Brain Health and Injury[RRD1],NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA

The proposed Center will allow the development and growth of the key infrastructure needed to support the national competitiveness of not only the members of the CAIPP Center, but of all researchers on campus, the region and the state. We propose new techniques and infrastructure not presently found on campus. We also propose to promote the interaction and synergy of multiple disciplines where appropriate and harness the collective strengths of the collaborative departments and schools within the state and region to drive research competitiveness. Together, the CAIPP will advance new insights and understanding for how when the immune system is dysregulated in either a hyperactive manner as would be seen in the case of chronic inflammatory conditions or when negatively affected such as during infection with viral or bacterial pathogens, serious and often fatal disease pathologies ensue. It is the understanding of the molecular and clinical basis for these diseases and resulting immunopathologies that we hope will lead to new and better ways to detect and treat these various diseases.

The proposed study will uncover the molecular basis for specific race-related differences in PCa immunobiology, which could provide key insights into immune determinants contributing to PCa mortality disparities.

An early event in development of breast cancer is the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) when mammary cells lose their normal structure and function and gain migratory and invasive properties. Project 1 studies will investigate mitotic gene bookmarking—mitotic retention of transcription factors with target genes on chromosomes for transcriptional regulation in progeny cells—as an epigenetic mechanism to maintain normal mammary epithelial cell identity. We will determine whether compromised mitotic bookmarking by the RUNX1 transcription factor results in initiation of EMT and onset of breast cancer.

The sleep-wake cycle affects the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of proteins critical to AD pathogenesis, such as Aβ and tau, although other processes (e.g., immune response, synaptic function) are also involved. Dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORAs), such as suvorexant, block the interaction of wake-promoting neuropeptides called orexins and induce sleep. DORAs have been found to decrease the ratio of phosphorylated tau to unphosphorylated tau in humans as well as AD pathology in animal models. In this project, we will test the hypothesis that chronic treatment with suvorexant will decrease CSF and plasma AD biomarkers. Optimal trial design is essential prior to launching a full primary or secondary prevention trial with a maximum chance of success.

The successful outcomes of this study will determine if amphiregulin is a viable therapeutic target for radiation-induced fibrosis which will also be relevant for other benign bladder conditions characterized by a fibrotic bladder.,14592577 (contact),"ZWAANS, BERNADETTE MARGARETHA MARIA (contact)","MULLINS, CHRISTOPHER V",2023-04-15,2028-02-29,Acute;Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis;Age;age acceleration;Amphiregulin;Animal Model;Applications Grants;Award;Benign;Binding;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Bladder;Bladder Urothelium;Blood coagulation;Blood Vessels;Body System;cancer radiation therapy;cancer survival;Cancer Survivor;Cancer Survivorship;cancer therapy;Cell Aging;Cell Line;cell type;Characteristics;Chronic;Chronic Kidney Failure;Collection;Colorectal Cancer;conventional therapy;detrusor muscle;Doctor of Philosophy;Early Diagnosis;effective therapy;Environment;Epidermal Growth Factor;Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor;Epithelial Cells;experience;falls;Family;Fibrosis;Health;Heart;Hematuria;Hour;Human;improved;In Vitro;in vivo;Increased frequency of micturition;Injury;Injury to Kidney;innovation;irradiation;Kidney;kidney fibrosis;Knock-out;Knowledge;Life;Liver;Lung;Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri;Malignant neoplasm of prostate;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Mediating;Medical;member;Microscopic;Mission;Modeling;Mus;National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases;Natural regeneration;Newly Diagnosed;Outcome;Outcome Study;overexpression;Pain;Pathologic;Patients;Pattern;Pelvic Cancer;Pelvic Pain;Pelvis;Phase;Phenotype;Pilot Projects;Population;pre-clinical;Pre-Clinical Model;predictive marker;prevent;Price;Process;Productivity;Profibrotic signal;Proteins;Proteomics;Quality of life;quality of life for cancer survivors;Radiation;radiation cystitis;Radiation Fibrosis;Radiation Injuries;Radiation therapy;Research;Research Institute;response;Risk;Risk Factors;Role;Sampling;senescent cell;Severities;side effect;Skin;survivorship;Symptoms;Testing;therapeutic target;Time;tissue injury;tissue regeneration;Tissues;tool;Training;United States;UPK2 gene;urinary;Urination;Urine;Urothelial Cell;Urothelium,The role of amphiregulin in mediating radiation cystitis in cancer survivors,135986,KUFD,Kidney and Urological Systems Function and Dysfunction Study Section[KUFD],NA,NA,2,287742,149626,437368,NA

For example, in type 2 diabetes, overfeeding results in hyperstimulation of mTORC1, which measures nutrients, resulting in inhibition of mTORC2, which then fails to transmit the critical insulin signal and leads to insulin resistance; in this context, it would be advantageous to selectively inhibit mTORC1, preventing this feedback loop, or selectively activate mTORC2, mitigating insulin resistance. The overarching goal of the scientific arm of this project is to learn about the structure and mechanism of mTORC2 in detail so that we could develop these selective strategies for better treatment of diabetes and cancer.",8431403 (contact),"TAYLOR, MARTIN S (contact)","SECHI, SALVATORE",2021-07-15,2026-04-30,Address;Affect;Affinity;Aging;Allosteric Regulation;Apoptosis;arm;Autophagocytosis;Award;Binding;Biochemical;Bioinformatics;Biological Assay;Biology;Biomedical Research;blood glucose regulation;cancer type;career;career development;Catabolic Process;Catalysis;cell growth;cell motility;chemical conjugate;Chemicals;Clinical;Collaborations;Color;Complex;crosslink;Cryoelectron Microscopy;Cytoskeleton;Data;Data Analyses;density;design;Development;Development Plans;Diabetes Mellitus;Disease;Ensure;Eukaryotic Cell;experience;Feedback;feeding;follow-up;Fostering;FRAP1 gene;Functional disorder;gastrointestinal;General Hospitals;Generations;glucose transport;Glucose Transporter;Goals;Growth;Growth Factor;Homeostasis;Hospital Departments;Human;human disease;Hypertension;Impairment;inhibitor;insight;Institution;Insulin;Insulin Receptor;Insulin Resistance;insulin sensitivity;insulin signaling;interest;International;Ion Channel;Kinetics;Knowledge;Learning;Malignant Neoplasms;Maps;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Massachusetts;Measures;Mentors;Metabolic;Metabolic syndrome;Molecular Conformation;Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins;mTOR inhibition;nanobodies;Neoplasm Metastasis;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;novel;Nutrient;Oncogenic;Pathologist;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Pharmaceutical Preparations;pharmacologic;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Physicians;PIK3CG gene;Play;Positioning Attribute;prevent;Principal Investigator;programs;Proliferating;protein complex;Protein Engineering;Proteins;Proteomics;Reaction;Reagent;receptor sensitivity;Regulation;Research;research and development;Research Personnel;Resolution;rho;rho GTP-Binding Proteins;Role;Science;Scientist;Series;Signal Transduction;skill acquisition;small molecule;Solid Neoplasm;structural biology;Structure;Substrate Interaction;success;System;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;therapy development;Time;tool;Training;transmission process;Treatment Failure;Tuberous Sclerosis;Universities;Up-Regulation;Visualization,"Elucidating structural, mechanistic, and allosteric determinants of mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2) signaling.",129824,DDK,"Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases B Study Section[DDK-B]",NA,NA,4,158403,12672,171075,NA

Yet, exactly when to begin lipid-lowering therapy has not been well understood. Despite the increasing rates of ASCVD in US young adults aged 18-39 years over the past two decades, use of lipid-lowering therapy remained low, with <7% of young adults with LDL-C ≥160 mg/dL being treated (vs. ~50% in those aged ≥40 years). It is estimated that 52% US young adults have non-optimal LDL-C ≥100 mg/dL and 7% have LDL-C ≥160 mg/dL.

We have discovered that brain TB induced lymphangiogenesis and increased drainage from the brain. This proposal investigates how lymphatic regulation affects immunity and protection against TB and will test the effects of agents that increase or diminish the brain-draining lymphoid vessels on the outcome of brain tuberculosis in a murine model.

The goal of this project is to define how mice reprogram 37 different RNA modifications comprising their tRNA-specific epitranscriptome to regulate translation in response to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). We have recently discovered a new mechanism of translational regulation in response to stress, in which toxicant exposures cause highly predictive changes in dozens of modified ribonucleosides in the RNA machinery that regulates protein levels, leading to selective translation of codon-biased mRNAs representing families of genes critical for surviving the stress. Using novel mouse genetic models, we will test our proposed mechanism of translational control, define the ETS-programmable epitranscriptome, and determine the importance of RNA modification reprogramming in response to ETS. The results will have major implications for our understanding of tissue and cellular responses to cigarette smoke and they will be broadly applicable to other toxicants and pharmaceuticals. !",6692523 (contact),"BEGLEY, THOMAS J (contact)","TYSON, FREDERICK L",2020-06-09,2026-03-31,4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone;Alkylating Agents;Alkylation;Anticodon;Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons;Arsenic;Automobile Driving;Bacteria;Benzo(a)pyrene;biological adaptation to stress;Cadmium;Cardiovascular Diseases;cell behavior;Cell Survival;Cells;Chemicals;Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease;cigarette smoke;cigarette smoking;Codon Nucleotides;Complex;Complex Mixtures;Cytochrome P450;Data Set;defined contribution;Disease;DNA Damage;Dose;Drug Metabolic Detoxication;Embryo;Environmental Exposure;environmental tobacco smoke;environmental tobacco smoke exposure;Enzymes;epitranscriptome;epitranscriptomics;Etiology;exposed human population;Exposure to;Family;Fibroblasts;Formaldehyde;Future;Gene Expression;Gene Family;Genes;Genetic Models;Goals;Heat shock proteins;Human;In Vitro;Inflammation;Inflammatory;insight;Link;Liver;Lung;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Mammalian Cell;Maps;Mediating;Messenger RNA;Metabolic;Metals;Modeling;Modification;mouse genetics;Mus;Naphthalene;Nose;novel;Organism;Oxidants;oxidation;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacologic Substance;Physical condensation;Play;programs;Proteins;Proteome;Proteomics;Rattus;Reporter;response;Ribonucleosides;RNA;Role;selenoprotein;Smoking;Statistical Data Interpretation;Stress;stressor;System;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissues;toxicant;Toxicant exposure;Transcript;Transfer RNA;Translating;Translational Regulation;Translations;Xenobiotics;Yeasts,"Translational regulation during  cigarette smoking-induced reprogramming of the tRNA epitranscriptome, in vitro and in a mouse smoking model",31529,ZES1,ZES1-LWJ-D(01),NA,NA,5,318040,59950,377990,NA

Placental dysfunction is at the core of many adverse obstetric outcomes seen in pregnancies affected by either, and is thought to have a pivotal role in the development of fetal CHDs, particularly in the vasculopathic context of the DM state.
