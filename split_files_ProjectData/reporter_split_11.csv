We propose to address these limitations by developing a family of flexible spatio-temporal models that leverage and blend the concepts of joint blind source separation and deep learning, which we show can reveal important information missed by existing models.

The way in which those pressures are applied to the amputated limb can be influenced by the position of the prosthesis, but also by the flexibility of the prosthesis. The aim of this study is to help us better understand the relationships between prosthesis user comfort, pressures applied to the amputated limb, and prosthetic foot flexibility to improve Veterans’ experience using a leg prosthesis.

Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure and myocardial infarction. These common heart diseases exhibit a mismatch between metabolic substrate availability and substrate preference: normal mitochondria prefer fats and proteins that most efficiently make ATP, whereas diseased mitochondria reserve fats and protein to repair heart damage and instead metabolize sugars. It was generally accepted that metabolic transitioning in hearts (from preferring fats to sugars or vice-versa) is simply a matter of genetic programming. However, we discovered that the heart must first rid itself of existing mitochondria before replacing them with those having a metabolic preference matching its condition. We identified a key factor responsible for removal, replacement and redistribution of mitochondria during metabolic transitions and developed a new class of drugs to orchestrate and coordinate activities of these factors, matching preferences of the heart’s mitochondria to its available metabolic “menu”. Moreover, by whole genome and exome sequencing we identified rare gene mutations that impair mitochondrial removal and replacement in patients with hypertrophy or heart failure, potentially revealing a new mechanism of heart failure. Our studies provide a fresh understanding of cardiac metabolism and establish the foundation for a completely new approach for managing heart disease by “dialing in” mitochondrial metabolism to optimize cardiac contraction or repair.",1869126 (contact),"DORN, GERALD W.

The proposed study will explore salt-inducible kinase 1 (SIK1) as a novel and promising therapeutic target for TBI. We will investigate whether genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of SIK1 improves long- term TBI outcomes by promoting inflammation-resolving and protective microglial/macrophage responses and WM restoration. We will use state-of-the art approaches, comprehensive and long-term assessment of neurological and psychiatric functions, and both male and female subjects to gain novel mechanistic insights into the role of SIK1 in microglial/macrophage responses, brain inflammation, and WM repair after TBI.

The proposed research is relevant to public health as SLE affects 0.1% of the US population, mainly women of child-bearing age, with 10% mortality in 5 to 10 years. There is an unmet medical need as current treatments are only partially effective and carry significant side effects. Development of new therapies has been hampered by gaps in our understanding of pathogenesis. Metabolic pathways that control the production of energy in the form of ATP and generate reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) have emerged as essential regulators of immune responses and contributors to lupus pathogenesis. Comprehensive metabolome studies indicate that SLE profoundly impacts the utilization of glucose through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) eliciting changes that mimic deficiency of a rate-limiting enzyme, transaldolase (TAL). In turn, TAL deficiency elicits activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), which has been recently identified as a key sensor of oxidative stress and driver of inflammation in SLE. The results of the proposed studies will bring new breakthroughs in our understanding of how metabolic pathways control oxidative stress during development of autoimmunity that can be harnessed for safe and effective treatment of SLE.",1891355 (contact),"PERL, ANDRAS  (contact)","RICE, JEFFREY S",2008-02-01,2026-02-28,Adaptive Immune System;Affect;Aldehyde Reductase;Anabolism;Anti-phospholipid Syndrome;Antibody Formation;Antinuclear Antibodies;Antiphospholipid Antibodies;aryldialkylphosphatase;Arylesterase;Autoimmune Diseases;Autoimmunity;autoimmunity checkpoint;Biological Response Modifiers;Carbon;CD3 Antigens;CD8B1 gene;cell type;Cells;Chronic;chronic autoimmune disease;Circulation;Citric Acid Cycle;comorbidity;Complex;congenic;constriction;Development;DNA;effective therapy;Electron Transport;Enzymes;Etiology;Exhibits;Female of child bearing age;FRAP1 gene;Fumarates;gene therapy;Genetic;Glomerulonephritis;Glucose;Glycolysis;glycosylation;Goals;Hepatocyte;Human;IL17 gene;Immune response;Immune system;in vivo;Inflammation;Inflammatory;innovation;inorganic phosphate;Interleukin-4;Knowledge;Liver;Liver diseases;Longitudinal Studies;Lupus;lupus prone mice;Lymphocyte;Mediating;Medical;Metabolic;Metabolic Control;Metabolic Pathway;Metabolism;metabolome;Mitochondria;Modeling;mortality;Mus;NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone);NADP;Nephritis;novel therapeutics;overexpression;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pentosephosphate Pathway;pharmacologic;Phospholipids;Plasma;Population;Production;Proteins;Public Health;reactive oxygen intermediate;Regulation;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Research;Resolution;Role;sensor;side effect;Sirolimus;stable isotope;Stable Isotope Labeling;stem;systemic autoimmunity;Systemic Lupus Erythematosus;T memory cell;T-Cell Development;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Transaldolase;Work,Metabolic Control of Systemic Autoimmunity,72648,HAI,"Hypersensitivity, Autoimmune, and Immune-mediated Diseases Study Section[HAI]",NA,NA,15,300000,186000,486000,NA

Prognostic profiles of established and novel biomarkers of cell-fusion/TNT formation in the context of a complex glioma microenvironment will be established for different glioma subtypes. The HuR-dependent axis in the regulation of cell fusion/TNT formation at different environmental stress modalities (to include hypoxic, mechanical, metabolic, and cytotoxic stress) will be explored; the quantitative values of HuR inhibitors, including the newly developed and recently patented by our group inhibitor of HuR dimerization SRI4212, in the suppression of the cell fusion and glioma heterogeneity will be provided.",14906368;7075834 (contact),"FILIPPOVA, NATALIA ;NABORS, LOUIS B (contact)","SNYDERWINE, ELIZABETH G",2023-02-08,2028-01-31,Amino Acids;Architecture;Autophagocytosis;Back;Binding Proteins;Biological;Biological Markers;Brain;Cell Communication;Cell fusion;Cell Line;cell mediated gene transfer;Cell Survival;cell transformation;cell type;Cells;Cellular Assay;Cellular Stress;Cerebrum;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Compensation;Complement;Complex;Cytoplasm;Cytoskeleton;cytotoxic;Data;Data Analyses;Development;Dimerization;Disadvantaged;Dissection;Dissociation;Drug resistance;ELAV protein;Event;experimental study;extracellular vesicles;Family;Female;Flow Cytometry;Fluorescence;Gene Expression Profiling;Gene Transfer;Genes;Genetic Transcription;genome wide screen;genome-wide;genome-wide analysis;Genomic Instability;Genomics;Genotype;Glioblastoma;Glioma;Grant;Guide RNA;Heterogeneity;Histologic;Horizontal Gene Transfer;Human;Human Genome;HuR protein;Hypoxia;Immunocompetent;Immunocompromised Host;Immunologics;In Vitro;in vivo;in vivo Model;Inflammatory;inhibitor;knock-down;Knock-out;knockout gene;Lead;Legal patent;Libraries;male;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Mechanical Stress;Mechanics;Mediating;Membrane;Membrane Fusion;Messenger RNA;Metabolic;Microfluidics;Mitochondria;Modality;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Analysis;molecular subtypes;multimodality;Mus;Nanotubes;neoplastic;Normal Cell;novel;novel marker;Nutrient;Organoids;Outcome;overexpression;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;pharmacologic;Phenotype;Phosphatidylserines;Process;prognostic signature;protein complex;Proteins;proteomic signature;Proteomics;receptor;Regulation;Reporter;Resolution;RNA-Binding Proteins;Role;screening;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Signaling Protein;Slice;Source;Stress;Surface;Techniques;therapy development;therapy resistant;Tissues;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomics;Tube;tumor;tumor heterogeneity;Up-Regulation,ELAVL1 role in glioblastoma heterogeneity through intercellular gene transfer mediated by cell fusion and tunneling membrane nanotube formation,269365,DT,Developmental Therapeutics Study Section[DT],NA,NA,2,217313,105397,322710,NA

This greatly enhances rehabilitation strategies that alleviate the burden of hearing loss.

An attenuated live vaccine (BCG) is currently licensed but inadequately controls the TB epidemic. The limitation in protection by this vaccine is still elusive. Therefore, a better understanding of the biological difference between TB bacilli (Mtb) and BCG is essential for generation of a more effective TB vaccine. We have demonstrated that a c-di-AMP phosphodiesterase-deficient mutant of Mtb secretes a large amount of c-di-AMP and induces a strong type I interferon (IFN-I) response in the infected macrophages. In contrast, BCG is unable to secrete c-di-AMP and is defective in IFN-I induction, even when the same gene is deleted. Interestingly, it has been reported that IFN-I links between innate and adaptive immunity, and addition of IFN-I elevates the immunogenicity of BCG. Moreover, c-di-AMP itself has been recognized as a vaccine adjuvant. Based on our understanding of the c-di- AMP-mediated signaling network in Mtb and BCG, we will construct novel recombinant BCG strains that secrete c-di-AMP and induce IFN-I in the vaccinated host. It is very likely that this approach will improve BCG's efficacy. Additionally, the result of this proposal will provide fundamental insights into vaccine strategy against other pathogens.

We have also developed an exosome-based drug delivery system packaged with these synthetic gRNA/Cas9 HBV gene-editing drugs to specifically target human hepatocytes.

Huntington’s disease is inherited as autosomal dominant, which means that an affected parent would have a 50:50 chance of passing the gene to a child. All who inherit the mutation will eventually develop the disease, with impaired cognition (dementia), depression and apathy, and abnormal movements. Patients will need to receive long-term skilled nursing for many years. We discovered an advanced, modified small interfering RNA that can lower the mutant huntingtin that causes HD, setting the stage for this CREATE proposal. Advantages of this therapeutic are long-term activity (about six months) to lower huntingtin after a single injection into cerebrospinal fluid and, critically, widespread distribution and neuronal uptake over the entire non-human primate brain. Our discoveries will set the stage for a new paradigm of therapeutics for an array of neurological diseases, including those with increased numbers of repeats of sequences in genes, such as HD, other CAG repeat expansions, and brain diseases with dementia and movement problems (C9ORF based amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontal-temporal dementia). Our program has public health relevance. Diseases marked by dementia and severe movement limitations are expensive to society, by requiring high level nursing care. Patients are removed from the active work force, thus lowering their earning capacity. These diseases reduce the gross national product. The stress on public health for HD is that the disease affects individuals in the prime of their lives – magnifying the economic burden while intensifying family hardship. Reversing HD or delaying its onset will have economic as well as health benefits.",1944714 (contact),"ARONIN, NEIL  (contact)","BOSHOFF, CHRIS",2020-02-01,2026-01-31,Affect;Age;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis;Animal Disease Models;autosome;Biological Assay;Blood Chemical Analysis;Bolus Infusion;Brain;Brain Diseases;Brain region;CAG repeat;Care given by nurses;Catheters;Cerebral Dominance;Cerebral Ventricles;Cerebrospinal Fluid;Chemicals;Chemistry;Child;Complete Blood Count;Coupling;Crowding;cytokine;DARPP;Data;Dementia;Disease;Dose;Drug Stability;drug testing;Dyskinetic syndrome;Economic Burden;Economics;effective therapy;Evaluation;Exhibits;Family;Female;Filtration;flexibility;Formulation;Frontotemporal Dementia;Genes;Genetic;Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein;Goals;Gross National Product;Head;Health Benefit;High Pressure Liquid Chromatography;Human;Huntington Disease;Huntington gene;Hydrophobicity;Impaired cognition;in vivo;Individual;Inherited;Injections;Lateral;lateral ventricle;lead candidate;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;male;manufacture;Measures;Mental Depression;Messenger RNA;Modification;motor impairment;Movement;Mus;mutant;Mutation;Neostriatum;Nervous System Disorder;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neurons;neuropathology;nonhuman primate;nursing skill;Onset of illness;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Parents;Patients;phosphoramidite;polyglutamine;pressure;Process;process optimization;Production;programs;Property;Proteins;Public Health;public health relevance;research clinical testing;response;RNA Interference;Route;Safety;Secure;Severity of illness;Small Interfering RNA;Societies;Spinal;Stress;Structure;Testing;Therapeutic;therapeutic RNA;Time;Toxic effect;Transgenic Organisms;uptake;Western Blotting;Work,Advancing RNA Therapeutics for Huntington’s Disease,114098,NSD,Neurological Sciences and Disorders B Study Section[NSD-B],NA,NA,5,724756,338259,1063015,NA

Instead of the C-terminal catalytic domain that current EZH2-targeting drugs interfere with, our compound binds to an N- terminal domain that is essential for the gene activation activity and methyltransferase-independent oncogenic effect of EZH2 in estrogen receptor a-negative (ERa-) breast cancer cells. Therefore, our prototype compound downregulated a group of genes that promote cancer cell migration and inhibited the malignant phenotypes of ERa- breast cancer cells that are insensitive to present EZH2 inhibitors.

It is better at protecting the normal tissue and organs surrounding the tumor and is more effective at killing tumor tissue and particularly tumor cells that can normally resist photon radiotherapy. While X-ray therapy using photons travel through our body, carbon ion is like a dart. It stops at a depth inside our body and releases all its energy in the form of a peak dose in the tumor. Since the track stops at a depth, the particle beam does not go through the body, thereby causing less harm to surrounding normal tissues. Since the particles cause DNA damage and the irradiated cells behave as if they are infected by a DNA virus and increase the body’s anti-viral defense system. We are looking into possible immune activating role of CIRT that possibly helps us fight cancer. We are going to look into the immunological consequences of CIRT for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, a devastating disease where we are losing our battle. Our goal is to determine the immunological effectiveness of CIRT compared to XRT (X rays) in mouse pancreatic cancer models for the treatment of both primary and metastatic cancer.

To regulate expression, cells utilize regulatory regions embedded within chromatin, as well as the physical interactions between regulatory regions and genes contained within the three-dimensional (3D) nuclear milieu of each cell. Most genomics assays to study 3D chromatin interactions, including ones developed by Arima, analyze samples in “bulk” – where measurements of chromatin interactions are averaged across all cells in the population, failing to capture the ever-important dynamic chromatin interaction landscape in each cell within a larger tissue or organ system. Lately, academic assays have been developed to analyze chromatin interactions in single cells, but these assays remain inefficient, and complex. Improved and standardized assays are critically needed. Via a self-funded phase-1 project, Arima has overcome these challenges to develop a kit-based solution for efficient mapping of chromatin interactions in single cells. To truly inform gene regulatory mechanisms, chromatin interactions cannot be studied in isolation – instead, it needs to be captured alongside regulatory and gene expression information. Building off the phase-1 kit, Arima proposes to develop a scalable kit-based solution for concurrently mapping all three modalities within individual cells. The development of our new single-cell multiomic solution aims to build new inroads for delineating mechanisms governing cell diversity and function in heterogeneous disease microenvironments, toward ultimately improving the human condition via enhanced discovery, diagnosis, and therapy.",14616140 (contact),"SCHMITT, ANTHONY  (contact)","FLICKER, PAULA F",2023-02-15,2025-01-31,3-Dimensional;Academia;Address;Adoption;Area;Bar Codes;Basic Science;Benchmarking;Biological;Biological Assay;Biology;Body System;Brain;Breast;Cell Separation;Cell Surface Proteins;cell type;Cells;Chemistry;Chromatin;Chromium;combinatorial;commercial prototype;commercialization;Communities;Complex;cost;Data;Data Analyses;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;DNA Sequence;drug discovery;Ensure;Environment;Feeds;Funding;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Regulation;Genes;Genome;genomic platform;Genomics;Health;Heterogeneity;Hippocampus;Human;Human body;human disease;improved;indexing;Individual;Informatics;innovation;insight;Learning;Letters;Libraries;Link;Malignant Breast Neoplasm;Malignant neoplasm of prostate;manufacture;Maps;Marketing;Measurement;Modality;Molecular Biology;Morphology;multiple omics;Mus;Neighborhoods;Nuclear;Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences;Organ;Organism;Output;Phase;Phenotype;Play;Population;Process;product development;Program Development;programs;Proliferating;prostration;protein expression;Protocols documentation;prototype;Publishing;Reaction;Reagent;Regulator Genes;Regulatory Element;Research;research and development;Research Personnel;Resolution;Role;Sales;Sampling;screening;Shipping;single cell ATAC-seq;single-cell RNA sequencing;Source;Standardization;success;symposium;Technology;Testing;Tissues;tool;Translating;Translational Research;Transposase;Validation;webinar;XCL1 gene,"Scalable single-cell workflow for multiomic analyses of chromatin interactions, accessibility, gene expression and cell surface proteins to unravel mechanisms of cellular diversity",149103,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-IMST-K(15)B],NA,NA,2,771608,241776,1084321,NA

Although autografts (from self) and allografts (cadaver) are the currently preferred options, each has its own drawbacks, including limited resources. A potential solution to overcome this graft material shortage is to develop equivalent engineered bone substitutes. This study is designed to test the efficacy of one such bone substitute, a fluoridated calcium phosphate-based bioceramic. In our initial studies, fluorapatite was shown to enhance in vitro differentiation of osteoblasts and stem cells into the osteogenic lineage, but more importantly, resulted in ~90% new bone formation in both, in vivo rat and pig models. The proposed study is designed to develop an autograft-like bone scaffold by incorporating a FA scaffold with a recipient’s own stromal vascular fraction cells—derived from a recipient’s fat tissue—to fill critical-size bone defects.

This work has relevance to public health because it will provide a molecular level understanding of several factors that promote homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair and are essential to the maintenance of genome integrity and tumor suppression. Targeting HR-promoting factors for inhibition could in principle be used to potentiate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) in killing ovarian and breast cancer cells and counteract acquired resistance to PARPi treatment developed by cancer patients.,7855152 (contact),"MER, GEORGES  (contact)","MACARTHUR, LINDA",2020-05-01,2025-02-28,ataxia telangiectasia mutated protein;Biochemistry;BRCA1 gene;Breast Cancer Cell;Cancer Patient;Cellular biology;Chromatin;Cryoelectron Microscopy;DNA Damage;DNA Double Strand Break;DNA Repair;DNA Repair Gene;Double Strand Break Repair;Equilibrium;fascinate;genome integrity;Goals;Health;Histone H2A;Histones;homologous recombination;Human;Knowledge;Lysine;Maintenance;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Molecular;Molecular Chaperones;NMR Spectroscopy;Nonhomologous DNA End Joining;Nucleosome Core Particle;Nucleosomes;p53-binding protein 1;Pathway interactions;Phosphorylation;Play;Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitor;Post-Translational Protein Processing;programs;Proteins;Public Health;recombinational repair;recruit;Research;Resistance;response;Ring Finger Domain;Role;Site;structural biology;Testing;Tumor Suppression;Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes;ubiquitin-protein ligase;Variant;Work;X-Ray Crystallography,Structural biology of DNA damage response in chromatin,136262,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-CB-K(55)R],NA,NA,5,250000,147500,397500,NA
