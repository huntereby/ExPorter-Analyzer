The lack of antimicrobial stewardship and increased use of antimicrobial drugs in animal feeds has led to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens from companion and food-producing animals. The availability of benchtop DNA sequencing platforms provides an accurate whole- genome sequence (WGS) for a broad range of bacteria in less than a day. Thus, identifying genetic determinants of antimicrobial resistance and typing of clinically critical bacterial pathogens help accurately define the transmission of drug-resistant and multi-drug-resistant organisms.

By generating new molecular insight into the mechanisms by which established (VDR) and novel (CAR) NR pathways regulate T cell homeostasis in the small vs. large intestines, our proposal will establish novel biological paradigms and inform the treatment of human inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs).",6885177 (contact);1880555,"SUNDRUD, MARK SCOTT (contact);WEAVER, CASEY T","HUDSPETH, KELLY",2021-09-23,2026-08-31,absorption;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Antigens;Bacteria;Bile Acid Biosynthesis Pathway;bile acid metabolism;Bile Acids;Bile fluid;Biochemical;Biological;Biological Assay;Butyrates;CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes;Cell Physiology;Cells;Cholecalciferol;Circulation;Clinical Management;Clinical Research;constitutive androstane receptor;Crohn&apos;s disease;cytokine;cytotoxic;Data;Detergents;Development;Drug Metabolic Detoxication;Duodenum;effector T cell;Enteral;Enterocytes;Enterohepatic Circulation;Enzymes;epidemiology study;Fostering;FOXP3 gene;Gallbladder;Gene Expression;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Hepatobiliary;Hepatocyte;Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor;Homeostasis;host-microbe interactions;Human;IL10 gene;Ileitis;ileum;Immune;immune function;Immune Tolerance;Immunologics;immunoregulation;improved;in vivo;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Bowel Diseases;insight;Interleukin-10;Intestines;Large Intestine;Libraries;Ligands;Link;lipophilicity;Liver;Maintenance;Mediating;Metabolism;Microbe;microbial;Molecular;mouse model;Mucous Membrane;murine colitis;Mus;novel;Nuclear Receptors;Organ;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Peripheral;pharmacologic;prevent;programs;Publishing;receptor expression;receptor function;Recombinant Proteins;Refractory;Regulation;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Reporting;Residual state;Resolution;response;sensor;Shapes;Signal Transduction;small bowel Crohn&apos;s disease;Small Intestines;synergism;T cell infiltration;T cell reconstitution;T cell response;T-Lymphocyte;T-Lymphocyte Subsets;targeted treatment;Testing;Tissues;Toxic effect;Transcriptional Regulation;Ulcerative Colitis;Vitamin D3 Receptor;Volatile Fatty Acids;Work,Nuclear Receptor Control of T Cell Function in Discrete Intestinal Microenvironments,164772,DHMI,"Digestive System Host Defense, Microbial Interactions and Immune and Inflammatory Disease Study Section[DHMI]",NA,NA,6,716735,131479,848214,NA

When this process is compromised, skeletal myopathies arise with symptoms that vary from mild to severe, and phenotypes that range from muscle weakness and debilitation to death. Myosin binding protein-C (MyBP-C) comprises a family of important regulators of muscle contractility, and is expressed in both skeletal and cardiac muscles. Consistent with this, mutations in the genes encoding the cardiac and slow skeletal isoforms have been causally linked with the development of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and distal arthrogryposis, respectively. Our studies will focus on the involvement of the slow skeletal MyBP-C isoform in a new form of myopathy accompanied by muscle weakness, hypotonia, body deformities and tremor. Our overarching goal is to understand the molecular etiologies underlying this myopathy and the origin of the tremor phenotype.

Nowhere are racial inequities and poor maternal health in starker relief than in Louisiana and Mississippi, which consistently rank last in the country on several health indicators. Urgently needed are interventions at multiple levels, coupled with sustained implementation of programs and policies that have been proven to promote pregnancy health. The Southern Center for Maternal Health Equity is a partnership among the National Birth Equity Collaborative (NBEC), Tulane University, and Ochsner Health System. It joins NBEC’s focus on optimizing Black maternal health through establishing the community as the experts on their health; Tulane’s technical expertise in epidemiology, translational research, and health policy and economics; and Ochsner’s depth in clinical and outcomes research and community-rooted network of clinical care. The overall objective of the Center is to improve maternal health through testing community-prioritized and co- developed strategies. A research center will be established, embedded within ongoing community partnerships and the existing research, training, and outreach infrastructure, to build and strengthen maternal health. The center’s overarching focus is addressing root causes (bias, insufficient access to care, health and social policy) of maternal morbidity and mortality, with a focus on Black women in the Gulf South. The overall research theme is assessing implementation of existing evidence-based strategies and building the evidence base for and translation of novel strategies that drive innovative models of care tailored to the community priorities and needs. The objective of the Research Projects is to assess interpersonal, health system, and policy interventions that combine to create a multilevel approach to advancing maternal health, and evaluate these strategies from cross-cutting perspectives, including cost-effectiveness, clinical care, and health equity. This will be achieved through conducting three research projects: a trial in a large health care system of a multifaceted behavior change intervention to reduce biased treatment (interpersonal level; RP1); adapting and evaluating an enhanced remote monitoring package in low maternity care access areas (health care provision level; RP2); and assessing the effects of Medicaid postpartum extension legislation on maternal health (policy level; RP3). The objective of the Training Core is to provide innovative and transdisciplinary training for early career scholars, aimed at developing a research workforce that can reduce maternal morbidity and mortality locally, regionally, and nationally.

We propose to leverage two remarkable discoveries we have made with our innovative microfluidic platform, mechano-Node-Pore Sensing (mechano-NPS) —breast epithelial cells from younger and older women have different mechanical properties, and cells from young women who are at very high risk of cancer because they carry a germline mutation appeared mechanically “older” than the women’s chronological ages—to develop a breast cancer susceptibility detection system, which will measure the “mechanical age” of a woman’s cells. Clinically useful genetic testing relies on a handful of known monogenic risk traits, but we hypothesize that emergent mechanical properties, measured from a few hundred cells, are a characteristic of the biology that underlies cancer susceptible states, even those that are polygenic or epigenetic in nature and are passed within a family but that have so far defied definition.",9369738;6199069 (contact),"LABARGE, MARK A;SOHN, LYDIA L (contact)","LASH, TIFFANI BAILEY",2017-08-01,2026-02-28,Acceleration;Age;age acceleration;Aging;Biological Clocks;Biology;Biomechanics;BRCA1 gene;BRCA2 gene;Breast;Breast Cancer Risk Factor;Breast Epithelial Cells;Cancer Detection;cancer initiation;Cell membrane;Cell Nucleus;Cell Surface Proteins;Cells;Cellular biology;Characteristics;Chronology;Cities;Classification;Clinical;Complex;Cytoskeleton;Data;design;Detection;detection platform;Devices;Diameter;Disease;Early Diagnosis;Educational process of instructing;Epigenetic Process;Epithelial Cells;Exhibits;experimental study;Family;Family Cancer History;Family history of;Funding;gene network;Generations;Genetic;Genetic Screening;genetic testing;genetic variant;Germ Lines;Germ-Line Mutation;high risk;High Risk Woman;High-Risk Cancer;Human;Immune;in silico;innovation;Intermediate Filaments;Knowledge;Machine Learning;machine learning classification;Malignant Breast Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;mammary epithelium;Measures;mechanical properties;Mechanics;Microfluidics;Modeling;Molecular;molecular mechanics;molecular phenotype;Nature;new therapeutic target;non-genetic;older women;PALB2 gene;Pathway interactions;Patients;Persons;Phenotype;physical property;portability;Portraits;Predisposition;Property;Proteins;Publications;Publishing;response;Risk;Risk Estimate;Risk Factors;screening;Surface;System;Time;Tissues;tool;trait;Validation;Variant;virulence gene;Woman;Work;young woman,Detection of Emergent Mechanical Properties of Biologically Complex Cellular States,24989,ISD,Instrumentation and Systems Development Study Section[ISD],NA,S1,6,60485,23080,83565,NA

A Non-Inferiority Randomized Single Blind Controlled Trial Comparing One and  Two Dose Regimes of Oxfendazole versus a Two Dose Regime of  Triclabendazole to Treat Chronic Fascioliasis PROJECT NARRATIVE  Fasciola hepatica infection causes liver disease in endemic regions, affecting between 2.6 and 17 million people around the world. Treatment is suboptimal. Triclabendazole, the only highly effective drug, is not widely available, and there is concern for the spread of resistant infections in humans. Oxfendazole is a veterinary benzimidazole with a wide anti-helminthic spectrum, highly effective against Fasciola, but it has not yet been evaluated in humans. We have completed animal toxicology and phase I studies of oxfendazole in humans, confirming its high bioavailability and, importantly, safety. We will compare two oral oxfendazole regimens, a single 20 mg/kg dose and two 20 mg/kg doses, against the standard of care of two 10 mg/kg oral doses of triclabendazole for the treatment of human fascioliasis. This study will be the first efficacy evaluation of oxfendazole in a tissue parasite of humans, and a significant step forward towards making this promising drug available for treatment of human parasitic infections.

Due to the increasing number of patients with diabetes and obesity, it is likely that this cohort will expand in the future, which renders this project highly relevant to the VA population. Insulin resistance and chronic inflammation are common in dialysis patients and have been linked to protein-energy wasting, the most important determinant of clinical outcome in this patient population. We hypothesize that the skin and muscle tissue sodium accumulation is a critical mechanism by which chronic inflammatory response and insulin resistance, alone or in combination lead to protein energy wasting in hemodialysis patients.

The primary goal of this study is to determine if real-time, real-life glycemic variability predicts fluctuations in dynamic cognitive function in youth with T1D using a unique and innovative combination of continuous health and cognitive data collection methods, multivariate time- series analyses, and machine learning models. This work, combined with a tailored career development plan, will form the basis of my future work as an independent investigator, which will expand to address how diabetes-related health behaviors (e.g., food choice) impact glucose fluctuations, and subsequent brain health (i.e., cognitive function), using mobile health technologies across different types of diabetes (e.g., T1D and type 2 diabetes across the lifespan), with the ultimate goal of improving treatment recommendations and quality of life for these populations.",14639476 (contact),"RAY, MARY KATHERINE OSBORN (contact)","CENTER, MAUREEN MONAGHAN",2022-09-01,2027-08-31,Acute;Address;Affect;Biological;Blood Glucose;Brain;brain health;career development;Childhood;Chronic;Cognition;Cognitive;cognitive function;cognitive performance;cognitive skill;cognitive testing;Complications of Diabetes Mellitus;Continuous Glucose Monitor;Data;Data Collection;Development;Development Plans;Diabetes Mellitus;Diabetic Ketoacidosis;Disease;Educational accommodation;euglycemia;Event;Food;Future;Gestational Diabetes;Glucose;glycemic control;Goals;Health;Health behavior;Health Technology;high standard;Hyperglycemia;Hypoglycemia;improved;Incidence;Individual;innovation;Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Laboratories;Learning;Life;life span;machine learning model;Measures;Methods;mHealth;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;novel;Oxidative Stress;Participant;Patients;Pattern;peer;Population;Prevalence;processing speed;Quality of life;rate of change;Recommendation;Research Personnel;Risk Factors;Short-Term Memory;skills;Sleep Deprivation;smartphone application;Testing;Time;Time Series Analysis;Translating;type I and type II diabetes;Work;Youth,Impact of Glucose Variability on Dynamic Cognitive Function in Youth with Type 1 Diabetes,131339,DDK,"Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases B Study Section[DDK-B]",NA,NA,3,110800,8798,119598,NA

However, it is now clear that these drugs are not as selective as once thought; drugs such as fulvestrant, raloxifene and tamoxifen, which inhibit classical estrogen receptors in breast cancer, stimulate the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor GPER, potentially resulting in hormone resistance and an increased risk of endometrial cancer. Resistance to aromatase inhibitors often results in continued sensitivity to estrogen receptor-targeted drugs.

Finally, we will use cutting-edge predictive geospatial risk mapping of P. knowlesi occurrence data and environmental and biological covariates in order to inform malaria control programs in Malaysia and other endemic countries in the region; promoting an improved targeted regional surveillance strategy and ability to prepare for and address the risk of increasing P. knowlesi transmission.",16604697 (contact),"RAJAHRAM, GIRI  (contact)","RAO, MALLA R",2021-09-01,2026-08-31,2019-nCoV;Address;anthropogenesis;Antigen Targeting;authority;Biodiversity;Biological;Borneo;burden of illness;Case Study;Cessation of life;Clinical;clinical phenotype;Communicable Diseases;Country;Culicidae;Data;Data Set;Databases;Detection;detection method;detection platform;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Disease;disease transmission;Epidemiological trend;Epidemiology;Evaluation;Fever;forest;Genetic;Genome;Genomics;Genotype;Goals;Government;Health;Health care facility;Hospitals;Human;Immunity;improved;Incidence;Indonesia;Infection;land use;Malaria;Malaysia;Malaysian;Maps;Methods;Microscopy;Molecular;Monitor;Monkeys;novel;Outcome Study;Parasites;pathogen;Pattern;Plasmodium falciparum;Plasmodium knowlesi;Plasmodium vivax;Population;Population Distributions;population genetic structure;predictive tools;Pregnancy;Prevalence;Prevention;programs;Public Health;public health priorities;remote sensing;Reporting;Resolution;Risk;risk prediction;Sabah;Sampling;screening;Serology;Seroprevalences;Severity of illness;Southeastern Asia;Spatial Distribution;spatiotemporal;Structure;surveillance strategy;surveillance study;Surveys;targeted sequencing;Time;tool;training data;transmission process;trend;Update;Zoonoses,Emerging zoonotic malaria in Malaysia: strengthening surveillance and evaluating population genetic structure to improve regional risk prediction tools,160457,CRFS,Clinical Research and Field Studies of Infectious Diseases Study Section[CRFS],NA,NA,4,126246,8717,134963,NA

In this competitive renewal, our collaborative team will test competing theory-driven predictions to understand the neural mechanisms that give rise to iTWs, their putative role in sensory discrimination, whether they induce deleterious information-limiting correlations in spiking activity, and whether they enable a new form of feature-selective sampling of the sensory environment.",12678475;6801866 (contact),"MULLER, LYLE EDWARD;REYNOLDS, JOHN H (contact)","FLANDERS, MARTHA C",2018-09-30,2027-04-30,Action Potentials;Anatomy;Anesthesia procedures;Animals;Appearance;Area;area MT;Attention;awake;Axon;Behavior;Brain;Callithrix;Communication;Computing Methodologies;Cortical Column;Data;Detection;Dimensions;Discrimination;discrimination task;Electrocorticogram;Electrodes;Environment;Exhibits;experimental study;extrastriate visual cortex;falls;Fiber;Funding;Goals;Human;Impairment;improved;in vivo;Individual;Link;Literature;Measurable;Measures;Modeling;Monkeys;Motion;Nature;Neocortex;network models;neural;neural patterning;Neuroanatomy;neuromechanism;Neurons;Noise;novel;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Perception;Performance;Phase;Play;Population;Positioning Attribute;predictive modeling;Property;Publishing;Regulation;Research;response;Role;Sampling;Sensory;sensory discrimination;Source;spatiotemporal;statistics;stem;Stimulus;Stratum Granulosum;Syncope;Testing;theories;Time;Travel;two-dimensional;Up-Regulation;Variant;Visual;Visual Cortex;visual stimulus;Visual System;Work,Spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity and their role in perception,28723,NBVP,Neuroscience of Basic Visual Processes Study Section[NBVP],NA,NA,6,267767,191253,459020,NA

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a brain-based therapy that may be effective for treating PTSD. The theorized mechanism of rTMS is enhancement of emotional flexibility via the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex node of the brain’s cognitive control network. Given this mechanism of action, adding rTMS to an evidence-based psychotherapy (EBP) for PTSD may enhance treatment effects. Written exposure therapy (WET) is a brief EBP for PTSD found to reduce attrition compared to lengthier first line treatments. In this study, we will determine if active rTMS added to WET compared with sham rTMS added to WET results in improved PTSD outcomes.

Project Narrative  Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is an early-life insult that programs developing systems and can predispose the organism to a myriad of health-related conditions, including mental health problems (e.g., depression/anxiety) and immune system dysfunction over the life course. The present proposal will investigate whether altered gut structure and function and shifts in microbiota (bacteria) composition, which are known to increase inflammation in both the brain and the body, may underlie the increased susceptibility to mental health problems seen following PAE.

Diabetic ulcers are very challenging to manage and are the most common cause of leg amputation. Many advanced treatments are expensive and difficult to use in the clinic or at home. Those newer therapies have shown little success in healing diabetic foot wounds. Our laboratory and animal work has suggested that a safe medication, currently used as an eye drop for treatment of glaucoma, can heal these ulcers. We are proposing to test this drop (timolol) directly on the surface of the foot ulcer to see if it can improve healing faster than the current standard of care. To do this, we propose a “randomized controlled trial” with two groups of patients with diabetic foot ulcers: one will receive standard of care with timolol while the other will receive standard of care with a gel (hydrogel, as placebo medicine).",12112768 (contact);1881473,"DAHLE, SARA  (contact);ISSEROFF, ROSLYN RIVKAH",NA,2018-04-01,2024-09-30,"Adrenergic beta-Antagonists;Adverse event;Affect;Amputation;Analysis of Covariance;Analysis of Variance;angiogenesis;Animal Model;Animals;Basic Science;Blinded;Body System;California;Caring;Cells;Characteristics;Chronic;chronic wound;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Management;Clinical Research;clinical translation;Clinical Trials Cooperative Group;Colon Carcinoma;comorbidity Index;Control Groups;cost;Cutaneous;Data;Debridement;Dermatologic;Devices;Diabetes Mellitus;diabetic;Diabetic Foot Ulcer;diabetic patient;diabetic ulcer;Disease;Double-Blind Method;Drainage procedure;Drops;early phase clinical trial;Electronics;Eligibility Determination;Enrollment;Eyedrops;follow-up;Foot Ulcer;Functional disorder;Gel;Glaucoma;healing;Health Surveys;Healthcare;Healthcare Systems;Home;Human;Hydrogels;Impaired healing;improved;In Vitro;Individual;Informed Consent;Isopropanol;keratinocyte;Knowledge;Laboratories;Laboratory Research;Leg;lifetime risk;limb amputation;Logistic Regressions;Lower Extremity;Measurement;Measures;Medical Care Costs;Medicine;Methods;migration;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality;necrotic tissue;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;Outcome Measure;pandemic disease;Patients;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Placebos;Population;pressure;primary endpoint;Productivity;psychologic;Quality of life;Randomized;Randomized, Controlled Trials;re-epithelialization;recidivism;recruit;Recurrence;Reporting;Research;Research Design;Research Personnel;response;Risk;Safety;Sample Size;screening;secondary endpoint;secondary outcome;Serum;Side;Skin;social;Sodium Chloride;standard of care;Sterile coverings;Strawberry nevus;study population;success;Surface;System;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Research;Time;Timolol;Topical application;Translating;translational study;Trauma;treatment arm;treatment group;Ulcer;United States;United States Department of Veterans Affairs;Veterans;Visit;Wages;Work;wound;wound care;wound closure;wound healing",Beta Adrenergic Antagonist For The Healing of Chronic Diabetic Foot Ulcers,1503,SURG,Surgery[SURG],NA,NA,7,NA,NA,NA,NA

Unfortunately, remarkably few studies have evaluated smoking cessation interventions for PLWHA and the available literature indicates that both behavioral and pharmacological smoking cessation interventions yield modest effect sizes and quit rates that are considerably lower than in the general population. A sizable literature, including studies by our research team, indicates that using the nicotine metabolite ratio (which represents the speed at which smokers metabolize nicotine; NMR) to personalize the selection of medications for tobacco use and the MAPS intervention to augment adherence to these medications can optimize treatments for tobacco use among PLWHA. As such, this trial will test these intervention optimization strategies to determine if individually or together these interventions can represent an effective approach to treating tobacco use in this population of smokers. As a major advance for this area of work, we will use rigorous methodology to evaluate these optimization strategies (i.e., a randomized design, biological verification, an ITT approach, and 6-month outcome assessments) and, overall, our approach is consistent with the MOST framework, which has been used to identify intervention components that maximize cessation outcomes. This trial will also assess theoretically derived and empirically based mechanisms through which these optimization strategies affect cessation and explore sub- groups who are more or less responsive to these strategies. In the end, this trial will determine if getting the right medication to the right person and helping to make sure they adequately use the medication optimizes tobacco cessation treatments among PLWHA in order to improve health outcomes for this population.",2131801;6440897 (contact),"GROSS, ROBERT ;SCHNOLL, ROBERT ADAM (contact)","KAUFMAN, ANNETTE R",2019-09-13,2025-08-31,"Address;Adherence;Affect;Aftercare;Age;antiretroviral therapy;Area;Behavior Therapy;Behavioral;Biochemical;Biological;Budgets;Cardiovascular Diseases;CD4 Lymphocyte Count;Characteristics;Clinical Trials;Combined Modality Therapy;Control Groups;Counseling;Data;Dependence;design;Effectiveness;efficacious intervention;Evaluation;Evidence based intervention;Expectancy;follow-up;France;Gender;General Population;genetic variant;Health;Hepatitis C Therapy;HIV;HIV Infections;HIV/AIDS;improved;indexing;Individual;individualized medicine;Intervention;Life;Life Expectancy;Literature;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Mediator;medication compliance;Mental Depression;Metabolism;Methodology;Modeling;modifiable risk;Motivation;multiphase optimization strategy;Nicotine;nicotine patch;nicotine replacement;nicotine use;novel;Outcome;Outcome Assessment;Participant;personalized approach;personalized medicine;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacogenetics;pharmacologic;Pharmacotherapy;placebo controlled trial;Population;Prevalence;Problem Solving;prospective;psychiatric comorbidity;Public Health;Race;Randomized;randomized, clinical trials;Reporting;Research;Risk;Risk Factors;Safety;Self Efficacy;Sex Orientation;side effect;Site;Smoke;Smoker;Smoking;smoking cessation;Smoking Cessation Intervention;Speed;standard care;Subgroup;substance use;systematic review;Testing;therapy adherence;Tobacco;tobacco abstinence;tobacco cessation intervention;Tobacco Dependence;Tobacco smoking behavior;Tobacco use;Tobacco Use Cessation;Toxic effect;Treatment Effectiveness;Treatment Efficacy;treatment optimization;Treatment outcome;treatment research;Underserved Population;varenicline;Variant;Virus;Work",Testing Novel Pharmacogenetic and Adherence Optimization Treatments to Improve the Effectiveness of Smoking Cessation Treatments for Smokers with HIV,243914,ZCA1,ZCA1-RTRB-U(A1),NA,NA,6,165814,49744,215558,NA

Over 35 percent of veterans are obese and many veterans are morbidly obese. Thromboxanes are fatty acid metabolites which are known to mediate inflammation by binding with a protein called thromboxane-prostanoid receptor (TP-R). Our preclinical studies show that mice lacking TP-R gene gained less body weight, and showed improvements in glucose handling on a high fat diet. Our data also show that markers of amino acid metabolism, in particular, histidine metabolism, are dramatically increased in the adipose tissue. Therefore, we hypothesize that blocking TP-R activation may be helpful to promote histidine metabolism in adipose tissue which, in turn, can improve systemic glucose homeostasis in obesity.
