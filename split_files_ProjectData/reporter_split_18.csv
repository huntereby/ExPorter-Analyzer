This dream is challenging to achieve. For example, in humans the 6.2 billion DNA letters that encode the information for building and maintaining our bodies are organized into 46 chromosomes that must be copied and then precisely distributed to produce two identical daughter cells. Errors in the distribution of chromosomes cause birth defects and contribute to the ability of cancers to develop and evade treatment.

However, no studies have ever investigated the role of this cooperation in cancer. Our preliminary data demonstrated that the m6A methyltransferase METTL3 directly binds to a component of NPCs called NUP93 in cancer cells, which ensures the efficient export of m6A-containing mRNAs. Interestingly, a subgroup of the mRNA cargos of the METTL3-NUP93 complex in prostate cancer (PCa) cells are functionally enriched in biosynthesis of androgen, the ligand for the main driver of PCa progression — androgen receptor (AR). Thus, in this study we aim to (1). Elucidate how the METTL3-NUP93 complex selects the target mRNAs and facilitates their nuclear export; (2). Investigate how the m6A-METTL3- NUP93 axis increases the intratumoral androgen levels and stimulates AR activity; and (3). Evaluate the therapeutic potential of targeting the m6A-METTL3-NUP93 axis for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), the most aggressive form of the disease.

Using a newly discovered approach that predicts outcomes, we will measure changes in maternal immunity and cortico-striatal circuits in five highly interactive projects using mouse and NHP models of MIA and individuals with schizophrenia, to determine factors in the mother and offspring that contribute to susceptibility and resilience to different phenotypic outcomes. If successful, our results will identify causal molecular pathways in specific neural circuits critical for developing interventions optimized for the developmental age and sex of at-risk offspring following MIA, as well as biomarkers to predict pregnancies most at risk and approaches to prevent behavioral aberrations in offspring.",8870287 (contact);6592122,"BAUMAN, MELISSA DAWN (contact);CARTER, CAMERON S.","ZALCMAN, STEVEN J",2015-04-01,2026-03-31,Address;Adolescence;Affect;Age;Age Months;at-risk pregnancies;Behavioral;behavioral outcome;behavioral phenotyping;Biological Markers;biological sex;biomarker development;Brain;brain abnormalities;clinically relevant;cognitive control;cognitive disability;Computer Models;Corpus striatum structure;Coupled;COVID-19 pandemic;Development;Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Disease;Dopamine;Early Intervention;Female;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Funding;Gene Expression;Heterogeneity;Human;Image;Immune;immune activation;Immune response;Immune signaling;immunoreactivity;in vivo;Incidence;Individual;Infection;Intervention;Knowledge;Lead;Link;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;male;maternal immune system;Maternally-Acquired Immunity;Measures;Mediating;Mental disorders;Modeling;Molecular;Mothers;Motivation;mouse model;Mus;neural;neural circuit;Neuroanatomy;Neurodevelopmental Disorder;neuroimaging;Neuroimmune;Neuroimmunomodulation;neuromelanin;neuropsychiatric disorder;non-genetic;nonhuman primate;novel therapeutics;offspring;optogenetics;Outcome;outcome prediction;Pathway interactions;Patients;Phenotype;Poly I-C;Population;postnatal period;predictive modeling;Predisposition;Pregnancy;prevent;Psychopathology;Research;Research Personnel;resilience;response;Risk;Risk Factors;Rodent Model;Schizophrenia;schizophrenia risk;sex;Sex Differences;Signal Pathway;single cell genomics;sobriety;Symptoms;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;therapy development;Time;transcriptomics;young adult,UC Davis Conte Center: Neuroimmune Mechanisms of Psychiatric Disorders,106438,ZMH1,ZMH1-ERB-G(01),NA,NA,9,2165043,959922,3124965,NA

OyaGen has discovered that sangivamycin is a highly potent antiviral for CoV-2. Sangivamycin was proven safe when evaluated in human cancer clinical trials performed in the 1960’s. It however was ineffective against cancer and abandoned. In this Phase I SBIR application, preclinical studies are proposed in response to FDA guidance that will be IND- enabling and a prerequisite to Phase I clinical trial safety and pharmacokinetics evaluation in healthy volunteers. The development of sangivamycin as a therapeutic for infected patients is a medical countermeasure for immunocompromised people who may not benefit from vaccine immunization as well as a stop gap therapeutic for new strains of CoV for which current vaccines may be less effective.

Endothelial cells in the pulmonary vasculature mediate recruitment of neutrophils to fight the invaders. Neutrophils inflict the collateral damage to endothelium. Emerging clinical reports implicate this complication in poor outcomes of COVID19 in the high-risk patients. We have devised nanocarriers for targeted delivery of protective agents to endothelium using ligand molecules with specific affinity to these cells. In the pilot studies we have also found that some nanocarriers lacking affinity ligands fortuitously accumulate on the neutrophils residing in the pulmonary vasculature. Using these two types of nanocarriers may permit cell-specific delivery of distinct drugs to endothelium vs neutrophils. Dual drug delivery of distinct pharmacological interventions in these adjacent cells may enable alleviation of the endothelial collateral damage concomitantly with desirable modulation of neutrophil activity.

The heart is a very metabolically demanding organ, but there are still large gaps in our knowledge of cardiac metabolism. We have identified several key metabolic events that take place during and after heart attack, and this project will investigate how manipulating these events can impact the outcome of heart attack. Specifically, under conditions of chronic hyperglycemia such as seen in diabetes, there is an elevation of the metabolite methylglyoxal (MGO), and this is generally thought to be detrimental to the heart.

Together with the beneficial effects of BAT on cardiometabolic health, studies in humans and in rodents made BAT a subject of research efforts to understand and treat obesity and related disorders. However, while BAT is composed of heterogenous adipocyte populations, the understanding of adipocyte heterogeneity and its significance in metabolic physiology and disease has been limited. The results obtained from this study will reveal the physiological function of a distinct adipocyte subpopulation in whole-body energy and glucose metabolism, leading to the identification of poteintial therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity and its associated metabolic diseases.",11206361 (contact),"LIU, MEILIAN  (contact)","HAFT, CAROL R",2022-04-20,2026-03-31,Ablation;adipocyte differentiation;Adipocytes;Adipose tissue;Adult;Aging;Amino Acids;Area;Biogenesis;Biological;Biological Assay;Biology;blood glucose regulation;Brown Fat;cardiometabolism;Cell Differentiation process;Cell Proliferation;Cell Separation;Cells;Development;diet-induced obesity;Diphtheria Toxin;Disease;Energy Metabolism;ERR1 protein;Exhibits;Family;Fatty Acids;Foundations;Futile Cycling;Genes;Glucose;glucose metabolism;Health;Heterogeneity;Homeostasis;Human;Immune response;improved;insight;Insulin Resistance;Knowledge;Link;lipid biosynthesis;Lipids;Lipolysis;Maintenance;Mediating;member;Metabolic;Metabolic Diseases;Metabolism;Mitochondria;Modeling;mouse model;Mus;novel;Obesity;obesity treatment;Oxidative Phosphorylation;Pathway interactions;Physiological;Physiology;Play;Population;precursor cell;Regulation;Research;Research Subjects;response;Rodent;Role;single nucleus RNA-sequencing;Solid;stem cells;Stimulus;Testing;therapeutic development;therapeutic target;Thermogenesis;Tissues;transcription factor;Transcription Factor AP-1;Transcriptional Regulation;uncoupling protein 1;Vascularization,Transcriptional Control of High-thermogenic Adipocyte Development,132643,BMDM,Basic Mechanisms of Diabetes and Metabolism Study Section[BMDM],NA,NA,3,240000,115046,355046,NA
