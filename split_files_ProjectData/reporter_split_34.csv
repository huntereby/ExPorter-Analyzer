Survey data suggests that Black, Hispanic/Latino and White patients agree that non-White patients with cancer are more likely than White patients to receive poor quality care. <5% of the oncology workforce (i.e. medical, surgical, radiation oncology etc.) identifies as an underrepresented minority (URM), which has implications for racial bias, discrimination, and cultural compentency.  The scientific premise of this proposal is based on the integration of spatial transcriptomics and artificial intelligence (AI) pathomics to conduct a differential expression analysis between Black and White patients with HPV-negative OPC. We have previous experience using these approaches as a basis to understand gene expression changes between Black and White patients with HPV-positive OPC, which is a distinct neoplastic entity when compared to HPV-negative OPC. Therefore, we will identify differences in gene expression and stromal and immune cell topology between Black and White patients to identify biologic mechanism(s) that underlies racial disparities with respect to oncologic outcomes. Moreover, within this research proposal, in partnership with minority serving schools, we will create two pathways to address the disparity in the oncology workforce, including translational research. We will address these gaps in the field by pursuing the following specific aims: In Aim 1, we will determine spatial gene expression differences Black vs. White patients with HPV-negative OPC. In Aim 2, we will integrate spatial genomics and AI-guided pathomics between high vs. low pathomic expression within tissue types, controlling for self-reported race. To address the gap in URM in the oncology workforce, in Aim 3 we will work in partnership with City of Medicine Academy and Howard University to provide a longitudinal oncology research experience for high school students and surgical residents. In Aim 4, we will provide a laboratory incubator space in which URM Duke Faculty will be embedded to pursue cancer research, along with mentoring from experienced and committed mentors.  We propose to address these important issues and lack of reliable biomarkers for all patients by integrating state-of-the-art techniques in genomics, pathomics, and AI, in a setting fostering diversity and inclusion.

AAV is an autoimmune disease characterized by patient’s own immune system attacking their vital organs such as the kidney and lung. If untreated, patients can die from kidney failure and lung bleeding. The current treatments are consisted with immunosuppressive drugs that carry high toxicity from long-term use and are not always efficacious to prevent relapses. In this project, we will test the hypothesis that complement, a series of proteins in the blood which are normally involved in protecting us from infection, may misdirect its attack on the kidney and lung to cause the pathological symptoms seen in AAV. We will also test several inhibitors of complement in our model to see if they can prevent or reduce kidney and lung injury.

Intriguingly, pyroptosis- and membrane pore-independent function of GSDMD in secretion of cytokines has been demonstrated in neutrophils, epithelial cells, and T cells. The goal of this proposal is to probe mechanisms for pyroptosis- dependent and novel pyroptosis-independent release of proinflammatory cytokines mediated by GSDMD. The outcome will not only provide novel insights into lytic and non-lytic cytokine release, but may also stimulate the development of therapeutics that target inflammatory disorders.!",12427005 (contact),"XIAO, TSAN SAM (contact)",NA,2020-07-24,2025-06-30,Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Apoptosis;Autoimmune;autoinflammatory diseases;Autophagocytosis;Binding Sites;CASP1 gene;CASP3 gene;CASP8 gene;Caspase;Caspase Inhibitor;Catalytic Domain;Cell Death;Cell membrane;cell type;Cells;Collaborations;Complex;Crystallization;cytokine;Cytolysis;Data;Data Analyses;Disease;enzyme substrate;enzyme substrate complex;Epithelial Cells;Event;Experimental Designs;Goals;Human;IL18 gene;Immune;Immune signaling;Immunity;Infection;Inflammasome;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Bowel Diseases;inflammatory modulation;insight;Interleukin-1 beta;Investigation;Knowledge;Lead;Length;Lipid Binding;Lytic;Macrophage;mast cell;Mediating;Membrane;membrane assembly;Molecular;Molecular Chaperones;Multiple Sclerosis;Mus;neutrophil;Neutrophil Activation;Nonlytic;novel;Outcome;pathogen;Peptide Hydrolases;Peptide Signal Sequences;Play;programs;Proteins;Proteomics;receptor;recruit;Regulation;repaired;Reporting;Role;Serine Protease;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Site;Structure;success;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;therapeutic development;therapeutic target;Tissues;Vesicle,Molecular mechanisms of gasdermin recognition by proteases and autophagy proteins in cytokine release,141350,ZAI1,ZAI1-SB-I,6246,NA,5,250001,152501,NA,402502

SCI often leads to an extremely sedentary lifestyle and marked bone loss that is associated with an increased life-long risk of fractures, morbidity, and financial burden. To date, there is no practical approach to safely and efficaciously treat osteoporosis and bone fractures in Veterans with chronic SCI. This study will test if a novel agent, an antibody against a bone cell receptor (Siglec-15) with unique bone-preserving and bone-building activity, can safely improve skeletal integrity, strength, and fracture healing in a preclinical model of chronic SCI and severe bone loss below the level of lesion. The proposed study will clarify basic mechanisms of novel processes that control bone cell function, thereby improving efforts to reverse SCI-related deterioration of bone. If successful, the proposed treatment can be swiftly deployed in a clinical trial and, ultimately, to clinical care with greater promise to improve skeletal health in Veterans with chronic SCI than that of currently available treatment options.",9834839 (contact),"QIN, WEIPING  (contact)",NA,2024-04-01,2028-03-31,Acute;Adaptor Signaling Protein;Address;Alleles;Amputation;Anabolic Agents;Animal Model;antagonist;Antibodies;Area;Binding;Biological Markers;Blood;blood vessel development;bone;bone cell;bone fracture repair;bone fragility;bone health;bone loss;bone mass;Bone necrosis;bone preservation;Bone Resorption;Caring;Cell Physiology;Cell Surface Receptors;Chest;Chronic;clinical care;Clinical Trials;clinically relevant;Collaborations;Communication;Complex;Contracture;cost;decubitus ulcer;Deep Vein Thrombosis;Defect;Deterioration;Disease;Eligibility Determination;Etiology;exoskeleton;FDA approved;Female;Femoral Fractures;Financial Hardship;Fracture;fracture risk;functional independence;functional outcomes;Future;Gait;Goals;Health;Healthcare;Hip region structure;Hospitalization;Immobilization;Immune system;Immunoglobulins;Impairment;improved;in vivo;Individual;inhibiting antibody;innovation;insight;Intervention;Jaw;Knee;Knockout Mice;Knowledge;Lectin;Lesion;Lifelong disability;Lower Extremity;Macrophage;male;Marketing;Measures;mechanical properties;Mediating;Medical;member;MicroRNAs;Minor;Mission;Modality;Modeling;Molecular;Monoclonal Antibodies;Mononuclear;Morbidity - disease rate;Multiple Sclerosis;Mus;Natural Killer Cells;Nature;Nervous System Disorder;neural circuit;Neurologic;Neurostimulation procedures of spinal cord tissue;novel;novel strategies;Osteoblasts;osteoclastogenesis;Osteoclasts;Osteogenesis;Osteomyelitis;Osteoporosis;Paralysed;Parkinson Disease;Pathological fracture;Persons;Physiologic Ossification;Polysaccharides;Population;Postmenopausal Osteoporosis;pre-clinical;Pre-Clinical Model;preservation;Prevalence;prevent;Process;Property;Quality of life;Rattus;Receptor Cell;Recovery of Function;Regulation;rehabilitation strategy;Rehabilitation therapy;Reporting;Research;Residual state;response;Rheumatism;Risk;Rodent Model;Role;Safety;sedentary lifestyle;sialic acid binding Ig-like lectin;Sialic Acids;side effect;skeletal;skeletal preservation;Space Flight;Spinal Cord Contusions;Spinal cord injury;Stress;Stroke;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;TNFSF11 gene;Torsion;Translating;Trauma;tumor;TYROBP gene;United States;Vascularization;Veterans;Walking;Wistar Rats;Work,The Blockade of Siglec-15 as a Novel Approach to Improve Skeletal Integrity and Fracture Healing in Chronic SCI,4553,RRDA,Spinal Cord Injury/Disorders & Neuropathic Pain[RRDA],NA,A2,1,NA,NA,NA,NA

During pregnancy many women are able to quit smoking but relapse shortly after delivery. Second-hand smoke exposure to newborns and infants increases their risk of both acute and chronic illness. Safe and effective smoking relapse prevention strategies that target the postpartum period are lacking. Sex hormones (progesterone and estradiol) have been shown to influence tobacco use behaviors in women during the postpartum period.

The explosion in genomics over the past several decades has spawned a range of sequencing technologies and approaches that each have advantages and disadvantages over competing approaches, even as the underlying cost drops precipitously. Biomedical scientists now use DNA sequencing technologies not just to catalog the genomes of thousands of species, but to probe genetic variation within species, including multicellular organisms such as plants and animals, fungi, bacteria and viruses. Techniques such as single cell sequencing allow for sampling of normal tissue across time and space, providing an ever more in-depth understanding of normal development and disease progression, while RNA sequencing in its many iterations provides detailed molecular analysis of the genome expression and regulation, informing both our understanding of normal biological processes and the progression of diseases such as cancer and viral infections. The plethora of sequencing technologies together produce an avalanche data, and practitioners must also be trained in the latest bioinformatics tools and approaches to make sense of and interpret the unprecedented volumes of information generated experimentally. The course will enroll a diverse cadre of students ranging from graduate students to group leaders, promoting collaboration and exchange of ideas between faculty and trainees, and thus represents a significant and valuable investment towards accelerating genome research and its application to biomedical and biological questions.

We do not understand how supply constraints such as lack of access versus demand constraints such as preferences affect HCBS use nationally, nor the consequences of use patterns for Veteran-centered outcomes. This rigorous mixed methods study will illuminate multi-level drivers of the largest VA HCBS, homemaker home health aide services (H/HHA). We will also estimate the average treatment effect of H/HHA on Veteran-centered outcomes and total VA costs.

This project will determine the impact of coordinator effort and experience on MFH Veteran direct healthcare costs as well as ED visits and hospitalizations.

As we await a cure for ALS in the future, we need more treatments now. We have shown that pairing electrical stimulation over the cervical spinal cord synchronized with magnetic stimulation over the brain can temporarily strengthen weakened nerve circuits between the brain and hand muscles in people with ALS. The current proposal will take the next step of customizing this intervention for each individual, then applying it repetitively in an attempt to achieve direct clinical benefit on hand strength and function. We will compare the effects of two-week programs of hand exercise versus paired brain-spinal stimulation versus the combination of exercise and stimulation. Not only will this project improve understanding of paired brain-spinal cord stimulation in ALS, but its eligibility criteria will also be more inclusive than most ALS studies, giving more Veterans an opportunity to participate in research aimed at treating this service-connected condition.",1868965 (contact),"HAREL, NOAM Y.
