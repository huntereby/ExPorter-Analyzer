In this award, we propose a series of investigations to better understand why inappropriate tests are ordered, what the cost is to the VA system, and implement a system to reduce inappropriate tests.

We propose to explore, from a multilevel perspective, the perceived barriers and facilitators for adopting energy independence as described by individuals, communities, and policy makers, while also documenting resilience related variables that can explain effective chronic disease management among aging populations in need of electricity-based therapeutic treatments (i.e., renal disease, respiratory diseases, diabetes).",8491018;9387343;2055862 (contact),"PADILLA, MARK B;RODRIGUEZ MADERA, SHEILLA LEE;VARAS-DIAZ, NELSON  (contact)","NGUYEN, EMERALD THAI HAN",2022-02-01,2026-12-31,Address;Adopted;Affect;Aging;aging population;Altruism;American;Area;Caribbean region;Case Study;Categories;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Chronic;Chronic Disease;Climate;commune;Communities;community engagement;community organizations;comorbidity;Diabetes Mellitus;disaster resilience;Disasters;Disease;Disease Management;Disparity;Disparity population;Earthquakes;Electricity;Emotional;Enabling Factors;End stage renal failure;Energy-Generating Resources;Ethnography;Event;experience;extreme weather;Face;food marketing;Fostering;Funding;Geography;Government Agencies;Health;health disparity;health inequalities;Healthcare Systems;Hispanic Populations;Homes for the Aged;Hurricane;improved;Individual;Institution;Interruption;Intervention;Interview;Island;Kidney Diseases;Knowledge;Local Government;Location;Maps;member;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality;Movement;multilevel analysis;Natural Disasters;Not Hispanic or Latino;optimism;Outcome;Patients;Persons;Policies;Policy Developments;Policy Maker;Population;population health;Positioning Attribute;Process;Pueblo Race;Puerto Rican;Puerto Rico;Recording of previous events;Recovery;Research;resilience;Respiratory Disease;response;Restaurants;Role;Rural;Sampling;Self Efficacy;Series;Solar Energy;Structure;Surveys;Technology;Therapeutic;Training;United States;United States National Institutes of Health;Vulnerable Populations;Work,"Disasters, solar energy, and chronic disease management in aging Puerto Ricans",72613,CIHB,Community Influences on Health Behavior Study Section[CIHB],NA,S1,3,20104,9549,29653,NA

Findings from this large longitudinal dataset may contribute to the scientific knowledge on the potential value of investing modest economic resources in poor and vulnerable girls during early adolescence and how these resources may offer long-term protection against known HIV, cognitive and mental health risks, with potential replicability in other low-resource countries.",9990538;8029116 (contact);10336642,"NAKASUJJA, NOELINE ;SSEWAMALA, FRED M (contact);THAMES, APRIL D","ALLISON, SUSANNAH",2017-08-01,2029-03-31,"Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome;Address;Adherence;Adolescence;Adolescent;adolescent brain development;adolescent mental health;adolescent woman;Adult;Affect;Africa South of the Sahara;aged;AIDS prevention;Alcohols;Area;arm;Behavior;Benchmarking;boys;Brain;Caring;Charge;Cognitive;cognitive development;cognitive function;Communities;community burden;cost;cost effectiveness;Cost-Benefit Analysis;Costs and Benefits;Country;Decision Making;depressive symptoms;design;Development;Discrimination;drug misuse;early adolescence;economic impact;Economics;Emotional;empowerment;Enrollment;evidence base;Family;family support;Feeling suicidal;Fees;Female Adolescents;Future;Gender;Generations;girls;Health;high risk;HIV;HIV Infections;HIV risk;HIV Seronegativity;HIV/AIDS;improved;Incentives;Income;Inequality;Informal Social Control;Intervention;Investments;Knowledge;Life Cycle Stages;Link;Long-Term Effects;longitudinal dataset;male;Mediating;Mental Depression;Mental Health;neural network;Outcome;Participant;peer;peer influence;Poverty;pre-exposure prophylaxis;Prevalence;Prevention program;programs;Randomized, Controlled Trials;Recommendation;Reporting;Research;Research Priority;Resources;retention rate;Rewards;Risk;Risk Behaviors;Risk Taking;Rural;Rural Community;Schools;Secondary Schools;Self Concept;Sex Behavior;sexual risk taking;skills;social situation;social stigma;substance use;Testing;theories;Uganda;United States National Institutes of Health;vulnerable adolescent;Woman;World Health Organization;young adult;young woman;Youth","Suubi4HER Round 2: Examining the Long-term Impact of A Combination Intervention on HIV Prevention, Care and Mental Health for Adolescents and Young Women in Uganda",113486,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1 CCHI-K (02)],NA,NA,6,535664,143609,679273,NA

I-Corps Team The I-Corps team will be formed with three key members of the leadership team. The team has actively been involved in product development and is currently building commercialization strategies for the launch of this assay via a targeted “early access” launch in 2025. All team members have previous experience with startups in the life science industry. Members also have commercial launch, market research, and diagnostics industry experience which will allow the team to effectively carry out the requirements of the I-Corps grant. The Corporate Officer representative will be Diana Caldwell, CEO, who is an accomplished and recognized serial life science entrepreneur with over 25 years of experience in both large corporate and small entrepreneurial environments. Throughout her career, she has successfully driven organizational growth, developed, and implemented strategic business plans, raised capital, launched novel life science products, and directed successful teams. Diana has been leading Amplified Sciences for three years, has decades of life science product launch experience, and has in-depth knowledge of the technologies and the markets that we will be addressing in carrying out the objections of the I-Corps grant. Dan Sheik, PhD, Director of Research and Technology at Amplified Sciences, is the PI on this working to improve the diagnostic sensitivity of assays using proprietary rhodamine dyes and the ultrasensitive Surface- on early detection of pancreatic cancer to improve the quantitative resolution of biomarkers to give a clearer picture of pancreatic cyst malignancy. Dan’s assay development experience and scientific skills provide the project with the technical expertise that will be necessary to meet the objectives of the I-Corps grant. John R. Ridge will round out the team as the Industry Expert. John joined Amplified Sciences as 20 years of experience working in Market Access and cross functionally with commercial functions for Medical Device and Diagnostics companies. Additionally, he worked on the payer side early in his career thus bringing a well rounded industry perspective to the challenges and opportunities in successful commercial launch and reimbursement efforts. Before joining Amplified Sciences as an employee, he served as an Advisor for the company and is familiar with the company’s new technologies and will use that knowledge and prior diagnostic product launch experience to contribute effectively to the team’s efforts. The I-Corps grant will be valuable to the team as it will allow us to further build on initial research that was completed by student interns. That project identified potential key targets that we could reach out to with the discovery questions, and that would allow us to gain key data to assess customer needs, understand commercial adoption barriers, explore the value this innovation provides, and develop potential options to position the new assay. All team members will be able to meet the time intensive time requirements outlined in the program. This proposed team is also able to benefit maximally from the I-Corps program as it has already conducted background research into competitive IP landscape, competitors’ publications, customer needs, value proposition, market assessment and reimbursement models. With new knowledge and information gained from the I-Corps program, the team is capable of and looks forward to a thorough vetting from potential customers and industry experts of these early concepts and refining, realigning and/or pivoting their initial plan to maximize commercialization success. 3. Potential Commercial Impact and Target Customers Research indicates that the pancreatic cancer diagnostics US market is a robust +$2.9 billion (TAM). Over 3 million patients are diagnosed annually in the US with a pancreatic cyst, and it is -FNA procedure to sample cyst fluid. A conservative estimate of ~300,000 patients tested annually yields a serviceable available market (SAM) of at least $300 million in the US. Amplified Sciences’ sales revenue for the rule-in high-grade vs. low- grade assay forecast at $80 million five years post launch. This represents 20,000 tests and a 20- 25% market share. The proposed customers would be centers of specialty gastroenterologists (30-50), advanced/interventional endoscopists, specialty fellows, pancreatic cyst clinics, and high-risk pancreatic cancer centers. Within this market, there is a large unmet medical need for earlier detection of pancreatic cancer given that it is the third deadliest cancer with the highest mortality rate in the US. Patients diagnosed with pancreatic cystic lesions are at increased risk for pancreatic cancer and represent a window to early detection, and monitoring and surgery on these patients is expensive and associated with complications and morbidity. One of our specific plans for the I-Corps program is to conduct interviews with the customer targets and influencers. Clinician influencers include pancreatic biliary surgeons, oncologists, and hospital pathologists. Although the customer physician targets are clear, there are also key decision makers with commercial and government payers. Their role is to determine if a new novel assay should be covered and paid when a bill is submitted for a lab developed test by the diagnostic company. In the commercialization of a new assay, it is critically important to assess payers’ thoughts and gain their inputs on the clinical value of the assay. As such, they will need to be a target of the project as well. In addition, there is no current standard testing for grading dysplasia, with multiple attempts showing little promise. In fact, peer reviewed studies have demonstrated that standard cytology fails over 70% of the time in this disease state due to acellularity of the cyst fluid sample and the low volume of fluid that is successfully procured during an EUS-FNA. Given the lack of laboratory- based solutions, clinicians and payers are very receptive to novel diagnostics with increased sensitivity and specificity vs. currently available diagnostic competitors that can provide improved outcomes and cost savings. A competitive advantage rests in our ability to provide clinicians access to an assay that delivers higher content diagnostic information about the malignant potential of the mucinous pancreatic cyst population. By analyzing competitors and similar lab developed test models across other cancers, a target price range between $2000 - $3000 has been established but needs to be confirmed. This price point has been established considering several factors: material and production cost, reimbursement of similar assays, and likelihood to be able to cross-walk to an existing test in a different disease state. It is important to note that the price point is sensitive to the assay reimbursement rate that would be determined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or the Medicare Administrative Contractors. We are open to revisiting these additional factors and possibly revising this price point based on interviews with a much larger pool of stakeholders of the assay. 4. Project Plan - readiness, and adaptability to standard clinical lab test processes. Amplified Sciences seeks to -certified lab that are novel and demonstrate superior accuracy with a keen desire to stretch the capabilities and acceptance of SERS as a detection platform. These efforts to validate biomarkers of dysplasia in mucinous pancreatic cysts in this Phase 1 are expected to produce assays that have demonstrated clinical proof of concept in a small retrospective cohort. These assays will be ready for further analytical validation and larger hypothesis, Amplified Sciences will use the protocols developed in AIM 2 to reanalyze the 100 clinical samples from AIM 1 and compare the diagnostic results after optimization with a second nested-cross validation study to those of AIM 1. It is expected that the results using Amplified Sciences’ assay platform will prove to be at least non-inferior to the results found in the AIM 1 validation studies. Importantly, the new assays will use low sample volumes, allowing for the multi-analyte panel to be tested on -volume analyses prevent interruption of current standards of care while this panel is introduced to the clinic. Currently we are continuing optimization of marker assays to our SERS platform before final clinical sample testing. This is expected to be completed prior to submission of our Phase II application. Assuming that these results are promising, the company is prepared to execute the -certified lab in Irvine, California. The company will execute the analytical validation and clinical validation protocols required to regulatory milestone, the company will prepare for a targeted early-access launch to advanced endoscopist gastroenterologists targeted by the end of 2025. Phase II will combine a set of multiplexed low-volume assays ready to commercialize as lab -site prospective sample (n = 300) collection study.",15608438 (contact),"SHEIK, DANIEL  (contact)","LOU, XING-JIAN",2023-05-01,2024-10-31,accurate diagnostics;activity marker;Address;Adoption;algorithm development;assay development;Benign;Biliary;Biochemical;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biological Sciences;biomarker validation;Businesses;California;Cancer Center;Cancer Diagnostics;Capital;career;Caring;Certification;Chemicals;Clinic;Clinical;clinical diagnostics;Clinical Investigator;clinical translation;cohort;Collection;commercial launch;commercialization;Contractor;cost;Cost Savings;Cyst;Cyst Fluid;Cytology;Data;Death Rate;Detection;detection method;detection platform;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;diagnostic assay;Diagnostic Sensitivity;Diagnostic tests;diagnostic value;Disease;Doctor of Philosophy;Dyes;Dysplasia;Early Diagnosis;Employee;Environment;Evaluation;experience;Fine needle aspiration biopsy;Funding;Gastroenterologist;Government;Grant;Growth;high risk;Hospitals;Image;improved;improved outcome;Industry;innovation;Innovation Corps;insight;Internships;Interruption;Intervention;Interview;Knowledge;Laboratories;Leadership;Ligand Binding;Liquid substance;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Malignant Neoplasms;Market Research;Marketing;Medical;Medical Device;medical specialties;Medicare;member;Modeling;Monitor;Morbidity - disease rate;Mucinous;new technology;novel;novel diagnostics;Oncologist;Operative Surgical Procedures;Pancreas;Pancreatic Cyst;Pancreatic cystic neoplasia;Pathologist;patient stratification;Patients;Peer Review;Peptide Hydrolases;Phase;Physicians;Population;Positioning Attribute;prevent;Price;Procedures;Process;product development;Production;programs;progression risk;prospective;Protocols documentation;prototype;Publications;Readiness;Research;research clinical testing;Resolution;Rest;Retrospective cohort;Rhodamine;Risk;risk stratification;Role;routine imaging;Sales;Sampling;Science;Screening procedure;Secure;Sensitivity and Specificity;Side;Site;skills;Small Business Innovation Research Grant;Statistical Data Interpretation;Stretching;Students;success;supply chain;Surface;Surgeon;Survival Rate;Technical Expertise;Technology;Testing;Thinking;Time;Translating;United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services;Validation;validation studies;Vendor;Visit;Walking;Work,Translating a Novel Assay for Risk Stratification of Potentially Malignant Pancreatic Cystic Lesions,277913,NA,NA,NA,A1S1,1,55000,0,55000,NA

Treatments claiming to reduce the sound of tinnitus show promise, but they need reliable measures of tinnitus features such as its loudness, pitch, and maskability. The previous study found age-specific standard ranges for these measurements using our computer-automated Tinnitus Evaluation System (TES). The new study will expand the previous study to: represent all age groups equally, obtain test-retest data over an extended period of time, test a pre-test training program for tinnitus pitch matching, and update the TES for ease of use in VA Audiology clinics.

RNA molecules encode this information in both their primary sequences and in complex structures that form when RNA folds back on itself. The broad and fundamental importance of RNA structure is clear, but there remains a profound knowledge gap: We generally have only rudimentary understanding of RNA structure across vast regions of most messenger and non-coding RNAs. We need to move beyond modeling RNA structure to directly detecting through-space structural communication and interactions in cells. In essentially every instance where we have applied rigorous and quantitative technologies to study RNA structure-function interrelationships, new insights regarding biological regulatory mechanisms have emerged. We have also shown that RNA elements with higher-order structures are more likely to contain high-information-content clefts and pockets that bind small molecules, broadly informing a vigorous field of RNA-targeted drug discovery. Our work has sustained long-term impact due to pursuing three overarching opportunities. First, the project focuses on development of decisive, concise, and broadly implementable technologies for discovering and assessing higher-order structure in RNA. Second, this project applies these direct and experimentally concise methods to challenges of broad importance, from identification of structures essential for replication of pathogenic viruses to understanding how RNA conformational ensembles govern transcriptional gene regulation and pre-mRNA splicing. Third, understanding the propensity of RNA to form higher-order structures – and often clefts and pockets – opens up the possibility of targeting these motifs with small molecules, an opportunity we will exploit with the long-term goal of inventing facile and straightforward strategies for creating RNA-targeted therapeutics. Overview of Need for Equipment Purchase This administrative supplement requests funds to purchase and replace thermocycler instruments to be used by the Weeks research laboratory, which is currently supported by NIGMS R35 GM122532 (Dr. Michael Sakalian, PO). The cost of the essential instruments is $19,999.98 and is outside the range of equipment that can be purchased in the context of the current budget. Our grant budget is fully encumbered, and will zero out, for the next year. The requested instrument will be shared and used by multiple members of the Weeks group. The need for replacement thermocyclers was unforeseen at the time of the original research proposal. Thermocyclers are essential for all modern RNA genomics experiments. Our current, non-functional instruments were purchased in 2012, twelve years ago. Stuff breaks, and we absolutely need to replace these instruments to do our MIRA-funded work. We need two instruments due to the volume of work and sequencing that we do. Diverse researchers will benefit from this purchase. The thermocycler instruments will be used by all Weeks group members, from undergraduates to postdocs (14 total). The simple operating design and user interface of the requested instruments will allow all members of the lab to use the instruments efficiently. Plan for training and upkeep. The instruments will be maintained by the Weeks lab. A lead user in our laboratory will be assigned and will facilitate training and ensure the instruments operate efficiently.",1860696 (contact),"WEEKS, KEVIN M (contact)","SAKALIAN, MICHAEL",2017-06-09,2027-05-31,Acceleration;Administrative Supplement;Adopted;Back;Binding;Biological;Biomedical Research;Biotechnology;Budgets;Cells;Communication;Complex;cost;design;Development;drug discovery;Elements;Ensure;Equipment;equipment acquisition;experimental study;Funding;Gene Expression Regulation;Genetic Transcription;genomic RNA;Genomics;Goals;Grant;Higher Order Chromatin Structure;insight;instrument;invention;Knowledge;Laboratories;Laboratory Research;Lead;Libraries;Massive Parallel Sequencing;member;Messenger RNA;Methods;Modeling;Modernization;mRNA Precursor;National Institute of General Medical Sciences;parent grant;parent project;pathogenic virus;Postdoctoral Fellow;Preparation;programs;Research;Research Personnel;Research Proposals;Research Support;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction;RNA;RNA Conformation;RNA Folding;RNA Splicing;RNA-targeting therapy;small molecule;Structure;Technology;Time;Training;undergraduate student;Untranslated RNA;Work,Administrative Supplement to Purchase Thermocycler Instruments,122532,MRAA,Maximizing Investigators’ Research Award A Study Section[MRAA],NA,S1,8,20000,0,20000,NA

Wounded soldiers and Veterans often receive critical lifesaving antibiotics to treat and prevent bacterial infections, which also put them at a high-risk for a drug-induced ototoxicity. Increasing evidences suggest substantial noise- and drug-induced hearing loss can include synaptopathy, which may be reversible, if treated on time.

Aim 1 is focused on characterizing functional natural variation in telomerase function, expression, and enzymatic activity. We also employ innovative and comprehensive genome-wide screens to identify novel trans-regulators of TERT expression and inhibitors and activators of in vivo telomerase activity. In Aim 2, we perform a series of experiments to characterize the role of previously identified candidate genes in telomere biology and length control. We also exploit several cutting-edge genomic approaches to identify additional regulators of telomere length. We have developed an effective research pipeline for candidate gene analysis that led to the identification of several novel genetic factors and pathways and we anticipate making more new discoveries. Our high-throughput assays allow us to screen up to 20 different T-DNA mutants for telomere phenotypes simultaneously. Genetic and transgenic experiments to validate the role of candidate genes in telomere length control include: 1) knock-out analysis of candidate genes for defects in telomere length; 2) transgenic rescue experiments; and 3) quantitative complementation tests. Collectively, these studies will reveal and characterize the complex genetic landscapes that underlie natural variation in telomere length set point.  Both Aims 1 and 2 rely heavily on the measurement of telomere length in hundreds of various transgenic mutants and natural populations of Arabidopsis. This Southern blotting technique requires the use of radioactive P32 oligonucleotide probes to hybridize telomeric DNA in gels and subsequent scanning the signals with a Phosphor Imager. Our lab previously had a Typhoon FLA 7000 machine suitable for these assays, but unfortunately this machine is now not operational. We had a Cytiva technician come to the lab to look at it, and he had indicated that the unit cannot be repaired, as this model is so old that Cytiva is no longer manufacturing parts or providing any service. Thus, currently we do not have a Phosphor Imager, and no other lab at Marshall University has this type of equipment for imaging.  We are currently using X-ray films as an alternative. However, this method has major crucial drawbacks and limitations compared to Phosphor Imaging which substantially slows down work and adds unnecessary costs. Specifically, Phosphor imaging provides a much greater linear dynamic range and higher sensitivity than X-ray film when detecting radiolabels. This allows very precise quantitation of nucleic acids which is incredibly important for our high-throughput project and not really sustainable long-term with X-ray films. With P32 half-life being only 2 weeks, without digital imaging we simply cannot analyze the necessary number of samples with X- rays before the signal disappears, especially when some assays often need to be repeated. Having access to a Phosphor Imaging capability is a major necessity, and it will be routinely used for the duration of the project.  I have received a quote for Azure Sapphire FL Phosphor Imager, which is the next generation of biomolecular imagers with many benefits and extra features over the Typhoon models. It features customizable and user- changeable optical modules, laser based scanning system supporting 375 nm excitation to 900 nm emission, adjustable Z focus, 5-1000 micron resolution. Through the use of laser excitation and photon multiplier tube (PMT) detection, Sapphire FL is able to scan storage phosphor screens with exceptional dynamic range and image quality; these features are integral to the success of our study and provide unparalleled advantages for everyday use in comparison to X-rays. Sapphire FL Phosphor Imager is essential for both aims of our research project and will substantially speed up our progress.  The quote for Sapphire FL Phosphor Imager covers the price of the Imager, Phosphor Standard Optical Module, dedicated Desktop Workstation with External High-Resolution Monitor for Sapphire FL, shipping & handling, device installation and training of the personnel, and AzureSpot Pro software for downstream analysis. Warranty period is for 1 year. The future recurring costs associated with the requested equipment include additional years of service contract, which will be covered through PI’s startup funds.",11144736 (contact),"SHAKIROV, EUGENE V (contact)","VATAKIS, DIMITRIOS NIKOLAOS",2018-08-01,2026-02-28,Administrative Supplement;Arabidopsis;Architecture;Biological Assay;Biology;Candidate Disease Gene;candidate identification;Complex;Computer software;Contract Services;cost;Dedications;Defect;Detection;Devices;digital imaging;DNA;Doctor of Philosophy;Epigenetic Process;Equipment;experimental study;Funding;Future;Gel;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Complementation Test;Genetic Polymorphism;genome wide screen;Genomic approach;Genotype;Grant;Half-Life;high throughput screening;Human Resources;Image;imager;imaging capabilities;in vivo;inhibitor;innovation;Knock-out;Lasers;Length;manufacture;Measurement;Methods;Modeling;Monitor;Mouse-ear Cress;mutant;National Institute of General Medical Sciences;next generation;novel;nucleic acid quantitation;Oligonucleotide Probes;Optics;Pathway interactions;Phenotype;Phosphorus 32;Photons;Population;Price;Principal Investigator;Radioactive;radiotracer;Recurrence;repaired;Research;Research Project Grants;Resolution;Roentgen Rays;Role;Sampling;Sapphire;Scanning;Series;Services;Shipping;Signal Transduction;Southern Blotting;Speed;success;Support System;T-DNA;Techniques;Telomerase;telomere;Training;Transgenic Organisms;Tube;Universities;Variant;Work;X-Ray Film,Genetic and epigenetic architecture of natural telomere length variation,127402,GVE,Genetic Variation and Evolution Study Section[GVE],NA,S1,8,52946,0,52946,NA

Our overall research goal has not changed and our access to high-end microscopy (point-scanning, high-resolution, multi-photon) in our campus’ Light Microscopy Core Facility (LMCF) has not changed. The Supplemental request is for a replacement of our 27-year-old microscope (a NIKON E800, purchased in 1996 on NIH GH52953). The E800 has been a workhorse and contributed heavily to my entire portfolio of publications with a cell biological orientation (the most relevant to the project is listed in my Biosketch), including a new paper in Cell, listed as the last entry in my Biosketch. There have been many generations of microscopes marketed by NIKON since the E800. While we coped the best we could with out-dated technology, the functionality of our microscope has been on a slow decline over the past decade due to increasing difficulty in acquiring replacement parts. In the last service call (January 2023), I was warned the E800’s capability would continue to decline to below the limits of operational needs (such as moving shutters in and out, filter turrents etc.; yes these are all in manual mode).  The requested microscope will provide hours of access for training and pilot experiments prior to using the LMCF facility, which charges by the hours on all microscopes. Our original budget has depended on the E800 (located just steps from my office and lab). Declining ability to do so translates to a full reliance on the LMCF (hourly users-fees are set between $22.05–$26.25 for point-scanning confocals, and $33.60 for multi- photon). The added costs will be unsustainable. It will also incur extraordinary hardship for the many hours of on-hand training (typically provided by the PI and a senior trained personnel, to postdoc) needed to initiate each new trainee. Research strategy  The goal is to achieve the originally planned research using the requested microscope (a NIKON Ti2-E microscope with CREST V2 spinning disc components). The new microscope will be many generations advanced from the NIKON E800 and the added spinning confocal capability will provide an enhanced imaging capability before advancing to the microscopes in the LMCF. Proposed activities: A. Pollen and pollen-derived molecular trigger-induced stigmatic cell responses to initiate pollen hydration and germination. Figs. 1, 2 are examples of how we shall meet our imaging needs.  • Typically (Fig. 1A), we monitor hydration for 10-30 minutes (Wildtype completes in 10, mutants take longer). We use epifluorescence to monitor the rise or fall in nitric oxide (NO) or ROS (not shown), which do not require the resolution of confocal imaging, but extended time on the microscope. The next is pollen tube emergence and penetration of the stigmatic papilla cell (Fig. 1B). This relies on confocal imaging. Fig. 1B shows one hr after pollination, when a pollen tube is seen attached to a papilla cell. The goal is to monitor pollen hydration and tube germination with papilla cell responses [revealed by, e.g., Ca2+, water channel (see Fig. 2) cell wall quality reporters] over the time course. The requested microscope will provide on-hand training for students and collect preliminary observations for the optimal time frame for each response to guide the more refined imaging needs at the LMCF. Fig. 1A. (upper) Wide-field imaging  of stigmatic NO response upon  pollination. (Lower) Bright-field, time  course of wildtype pollen hydration  from time of deposition to full  hydration (published). Fig. 1B. Point-  confocal scanning image of a  germinating pollen tube (acquired in  LMCF). New student acquired images.  • Fig. 2 (next page) shows how we shall examine stigmatic cell responses to pollen-derived molecular trigger (pollen coat protein-Bγ, PCP-Bγ) partially on the requested microscope (Fig. 2A) and partially at the LMCF (Fig. 1B). Typically, and using Ca2+ dynamics as an example, we screen the efficacy of recombinant molecules by bright-field (top) and epifluorescence (bottom) (Fig. 2A, the green fluorescence shows extracellular Ca2+, reflecting efflux from the papilla).  The determined optimum reagent, dosage and time frame (requiring  considerable microscope time) will inform on experimental conditions used for confocal microscopy to acquire refined data (Fig. 2B,  acquired by point-scanning confocal at the LMCF).  • Fig. 2C shows how the trigger PCP-Bγ had impacted the activation (reflected by higher plasma-membrane intensity of the probe aquaporin- Cherry). The images were acquired on a Crest V2 demo session. The proof of principle experiment provides solid support and justification to move forward to higher spatial resolution point-scanning confocal or high-resolution STORM microscope at the LMCF. The savings based on using the requested microscope will allow higher qualitative and quantitative achievements.  Fig. 2A (legend). Pollen trigger PCP-Bg induced Ca2+ efflux from papilla cells. Co-imaging (upper, bright-field; lower, epifluorescence). Pilot experiments to  establish MBP-PCP-Bg has higher efficacy. Fig. 2B. Point-scanning confocal  image of MBP-PCP-Bg-triggered papilla cell Ca2+ efflux, permitting considerably higher resolution details. Fig. 2C. PCP-Bγ-induced enhance membrane  association of aquaporin, facilitating water transfer to hydrate deposited pollen  grains. Acquired by a demo on CREST V2. B. Another goal of the parent grant is to reveal how the target female cells respond when pollen tubes approach, arrive, penetrate and burst to release sperm for fertilization. We can refine the temporal and spatial windows (e.g., see Fig. 3A,B, under semi-in vivo condition where access to imaging is easier), which takes a lot of time, on the requested microscope. The we migrate to the LMCF to monitor detailed dynamics of ovule responses. Fully in vivo experiments are even more challenging. Fig. 3C shows a typical time course for in-vivo pollination. Typically, we establish the pollen tube front (arrow) migration rate using the requested microscope. The information will inform on how to set up higher-resolution experiments that monitor the female cell dynamics during pollen tube entry and burst with the microscopes in the LMCF.  Fig. 3. (A) Pollen tube growth and  targeting under semi-in vivo conditions.  (B) Monitoring the process over three to  four hours from the start of observation  till completion of pollen tube burst and  sperm release in our basic set up for  these experiments. these were acquired  by the E800 a couple of years ago. (C)  typical preliminary experiments to define  the pollen tube front achievable in the  E800 and will be done on the requested microscopes. C. Training and maintenance plan. Four frequent users (currently one senior research associate, 3 graduate students) and 3-4 new trainees (1 new graduate student, 3 undergrads) will be initiated on the microscope. The PI and senior research associate (Dr. Mingche Liu) will be responsible for training; Dr. Liu will be charged with upkeep duties and training of students on general equipment care after each use. The proximity of the requested microscope to the lab and PI’s office allows close supervision at the beginning and drop-in help and consultations as needed. We will also have access to consultation with the LMCF staff as needed and for transition to use the facility there.

Despite reported success with neurotrophic or neuroprotective therapeutic drugs or cell replacement therapies in animal models of PD, none have led to a clinically effective treatment avenue, curing all aspects of the disease complex. Inflammation in the brain, in particular, activation of microglia has been increasingly associated with the ongoing pathogenesis of PD. Aging impacts immune cell phenotype, reducing the efficacy some therapeutics. We have identified exosomes derived from human adipose derived stem cells as a potent modulator of inflammation.

It is critical to produce probes that would function ratiometrically as that would negate erroneous measurements based on differential diffusion rates. The syntheses of these probes involve many steps and at the end of each stage, as the compounds cannot be separated based on solubility differences, silica gel chromatography is employed. This requirement ends up adding days to the synthesis. Chromatography requires lots of glassware to do the synthesis and collect all the various fractions, not to mention the huge quantities of solvents such as dichloromethane that are utilized in these steps. Great skill is also required to prepare the columns and, while this is quite constructive, some preps are not as good as others and, in some cases, effective separation of the compounds is not accomplished. Unfortunately, we do not possess such a system in our laboratories. Our synthesis schemes are very involved,1-23 and we are going to use this equipment to purify compounds at every step of the process. We propose acquiring a preparative high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) system for the purification of our reaction products, moving away from the conventional approach involving silica gel packed columns. This shift is driven by the superior capabilities of preparative HPLC, which excels in achieving enhanced resolution and improved separation of closely related compounds. Our decision is grounded in the intricate nature of our probes, composed of multiple fluorophore components linked through complex, multi-step synthetic procedures, where traditional packed silica gel column chromatography used in organic labs is often incapable of effectively separating side products with subtle structural variations. An example of one synthetic pathway is shown below.

The increased plate counts associated with HPLC columns further facilitate efficient separation, especially when dealing with high load volumes necessary for preparative-scale purifications. This not only ensures the production of higher purity products but also expedites the purification process. In the specific context of our probes, incorporating oligo(ethylene glycol) moieties with organelle-specific functional groups, preparative reverse phase HPLC is particularly advantageous. It enables the use of water-rich mobile phases, overcoming the limitations associated with silica gel normal phase column chromatography, which utilizes organic solvents that could excessively solubilize polar products, resulting in broad peaks and co-elutions. With preparative HPLC, we gain precise control over solvent strength, yielding tight, concentrated bands that can be efficiently collected at the preparative scale. Rationale: High-performance liquid chromatography is an essential technique in modern analytical chemistry, allowing for the separation, identification, and purification of chemical compounds. The preparative column with a refractive index detector is particularly valuable for our research, and the chosen system offers the following advantages:  1. High-Resolution Separation: The HPLC preparative column will provide high-resolution  separation of complex mixtures, allowing us to isolate target compounds with greater precision.  2. Purification Capability: The preparative column we are hoping to obtain is designed for 1 g of  material, making it suitable for the purification of compounds at preparative scale, a critical  aspect of our research objectives.  3. Refractive Index Detection: This will enable the detection and quantification of compounds  based on differences in their refractive indices. This will be useful for the separation of all  molecules as it is non-selective and responds to everything coming off a column. Unlike UV  detection, it does not rely on chromophores in the mixtures. Additionally some compounds have  weak UV absorptions. In essence it provides universal detection of compounds.  4. Reverse Phase: As the system is reverse phase, water or a water-based solvent can be used in the  mobile phase. This has many advantages over normal phase HPLC including lower costs  compared to other HPLC methods, less toxicity, accurate results, reduced solvent evaporation (as  polar solvents utilized), can change pH to affect separation, elimination of skewed analyte  retention times, and increased accuracy of gradient separations.  5. Non-toxic solvent use: Finally, another significant advantage is the ability to analyze samples  containing polar (hydrophilic), non-polar (hydrophobic), ionic, and ionizable compounds, due to  the use of a hydrophobic stationary phase. Benefits to NIH: The acquisition of the proposed HPLC preparative column with a UV detector will not only advance our research capabilities but also align with the NIH's mission to support groundbreaking scientific discoveries. The resulting research outcomes will contribute to the understanding of ratiometric fluorescent probes, with implications for the development of new diagnostic tools, therapeutic agents, or other applications that align with the NIH's broader goals. Conclusion: The acquisition of a preparative HPLC system is motivated by its unparalleled resolving power, flexible solvent options, and scalability in purifications. This strategic shift addresses the challenges inherent in the composition of our probes, ensuring efficient and high-quality purification tailored for their intended biomedical imaging applications. The chemistry department will maintain and preserve this instrument beyond the 3-year timeline of the NIH proposal GM152969.

This will be accomplished through analysing the comparative impact of particle radiotherapy delivered at both low and high (so called “FLASH”) dose rates on survival of normal versus the tumour cells, and how this this is mediated through specific effects on critical targets (DNA), under conditions of normal and reduced oxygen (hypoxia) which is important for solid tumours that are radiotherapy resistant. This will lead to development of optimal strategies using particle radiotherapy (protons) for the effective treatment of head and neck and brain tumours, minimising the commonly observed acute and long-term adverse side effects caused by the impact of the radiation on the associated normal tissues, and ultimately improve patient benefit and overall survival. 1",16354638 (contact),"PARSONS, JASON  (contact)","BUCHSBAUM, JEFFREY",2021-07-01,2026-04-30,3-Dimensional;Acute;Automobile Driving;Biologic Characteristic;Biological;Biological Process;Biology;Brain;Brain Neoplasms;cancer therapy;cell killing;Cell model;Cell Survival;Cells;cellular targeting;Characteristics;Chronic;Clinical Oncology;combinatorial;comparative;Complex;conventional dosing;Data;Deposition;Development;Distal;DNA;DNA Damage;DNA Double Strand Break;DNA Repair;Dose;Dose Rate;Drug Targeting;effective therapy;Electron Transport;Frequencies;Future;Glioblastoma;Head and Neck Cancer;Head and Neck Neoplasms;Helium;High-LET Radiation;Human;Hypoxia;improved;inhibitor;interest;Ions;irradiation;Knowledge;Lead;Linear Energy Transfer;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Modeling;Molecular;neoplastic cell;Normal Cell;Normal tissue morphology;novel;optimal treatments;Organ;Oxygen;particle;patient response;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Photons;proton beam;Protons;Radiation;Radiation Dose Unit;radiation effect;Radiation Physics;radiation resistance;Radiation therapy;Radiation Tolerance;Radiobiology;radioresistant;Relative Biological Effectiveness;Research;Resistance;Resources;response;Risk;Roentgen Rays;Role;Sampling;screening;side effect;Solid;Solid Neoplasm;Techniques;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Effect;therapy resistant;three-dimensional modeling;Time;Tissues;treatment strategy;tumor;Tumor Promotion;Tumor Tissue;two-dimensional;Uncertainty,Realizing the radiobiological impact of protons and high-LET particles in head and neck cancer and glioblastoma models,256854,ZCA1,ZCA1-SRB-2(O2),NA,NA,4,295757,22397,318154,NA

Meanwhile, 37.9% US adults reported unintentionally falling asleep during the day at least once in the preceding month, while 4.7% reported nodding off or falling asleep while driving at least once in the preceding month. Given that drowsy driving is responsible for 1,550 fatalities and 40,000 nonfatal injuries annually in the US, this remains a serious public health crisis requiring serious attention. Meanwhile, neuropathic pain estimated in the general population to range between 3% and 17%, lacks an effective treatment as most of the available treatments have only moderate efficacy and present significant side effects that limit their use.

Transcription copies DNA into RNA, a key process that permits gene expression. On occasion, the nascent RNA can become entangled with the DNA, resulting in an alternative three-stranded nucleic acid structure called an R-loop. R-loops form universally under normal conditions and are thought to play physiological roles in cells, including human cells. Studies have suggested, however, that under conditions where transcription is perturbed, harmful R-loops are created, leading to DNA breaks and chromosome anomalies. What distinguishes “good” from “harmful” R-loops remains unknown. Similarly, how harmful R-loops arise as a result of perturbed transcription is unclear. Using innovative technologies developed by my group, we will characterize the formation of so-called harmful R- loops under conditions of perturbed transcription in human cells. We will also determine whether harmful R- loops, or perturbed transcription itself, are the cause of the DNA breaks. Finally, we will determine if an enzyme known to relieve the DNA break problem is acting by resolving harmful R-loops or remediating the altered transcription. This work will benefit our understanding of fundamental cellular processes acting in our genome and will provide insights into a range of human disorders linked to perturbed transcription.",8304160 (contact),"CHEDIN, FREDERIC LOUIS (contact)","KRASNEWICH, DONNA M",2021-01-01,2025-12-31,Address;Affect;Attention;Biochemical;Biogenesis;Cell Line;Cell model;Cell Physiology;Cells;Chromatin;Chromosome abnormality;Chromosome Segregation;Complement;CpG Islands;Data;Defect;Deposition;Developmental Gene;Disease;DNA;DNA Damage;DNA Structure;DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase;Enzymes;Functional disorder;Gene Expression;genetic information;Genetic Transcription;Genome;Genome Stability;Genomic Instability;genomic profiling;Genomics;Goals;Health;Histones;Human;human disease;Human Genome;Hybrids;Inherited;innovative technologies;insight;Knowledge;Length;Life;Light;Link;Maintenance;Mammalian Cell;mammalian genome;Mammals;Measures;Mediating;Metabolism;Monitor;Nature;Normal Cell;Nuclear;nuclease;nucleic acid structure;Nucleosomes;Outcome;overexpression;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Phenotype;Physiological;Physiological Processes;Planet Earth;Play;Population;preservation;Prevalence;Process;programs;promoter;recruit;remediation;Resolution;ribonuclease H1;RNA;RNA annealing;RNA Processing;RNA Splicing;Role;single molecule;Single-Stranded DNA;Stress;Structure;Technology;termination factor;Time;Transcription Process;transcription termination;Work;Yeasts,Understanding the mechanisms underlying R-loop biogenesis and resolution in mammals.,139549,NA,NA,NA,S2,4,30109,0,30109,NA

NIGMS grant R35 GM148220-02 supports research on protein chemistry. This grant is focused on an increasingly important challenge in biomedicine—the traceless delivery of proteins to the cytosol of human cells. This ability provides far-reaching, long-term opportunities for high-impact advances in biomedicine, chemical biology, and allied fields. This supplemental application is for a single piece of equipment that is critical for the completion of the proposed research.  Need for the Requested Equipment. Grant R35 GM148220 proposes the use of diazo compounds to create “protein prodrugs”. In this approach, the esterification of protein carboxylates temporarily “cloaks” the anionic charge in a target protein (Figure 1), enabling membrane transversal. The internalized esters are hydrolyzed by cytosolic esterases, much like small- molecule prodrugs.  This research requires the ability to monitor quantitatively (1) the synthesis of novel diazo Figure 1. Key aspects of the research supported by grant R35 GM148220 and structures of esterified proteins formed from novel cognate α-aryl diazo compounds. Resistance to spontaneous hydrolysis is conferred by either steric interactions or an intramolecular n→π* interaction that elicits the Pauli exclusion principle. Release is achieved by esterase- mediated p-quinone-methide formation. compounds, (2) the rate at which those diazo compounds esterify carboxylic acids, and (3) the kinetic stability of the ensuing esters in both the absence and presence of human esterases. In the first two years of support, we have learned that spontaneous hydrolysis can limit the practical utility of nascent esters. (A typical half-life is a few days.) Accordingly, we are now seeking diazo compounds that generate esters that are stable to spontaneous hydrolysis but removable by cellular esterases. Our strategy is to generate esters that are protected by steric effects or Pauli exclusion (as only one electron pair can occupy an orbital). The esters are designed to be cleaved by p-quinone methide formation. We have conceived of many new α-aryl diazo compounds along these lines (e.g., Figure 1). We now seek to make and test them.  This request arises because there is an urgent, unexpected need for the requested equipment. First, our need for analytical chromatography greatly exceeds that expected upon submission of our grant application in January 2022 because of the need to make and test many new diazo compounds. Second, we have lost our ability to perform any analytical chromatography. Our laboratory had a functioning Agilent 1200 series HPLC instrument for analytical chromatography (Figure 2). This instrument was purchased in 2008 and was a workhorse for 16 years. With this instrument, we characterized hundreds of compounds and performed thousands of assays, leading to dozens of publications. Unfortunately, the instrument is broken and irreparable. We now have a daily need for this instrument that cannot be accommodated elsewhere. For example, the use of instrumentation facilities is slow and inefficient, does not allow for the use of columns appropriate for polar molecules like ours (e.g., C4 and HIC), and is expensive, putting an undue burden on the budget of our NIGMS grant.  Description of the Requested Equipment. We request support for the purchase of an LC/MSD instrument from Agilent Technologies (Lexington, MA). This instrument uses powerful mass-selective detection to enhance analytical precision and is designed for efficiency. Its single quadrupole provides both flexibility and insight. The instrument has these capabilities that are essential for our research: Figure 2. Photograph of the rust-laden, nonfunctional 16-year-old analytical HPLC instrument in our laboratory. · High mass accuracy (±0.005 Da) · Flexibility to detect compounds with ESI, APPI, APCI, and multimode ion sources · Diode array detector with ultrafast scan speeds · Automated multisampler for vials and microplates · Simple, intuitive software that includes the OpenLab chromatography data system (CDS) · Rapid confirmation of interpretations through a library-match search technology This instrument would not only meet the urgent, unexpected need described above but also enhance the overall impact of grant R35 GM148220 by facilitating nearly all of the synthetic and analytical procedures inherent in the proposed research.  Oversight and Training Plan. An engineer from Agilent Technologies would install the equipment, and a representative would provide training, both free of charge. To ensure that the requested instrument is accessible but maintained in like-new condition for the foreseeable future, we have designed a plan for instrument oversight. Specifically, we would house and maintain the instrument in MIT Room 18-344D, which is an equipment room within our laboratory. That location is ideal because of its central location and ready accessibility to personnel.  A postdoctorate in our research group, Dr. Bjarne Silkenath, would facilitate the training of individual users and provide oversight. Dr. Silkenath is a synthetic organic chemist who has much experience in both liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. He would host training events in which he would present the capabilities of the instrument to potential users. After attending such a session, individual users would contact him to request hands-on training, access to documentation on standard operating procedures, and certification to use the instrument independently. Certified users would be provided with the opportunity to sign up for a particular block of time on a first-come, first-served basis. Lastly, prior to leaving our research group, Dr. Silkenath would be responsible for appointing and training his successor, who would be chosen based on their experience with the instrument and their accountability.  Other Users. The reach of the requested equipment supplement would extend beyond the laboratory of the PI. Specifically, the requested instrument would be shared with other departmental researchers, including Profs. Buchwald (R35 GM122483), Cummins (R01 GM130936), Movassaghi (R01 GM141963), Nolan (R01 GM118695 and R01 GM126376), and Shoulders (R35 GM136354). Notably, we have recently published joint papers with Profs. Buchwald, Cummins, and Movassaghi, and our groups have highly active collaborations.  Cost of the Requested Equipment. We have negotiated a 28% discount on the list price for an LC/MS from Agilent Technologies. The price quote is attached to this application. To supplement this cost, we would provide a computer (~$2000) to operate the equipment, and we would use institutional funds to purchase a yearly service contract for ~$6000 per year (see below).  Maintenance of the Requested Equipment. To ensure that the requested equipment is maintained in like-new condition, institutional funds would support a service contract from Agilent Technologies. The corporate headquarters of Agilent Technologies is in Lexington, MA, which is a 30-minute drive from our laboratory. Our department has many pieces of Agilent equipment and has negotiated a blanket contract to cover the cost of servicing that equipment.

My lab focuses on two areas of dsRNA recognition: microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis and innate immune sensing. During miRNA biogenesis, Microprocessor, consisting of Drosha and DGCR8, recognizes and cleaves hairpin-like structures from long transcripts called primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs). My previous work has built a unifying model of human pri-miRNA1 and discovered that some natural, suboptimal miRNA hairpins rely on neighboring optimal miRNA hairpins for efficient Microprocessor cleavage—known as “cluster assistance”2. Nearly 40% of human miRNAs reside in clusters, with many implicated in diseases and influenced by cluster assistance. We propose to dissect this fundamental regulatory mechanism in miRNA biogenesis using biochemical, single-molecule, and structural approaches (Project 1).  Recognition of dsRNA by innate immune sensors such as RIG-I and MDA5 initiates antiviral responses3. Recent studies show that endogenous dsRNAs can also activate these sensors, sometimes resulting in autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases4. The recognition of self dsRNAs therefore needs to be restricted by proteins that modify, degrade, or shield endogenous dsRNAs. Building on our expertise in dsRNA recognition and processing, we proposed to 1) develop new biochemical methods to identify dsRNA ligands of innate immune sensors (Project 2), and 2) develop new genetic screen methods to identify factors that restrict self dsRNA sensing in innate immunity (Project 3). Together these studies will provide crucial insights into how cellular dsRNAs are sensed and regulated, with therapeutic implications for cancer, autoimmune and infectious diseases. Recent progress and scientific justification For Project 1, we have made important progress dissecting the mechanism of cluster-assisted pri-miRNA procesing. We had envisioned two models of cluster assistance: in a dimerization model, one Microprocessor binds the helper miRNA hairpin and promotes the binding of a second Microprocessor to the recipient hairpin; in a transfer model, Microprocessor binds and cleaves the helper hairpin and is then transferred to the proximal recipient (Figure 1). These processes could be mediated by ERH which I identified biochemically2, and SAFB proteins that the Herzog lab Figure 1. Working models of cluster assistance. identified through a CRISPR screen5.  To test these models biochemically, we utilized an in vitro pri-miRNA cleavage assay, which I previously established using lysates from cells that overexpress Drosha and DGCR8. This in vitro system recapituates cluster assistance, i.e., the defective miR-451 hairpin was cleaved faster in the context of the miR- 144~451 cluster. To test whether cleavage of the miR-144 helper hairpin is required for cluster assistance, we introduced modifications (phosphorothioate linkages flanked by 2′-O methylation) at both cleavage sites of the miR- Figure 2. Blocking miR-144 hairpin cleavage inhibited cluster 144 hairpin, which successfully blocked assistance. The line for each substrate represents the best fit of all of cleavage of the miR-144 hairpin (data not the data to an exponential reaction course, which generated the shown) by Drosha. Importantly, preventing the observed rate constants (k, shown ± 95% confidence intervals). Pri- processing of miR-144 hairpin abolished cluster miR-144*~451 has modifications to block miR-144 hairpin cleavage. assistance (Figure 2). This finding suggests that the dimerization model is unlikely. To strengthen this result, we are testing whether blocking one out of the two Drosha cleavage sites is sufficient to inhibit cluster assistance, and we will also test whether such cleavage-site modifications affect Micrprocessor binding.  1  We have also purified a C terminus-truncated form of SAFB2 and showed that it can enhance the cleavage of miR-451 hairpin in the cluster context in vitro. Therefore, cluster assistance can now be reconstituted using purified Microprocessor, ERH, and SAFB2 (Figure 3). Next, we will map the interaction between SAFB2 and Microprocessor using crosslinking mass spec. We will then introduce mutations that disrupt SAFB2–Microprocessor interactions to identify residues important for cluster assistance. Furthermore, as proposed in the parent award, we will use cryo-EM to provide the structural basis of cluster assistance.  For project 2, we proposed to identify endogenous dsRNAs that activate innate immune Figure 3. Reconstitution of cluster assistance using sensors. We have developed a novel approach using purified Microprocessor.

We indicates 3′ radiolabel. transiently overexpressed mDcrO in HEK293T cells, performed small RNA-sequencing analyses to identify mDcrO-dependent small RNAs, and then predicted the dsRNAs from which these small RNAs are processed by mDcrO. We used MACS2 peak calling8,9 to identify sRNA clusters. Our initial experiments identified 1297 small RNA clusters derived from intermolecular and intramolecular dsRNAs. The majority (66%) come from intramolecular folding of repetitive elements. We identified 60 stem-loop structures in the 5′ UTR and 41 in the 3′ UTR of mRNA transcripts. We also identified 51 intermolecular dsRNAs formed by overlapping transcripts (27 at the 3′ end, and 24 at the 5′ end). We are currently investigating the editing status of these dsRNAs to understand how editing suppresses innate immune sensing of dsRNAs. Our preliminary data suggest that many of the intermolecular dsRNAs formed by 3′ overlaps do not have extensive editing, and we plan to pull-down these dsRNA pairs and identify potential proteins that prevent them from activating MDA5.  For project 3, we proposed to identify regulators that restrict sensing of endogenous dsRNA in human cells through CRISPR screens. We have made CRISPRi-compatible, GFP knock-in N/TERT-1 cells that reports IFN-β expression. We have verified this cell line in a mock screen (data not shown), and we are currently conducting a genome-wide screen to identify factors whose loss results in increased IFN-β expression. After obtaining the hits, we will verify and focus on RNA-related genes. We will then use biochemical, genetic, and other approaches to understand the mechanism by which these genes suppress endogenous dsRNA sensing. Rationale for the purchase of an ÄKTA pure micro system: Project 1 is a mechanistic project that relies heavily on protein and RNA purification. Although Projects 2 and 3 are discovery-oriented, we expect to move beyond discovery and conduct mechanistic studies using biochemical approaches. Currently we are using an ÄKTA pure 25 M system in the laboratory of my RNA Therapeutics Institute colleague Dr. Li Li. Dr Li’s system meets our current purification needs, but the ÄKTA pure micro system will be much better suited for our proposed cryo-EM studies because of specific requirement of sample concentration and quality. In addition, we routinely use the mammalian expression system (Expi293) for protein purification. The expression system is expensive and does not efficiently produce large quantities of RNA-binding proteins, so our experiments will benefit from the ability to purify minute quantities of proteins and RNA–protein complexes for analyzing protein–protein interactions, oligomerization states, and RNA–protein interactions. The small injection and elution volumes, improved resolution, and sharper peaks offered by the ÄKTA pure micro is ideal in this respect. I have recently hired a postdoc who has extensive experience with cryo-EM analysis of RNA–protein complexes, and who has used the ÄKTA pure micro system before. Therefore, we are prepared to take full advantage of this system. Plans for service contracts The service contract for the requested ÄKTA pure micro system will cost ~$6,600 per year. I will use my startup provided by the RNA Therapeutics Institute (my host department at UMass Chan Medical School) to cover the service contract for the duration of the project. Moreover, our department has dedicated funding and personnel for instrument maintenance, which is available for this proposed equipment.  2 Reference 1 Fang, W. & Bartel, D. P.

Consequently, a major goal of NIH is to understand the neural mechanisms that underlie adaptive and maladaptive threat processing. The hippocampus and dopamine release (via the locus coeruleus and ventral tegmental area) both contribute to fear and anxiety, but it is not known how they interact during these states to promote the encoding of aversive memories. This represents a major gap in our understanding of the neural systems that contribute to emotional disorders. Altered catecholamine release accompanies schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and ADHD, which are often comorbid with fear and anxiety disorders. Alzheimer’s disease also produces severe atrophy of the locus coeruleus, which reduces catecholamine release throughout the brain and is thought to exacerbate amnesia.

The overall goal is to help exporters in Latin America strengthen their food safety programs in order to export safer food and comply with the United States food safety regulations. IICA has the capacity to implement many outreach and innovative capacity building activities relying on its extensive network of professionals trained under current and previous projects related to FSMA and food safety. IICA can find the most appropriate location/users (specific countries/farms, etc.) for any programs and, as appropriate, align with or consider ongoing and planned training by other organizations as part of the context for this proposal. IICA can work and conduct outreach with government, academia, and the private industry. These capabilities have brought success to the previous two cooperative agreements between FDA and IICA.
