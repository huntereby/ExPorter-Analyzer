Failure to diagnose and treat these visual deficits may exacerbate or prolong the everyday difficulties experienced by Veterans with mTBI (e.g., reading, driving, or following a visual presentation), presenting a critical barrier to successful rehabilitation and reintegration. In other acquired visual disorders, changes in color vision are often the earliest sign of vision loss. This study develops a new test of color vision designed to capture subtle differences in the processing of color signals at peripheral and central stages of the visual system.

HFOs are known to occur in epilepsy but their role in AD remains unknown. Based on pilot data, we hypothesize that HFOs in AD start as a local electrical disturbance in the hippocampus, and as disease progresses, they progressively expand into superficial cortex. We will address this hypothesis using multi-electrode arrays and longitudinal recordings as the animal ages. Finally, we will test whether HFOs contribute to impaired memory, a major AD symptom as well as to AD neuropathology. To that end, we will use two novel strategies that our preliminary data suggest we can disrupt HFOs in vivo either by employing closed-loop optogenetics or by overexpressing a specific K+ channel to also gain novel insights about mechanisms contributing to HFOs in AD.",15550000 (contact),"LISGARAS, CHRISTOS PANAGIOTIS (contact)","WAGSTER, MOLLY V",2024-09-30,2026-08-31,Address;Affect;Age;Age Months;Algorithms;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Alzheimer&apos;s disease model;Alzheimer’s disease biomarker;Amyloid;Amyloid beta-Protein;Animals;Area;Biological Markers;Blood;Brain;Brain Diseases;brain electrical activity;Cerebrum;Clinical;Data;density;dentate gyrus;Disease;Disease Progression;early detection biomarkers;Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;epileptiform;Event;Exhibits;experimental study;flexibility;Foundations;Functional disorder;Future;gene therapy;Goals;High Frequency Oscillation;Hippocampus;Human;Image;Impairment;Implant;improved;improvement on sleep;in vivo;insight;Investigation;Life;Location;Memory;memory consolidation;Memory impairment;Methods;Modeling;mouse model;multi-electrode arrays;Mus;neuropathology;neurotechnology;new therapeutic target;non rapid eye movement;novel;novel strategies;optogenetics;overexpression;Performance;postnatal;Potassium Channel;Protocols documentation;Repressed Memory;Role;Seizures;Senile Plaques;Sleep;Sleep Stages;Solid;Source;spatiotemporal;Stains;Symptoms;Testing;Tg2576;Time,High frequency oscillations in Alzheimer's disease,86880,CNNT,Clinical Neuroplasticity and Neurotransmitters Study Section[CNNT],NA,A1,1,274999,179025,454024,NA

A detailed investigation of dynein’s mechanochemical cycle and its regulation by dynactin and cargo adaptor proteins will significantly contribute to our understanding of how points mutants in the dynein/dynactin complex contribute to human disease and the development of specific chemical inhibitors of dynein function for the treatment of these diseases in future studies.",9737871 (contact),"YILDIZ, AHMET  (contact)","AINSZTEIN, ALEXANDRA M",2020-04-01,2025-03-31,Adaptor Signaling Protein;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;arm;Autophagosome;Behavior;Binding;Binding Sites;biophysical analysis;Cells;Chemicals;Cilia;cilium motility;cofactor;Complex;Cryoelectron Microscopy;Cytoplasm;Development;Disease;dynactin;Dynein ATPase;Exclusion;Exhibits;Future;Generations;Geometry;Goals;human disease;In Vitro;in vivo;inhibitor;Intracellular Transport;Investigation;Kinesin;Knock-out;Lead;Liquid substance;lissencephaly;Male Infertility;Microtubule-Associated Proteins;Microtubules;Mitochondria;Mitosis;Mitosis Inhibition;Modeling;Molecular;molecular imaging;Motility;Motor;motor neuron degeneration;Movement;mutant;Mutation;Neurobiology;Neuropathy;optic trap;optical traps;Pathogenesis;Physiological;Play;predictive modeling;Primary Ciliary Dyskinesias;programs;Recombinants;reconstitution;Regulation;Research;retrograde transport;Role;Schizophrenia;simulation;single molecule;Slide;success;System;tau Proteins;Testing;Tetrahymena;Tubulin;vesicle transport;Work,The Mechanism and Regulation of Cytoplasmic and Ciliary Dyneins,136414,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1(55)-R],NA,S1,5,248705,0,248705,NA

Full-thickness RC tendon tears occur in >20% of the adult population and Veterans are particularly affected, due to the presence of injuries incurred during active duty and greater average age. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US) can be used to assess tendon tear size, muscle atrophy, and fatty infiltration, but are less well- suited for evaluation of tendon degeneration and muscle fibrosis. Both of these important variables can increase surgical complexity and lead to lower patient outcome scores. We propose to develop, optimize, validate and translate novel quantitative MRI and US techniques for comprehensive assessment of RC collagen abnormalities and fibrosis. These techniques may guide treatment decisions, operative planning, and yield prognostic information.

Successful anti-HIV treatments can eliminate nearly all active viruses and prolong patients’ lives to nearly normal lifespans. However, the new challenge faced by aging patients is chronic neuroinflammation in the brain, leading to various HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) that are found in more than 50% of HIV-infected individuals. Even under effective antiviral therapies, chronic HAND persists with high rates of delirium and dementia that can lead to suicide. According to a VA report, “the risk of suicide mortality in HIV-infected persons is 3-5 times higher than in HIV-uninfected counterparts.” What causes HAND is not well understood. Through our pilot studies, we have linked a HIV protein Vpr to HAND, and discovered a novel mechanism involving activation of the Sur1-Trpm4 channel.

Because of potential harms of LTOT, difficulties of frequent monitoring, and potential harms of having LTOT discontinued, physicians need practical tools and guidelines to improve care. This project will improve patient care by developing integrated screening tools to indicate if LTOT is harmful to continue (yes or no), and if tapering to discontinue opioids is harmful to initiate (yes or no). When the tool indicates “yes,” this will mean that physicians should start additional, more comprehensive monitoring and examination to determine the harms and benefits of continued LTOT or of tapering to discontinuation.

INVESTIGATORS: Rachael Leon Guerrero (PI), Yvette Paulino (PI), Grazyna Badowski (Co-I), Leslie Aquino (Co-I) Project type: Administrative Supplements to Enhance Institutional Data Science Capacity. NOT-OD-23-123 Specific Aims  This supplement application addresses the need to better prepare researchers in Guam and Micronesia, particularly in data science, so they can pursue careers in cancer health disparities and other biomedical fields. Pacific Islanders are extremely underrepresented in the nation’s biomedical workforce, both on the faculty of universities and research institutions as well as in hospitals and public health departments. The limited number of Pacific Islanders with graduate degrees continues to impede progress in research and prevention of cancer health disparities. The Pacific Island Partnership for Cancer Health Equity (PIPCHE) is the National Cancer Institute’s only U54 partnership that advances cancer health equity in Pacific Islands Populations (PIP). PIPCHE’s overarching goal is to promote cancer health equity and mitigate the impact of cancer on PIP through increasing cancer research leadership and capacity in Hawai‘i, Guam and the USAPI. The University of Guam (UOG) is the minority-serving institution (MSI) within PIPCHE and is a USDA land- grant institution whose student population is 90% Asian Pacific Islander, of whom 51% are native Pacific Islanders. UOG is uniquely situated to recruit and inspire future professionals from these Pacific Islander groups as well as conduct research with the diverse communities living in Guam and other Micronesian islands.  The current goal of PIPCHE’s Research Education Core (REC) is to train graduate students committed to addressing health disparities in Pacific indigenous populations. Despite the success of the PIPCHE-REC in training PIP students to pursue and complete graduate degrees, there remains a dearth of researchers competent in data science in Guam. Additionally, UOG has limited faculty with expertise in math, statistics, and data science, all burdened with full teaching schedules. Furthermore, UOG graduate students funded by PIPCHE-REC extensively utilized PIPCHE's Biostatistics Shared Resource (BSR) for thesis project data analysis due to their limited experience in statistics and data science. A new graduate program in Data Science has been developed at UOG, which would equip students with the technical skills to collect, manage, analyze, and interpret data, and will also be proficient in programming languages such as R and Python, and statistical analysis tools such as SAS and SPSS. The anticipated start of the program is Fall 2024.  The proposed supplement seeks to support the establishment of a Data Science Center at the UOG, designed to complement the MS in Data Science program and bolster the region's data science capabilities. Integral to this program is the mandatory capstone course entitled ""Statistical Research and Consulting."" Within this course, students will undertake internships at the Data Science Center, engaging in collaborative projects with UOG researchers or partnering with government agencies. The Center will serve as a hub for additional support, offering students enhanced opportunities to gain valuable research skills and practical experience.  As part of this initiative, we aim to enhance UOG's data science capabilities by upgrading our infrastructure with high-performance workstations and developing a comprehensive cancer database. We intend to investigate the feasibility of linking the Guam Cancer Registry (GCR) with data from Guam's Medicare, Medicaid, and Medically Indigent Program (MIP) recipients. This integrated dataset is expected to be a valuable resource for researchers. Furthermore, we plan to forge partnerships with regional community colleges to offer summer data science workshops. Aim 1: Establish the first regional Data Science Center in synergy with the MS in Data Science at UOG. The center will provide research support and advance education in data science in Guam and Micronesia. Aim 2: Establish infrastructure, security protocols and agreements necessary for the data linkage between Guam Cancer Registry and Medicare, Medicaid and MPI. The linkage would improve the completeness of GCR treatment data and will be the source for future studies, for example adherence to treatment and its impact on survival. Aim 3: Build data science education and training partnerships with the Northern Marianas College (NMC) and Palau Community College (PCC). These partnerships will enhance data science knowledge and skills of the researchers and students in NMC and PCC and create the pipeline for the data science path at UOG. We hypothesize that the establishment of the Data Science Center will significantly increase the number of underrepresented students, particularly Pacific Islanders, trained in statistics and data science. Impact: This supplement will greatly enhance the research and data science capacity of UOG, Guam and the greater Micronesian region. Students trained in the proposed program would be equipped with the necessary skills to work as data analysts in both academic, healthcare, and industry settings. RESEARCH STRATEGY Background and Significance  A new graduate program in Data Science has been proposed at UOG with the anticipated start in Fall 2024. This 30-credit, cohort-based graduate program aims to equip students with skills in statistical modeling, machine learning, optimization, and big data analysis, catering to the urgent demand for data science professionals. The program's relevance is highlighted by the critical role of data analytics in public health, especially evident during the COVID-19 pandemic when a UOG math student contributed to analyzing COVID data for public health efforts. This new program addresses the need for experts who can harness data for impactful decisions, signaling a significant advancement in local and regional education and workforce development. The MS in Data Science program at UOG could draw students from various disciplines, including Mathematics, Computer Science, Biology, Chemistry, Health Science, and Psychology. Table 1 details enrollment numbers and degrees granted in these fields at UOG in recent years. Additionally, a preliminary survey was conducted among seniors and recent graduates to gauge interest in the forthcoming Academic year Health Science +Psychology 250 228 215 230 2018 2019 2020 2021 Declared Majors Math+CS+Biology +Chem 406 406 379 332 Number  of Degrees Granted Math+CS+Biology +Chem 60 66 77 62Health Science +Psychology 43 51 40 31 Data Science program. Out of 53 student respondents, 66% expressed high interest in enrolling in the program. Until recently, students from Guam, PIPCHE biostatistics trainees, had to travel to the mainland U.S. to pursue their graduate degrees. While they have been successful, most have not returned to Guam. For instance, Louis Dulana, who earned an MS in Applied Statistics from Loyola University Chicago in 2021, is now a Behavioral Health Research Analyst with the Oregon Health Authority. Dwight Sablan, who earned MS in Data Science at the University of Washington in 2022, works as a computer scientist for the Air Force. Regina- Mae Dominguez, who completed her MS in Data Science at the University of Washington in 2023, works as a Data Analyst at the Institute for Health Metrics & Evaluation in Seattle, WA. The new program, which includes an internship at the Data Science Center, aims to prevent this brain drain by retaining talented students in Guam to pursue their graduate degree.  Current trainees in the PIPCHE Biostatistics program have focused on analyzing Guam Cancer Registry Data (GCR), particularly looking into incidence trends (1) and survival analysis (2). They observed ethnic disparities in cancer incidence and survival rates in Guam. Specifically, CHamoru and Other Micronesians have the lowest 5-year survival rates for lung cancer, at 15.6% and 18.7% respectively. For breast cancer, Other Micronesian women have the lowest 5-year survival rate at 55.9%, with CHamoru women following at 81.1%. However, the analyses are primarily descriptive due to limitations in the GCR data. The GCR is affiliated with both the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) and the US Pacific Regional Central Cancer Registry and adheres to the stringent data quality standards established by the NAACCR and the NCI SEER programs. The GCR includes comprehensive demographic, tumor, and survival data for all diagnosed cancer cases in Guam (3). However, the data on risk factors (smoking, drinking, BMI) and treatment information are mostly missing. For example, the treatment data for breast cancer cases is incomplete, with missing values ranging between 41% for diagnostic procedures and 58% for radiation therapy. Without the risk factors and treatment data it is impossible to investigate underlying causes for the disparities in cancer outcomes.  In 1991, a collaboration between the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) enabled the linkage of NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry data with Medicare's enrollment and claims data, creating the SEER-Medicare database. Due to the significant interest in the cancer research community, the NCI, CMS, and SEER registries agreed that the NCI should oversee the database, ensuring its availability to researchers upon meeting confidentiality requirements. Today, the SEER-Medicare database remains a vital tool for evaluating cancer care and outcomes in the United States (4, 5). The Guam Cancer Registry (GCR) is not linked with Medicare because it is not a part of the SEER registry. According to the 2020 Guam Census, 20.2% of the population lives below the poverty level, 23.2% do not have health insurance, and the median household income is $58,289. Medicaid and Medicare programs are available in Guam, and there is also a locally funded Medically Indigent Program (MIP) designed to pay for medical expenses of low-income families without health insurance. Approximately 24% of Guam’s population was enrolled in Medicaid at the end of 2018. Obtaining Medicare’s enrollment and claims data will enrich the Guam Cancer Registry by incorporating not only treatment information but also social determinants of health which are important factors for understanding cancer treatment outcomes and survival disparities (6, 7). This integrated dataset will serve as a significant resource for researchers and students.  Pacific Islanders, specifically Micronesians, are not only a small ethnic minority but highly underrepresented in STEM the biomedical research community. A survey of PhD degrees awarded in biological sciences in a one-year period in the US showed that not a single Pacific Islander received a PhD (Science, Vol 311, p 378, 2006), a dire problem that we have successfully started to address with PIPCHE. Moreover, a recent report by the National Commission on Asian American and Pacific Islander Research in Education (published by Educational Testing Service (ETS) in 2013), showed that, in contrast to the US average, educational attainment of the younger generation of Pacific Islanders is lower than that of their parents, and that the gap between the US average and Pacific Islanders widens. The UOG is characterized by a very high percentage of minority students (approximately 90%), almost all of whom are CHamorus and other Micronesians. The UOG is the only minority institution in the country where Pacific Islanders constitute the majority of the student body. Yet, there is no established pathway for students from regional community colleges to transition to UOG. Very small number of students from Northern Marianas College (NMC) and Palau Community College (PCC) continue their undergraduate or graduate education at UOG. In Fall 2021, just 9 students from NMC and 5 from PCC enrolled at UOG. PCC offers the Associate of Community and Public Health program, featuring courses like Principles of Epidemiology, which covers epidemiology's foundational principles and their application to disease distribution and determinants in populations. Another course, Epidemiological Surveillance & Public Health Information System, focuses on the basics of epidemiological surveillance for monitoring infectious pathogens. Similarly, the Science, Math, Health & Athletics department at NMC offers courses such as Introductory Statistics, Introduction to Programming, and Database Applications. Students from these programs are well-positioned for data science training and further education at UOG. Significance The establishment of the Data Science Center will create infrastructure for data curation, analysis, and science training, fostering increased collaboration among UOG faculty and students, as well as with their counterparts in the Micronesia region. Research Design and Methods Our proposal builds upon the achievements of the PICPCHE REC, the Biostatistics Cores, and the UOG Division of Mathematics and Computer Science (DMCS), and UOG's long-standing commitment to undergraduate research and student mentoring. Dr. Badowski, co-leader of the PIPCHE Biostatistics Core, has successfully mentored 27 students, supported by PIPCHE or other programs, to notable achievements: one completed a PhD, while 12 obtained MS degrees in Statistics or Data Science. These students presented at 29 research conferences. She also led a Problem Based Learning workshop for students from Japan's Shibaura Institute of Technology. Dr. Aquino, DMCS chair and the first CHamoru woman to earn a PhD in Mathematics, has significantly contributed to undergraduate math research for underrepresented minorities through programs funded by Mathematical Association of America (MAA), NASA-funded Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and National Science Foundations (NSF). Along with DMCS faculty, she has mentored over 30 students in the summer Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) programs over the past four years. Additionally, the plan for the Data Science Center aligns with UOG’s strategic plan, “Para Hulo’”—the CHamoru phrase for “Ever Upward.” This plan positions the university as a research institution grounded in island wisdom. Aim 1. Establish the first regional Data Science Center at the University of Guam. The Data Science Center, to be established at UOG, will feature advanced workstations and laptops designed for big data analytics. MS in Data Science students will intern at the Center, collaborating with UOG researchers and/or government health agencies, such as the Guam Department of Public Health and Social Sciences, Guam Behavioral Health, Guam Memorial Hospital Authority, and Bureau of Statics and Planning. Their involvement will include contributing to new research proposals, focusing on statistical methodologies and power calculations, and participating in data analysis for manuscript preparation, with the goal of earning co-authorship on submissions. This Center aims to enhance research skills and offer experiences particularly beneficial for those interested in addressing cancer health disparities in the Pacific, among other data science applications. Our commitment extends to developing a diverse workforce proficient in data science, especially within healthcare contexts. By integrating students into active research projects, we aim to provide substantial hands-on experience and mentorship, nurturing their development into skilled professionals. The aim 1 of our proposal fulfills objective 1 of FOA: “Grow human capital with data science competencies, such as knowledge, skills, abilities, and behaviors.” Evaluation and Sustainability: For our first cohort, starting Fall 2024, we aim for 6-8 students in the program, all expected to complete their internships at the Data Science Center and graduate within 2 years. The next cohort is set to begin in Fall 2026. UOG boasts a diverse research portfolio, supported by grants from various agencies, including the NSF-funded EPSCoR-GECCO grant, the NCI-funded Pacific Island Partnership for Cancer Health Equity (U54-PIPCHE) grant, the NOAA-funded Sea Grant, USDA-funded Land Grant programs and projects, CEDDERS funding, and NASA EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Development funding. We plan to continue seeking these grants to support our graduate data science students. Additionally, some students will have the opportunity to apply for teaching assistantships positions at UOG College of Natural and Applied Sciences. Aim 2. Establish infrastructure, security protocols and agreements necessary for the data linkage between Guam Cancer Registry and Medicare, Medicaid and MPI. In Year 1, with the help of PIPCHE IT Shared Resource Core and UOG Office of Information Technology, we will collaborate with the Guam Cancer Registry and the Guam Department of Public Health and Social Services (DPHSS) to:  • Establish data sharing agreements with DPHSS and Guam Cancer Registry.  • Establish a secure infrastructure for data transfer and storage at UOG. In partnership with UOG's Office  of Information Technology (OIT) and the Micronesian Data Laboratory, we aim to utilize expertise and  best practices to create a secure, on-site data storage system compliant with NIST and NIH data  management policies. This initiative will also enhance our ability to manage healthcare data and offer  computer science internships with OIT, further supporting this project.  • Prepare secure protocol for the data transfer directly from Guam Cancer Registry (GCR) and DPHSS.  As we establish data sharing agreements with GCR and DPHSS, we will establish the protocols and  determine the best methods for secure transfer of data from GCR and DPHSS to UOG based on nature  and format of the data. Given that the database will temporarily store personally identifiable patient information, it's crucial to meet HIPAA standards for data storage and transmission. We will adhere to HIPAA compliance in all our protocols. Our strategy includes hosting the database behind the OIT’s firewall to limit access, monitor all traffic, and encrypt database backups before storage. In Year 2, for the data linkage, we will use 2007-2022 GCR data, which includes a total of 5,728 cases recorded during that period. We will link the individuals documented in the GCR with their corresponding Medicare, Medicaid, and MIP enrollment data using the Link Plus Software, which is available at no cost from the CDC. It uses a deterministic algorithm based on social security number (SSN), name, sex, date of birth, and, if applicable, date of death. We will also use this opportunity to include noncancer controls, a random sample of Medicare, Medicaid, MIP beneficiaries that are not included in GCR data. To protect the identities of the cancer patients and noncancer controls included in this data, personally identifiable information that is used to link the GCR and Medicare data (eg, SSN, names, and full date of birth) will be removed from the integrated database after the linkage is completed. Instead, each beneficiary will be assigned a unique, nonidentifiable number, which will allow the same individual to be tracked across data files and time. This aim of our proposal addresses Objective 2 of FOA: “Develop or expand infrastructure to support data science research, training, and education” by creating the rich cancer data set that researchers can use for creating hypotheses, or as preliminary data source. The integrated GCR-Medicare database will serve as a valuable resource for researchers. It will contain patient demographics (e.g., age, race-ethnicity, sex), comprehensive clinical cancer details (e.g., diagnosis date, site, histology, stage), and detailed health-care use and cost information that will allow for the identification and comparison of cancer treatment and outcomes across different populations within the dataset. Its longitudinal structure, capturing data before and after a cancer diagnosis, will enable the analysis of time-dependent measures like comorbidity indices, multi-course treatments (e.g., surgery, radiation, systemic therapy), and outcomes such as time to a subsequent event or death. Additionally, this database can also support student training by serving as a practical dataset for educational purposes. Impact and Sustainability. The integration of GCR and Medicare datasets, encompassing social factors, risk factors, and cancer treatment data, will markedly improve both the quality of research and the depth of manuscripts derived from this data. It will aid in identifying the causes of disparities and generating hypotheses for future research. Upon establishing data transfer agreements and data storage infrastructure, we can periodically update the linkage, every two years. Aim 3. Build data science education and training partnerships with the Northern Marianas College (NMC) and Palau Community College (PCC). We plan to hold a two-week workshop titled ""Introduction to Data Science with R"" in Saipan and Palau, targeting community college and high school students, as well as faculty members, with a cap of 8 participants per location. This beginner-level course emphasizes practical engagement and doesn’t require any prior background, utilizing the open-source software R. Initially, attendees will be guided through the installation of R, its tools, and RStudio. Participants will be given access to de-identified datasets from PIPCHE, research projects, GCR, and Guam BRFSS, enabling them to construct and apply a framework for statistical analysis. The course is structured into six modules. The first module introduces cancer and health disparities research, using findings from PIPCHE to guide students in formulating their research questions. It will also use some of the lectures developed for the new graduate course Cancer Disparities (funded by U54). Module 2 focuses on data visualization using R, covering the basics of ggplot and presenting examples of various graphs such as histograms, bar plots, violin plots, and scatter plots along with attached R scripts on how to run these in R. Subsequent modules (3 to 5) will cover descriptive statistics, linear regression, and logistic regression, respectively. These sections include lab exercises for interpreting results from provided sample data and executing analyses using attached R scripts. In the final module, Module 6, participants will brainstorm research ideas and collaborate in groups, fostering an environment of collective learning and innovation. Course Objectives:  1. Understand how to properly prepare datasets for use in computing workspaces.  2. Understand disparities in cancer and cardiovascular-related risk factors and outcomes.  3. Recognize and articulate a research problem.  4. Describe some models used in data science and the benefits and limitations of these approaches.  5. Gain hands-on experience coding in R and analyzing data sets gathered in past PIPCHE projects.  6. An increased proficiency of student research skills including those used in: literature review,  understanding ethical issues, using computer software, and oral and written communication of data  science research.  7. An awareness of career options in academics, industry, and/or government. Evaluation and Sustainability. The workshop's evaluation will adopt a formative and summative approach, aiming to gather feedback on the current program's quality and guide improvements for future workshops. The evaluation will be twofold:  1. Students’ self-evaluation, conducted before and after the workshop.  2. Students’ assessment of their workshop experience. The surveys will assess students' perspectives on several key areas, including their understanding of data science career paths, skills in interpreting results, resilience in overcoming research obstacles, preparedness for advanced research, comprehension of knowledge construction, grasp of the research process, insight into how data scientists tackle real-world problems, and proficiency in data analysis. A pre/post evaluation design will be implemented to gauge self-reported improvements in participants' skills and knowledge following their participation in the program. The evaluation will include questions such as: 1. How satisfied were participants with the program overall? 2. Did the research experience meet participant expectations? 3. Did the research experience impact participant plans to pursue career in data science? 4. To what extent did participants increase their research skills during the program? 5. To what extent do participants feel they gained knowledge about the research process? 6. What changes should we make to the program for next year? Aim 3 of our proposal meets the third objective of the supplement program, “Build data science partnerships” particularly focusing on the second point: “Activities that establish learning communities to help participants such as students, educators, and community partners to develop data science identity, equitable data practices, and sense of belonging to the data science community.” For each workshop, our plan includes recruiting one faculty member from each participating institution. In the first year, this faculty member will acquire the necessary skills and knowledge; in the second year, they will help co-facilitate the workshop, gaining hands-on experience in conducting a data science workshop. We will provide these faculty members with all the workshop materials, enabling them to independently run the workshop in the future, even beyond the duration of the supplement. Additionally, we aim to support one student from Saipan and one from Palau in submitting an abstract to a national conference and presenting their research during the second year of funding. This effort is intended to motivate students to pursue further education in data science. Furthermore, while in Saipan and Palau, we plan to engage with the leadership of both institutions to explore creating pathways for students to continue their studies at UOG. REFERENCES  1.

The overall 5-year survival rate for head and neck cancer has not improved much over the last few decades with both conventional multimodal treatment and emerging immunotherapies known to have an adverse (and sometimes fatal) impact on quality of life. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the mechanisms driving the effectiveness of a novel immunotherapy for head and neck cancer we call “SynerGel” and determine how it can be used in combination with standard-of-care radiation therapy to reduce treatment toxicity. By doing so, we aim to enhance our understanding of how both tumor and immune cells in the tumor environment can be manipulated to produce a strong anti-tumor effect while reducing the side effects of treatment.",11424226 (contact),"YOUNG, SIMON  (contact)","CHEN, ZHONG",2021-07-01,2026-04-30,Activities of Daily Living;Acute;Address;antitumor effect;Automobile Driving;Biocompatible Materials;cancer immunotherapy;cancer type;Cells;chemotherapy;Combination immunotherapy;Combined Modality Therapy;cytokine;cytotoxic;Data;Dendritic Cells;design;Dose;effective therapy;Effectiveness;Effector Cell;Environment;exhaustion;FDA approved;Generations;Goals;Head and Neck Cancer;Hydrogels;Immune;immune checkpoint blockade;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immune response;immune-related adverse events;Immunity;Immunologic Adjuvants;Immunologic Stimulation;Immunologics;Immunomodulators;immunomodulatory therapies;Immunophenotyping;immunoregulation;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;improved;In Situ;Inflammatory Response;Injectable;Injections;insight;Interferons;Lymphocyte;malignant mouth neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Molecular;Myeloid Cells;Myeloid-derived suppressor cells;nanofiber;Nature;next generation;NOS2A gene;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;Pathway interactions;Patients;Peptides;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pre-Clinical Model;Predisposition;Quality of life;Radiation therapy;rational design;recruit;Refractory;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Resistance;response;Risk;self assembly;Severities;Signal Transduction;Solid Neoplasm;spatiotemporal;standard of care;Survival Rate;System;systemic toxicity;T cell response;T memory cell;T-Lymphocyte;Technology;Tertiary Protein Structure;Testing;Toxic effect;Treatment Side Effects;Treatment-related toxicity;tumor;tumor heterogeneity;tumor microenvironment;tumor-immune system interactions,SynerGel: A Novel Tumor Microenvironment-Modulating Hydrogel for Local Immunotherapy,30140,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-OTC-M(08)F],NA,S1,4,51925,25357,77282,NA

The proposed study is relevant to public health because here is an urgent need to prevent juvenile myopia (nearsightedness) — projections indicate that over 50% of the world’s population will have myopia by the year 2050. Furthermore, the increasingly earlier onset of myopia in children with consequent higher progression rates is generating an epidemic of potentially blinding, high myopia. As a necessary step in developing successful myopia prevention programs, this longitudinal project will help understand the ocular structure and visual function characteristics of myopia development in children with an investigation of ocular, retinal and visual processing factors prior to and after the development of myopia in children. 1",9664664 (contact),"VERA-DIAZ, FUENSANTA ASCENSION (contact)","WIGGS, CHERI",2019-09-01,2025-08-31,"Adolescent;Affect;aged;Caring;catalyst;Characteristics;Child;Childhood;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Complex;Contrast Sensitivity;Data;Data Analyses;design;Detection;Development;Discrimination;early onset;Electrodes;Electrophysiology (science);Electroretinography;Eligibility Determination;emmetropization;epidemic potential;Evaluation;experimental analysis;Eye;Failure;Future;Growth;high risk;Human;Image;Impairment;Individual;Intervention;Investigation;Knowledge;Lead;longitudinal, prospective study;Measures;Modeling;Myopia;neural;novel;Only Child;optical imaging;Optics;Pattern;Perception;Polynomial Models;Population;predictive modeling;prevent;Prevention;Prevention program;Procedures;Process;Psychophysics;Public Health;Pupil;recruit;Research;Research Personnel;response;Retina;retinal imaging;Risk;sample fixation;Scanning;Signal Transduction;Skin;Structure;Testing;Vision;Visual;Visual Fields;visual processing;Visual Psychophysics;visual tracking",Longitudinal evaluation of optical and neural factors leading to juvenile myopia,30518,NA,NA,NA,S1,5,97448,59452,156900,NA

The proposed two full projects and pilot project include investigators from the three institutions and will leverage on specimens collected across the partnership from Black/African American and Hispanic/Latinx, representing a wide range of subpopulations within these minority groups. Thus, our studies will reveal unprecedented findings about these two understudied minority populations, will be instrumental in transferring cutting edge and innovative technologies to FAMU, and will expand in a significant way the research focus at UF and USC-NCCC to address cancer health disparities in pancreas and lung cancers.

Despite increasing recognition of the importance of engaging patients in SUD research and clinical practice, as well as NIDA’s commitment to patient engagement, we have limited understanding of best practices for patient engagement in the SUD field. Patient engagement frameworks are tools that help stakeholders support, evaluate, improve, and report on patient involvement in research and clinical practice. Yet, patient engagement frameworks that are tailored to the unique needs of patients and communities impacted by SUD are nascent. Therefore, our short-term goal for this project is to tailor a patient engagement framework for SUD research and clinical practice in partnership with the Addiction Policy Forum (APF), a nationwide organization dedicated to eliminating addiction. In Aim 1, we will engage in bioethics research to identify key elements of SUD patient engaged research and clinical practice via concept mapping. Concept mapping is a community-based participatory, mixed-methods approach that has been used in past work both to develop community engagement frameworks and with populations affected by SUD. We will follow recommended steps for using concept mapping in community-based participatory research, including: patient preparation, patient brainstorming, patient sorting and rating, multivariate statistical analysis, and patient interpretation. Participants will include individuals recruited from APF’s patient panels focused on individuals with active use (n=25) and in treatment and recovery (n=25). In Aim 2, we will tailor a patient engagement framework for SUD research and clinical practice. We will choose a patient engagement framework for tailoring by comparing results from Aim 1 to existing, well-established patient engagement frameworks. We will then tailor the framework by integrating results from Aim 1, and iteratively revise it with patients and experts in SUD research and clinical practice. This project will be conducted alongside our ongoing randomized controlled trial of a disclosure intervention for people in recovery from opioid use disorder (R01DA059557). We will therefore immediately apply the framework to our ongoing trial. Additionally, our long-term goals are to disseminate and evaluate the resulting SUD patient engagement framework. We will disseminate the framework via peer- reviewed publications and tailored, translated products for patients and other key stakeholders so that it can be applied to SUD research and clinical practice. We also plan to evaluate and, if needed, refine the framework in the context of future studies (e.g., with R21 or R01 funding). Our ultimate goal is to produce a SUD patient engagement framework that is flexible (so that it can be used with patients impacted by a variety of SUDs, who are engaged in active use and in treatment/recovery, as well as in both research studies and clinical practice) and adaptable (because the SUD epidemic is dynamic and often rapidly evolving).",11027388 (contact),"EARNSHAW, VALERIE ANN (contact)","ZUR, JULIA BETH",2023-09-30,2028-08-31,"Academy;addiction;Address;Adult;Affect;barrier to care;Benchmarking;Bioethics;clinical practice;Communities;community based participatory research;community engagement;concept mapping;Consult;Dedications;design;Development;Disclosure;Elements;Ensure;Epidemic;experience;flexibility;Fright;Funding;Future;Goals;improved;Individual;Intervention;Literature;Maps;Medicine;Methods;Modeling;National Institute of Drug Abuse;Nonprofit Organizations;opioid use disorder;Outcome;overdose death;Participant;patient engagement;patient oriented;Patient Recruitments;Patients;Peer Review;Persons;Policies;Population;Preparation;Protocols documentation;Public Health;Publications;Publishing;Randomized, Controlled Trials;Recommendation;Recovery;recruit;Reporting;Research;research study;social stigma;Sorting;Statistical Data Interpretation;Substance Use Disorder;systematic review;tool;Translating;United States;Work",Tailoring a patient engagement framework for substance use disorder research,59557,SPIP,"Social Psychology, Personality and Interpersonal Processes Study Section[SPIP]",NA,S1,2,107862,12987,120849,NA

Multiple sclerosis (MS) develops when the immune system attacks this myelin, resulting in damage and symptoms like motor and vision loss. MS is prevalent in women and Veterans, who have no curative treatment options and many treatments leave patients vulnerable to infection. These life-long treatments often require injections that limit independence and diminish quality of life. The goal of this project is the development of therapies that specifically counter the attack against myelin, while leaving healthy immunity intact. This will be achieved by engineering therapeutics that precisely promote regulatory immune cells to deactivate the cells that attack myelin. The research will leverage nanotechnology for the assembly and delivery of these therapeutics to skin, where immune cells are dense and were recently shown to regulate autoimmunity.

Accordingly, there is an urgent need to increase our understanding of TBI-induced long-term disability mechanisms related to chronic pain/headache, and to test the efficacy and mechanism of potential drug-free therapy, electro-acupuncture (EA), that has excellent potential for rapid translation. This urgently needed evidence-based testing of specific mechanisms of efficacy currently limit the application of this non- addictive drug-free EA therapy to TBI-induced pain/headache.

To bridge this gap, in this proposal, we will investigate the amount of whole-body movement information that can be extracted in a single region of human motor cortex and quantify the degree to which we can modify the functional architecture of the implant site itself to support the desired iBCI application, laying the groundwork for developing versatile iBCI applications for a variety of clinical populations.",79357095 (contact),"SCHONE, HUNTER  (contact)","VAN'T VEER, ASHLEE V",2024-12-01,2027-11-30,Ankle;Architecture;Area;arm;arm movement;Automobile Driving;Body part;brain computer interface;BRAIN initiative;Brain Injuries;career;Cervical spinal cord injury;Clinical;clinical translation;Clinical Trials;clinically relevant;Computers;Data;design;Development;Electrodes;Engineering;Environment;Exhibits;expectation;experience;Fellowship;foot;Foundations;Freedom;functional electrical stimulation;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Goals;grasp;Hand;Head;Human;Imagery;Implant;implantable device;improved;Individual;insight;Investigation;Ipsilateral;Learning;Limb Prosthesis;Limb structure;Link;Maps;Motor;motor control;Motor Cortex;Motor disability;motor impairment;motor learning;Movement;multi-electrode arrays;neural;Neuronal Plasticity;neuroprosthesis;Neurosciences;neurotransmission;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Participant;Performance;Population;professor;Property;Research;Research Personnel;response;Robotics;Self-Help Devices;Site;skills;Stroke;stroke survivor;System;Technology;Testing;Time;Training;Universities;Work;Wrist,Using Neuroprosthetics to Promote Plasticity in Cortical Motor Circuits,139145,ZMH1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZMH1 ERB-P (06)],NA,NA,1,78828,0,78828,NA

New evidence shows that the brain is capable of controlling these “hemodynamic” changes finely enough to use it to identify neuronal activity at the scale of the “layers” of the cerebral cortex, which are the inputs and outputs of brain circuits, yet, unfortunately, the imaging resolution of modern fMRI is not high enough to resolve these layers. To address this, in this F32 fellowship we propose to develop a high-resolution one-dimensional imaging approach called “linescan fMRI” that rapidly scans across the cerebral cortical layers, then fully characterize its performance, validate it as a tool for measuring brain activity within cerebral cortical layers, then apply it to a new experiment we have designed, all to establish linescan fMRI as a mainstream tool for human neuroscience.",14231764 (contact),"YUSIF RODRIGUEZ, NADIRA DEL R.
