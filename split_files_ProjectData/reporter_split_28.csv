We have shown that acute and chronic injury produce opposite effects on sensibility and responsiveness of tactile (desensitization) and nociceptive (sensitization) mechano-sensory afferents and the abnormal response of these afferents are critical to the maintenance of the neuropathic state and its recovery after nerve injury. Our published and preliminary data suggest that oxytocin (OXT) may speed recovery from pain after injury by returning peripheral input to normal. These data suggest that OXT may be used as a disease- modifying treatment after traumatic injury. With a base on the strength of our preliminary results, we anticipate that this research will contribute to understanding the role of OXT in the modulation of both normal and abnormal peripheral inputs, how this modulation may affect the recovery after nerve damage (L5 SNL), driving central circuitry, nocifensive behavior and attention (Project 2).

The problem may in part stem from subtle but important differences between current vaccine Envs & authentic Env spikes on replicating virus surfaces: logically, the form of vaccine Env, including its context & carbohydrate shell, should be as close to a perfect match as possible. Another problem is that the prototype broadly neutralizing antibodies generated during natural infection generally make contacts with sugars on HIV, whereas vaccine antibodies generally avoid these sugars, severely limiting their potential for vaccine protection.

After complete spinal cord injury (SCI) voluntary control over micturition is eliminated. Recovery is possible if L4/L3 segments are not damaged, but suppression of the EUS guarding reflex is incomplete leading to detrusor-sphincter-dyssynergy (DSD) and inefficient voiding after SCI. Various therapeutic approaches have been employed to reduce DSD, but currently available treatments do not give fully satisfactory results and may be accompanied by side effects. Furthermore, sexual dimorphism in anatomy and function of the lower urinary tract (LUT) suggests differences in the spinal neural circuits of male and female which in turn may require different approaches to DSD treatment in males and females. Therefore, development of targeted DSD treatment requires better understanding of neural control and intimate mechanisms of intraspinal regulation of EUS and BL activity, which will help to design future therapeutic methods. This project is aiming to fill the gap in knowledge about the spinal circuit responsible for EUS relaxation during voiding and about the post-SCI involvement of a recently discovered LUT- related propriospinal circuit. New knowledge about sex-related differences in structure and function of these circuits in spinal intact (SI) and SCI animals will reveal critical points in gender- oriented therapies to cure LUT dysfunctions.",1975333;6154918 (contact),"KARNUP, SERGEI V;YOSHIMURA, NAOKI  (contact)","MULLINS, CHRISTOPHER V",2021-07-01,2025-05-31,3-Dimensional;Anatomy;Anesthesia procedures;Animals;Area;Ataxia;Axon;biocytin;Bladder;Brain;C57BL/10 Mouse;Cell Nucleus;cholinergic neuron;Chronic;clinical practice;design;Development;efficacy evaluation;Electric Stimulation;Electrophysiology (science);excitatory neuron;Exhibits;experimental study;Feedback;Female;Functional disorder;Future;Gender;gender difference;Generations;Genetic;Glutamates;Goals;Horns;improved;In Vitro;in vivo;inhibitory neuron;Injections;injury recovery;insight;Interneurons;Interruption;intravesical;Knowledge;Label;Light;Lower urinary tract;mad itch virus;male;Mammals;Maps;Mediating;Methods;Micturition Reflex;Modification;Motor Neurons;mouse model;Mus;Muscle;neural;neural circuit;neuronal circuitry;Neurons;neuroregulation;Neurotransmitters;novel therapeutics;Optics;optogenetics;Pathway interactions;Periodicity;Persons;pharmacologic;Pontine structure;Population;postsynaptic;Preparation;pressure;Rattus;Reaction;Recommendation;Recovery;Recovery of Function;Recurrence;Reflex action;Regulation;Relaxation;Research Project Grants;Residual state;response;restoration;Rhodopsin;Role;sex;Sex Differences;sexual dimorphism;side effect;Slice;Sphincter;Spinal;Spinal Cord;Spinal Cord Diseases;Spinal cord injury;spinal pathway;spinal tract;Structure;Synapses;Synaptic Potentials;synergism;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;therapeutically effective;Tracer;Transgenic Mice;Urethane;Urethral sphincter;Urinary Retention;Urination;Urine;urologic;Viral,Intraspinal circuits supporting synergy between the bladder and urethral sphincter in mice,129194,KUFD,Kidney and Urological Systems Function and Dysfunction Study Section[KUFD],NA,NA,4,211200,124608,335808,NA

One of the most common forms of AKI is acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

This is because there is currently no treatment available for to prevent RPE atrophy and thus GA, which is an advanced form of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). The disease is characterized by focal RPE cell loss. Because the RPE maintains photoreceptor homeostasis, photoreceptors die as well, which then leads to vision loss. Recently, it has been recognized that the high metabolic demands of photoreceptors may contribute to disease progression in AMD, in particular, because photoreceptors and RPE metabolism are tightly linked. To study how photoreceptor metabolism can affect the RPE we generated an animal model in which photoreceptor metabolism is altered. These mice develop AMD-like characteristics including focal RPE atrophy. In this project we propose to investigate what exactly causes the pathologies seen in these mice and how the RPE deteriorates over time. This will help us understand how altered photoreceptor metabolism can affect RPE health.",10631076 (contact),"PUNZO, CLAUDIO  (contact)","NEUHOLD, LISA",2021-06-01,2026-05-31,advanced disease;Affect;Age;Age related macular degeneration;Animal Model;Area;Atrophic;Autophagocytosis;Blindness;Candidate Disease Gene;Cell Death;Cells;Cellular Metabolic Process;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Complement;Complex;Cone;Data;density;Deposition;Derivation procedure;Deterioration;dietary;Disease;Disease Progression;Docosahexaenoic acid supplementation;Drusen;Ecosystem;Electroporation;Event;Fatty Acids;FRAP1 gene;Functional disorder;Gene Expression;Genes;Genetic Transcription;geographic atrophy;Glucose;Glycolysis;Goals;Health;Hexokinase 2;Homeostasis;Human;Impairment;in vivo;Individual;Industrialization;Link;lipidomics;Lipoproteins;Literature;Location;Long-Term Effects;Lysosomes;macula;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolism;metabolomics;Modeling;Mus;Nutrient;Pathogenesis;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Patients;Phase;Phosphotransferases;photoreceptor degeneration;Photoreceptors;plasmid DNA;postnatal;prevent;Procedures;Process;Production;Proteins;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt;Publishing;Research;response;Retina;Retinitis Pigmentosa;Rod;Rotation;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Stress;Structure of retinal pigment epithelium;Testing;Time;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomics;Translations;Tuberous Sclerosis;Vertebrate Photoreceptors,Identifying the cause for photoreceptor-mediated retinal-pigmented epithelium atrophy,32461,BVS,Biology of the Visual System Study Section[BVS],NA,NA,4,250000,168750,418750,NA

Notably, Veterans with HIV have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to HIV-negative Veterans with similar age and body weight, but the reason for this higher risk is not clear. Recent studies show that treated HIV can cause changes in adipose tissue (body fat) that are similar to the changes occurring in obesity, which reduce the ability of adipose tissue to store energy and promote the accumulation of adipocytes (fat cells) infiltrating other organs and tissues such as the liver and skeletal muscle.

ESKAPE (Enterococcus, S. aureus, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and Enterobacter spp.) pathogens are particularly pathogenic because they have increased capacity to acquire resistance and virulence traits. We have proven that a multifaceted program involving improved basic perioperative preventive measures can generate substantial reductions in S. aureus transmission and significant reductions in SSIs (88% reduction as compared to usual care). In this study, we aim to examine the relative effectiveness of each component of this program in controlling ESKAPE transmission and reducing SSIs and to identify an optimal implementation strategy for national dissemination.

However, the use of recombinant leptin as a therapeutic agent is extremely limited. This is due to widespread leptin resistance, observed even after moderate increases in leptin. We determined that reducing leptin concentrations in circulation results in a dramatic improvement in leptin sensitivity, which leads to an immediate increase in insulin sensitivity. The studies we propose here are aimed to a) better understand the mechanistic aspects of this leptin sensitization; b) determine which anti-diabetic pharmacological treatment regimens rely on a leptin-lowering effect to achieve their established action, and c) gain a better understanding of the regulation of leptin production at the level of different fat-pads. As such, the proposed studies are of immediate relevance for both clinical applications of neutralizing leptin antibody preparations, as well as the basic understanding of leptin production and action.",1896064;2204305 (contact),"ELMQUIST, JOEL K.;SCHERER, PHILIPP E (contact)","LAUGHLIN, MAREN R",2021-07-01,2025-05-31,Acute;Address;Adipocytes;adipokines;adiponectin;Adipose tissue;Adrenergic Receptor;Adult;adult obesity;Affect;Agonist;Animals;Anti-diabetic Drugs;Antibodies;Area;blood glucose regulation;Body Weight;Body Weight decreased;Brain;brain tissue;Cellular Metabolic Process;Chronic;Circulation;clinical application;Closure by clamp;diet-induced obesity;Eating;Energy Metabolism;experimental study;Fatty acid glycerol esters;FGF21 gene;fibroblast growth factor 21;Food Energy;Food Intake Regulation;GCG gene;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Glucagon;Glucose;Hand;Homeostasis;Hypothalamic structure;improved;in vivo;Individual;inhibitor;insight;Insulin Resistance;insulin sensitivity;insulin sensitizing drugs;insulin signaling;Intervention;Laboratories;Leptin;Leptin deficiency;leptin receptor;Leptin resistance;Ligands;Lipids;Lipodystrophy;LoxP-flanked allele;Mediating;Mediator;Metabolic;Metabolic Control;Metabolic Diseases;metabolic profile;Metabolism;Metformin;Modeling;Monitor;mouse model;Nature;Neurons;Obesity;Organ;overexpression;Peptides;Peripheral;Personal Satisfaction;pharmacologic;Pharmacological Treatment;Physiological;Physiology;Plasma;Play;Population;Positioning Attribute;predictive modeling;Preparation;Pro-Opiomelanocortin;Process;Production;Publishing;Recombinants;Records;Regimen;Regulation;Reporter;response;Role;Series;sexual dimorphism;Signal Transduction;success;Sympathetic Nervous System;System;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Agents;Therapeutic Intervention;Time;Tissues;tool;Transgenic Organisms;Treatment Protocols;Visceral;Work,Metabolic Benefits of Leptin Reduction,127274,POMD,Pathophysiology of Obesity and Metabolic Disease Study Section[POMD],NA,NA,4,392688,251320,644008,NA

Loss of ovarian function due to pre-mature ovarian failure or menopause are key underlying factors in the development of osteoporosis in women. Alternatives to traditional hormone therapy (estrogen alone or with progesterone) that can deliver hormones while reducing/eliminating safety risks such as cardiovascular disease or cancer would provide an alternative to existing pharmacological treatments including pharmacological hormone therapy and the bisphosphonates. We will assess the ability of a biomimetic ovarian cell encapsulation system developed by our team to regulate female endocrine hormone pathways in a manner that is safer and more effective at achieving bone health than pharmacological agents in a rat ovariectomy model. These studies will also allow determination of how the female endocrine regulatory pathways are impacted by the cell encapsulation strategy to yield these outcomes.,7774437;1955677;9509383 (contact);16121424,"BOYAN, BARBARA D.;OPARA, EMMANUEL C.;SAUL, JUSTIN  (contact);YAZDANI, SAAMI K","MARQUITZ, ARON",2023-05-15,2028-03-31,Address;Affect;Age;Age Years;Alendronate;Alginates;Allogenic;American;Animals;Anterior Pituitary Gland;Belief;Biomimetics;bisphosphonate;bone;bone health;cancer type;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cardiovascular system;Cell Separation;Cell Survival;Cell Therapy;cell type;Cells;Clinic;Clinical;clinical translation;confocal imaging;design;Development;Direct Costs;Disproportionately impacts women;Dose;egg;Encapsulated;Endocrine;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Epigenetic Process;Estrogens;experimental study;Female;Follicle Stimulating Hormone;Fracture;gender difference;Gene Expression Profile;Glucocorticoids;Goals;granulosa cell;Heart;Histology;Hormone secretion;hormone therapy;Hormones;hospitalization rates;Human;Hypothalamic Hormones;Hypothalamic structure;Immune response;Immunologics;Implant;implantation;improved;in silico;In Vitro;Incidence;insight;Knowledge;loss of function;Luteinizing Hormone;Malignant Breast Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Mechanics;men;Menopause;Messenger RNA;microCT;MicroRNAs;Modeling;Myocardial Infarction;next generation sequencing;older women;Oocytes;Oryctolagus cuniculus;Osteoporosis;Osteoporosis prevention;osteoporosis with pathological fracture;osteoporotic bone;Outcome;Ovarian;ovarian failure;Ovarian Follicle;Ovarian Granulosa Cell;Ovarian hormone;Ovarian Tissue;Ovariectomy;Ovary;Pathway interactions;Performance;Pharmaceutical Preparations;pharmacologic;Pharmacological Treatment;Physiological;Pituitary Gland;Pituitary Hormones;Plasma;polyornithine;Postmenopause;Premature Ovarian Failure;Prevalence;Progesterone;Rattus;Recommendation;Regulation;Regulatory Pathway;Research;Risk;Risk Reduction;Safety;safety outcomes;Source;Stroke;Structure;Surgical Models;System;Testing;theca cell;therapeutic target;Time;Tissue Engineering;Tissue-Specific Gene Expression;Tissues;transcriptome sequencing;Uterus;Woman;Women&apos;s Health,Sustained regulation of hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary hormones with tissue-engineered ovarian constructs as a treatment for osteoporosis in females,81340,MTE,Musculoskeletal Tissue Engineering Study Section[MTE],NA,NA,2,421467,72666,494133,NA

Knowledge of the normal circuitry provides a foundation for understanding the causes of impaired brain function and developing corrective measures. Our studies of the normal circuitry between early visual cortical areas will provide greater insight into the causes and effects of central vision defects when these circuits are damaged by stroke or other neurological or developmental cause. In particular, our studies of feedback circuits between different visual cortical areas will help our understanding of how these pathways mediate the influence of stimulus context on neuronal responsivity, spatial integration, and changes in visual sensitivity associated with top-down attention. Moreover, understanding how these circuits operate in normal vision will provide a foundation for understanding the consequences of their dysfunction in neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as autism, schizophrenia and attention deficits disorders, which have been directly linked to abnormalities in inter-areal connectivity [e.g. Belmonte et al.

DNA-directed RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) is one of the most important molecules in biology. Pol II is highly- conserved among eukaryotic organisms and plays a fundamental role in cellular life; specifically the transcription of genes into messenger RNA. Pol II studies, and RNA polymerase studies in general, lag the diverse and extensive studies on DNA polymerases where high resolution, atomic level data on conformational changes and chemical groups that drive catalysis and translocation have been revealed. Catalysis and translocation of multi-subunit RNA polymerases underlie all cellular RNA synthesis. Advancing our knowledge will be hugely significant for understanding how these enzymes work and are potentially regulated by initiation and elongation factors. Our preliminary experiments reveal ‚Äúsnapshots of the transcriptional process at different time points‚Äù. The studies proposed in this renewal will uncover (for the first time) a ‚Äúmolecular movie‚Äù of nucleotide addition and will lead to the fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of DNA mediated transcription.

Is unclear how these regulatory networks functions in cells, how APA is achieved, and which elements miRNA specifically target, but disruption in these basic processes has been implicated in a broad array of human diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer‚Äôs, and muscular dystrophies.  The experiments described in this research grant use a unique combination of genetics, biochemistry, bioinformatics and HT genomics taking advantage of the extensive genetic knowledge of the round nematode C. elegans to shed light on these important processes, produce unparalleled amount of information regarding APA reaction, and provide an unprecedented resource for the worm community. 1",10492521 (contact),"MANGONE, MARCO  (contact)","CZAPLINSKI, KEVIN",2016-06-01,2025-05-31,3&apos; Untranslated Regions;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;base;Biochemistry;Bioinformatics;Biological;Biological Models;Biology;Caenorhabditis elegans;Cell Lineage;Cells;cis acting element;Cloning;Communication;Communities;Complex;Coupled;Cytoplasm;Data;Data Set;Databases;Development;Disease;dosage;Elements;Event;Experimental Genetics;experimental study;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Regulation;Gene Rearrangement;Genes;Genetic;genetic manipulation;genetic signature;Genetic Transcription;Genome;Genomics;Goals;Grant;Homologous Gene;Human;human disease;Immunoprecipitation;improved;in vivo;insight;Intestines;Knowledge;Length;Malignant Neoplasms;Manuals;Maps;Mechanics;member;Messenger RNA;Methods;MicroRNAs;Modification;Molecular;mRNA Translation;Muscle;Muscular Dystrophies;N-Methylaspartate;Nematoda;Neurons;novel;Nuclear;Organism;Pattern;Pharyngeal structure;Physiological;Polyadenylation;Population;Post-Transcriptional Regulation;posttranscriptional;Process;Production;Protein Isoforms;Proteome;Reaction;Regulation;Regulatory Element;Repression;Research;Research Project Grants;Resolution;Resources;RNA Binding;RNA-Binding Proteins;Role;Signal Transduction;Site;Sorting;Subcutaneous Tissue;Tail;Terminator Codon;Testing;Tissues;tool;transcription regulatory network;transcriptome;Update;Validation;virtual,Genetics and Genomics of Alternative Polyadenylation and miRNA Regulation in C. e - Renewal - 1,118796,GCAT,"Genomics, Computational Biology and Technology Study Section[GCAT]",NA,NA,9,216300,98605,314905,NA

This grant proposes to improve outcomes for AML by: 1) identifying synergistic combinations of radioimmunotherapy approaches with highly effective, but not yet curative, targeted agents; 2) correlating efficacy with the extent of DNA damage achieved by synergistic combinations; and 3) by comparing these radioimmunotherapy combinations as preparative chemotherapy prior to allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.",10727686 (contact),"OROZCO, JOHNNIE JOSE (contact)","CAPALA, JACEK",2020-06-01,2025-05-31,90Y;Acute Myelocytic Leukemia;Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplantation;Allogenic;Antibodies;antibody conjugate;Antibody Specificity;Apoptosis;Apoptotic;Astatine;BCL2 gene;Behavior Therapy;Bispecific Antibodies;Bone Marrow;Bone Marrow Transplantation;Cell Line;Cells;Cesium;chemotherapy;Chimerism;Chromosome abnormality;Clinical Research;clinical trial enrollment;Clinical Trials;Combination Drug Therapy;conditioning;curative treatments;Data;Disease;Disease remission;DNA Damage;DNA Repair;DNA Sequence Alteration;donor stem cell;dosimetry;Engraftment;ethnic minority population;Funding;Genetic Variation;Grant;Hematologic Neoplasms;Hematology;Hematopoietic Neoplasms;Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation;high risk;I131 isotope;Immunocompetent;improved;improved outcome;In Vitro;Infrastructure;inhibitor;interest;irradiation;Label;leukemia;leukemia treatment;Leukemic Cell;Lymphoma;Modeling;Monoclonal Antibodies;mouse model;multidisciplinary;Multiple Myeloma;Mus;new therapeutic target;Non-Hodgkin&apos;s Lymphoma;Normal tissue morphology;novel;Oral;Organ;Outcome;participant enrollment;Pathway interactions;patient subsets;Patients;Pharmacologic Substance;Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitor;post-transplant;pre-clinical;Pre-Clinical Model;preclinical study;Prior Chemotherapy;Prior Therapy;PTPRC gene;Radiation;Radiation Dose Unit;Radiation therapy;Radioimmunoconjugate;Radioimmunotherapy;Radioisotopes;Radiolabeled;Regimen;Relapse;Reporting;Research Personnel;response;Site;small molecule;small molecule inhibitor;Spleen;Supportive care;Surface Antigens;synergism;Systemic disease;Systemic Therapy;targeted agent;targeted treatment;Technology;Tissues;Toxic effect;Translating;Transplantation;Treatment Efficacy;Treatment Failure;tumor;tumor eradication;United States National Institutes of Health;Whole-Body Irradiation;Xenograft procedure,Combining Targeted RIT and Synergistic Novel Agents to Eradicate AML,252070,RTB,Radiation Therapeutics and Biology Study Section[RTB],NA,NA,6,515741,316850,832591,NA

The studies may uncover protein import stress and mPOS as novel mechanisms of neural and muscular degeneration, and help the understanding and treatment of Ant1-induced diseases and possibly, many other clinical conditions that directly or indirectly affect mitochondrial protein import.",7736889 (contact);1903440;1961089,"CHEN, XIN JIE  (contact);MASSA, PAUL T;MIDDLETON, FRANK A.","BARRETT, PAUL JOHN",2020-09-01,2025-05-31,Address;Adenine Nucleotide Translocase;Affect;Aging;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis;Animals;Area;Autophagocytosis;Behavioral;Bioenergetics;Cause of Death;Cell Death;Cell Death Induction;Cells;Central Nervous System;cerebral atrophy;Charge;Child;Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia;Clinical;Cytoprotection;Cytosol;Data;Defect;Degenerative Disorder;Dementia;Disease;dominant genetic mutation;Equilibrium;Experimental Models;FRAP1 gene;Frontotemporal Dementia;Functional disorder;Future;Gene Expression Profile;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Goals;hearing impairment;Heart;Histologic;Human;Impairment;Inner mitochondrial membrane;insight;Intervention;Knock-in Mouse;Late-Onset Disorder;Lateral;Maintenance;Membrane;Missense Mutation;Mitochondria;Mitochondrial Diseases;Mitochondrial DNA;mitochondrial dysfunction;Mitochondrial Proteins;Modeling;Molecular;mouse model;Mus;Muscle;muscle form;Muscle Weakness;mutant;Mutation;Myopathy;Names;neural;neuromechanism;neuromuscular;Neuromuscular Diseases;Neurons;novel;Nuclear;Nucleotides;old mice;Oxidative Phosphorylation;Oxidative Phosphorylation Deficiency;Oxidative Stress;Parkinson Disease;Pathogenicity;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;Phenotype;Play;posttranscriptional;preference;Protein Import;Protein Isoforms;Proteins;psychiatric symptom;receptor;Repression;Research;Respiration;Role;Seizures;Skeletal Muscle;SLC25A4 gene;Spastic Paraplegia;Spinocerebellar Ataxias;Stress;success;Suppressor-Effector T-Lymphocytes;Surface;Syndrome;System;Testing;tool;translocase;ubiquitin-protein ligase;Ubiquitination;Validation;Variant;Yeasts;young adult,Novel mechanism of neural and muscular degeneration,63499,CMAD,Cellular Mechanisms in Aging and Development Study Section[CMAD],NA,NA,5,254382,157717,412099,NA
