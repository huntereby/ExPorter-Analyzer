To fulfill this mission, MDFSB conducts regulatory food safety activities at all sectors of the dairy industry from farm to table, including inspections of dairy farms, bulk milk tanker trucks, milk processing plants, industry milk testing laboratories and manufacturers of single-use dairy containers. MDFSB also collects regulatory samples of milk, milk products and water supplies for laboratory testing, responds to consumer complaints and food safety incidents, and initiates impounds and product recalls to protect public health as warranted. In addition, sanitation ratings by MDFSB personnel certify milk supplies and milk plants for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to ship Grade-A milk and milk products in interstate commerce. MDFSB as part of the AHFSS Division of CDFA, relies on the ET database to manage daily business activities such as licensing, registration, certification, permitting, inspection, traceability, compliance, and enforcement. ET is also integrated with the California Animal Health and Food Safety (CAHFS) Laboratory System to electronically submit and receive testing results for dairy samples. A 2016 analysis of ET, performed by the California Department of Technology (CDT) Data Management Consultant, found that ET's current data model no longer represents the business need of AHFSS. The report also identified that the means to ensure reliable shared data, necessary for key management decisions, are not fully implemented, resulting in duplicate information and orphaned records (not linked to a parent record). The following data quality issues are just a few of the concerns identified in the CDT report: duplicate farm records (over 3,000); incomplete data (59,380 active operation records with no date); and invalid data issues (street number, street name, and street suffix are all in the same field and are not uniform, making it hard to search for existing premises). Since this report, these numbers have increased with the adoption of mobile devices to capture activity. Accurate information is essential to a rapid and effective response during an animal health or food safety incident and any delay increases the potentially negative effects and hinders control measures. The ET 2 database will help CDFA, including the Milk and Dairy Food Safety Branch, to respond efficiently and effectively to future food safety incidents, disease outbreaks, and natural disasters. This project is in accordance with the purpose of special projects outlined in the RFA to develop and implement special projects that support innovation and integration in a nationally Integrated Food Safety System (IFSS) using the MFRPS framework. This track will also support other emerging food safety priorities that develop over the lifespan of the project. CDFA is responsible for supporting the responsible jurisdiction and coordinating activities during and immediately following a disaster impacting the agriculture and food industry and supporting the recovery of impacted industries and resources post disaster. The plan specifically references AHFSS as a resource to protect public health, the health of California's livestock and poultry, and to provide safety of food at animal origin.

Since then, WV DHHR has held conformance through the hybrid audit performed in 2021 and conƟnues to work to maintain conformance with the new 2022 MFRPS. WV DHHR is invested in the Manufactured Food Program Standards because it allows us to maintain a program that puts a priority on protecƟng public health through evaluaƟng and monitoring risk, by maintaining inspecƟonal standards and training, and by sharing data with partners. WV DHHR is working to maintain and advance our framework for mutual reliance by ensuring our staﬀ are trained according to Standard 2. As an example, WV DHHR has one inspector fully qualiﬁed to conduct process controls inspecƟons, acidiﬁed inspecƟons, Juice HACCP, and low acid canned food inspecƟons, and plans to have a second trained in all these areas prior to the conclusion of 2025. WV DHHR works with FDA to conduct work planning for the FDA contract and shares noncontract state inspecƟon data with the FDA Liaison. Our standards require the program to assess areas of weakness and idenƟfy gaps in standards on a rouƟne basis and at a minimum annually. WV DHHR MFRPS Self-Assessment has idenƟﬁed areas for improvement in the past that resulted in working to add ﬁeld staﬀ to the manufactured food program speciﬁcally. It has idenƟﬁed areas that were weak regarding policy, like adding informaƟon about when samples could be released for validaƟon tesƟng and who could request their release. WV DHHR has also adopted 21 CFR 117 by reference as part of our Food Manufacturing FaciliƟes Rule W.Va. 64 CSR 43 in 2022. This change, along with modeling our standards based on the naƟonal program, helps reduce foodborne illness risks by allowing WV DHHR to focus on the hazards that cause illnesses during inspecƟons. WV DHHR has also maintained a Food ProtecƟon Task Force for as long as the organizaƟon has been enrolled in MFRPS and VNRFRPS. Our Task Force has maintained meeƟngs during the pandemic by meeƟng virtually and returned to hosƟng in-person in November of 2022. Moving forward the Task Force will host two in-person meeƟngs. One to set projects for educaƟon and goals speciﬁcally and the other will focus on updaƟng missions, vision, and governance. The Task Force will conƟnue to uƟlize virtual meeƟng space to conduct business between in-person meeƟngs for things like commiƩees and variance review. Our Task Force is instrumental in garnering input and feedback relaƟng to draŌing legislaƟon, creaƟng policies and procedures, providing guidance for variance reviews, and serving to communicate updates to consƟtuents and partner organizaƟons.

While HIV integration and latency in tissues such as the brain are challenges to the cure, the relationships between HIV integration and chromatin dynamics may be drastically different in prevalent populations of HIV+ drug users, especially Methamphetamine. Following a two phase project, where a progression of models will lead to conclusions about HIV/SIV integration site frequency, location and markers, we expect to prove our hypothesis that Meth impacts chromatin structure in microglia, enhancing viral integration susceptibilities and that these effects vary between brain regions that differ in levels of dopaminergic projections, and their involvement in the addiction circuitry, leading to a paradigm shift about the role of brain regions and their heterogeneous microglia populations in the establishment of a reservoir state.",9436441 (contact),"MARCONDES, MARIA CECILIA GARIBALDI (contact)","BORGMANN, KATHLEEN RUTH",2023-09-30,2025-08-31,addiction;Address;Affect;Animals;antiretroviral therapy;Architecture;Area;Basal Ganglia;Binding;Brain;Brain region;CCCTC-binding factor;Cell Line;Cell model;Cells;Central Nervous System;Central Nervous System Stimulants;Cerebellum;Characteristics;Chromatin;Chromatin Structure;Chronic;comparison control;Complex;Data;density;Dopamine;Dopamine Receptor;Drug usage;Drug user;Epigenetic Process;epigenomics;Exhibits;Experimental Models;Frequencies;Gene Expression Profile;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Genome;Genomic Segment;Genomics;Goals;Grant;Heterogeneity;HIV;HIV Infections;HIV-1;HIV-1 integrase;Human;In Vitro;in vitro testing;in vivo;in vivo Model;induced pluripotent stem cell;Infection;Inflammation;Inflammatory;insight;Intake;integration site;Link;Location;Macaca mulatta;Mediating;Methamphetamine;methamphetamine effect;methamphetamine use;Microglia;Modeling;neuroAIDS;Neurologic;Neurotransmitters;nonhuman primate;novel;Nucleus Accumbens;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Population;Population Heterogeneity;Predisposition;Prefrontal Cortex;Provirus Integration;Publishing;response;Role;Site;SIV;Stimulant;Structure;substance use;Substantia nigra structure;System;Testing;Tissues;transcriptional coactivator p75;Validation;Ventral Tegmental Area;Viral;Viral Genome;Viral reservoir;Virus Integration;Work,"Methamphetamine, HIV integration and latency in the brain",59924,ZDA1,ZDA1-SXC-N(O2)R,NA,NA,2,348137,217731,565868,NA

Intercellular crosstalk of hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells (i.e. Mφ and LSEC) is crucial for the maintenance of liver homeostasis. Under the pathological condition, hepatocyte damage results in the activation of fibrotic Mφ and LSEC. Thereby these cells play a critical role in the control of hepatic inflammation and the development of liver fibrosis. Exosomes are small membrane-bound extracellular vesicles and serve as natural carriers of signaling molecules such as cytokines for prompting cellular crosstalk. This project will identify a major cellular and molecular mechanism for the role of exosomes released from HCV-infected hepatocytes in promoting intercellular communication with non-parenchymal cells (i.e. Mφ and LSEC), leading to the development of liver fibrosis.

Although there are many effective osteoporosis treatment options, no single therapy is recommended for indefinite use and thus long-term management of osteoporosis involves transitions between agents. Optimal approaches to long-term osteoporosis treatment, including how best to manage sequential and possibly combination use of different types of medications over a patient’s lifetime, are unknown and a major knowledge gap in the field. With the work described in this proposal, we aim to provide evidence to guide treatment decisions over the lifetime for patients with osteoporosis. To do so, we propose to first perform meta-analyses of clinical studies on the efficacy of sequential and combination osteoporosis treatment strategies; and then carry out comprehensive cost-effectiveness analyses to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a variety of long-term treatment strategies for patients with osteoporosis with different clinical characteristics.",9395361 (contact),"NAYAK, SMITA  (contact)","JOSEPH, LYNDON",2023-09-30,2026-05-31,Acute;Acute myocardial infarction;Address;Adherence;Adverse event;Affect;Age;Aging;Alendronate;American;Anabolic Agents;Area;arm;beneficiary;bisphosphonate;bone;Bone Density;Bone Diseases;bone loss;bone strength;Calcium;Caring;Categories;Cerebrovascular Disorders;Characteristics;Chronic;Chronic Disease;Clinical;clinical care;clinical efficacy;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;Combined Modality Therapy;compare effectiveness;cost;cost effective;cost effectiveness;Cost Effectiveness Analysis;Data;Death Rate;efficacy evaluation;evidence base;Exercise Therapy;experience;Face;falls;Forteo;Fracture;fracture risk;fragility fracture;Future;Hip Fractures;Holidays;human old age (65+);Ibandronate;improved;Individual;innovation;interest;Investigation;Knowledge;Medical;Medicare;men;Meta-Analysis;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality;novel;observational cohort study;older adult;Osteoporosis;osteoporosis with pathological fracture;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Patients;Pattern;personalized management;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacological Treatment;Physicians;Pneumonia;Population;Postmenopause;prevent;Professional Organizations;Publication Bias;Raloxifene;Recommendation;Recording of previous events;Regimen;relative cost;relative effectiveness;Reporting;Research;Review Literature;Risedronate;Risk;Risk Reduction;Sequential Treatment;skeletal disorder;Spinal Fractures;Subgroup;systematic review;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Agents;Time;treatment as usual;Treatment Protocols;treatment strategy;United States;United States National Institutes of Health;Vitamin D;Woman;Work;Zoledronic Acid,Long-Term Approaches to Treating Osteoporosis,81466,HSQE,Health Services: Quality and Effectiveness Study Section[HSQE],NA,NA,2,171919,43687,215606,NA

Given the complex relationship between of these determinants, asthma outcomes, and the need to investigate the extent of how patient, provider, and community-level variation impacts our population, this proposal aims to improve the identification and understanding of multifactorial, multilevel determinants of asthma through 1) engagement of patients with asthma and their caregivers, 2) uncovering unknown region and population-specific factors underlying differences in outcomes, and 3) examining variation in asthma outcomes through multilevel analyses (patient, provider, community). There are few population-level analyses of pediatric asthma in rural and underresourced settings, and this proposal represents a foundational step in impacting disparity and inequity in asthma, while also providing findings that will inform innovative patient-centered, population-based interventional trials targeting high-risk pediatric asthma in Arkansas with broader implications as a model for investigations among other rural at-risk populations.",77898209 (contact),"JEFFERSON, AKILAH ANDREA (contact)","FREEMER, MICHELLE M",2024-09-15,2028-07-31,Address;administrative database;Area;Arkansas;Asthma;Automobile Driving;Black race;care outcomes;Caregivers;Caring;Characteristics;Child;Child Development;Child Health;Childhood;Childhood Asthma;Chronic;clinically relevant;Communities;community intervention;community-level factor;Complex;Data;Databases;design;Development;Dimensions;Disparate;Disparity;Emergency department visit;Ensure;ethnic minority;ethnic minority population;Ethnic Origin;Ethnic Population;Exhibits;experience;Extramural Activities;Face;Focus Groups;Foundations;Funding;Geography;Goals;Health;health care service utilization;Health Disparities Research;health equity promotion;Health Sciences;high risk;Hospitalization;Household;improved;indexing;Individual;Inequity;informant;Inhalators;innovation;Inpatients;Intervention;Intervention Trial;Interview;Investigation;K-Series Research Career Programs;Knowledge;Logistic Regressions;Measures;Medicaid;Mentors;Mentorship;Methods;minority children;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;multilevel analysis;Neighborhoods;Odds Ratio;Outcome;outcome disparities;patient engagement;patient oriented;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;population health;Population Intervention;Populations at Risk;Poverty Areas;preference;Prevalence;Provider;provider intervention;Quality of Care;Race;racial minority;racial minority population;racial population;Research;Research Methodology;Research Personnel;Resources;Risk;Risk Factors;Risk Management;Rural;rural area;School Nursing;success;tool;Training;Variant,Multifactorial Asthma Determinants in Underresourced Pediatric Populations,174407,MPOR,NHLBI Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Study Section[MPOR (MA)],NA,NA,1,152271,12182,164453,NA

The proposed research is relevant to the VA Office of Rehabilitation Research and Development’s mission because it is directed toward studying the effectiveness of pharmaceutical interventions in the treatment of comorbid mTBI-addiction. The Department of Defense and the Defense and Veteran's Brain Injury Center have estimated that 22% of all combat casualties from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan are brain injuries.

Primary mechanical damage induced brain tissue disruption after TBI progressively expands due to secondary injury mechanisms. Lipid peroxidation and subsequent cell demise via a recently discovered program of regulated death, ferroptosis, are important mechanisms involved TBI pathogenesis. However, the information on the types of cells in which these two aberrant processes are occurring and the major TBI-induced deficiencies in their regulation remain unknown, largely due to the lack of adequate methods. The goal of this application is to optimize and apply developed by us entirely new and revolutionizing technology – multi-omics imaging based on the employment of specifically designed secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and permitting simultaneous high-resolution imaging of three major types of biomolecules – lipids, proteins, and metabolites. Thus, not only the types of cells in TBI brain will be reliably identified but also accurate and quantitative information on changes of the amounts of oxidatively modified lipids and other metabolites will be determined in different subcellular compartments. By correlating this information with the data on neuropathology of the injured brain we will be able, for the first time, to decipher the mechanisms of lipid peroxidation driving ferroptotic death in specific cell types during TBI progression. Consequently, new effective and selective small molecule regulators of ferroptosis-inducing lipid peroxidation will be developed for targeted therapies and for evaluation of their efficacy in TBI.",8224249 (contact);1864636;14306168,"BAYIR, HÜLYA  (contact);KAGAN, VALERIAN E;TIAN, HUA","AWWAD, HIBAH OMAR",2012-07-01,2028-07-31,"acyl group;Address;Age;Amides;amino group;Anabolism;anandamide;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;antibody conjugate;Arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase;Arachidonic Acids;Area;Automobile Driving;Binding Proteins;Biology;Brain;Brain Injuries;brain tissue;catalyst;Cause of Death;Cell Death;cell type;Cells;Cessation of life;Clinical;Coenzyme A Ligases;Complex;controlled cortical impact;Data;design;disability;effectiveness evaluation;Employment;Endocannabinoids;Evaluation;Family member;Gases;Generations;Goals;high resolution imaging;Image;Imaging Techniques;Imaging technology;Individual;Inflammation;Inflammatory Response;inhibitor;Injury;innovation;Intracranial Hypertension;Ions;Label;Lanthanoid Series Elements;Lateral;Lipid Peroxidation;lipidomics;Lipids;Liquid Chromatography;Maps;mass spectrometric imaging;Mechanics;meter;Methods;Minor;Modeling;Molecular;multiple omics;Mus;Necrosis;neuropathology;novel;oxidation;Oxidation-Reduction;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;peroxidation;Phosphatidylethanolamine;Phospholipids;Positioning Attribute;Process;programs;protein complex;Proteins;Protocols documentation;Reaction;Refractory;Regulation;Resolution;Role;Scaffolding Protein;Secondary to;Series;Signal Transduction;small molecule;Specificity;Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion;targeted treatment;TBI Patients;Technology;Testing;Three-Dimensional Imaging;Time;Tissues;transacylation;Traumatic Brain Injury;Water;young adult",Lipid Imaging in Traumatic Brain Injury by High Resolution GCIB-secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry,76511,EBIT,Enabling Bioanalytical and Imaging Technologies Study Section[EBIT],NA,NA,12,469168,99653,568821,NA

The proposed research is innovative, as it will (a) use data to develop and validate a prognostic scoring tool for maternal mortality/SMM that goes beyond individual-level factors; (b) assess hospital-level factors that may contribute to maternal mortality, by using data from 128 separate health systems in Cerner's Real-World DataTM (RWD) national database; (c) integrate geocoding and linked death data to enable better estimates of structural and social determinants of health (SSDoH) factors that contribute to maternal mortality/SMM; and (d) facilitate a rapid “scale-up” to a national level, given the multi-site nature of the Greater Plains Collaborative (GPC)/PCORnet data system.",11653447 (contact),"HSU, ALBERT L (contact)","DAGHER, RADA K",2023-09-22,2025-03-31,"Address;allostatic load;American;Biological;Birth;Black race;Black, Indigenous, People of Color;Caring;Catchment Area;Censuses;Cessation of life;Clinical;Clinical Data;Communication;Community Surveys;comorbidity;comparative effectiveness study;complex data;Country;Data;Data Collection;Data Set;Databases;Death Rate;demographics;Diagnosis;Employment;ethnic disparity;Event;experience;explicit bias;Family;Future;Great Plains;Green space;Health;Health system;Healthcare;Heart Diseases;Hemorrhage;high risk;Hospitals;implicit bias;Income;Indigenous;Individual;ineffective therapies;Inequity;Information Systems;innovation;Institution;Insurance Coverage;Knowledge;Link;Maternal Mortality;maternal outcome;Measurable;Measures;Medical;Missouri;Modeling;mortality;mortality risk;Nature;Neighborhoods;Outcome;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;people of color;Persons;Population;Postpartum Period;Pregnancy;Pregnancy Outcome;pregnant;preventable death;Privacy;prognostic;prospective;Protocols documentation;Provider;Race;racial disparity;racism;Records;Relative Risks;Research;Research Institute;residence;residential segregation;Review Committee;Rural;scale up;segregation;Sepsis;Services;severe maternal morbidity;Site;social;social health determinants;Social Security;socioeconomic disparity;structural determinants;structural health determinants;Structural Racism;System;systems research;Testing;tool;Translating;Universities;University Hospitals;Utah;walkability",DRIVERs:  Data systems Research to Identify driVers of Ethnic & Racial Inequities in Maternal Mortality,19175,HHD,Healthcare and Health Disparities Study Section[HHD],NA,NA,2,172875,60816,233691,NA

This brain microstructure age framework will provide meaningful insight into the microstructural processes underlying brain aging and AD/ADRD and enable quantitative assessment of treatment response to future symptomatic and disease-modifying therapies.",10658487 (contact),"FIEREMANS, ELS  (contact)","DIBATTISTA, AMANDA",2024-09-15,2026-06-30,Acceleration;Age;age related deterioration;Aging;aging brain;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Alzheimer&apos;s disease related dementia;Alzheimer’s disease biomarker;Amyloid;Amyloid beta-Protein;Astrocytosis;Autopsy;axonal degeneration;biological age;Brain;Brain scan;brain volume;Centenarian;Clinical;cohort;Collection;Data;Data Set;Dementia;Demyelinations;Deterioration;Development;Diagnosis;Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Dimensions;Disease;Disease Progression;Electronic Health Record;Ethnic Origin;Evaluation;follow-up;Functional disorder;Future;Genetic;Gliosis;gray matter;Health;healthy volunteer;Histopathology;Human;Image;image processing;Impaired cognition;in vivo;indexing;Individual;Infiltration;insight;life span;Life Style;lifestyle factors;Macrophage;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measures;Mediating;meter;Methods;millimeter;Modeling;modifiable risk;Molecular;Monitor;MRI Scans;multi-scale modeling;multidisciplinary;Nerve Degeneration;neuroimaging;neuroinflammation;neuropathology;novel;open source;Parameter Estimation;Pathologic;Pathologic Processes;Pathology;Patients;Phase;Preventive measure;Process;Proteomics;Protocols documentation;Race;Research;research study;Resolution;response;Risk;Risk Factors;Role;Sampling;Scanning;Series;sex;Source;Specificity;Specimen;Staging;Structure;tau Proteins;Time;treatment response;Validation;water diffusion;white matter;Work,"Multiscale Modeling of Brain Aging and Alzheimer’s Disease with MRI, Pathology and Proteomics",87904,ZAG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZAG1 ZIJ-2 (M2)],NA,NA,1,150000,104250,254250,NA

However, this may not translate to real-world changes in thromboembolic event risk upon co-prescription of these drugs, and there is scant research on EI-AED/DOAC interactions in humans, with the small number of available studies having highly inconsistent findings, major methodological limitations that impede interpretability, and an overall lack of consideration of the potential role of higher-order drug interactions.

Insights from this study will generate new ideas for how neurons and astrocytes use p62 differently in basal, stress, and disease conditions, and may uncover new and more precise cell-specific targets to modify autophagy for the treatment of neurodegenerative disease.",77866726 (contact),"SIDIBE, DAVID KADER (contact)","GUBITZ, AMELIE",2023-09-01,2025-02-28,Affect;Antioxidants;Area;Astrocytes;Autophagocytosis;Autophagosome;bafilomycin A1;Binding;biological adaptation to stress;cell type;Cells;Cellular Stress;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Coculture Techniques;combat;Cytoplasm;Data;Defect;Degradation Pathway;design;Disease;falls;Genes;Goals;Impairment;in vivo;inhibitor;insight;Investigation;knock-down;Knowledge;Link;Lysosomes;Measures;Metabolic stress;mutant;Mutation;Nerve Degeneration;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neurons;neuroprotection;Oxidative Stress;Oxidative Stress Induction;Pathology;Pathway interactions;protein aggregation;Proteins;Proteome;proteotoxicity;receptor;Regulation;Resolution;response;Role;Serine;Small Interfering RNA;Specific qualifier value;Stress;Structure;superoxide dismutase 1;System;targeted treatment;Testing;therapeutic development;transcription factor;Ubiquitin;Ubiquitination;Western Blotting,Defining cell type-specific functions for the selective autophagy receptor p62 in neurons and astrocytes,132431,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-F03A-E(20)L],NA,NA,2,17812,0,17812,NA

This transformative project has important implications for further dissemination and widespread understanding of the organizational and contextual factors which act as barriers to implementation of evidence-based interventions and can serve as a blueprint for guiding Minority Serving Institutions across the country to address the mental health needs of racial and ethnic minority groups in low resourced communities who have experience disparities in access and outcomes.",11297739 (contact),"SANCHEZ, KATHERINE  (contact)","FERNANDEZ, ANGELA R",2023-09-24,2028-05-31,access disparities;addiction;Address;Anxiety;Attention;Behavioral;behavioral health;brief intervention;career;Caring;Certification;college;Communities;community advisory board;community collaboration;Community Health;Community Health Aides;Competence;Consultations;contextual factors;cost;Counseling;Country;demographics;design;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;digital solutions;Disabled Persons;Disparity;disparity reduction;Diverse Workforce;Dropout;Early Intervention;Educational Curriculum;empowerment;Enrollment;Ensure;Equity;ethnic diversity;ethnic minority population;Ethnic Population;Evaluation;evidence base;Evidence based intervention;experience;Faculty;Frequencies;Funding;Generations;Goals;Health;health disparity;health equity;Health Personnel;Health Services Accessibility;Health system;Healthcare Systems;higher education;implementation barriers;implementation framework;implementation science;Improve Access;indicated prevention;inequitable distribution;Infrastructure;innovation;insight;Institution;Intervention;intervention cost;intervention delivery;Measures;medical schools;medical specialties;Mental Depression;Mental Health;Mental Health Services;mental state;Mentorship;Methodology;Minority;Minority Groups;Minority-Serving Institution;Modeling;National Institute of Mental Health;Not Hispanic or Latino;Outcome;Patients;peer;people of color;Population;Population Group;Poverty;Preventive care;preventive intervention;Process;Production;programs;Provider;psychosocial;quality assurance;Quality of Care;Race;racial diversity;racial minority population;racial population;recruit;Reporting;Research;Resource-limited setting;Resources;response;retention rate;Risk;scaffold;scale up;Side;skill acquisition;skills;social determinants;Social Work;Specialist;Structure;Students;Supervision;Texas;Time;Training;Training Activity;undergraduate student;United States National Institutes of Health,Train and EMPOWER A Community Health workforce to achieve equity and reduce disparities in mental health (TEACH),19540,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-MOSS-T(54)R],NA,NA,2,646632,115294,761926,NA

This is especially important with regards to ICDs, permanent devices that require an invasive procedure for implant with intent to monitor and treat life-threatening arrhythmias. ICDs present a complicated balance of patient benefit (ie. treatment of dangerous heart rhythms), procedural risk, long-term maintenance and impact on psychological health (ie. PTSD, anxiety and depression from ICD shocks). Research shows providers overemphasize ICD benefits while patients overestimate benefit, poorly comprehend risks, psychological effects, and complications. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the current ICD decision-making process is heterogeneous and lacks sufficient Veteran perspective.

Older adults who experience EA are more likely to have depression, injury, additional hospitalizations, and early mortality. With the US population aging and >10 million US Veterans over age 60, addressing EA and its consequences is both a national and VA public health priority. Unfortunately, an estimated 95% of EA cases go undetected, limiting opportunities to intervene and improve health outcomes. Therefore, enhancing detection is the necessary first step to improving care for older adults experiencing EA. This project aims to improve EA detection in the VA, the country’s largest integrated healthcare system, by assessing how EA screening can be improved and by leveraging medical record data so healthcare teams can proactively identify older Veterans at high risk.

If axonal transport is a common mechanism of tau spread, it should leave behind a signature of tau accumulation and degeneration affecting the white matter networks that correspond to a patient’s primary cognitive symptoms.

This proposed project will implement and test a unique Virtual Reality Cognitive Training (VRCT) combined with concurrent cycling (Exergame) that seamlessly integrates specific cognitive tasks into a virtual environment and is synchronized with cycling to promote cognitive gains, in a home-based (asynchronous) telerehabilitation model in a 2:2 factorial design clinical trial in persons at risk for AD.",77842768 (contact);14144145,"OLOFINBOBA, OLU  (contact);SALISBURY, DERECK L","HETTINGER, JANE CECELIA",2023-09-30,2026-05-31,Address;Adherence;Aerobic;Aerobic Exercise;Affect;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Alzheimer&apos;s disease risk;American;arm;Attention;Behavior Therapy;Biological Markers;Blood;Businesses;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Design;Cognition;Cognitive;cognitive task;cognitive training;combat;Combined Modality Therapy;commercialization;Communities;community setting;cost;cost effective treatment;COVID-19 pandemic;Dementia;design;Disease;Dose;Double-Blind Method;efficacy evaluation;Environment;Epidemic;Exercise;exercise training;exergame;experience;flexibility;Habilitation;Home;Impaired cognition;improved;Individual;innovation;Intervention;intervention delivery;Laboratories;Liquid substance;Measures;Minnesota;Modeling;neuroprotection;Nonpharmacologic Therapy;novel;older adult;Outcome;Participant;Performance;Personal Satisfaction;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;pharmacologic;Phase;Populations at Risk;preference;preservation;prevent;Prevention strategy;Preventive Medicine;primary outcome;processing speed;programs;Psyche structure;Randomized;Rehabilitation therapy;Reporting;Research Project Grants;Risk;satisfaction;Science;secondary outcome;Small Business Innovation Research Grant;Technology;telerehabilitation;Testing;Therapeutic;therapy design;Time;Travel;Universities;Update;usability;user-friendly;virtual environment;virtual reality;Work,Concurrent Aerobic Exercise and Cognitive Training to Prevent Alzheimer's in at-risk Older Adults,82637,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-BP-C(10)B],NA,NA,2,539810,215924,808635,NA

Cognitive impairment is closely associated with synapse loss, which occurs significantly prior to neuronal loss, suggesting that synaptic dysfunction is the key treatment target and that ultimately synapse loss by multiple toxic oligomers must be stopped.

JOHN'S UNIVERSITY,NY,114399000,"The removal of a tumor is an important stage of treatment, as it allows the extraction of a large volume of tumor tissue, the reduction of intracranial pressure, the decrease of neurological deficit and the establishment of an exact tumor phenotype to solve the question of further treatment tactics. Modern research has shown that the size of tumor resection is reliably correlated with the life expectancy of patients. In the case of diffuse astrocytomas with a low degree of malignancy, total tumor removal is a key prognostic factor as it effectively reduces the risk of malignant tumor transformation. For adult patients with brainstem high-grade gliomas, one of the rarest and deadliest forms of brain cancer, surgically removing the entire tumor may add many months or potentially years of survival beyond that offered by radiation and chemotherapy. The main paradigm of brain tumor surgery is the maximal removal of the tumor with minimal risk of damage to functionally significant areas of the brain. However, the extraction of a tumor in the white light of a microscope can only achieve a maximum resection in 23–50% of cases. This contributes to maintaining a high interest in the development of intraoperative technologies that allow the differentiation of tumors from surrounding tissues. In this proposed study, we aspire to develop, characterize, and evaluate intranasally delivered tumor-targeting polymeric micelles carrying a self-quenched near-infrared (NIR) imaging agent on its potential in brain imaging and neurosurgical guidance during brain tumor surgery. This system is designed to switch “off” fluorescence signals until the micelles arrive at tumor tissues and begin to release an imaging agent as a monomeric form, resulting in strong fluorescence (“on”) signals on tumor tissues. We believe that the polymeric micelles proposed in this study will offer high sensitivity and specificity in imaging brain tumor for distinguishing tumor tissues from surrounding white matter and ultimately improve surgical outcomes and patient survival, potentially adding decades of quality life.",79062511 (contact),"CHO, HYUNAH  (contact)","RICHARDS, CRYSTAL LYNETTE",2024-07-15,2028-06-30,absorption;Accidents;Adhesives;Adult;Alginates;Area;Blood - brain barrier anatomy;Brain;Brain imaging;Brain Neoplasms;Brain Stem;brain tissue;brain tumor imaging;Bypass;cancer cell;Cancer Detection;cancer surgery;cancer therapy;Carbocyanines;Carbon;Cell membrane;Cells;Chemotherapy and/or radiation;Chitosan;Clinical;Contrast Media;cyanine dye;Defect;design;Development;Diffuse astrocytoma;Disease;Drops;Dyes;Endothelial Cells;ethylene glycol;Excision;Face;Fluorescence;fluorescence imaging;Formulation;Glioblastoma;Glioma;Goals;Growth;high resolution imaging;Homing;Hydroxypropylcellulose;Image;image guided;Image-Guided Surgery;imaging agent;improved;in vivo;in vivo optical imaging;Individual;Integrins;interest;Intracranial Pressure;Intranasal Administration;intraoperative optical imaging;Iodides;Lesion;Life Expectancy;Light;lipophilicity;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant neoplasm of brain;Malignant Neoplasms;Micelles;Microscope;minimal risk;Modernization;monomer;mouse model;Mus;nano;Near-infrared optical imaging;Neoplasm Metastasis;Neurologic;Neurologic Deficit;neurosurgery;Noise;Normal tissue morphology;Nose;Oncology;Operating Rooms;Operative Surgical Procedures;optical imaging;overexpression;Palpation;Patients;Phenotype;poly(lactic acid);Polymers;Potassium;preservation;Primary Brain Neoplasms;Prognostic Factor;Property;Quality of life;Reporting;Research;Resected;Residual Neoplasm;Risk Reduction;Route;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Transduction;Stains;Surgeon;surgery outcome;System;targeted delivery;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Time;Tissues;tumor;Tumor Tissue;Tumor Volume;Visual;Visualization;white matter;Work;xanthan gum;Xenograft procedure,Polymeric Micelles for Targeted Delivery of Contrast Agents Through the Nose-to-Brain Route in Image-Guided Brain Cancer Surgery,154661,ZGM1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZGM1 RCB-7 (SF)],NA,NA,1,125000,57500,182500,NA
