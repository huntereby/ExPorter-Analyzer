Comprehensive hearing health services are available within the VA to qualifying veterans. The delivery of optimal hearing healthcare mandates tailored treatments are offered based on degree of hearing loss and patient preferences. These options are defined in practice guidelines including the VA since 2004. Significance/Impact: Despite the prevalence of hearing loss among Veterans, there are few projects studying the management of those with severe hearing loss. Ensuring appropriate treatments for those most severely affected represents an important access to care issue with implications for patients’ communication, quality of life and overall health. This also facilitates patient communication in health care settings as being able to hear is a cornerstone of participation in shared-decision making. Innovation: The VA is the ideal setting to study management of severe hearing loss as this is a prevalent condition among veterans, interested patients are offered comprehensive treatments for hearing loss and longitudinal audiometric data are available to allow identification of factors associated with receipt of particular treatment strategies. Stakeholder engagement including interviews with affected Veterans and providers are incorporated in the study design. Specific Aims: 1. Define the prevalence, modes of treatment and time to treatment of Veterans with severe  hearing loss using the Audiometric Repository, a national database of audiograms and a  registry of assistive listening devices, hearing aids and cochlear implants within the VA,  between 2005-2017. 2. Identify which factors are associated with different treatment approaches for Veterans with  severe hearing loss using the Audiometric Repository linked to administrative data from the  electronic medical record during years 2005-2017. 3. Identify facilitators and barriers for distinct management of severe hearing loss among hearing  aid users (including referral for cochlear implants) through semi-structured interviews with  current VHA providers (audiologists, otolaryngologists and primary care providers) and  affected Veterans. Methodology: A mixed methods study using a sequential explanatory design will be employed. Data from the Audiometric Repository will be linked to administrative data from the electronic health record to understand management of Veterans with severe hearing loss. Interviews will be conducted with various stakeholders including Veterans and providers to identify barriers and facilitators to particular treatment modalities. Next Steps/Implementation: Results from this pilot will provide new information on barriers and facilitators of management of severe hearing loss. In addition to a planned manuscript describing our findings, we will develop educational materials for providers on CI indications and criteria for referral. We will also develop an educational brochure for Veterans and families to address potential attitudinal/knowledge barriers. These materials will form the basis for a Merit application to study trajectories of hearing loss and to develop and test an implementation approach to achieve best practices in the treatment of severe hearing loss.",15401585 (contact),"FRIEDMANN, DAVID R (contact)",NA,2020-08-01,2024-03-31,Acoustics;Address;Adherence;Affect;Age;age related;Age Years;American;Attitude;Audiology;Bilateral;Caring;Clinical Management;clinical practice;Cochlear implant procedure;Cochlear Implants;Communication;comorbidity;Computerized Medical Record;connected health;cooperative study;Counseling;Data;Databases;design;Diabetes Mellitus;disability;Disabling;Education;Educational Materials;Elderly;electronic data;electronic health data;Electronic Health Record;Eligibility Determination;Ensure;Evidence based intervention;Family;functional decline;Geographic Locations;Goals;Guidelines;Health;health care settings;health service use;Health Services;Health Services Accessibility;Healthcare;Hearing;Hearing Aids;hearing impairment;hearing loss treatment;Hearing Tests;Impaired cognition;Improve Access;improved;Individual;individualized medicine;inhibitor;innovation;interest;Intervention;Interview;Knowledge;Link;Literature;Manuscripts;Medical;Mental Depression;Methodology;Methods;military service;Modality;Neurocognitive Deficit;noise exposure;Otolaryngologist;Outcome;Outpatients;Pamphlets;Patient Preferences;patient subsets;Patients;Personal Satisfaction;Practice Guidelines;Prevalence;prevent;primary care provider;Procedures;Process;programs;prospective;Prosthesis;Provider;provider factors;Psyche structure;Qualifying;Quality of Care;Quality of life;Recommendation;Registries;Rehabilitation therapy;repository;Research Design;Research Methodology;research study;Risk;Schedule;Services;shared decision making;Social isolation;sociodemographic variables;sound;Specialist;Structure;System;systematic review;Testing;Time;Tinnitus;treatment strategy;United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality;Update;verbal;Veterans;Veterans Health Administration;Work,Resubmssion: Management of Severe Hearing Loss in the Veterans Health Administration,3141,HSR1,HSR-1 Health Care and Clinical Management[HSR1],NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA

PQ-induced neurodegeneration is tightly coupled to the activation of microglia and appears to require priming of the microglial response. However, the mechanistic pathways leading to this priming remain to be firmly established. Hv1 (HVCN1) is a voltage-gated proton channel highly expressed on microglia in the brain and in other immune cells in the body. This proton channel regulates the activity of NADPH oxidase and production of reactive oxygen species. This proposal seeks to test the hypothesis that Hv1 regulates priming of microglia following PQ exposure through the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.

We have also recently used contrastive learning to prospectively identify several new selective butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitors after scoring a library of 5 million molecules. In Phase II we will develop the MegaAChE software product for prediction of AChE inhibition to identify potential molecules that bind to AChE in order to predict pesticide and nerve agent poisoning across species and incorporate new validated models with a specific focus on developing novel AChE reactivators for treating pesticide and nerve agent exposure.

These oGPCRs represent fantastic opportunities to rebalance defective brain pathways. This Phase I SBIR proposal aims at demonstrating that our powerful DNA-encoded library (DEL) technology can be used very effectively to identify high-affinity drug- like molecules binding to one of those uncharacterized signaling receptors to modulate its activity.

AMPA receptors mediate the majority of fast excitatory neurotransmission. Permanent up-and down-regulation of their activity underlies learning and memory. However, over-activation of AMPA receptors can be damaging to the nervous system, producing seizures or neuronal death as induced by strokes. Proteins that regulate synaptic AMPA receptor targeting represent promising targets for drug developments. This potential remains largely unrealized despite a wealth of tantalizing preclinical data. We have identified a novel brain-specific postsynaptic membrane protein (SynDIG1) and a related protein (SynDIG4) that regulate synaptic AMPA receptor content and function. Defects in SynDIG1 and SynDIG4 might contribute to the etiology of certain brain diseases. Intriguingly, long-term potentiation, a cellular mechanism of learning and memory, is absent in acute hippocampal slices from mice with a targeted deletion of the SynDIG4 gene. Our work on the role of SynDIG4 in AMPA receptor function will provide insight into fundamental molecular mechanisms of synaptic transmission and into potential defects that underlie various brain diseases.",2097381 (contact);1958738,"DIAZ, ELVA D (contact);HELL, JOHANNES W","DRISCOLL, JAMIE",2019-09-24,2024-12-31,Acute;Address;Age;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;AMPA Receptors;Biological Assay;Brain;Brain Diseases;Cell surface;Cells;Chemicals;Cognitive;cognitive skill;Color;Complex;Data;Defect;density;Dissociation;DLG4 gene;domain mapping;Down-Regulation;drug development;Drug Targeting;Electrophysiology (science);Epilepsy;Etiology;Exhibits;Family;Genes;Glycine;Hippocampus;Image;in vivo;insight;Integral Membrane Protein;interdisciplinary approach;Investigation;knock-down;Knock-out;Knockout Mice;Knowledge;Label;Learning;Long-Term Depression;Long-Term Potentiation;Maintenance;Mediating;Membrane Proteins;Memory;Mental Depression;Mental disorders;Methods;Microscopy;Modeling;Molecular;morris water maze;Mus;mutant;N-Methylaspartate;Nervous System;Nervous System Disorder;neural network;neuromechanism;neuron loss;Neurons;neurotransmission;novel;object recognition;Permeability;PHluorin;postsynaptic;Postsynaptic Membrane;pre-clinical;Proline;Proteins;Proteomics;receptor;receptor function;recruit;Regulation;Role;Schizophrenia;Seizures;Site;Slice;Stimulus;Stroke;Surface;Synapses;synaptic depression;Synaptic plasticity;Synaptic Receptors;Synaptic Transmission;Testing;Tetanus;ultra high resolution;Up-Regulation;Variant;Viral;Visualization;Wild Type Mouse;Work,SynDIG1/Prrt1 regulation of extrasynaptic GluA1-containing AMPARs during plasticity,119347,SYN,"Synapses, Cytoskeleton and Trafficking Study Section[SYN]",NA,S1,5,49159,19899,69058,NA

No If  “no,” please explain.  o This study opened for patient enrollment in December of 2020 and accrual for the last three  years was significantly slower than the 10 patients per month which was expected. To  improve accrual the study team amended the trial in April 2023 and made the following changes:   The stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) plus hippocampal-avoidant whole brain  radiotherapy (HA-WBRT) arm was modified to be HA-WBRT alone. The NRG-BN009  team and the NRG Brain Tumor Committee leadership felt that modifying this arm will  remove insurance barriers and significantly increase physician and patient  enthusiasm for the study, and thereby accrual without changing the. fundamental  scientific question being addressed, which is the comparison of a focal irradiation  approach (Salvage SRS alone) versus a HA-WBRT approach (extensive field  irradiation). The primary hypothesis that the latter strategy will improve freedom from  neurologic death will not be affected by this amendment.   In addition, the protocol was revised to allow patients to have undergone multiple  SRS treatments to different brain metastases as long as prior brain metastasis  velocity (BMV) has been less than 4 brain metastases/year. This change was made  because presentation with high BMV, and not number of prior SRS treatments, is  central to the primary hypothesis being tested.   Lastly, the protocol eligibility was changed to permit enrollment of patients with prior  small cell cancer, as prior small cell cancer was included in the multiple series that  demonstrated the importance of BMV. • Do you anticipate a need to extend the study period? Yes If “yes,” please explain.  o This study was originally projected to complete accrual and testing during 2026. If the  amendment detailed above is successful in improving accrual an extension to the BIQSFP  will be required. If the accrual does not improve the trial will be closed without meeting its  required sample size. The decision regarding study closure will be made during grant  year 11. • Were there any unanticipated issues that negatively impacted conducting the BIQSFP-funded  assays/tests within projected turn-around time? No If “yes,” please explain. • Are there any other issues or concerns that should be brought to NCI’s attention?

Despite these successes, PD-(L)1 ICI therapy is plagued by several shortcomings: unpredictable patient response rates in many cancer types, extremely high total treatment cost ($150,000 per year) and serious adverse events which can often result in patient hospitalization and stoppage of treatment. In this project, Onc.AI aims to develop the first radiomic-based multi-modal Machine Learning solution to the problem of unpredictable response to PD-(L)1 ICI therapy to improve outcomes for patients and reduce the cost burden on healthcare systems and public/private payers. Achieving accurate prediction of PD-(L)1 ICI therapy response will enable a host of high-impact clinical applications such as -- identification of hyper-progressing patients (patients where tumor growth accelerates as a result of PD-(L)1 ICI); improved selection of patients (predicted non-responders) who would benefit from chemotherapy or additional immunotherapy added to a PD-(L)1 ICI backbone; appropriately de- escalating combination therapy to minimize toxicity for predicted responders (switching patient from PD-(L)1/chemo to PD-(L)1 monotherapy); and informing continuation of PD-(L)1 therapy at the 12 to 24 month mark based on radiomic signatures more advanced than tumor shrinkage.

Navigating fragmented systems of health care, long-term services and supports, and community or social supports to meet the diverse needs of PWMC is challenging. Currently, family, and unpaid caregivers provide the bulk of support PWMC receive to continue living in their homes. Caregiver burden, measured objectively (count of hours) or subjectively (caregiver’s perception of impact on themselves), is associated with poorer outcomes among people living with dementia. Given most PWMC live in their homes, people are concentrating on the home setting as an effective way to identify and address a broader set of unmet needs (e.g., social, and environmental determinants of health) and provide more comprehensive “family-centered” support. This approach aligns with value-based care principles and bridges the health care with community setting.",1974394 (contact),"HAVEY, GARY D (contact)","JOHN, DINESH",2019-08-01,2027-05-31,"Activities of Daily Living;Address;aging in place;American;Anxiety;Appointment;Behavioral;care burden;care coordination;care providers;care systems;Caregiver Burden;caregiver stress;Caregiver support;Caregivers;Caring;Cellular Phone;Chronic;Communities;community setting;Computer software;Coupled;Dementia;design;Development;Evaluation;Face;Family;Feedback;Friends;health determinants;Healthcare;Healthcare Systems;Home;Hour;improved;Individual;Informatics;Interview;Location;Managed Care;Measures;Medical;medical appointment;member;Memory;Modification;Monitor;Names;next generation;Notification;Nursing Homes;older adult;Outcome;Participant;Perception;Persons;Phase;phase 2 study;Play;premature;Randomized, Controlled Trials;Reminder Systems;remote monitoring;Reporting;Reservations;response;Risk;Running;Safety;Schedule;Security;Services;Small Business Innovation Research Grant;smartphone application;social;social engagement;social integration;Social Interaction;Social isolation;Social support;Stress;System;Tablet Computer;Tablets;Technology;Testing;Time;tool;Trust;United States;uptake;Visit;Work",A Mobile Informatics Solution to Assist Caregivers with Care Coordination and Social Engagement,63683,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1 SCIL-D (10)],NA,NA,4,601923,233569,861658,NA

Much of YBMSM's elevated risk is mediated through their sociosexual network, where higher rates of uncontrolled HIV and co-circulating sexually transmitted infections influence the risk of HIV acquisition, although the factors leading to acquisition and the factors indicating this risk are often not addressed in that context. In this project, we aim to address this issue by quantifying the additional risks of HIV for YBMSM as measured through the sociosexual network, developing a model that can be applied at the time of public health interview to predict HIV seroconversion within 3 years, and comparing methods to scale up to the underlying transmission network using the subset of relationships observed during public health interactions.",12663653 (contact),"PASQUALE, DANA KRISTINE (contact)","DEJLI, JAMAL",2024-06-01,2026-04-30,Accounting;Address;Affect;aged;AIDS prevention;antiretroviral therapy;Area;Attitude;barrier to care;Behavior;black men;black men who have sex with men;cisgender;Clinical;cohort;Communicable Diseases;Communities;Contact Tracing;Data;demographics;Diagnosis;Disparity;Economics;effective therapy;Epidemic;Failure;Future;Genes;Guidelines;high risk;high risk population;High Risk Woman;HIV;HIV anti-retroviral;HIV risk;HIV Seronegativity;HIV Seropositivity;improved;Incidence;Individual;Infection;infection risk;Intervention;Interview;Investigation;Joints;Lead;Learning;Link;Measures;Mediating;Medicaid;member;men;men of color;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;network models;Newly Diagnosed;North Carolina;Pathway Analysis;Pattern;Persons;Population;Populations at Risk;pre-exposure prophylaxis;Prevalence;prevent;Prevention;prevention service;Process;Prophylactic treatment;Public Health;Race;Recommendation;Recording of previous events;Regimen;Resources;Risk;Risk Factors;scale up;seroconversion;Services;Sexually Transmitted Diseases;simulation;social;sociodemographic group;Syphilis;Testing;Time;tool;transgender women;transmission process;United States;United States Public Health Service;Viral;Viral Load result;young man,Increasing the yield of HIV contact tracing for prevention using network models,181649,PPAH,Population and Public Health Approaches to HIV/AIDS Study Section[PPAH],NA,A1,1,125000,72233,197233,NA

This is despite the fact that 70% of the 46 million smokers in the United States express a desire to quit. The low success rate can be attributed to the complexity of smoking and vaping behaviors. Quitting involves not only ending nicotine use but also navigating social settings, managing isolation from social networks, and coping with sensory aspects related to oral sensations.

Natural hosts of SIVs (i.e., African green monkeys, AGMs) are ideal for dissecting the relative contribution of the different potential mechanisms resulting in mucosal dysfunction, because they maintain mucosal integrity throughout infection in spite of high levels of viral replication. We designed a set of interventions in the AGMs to induce dysbiosis, mucosal damage and/or impact liver clearance of the translocated microbes and thus dissect the mechanisms that may impact GI integrity and disease progression in HIV infection.

Organ preservation would address organ shortage by (a) enabling clinical immune tolerance induction, (b) greatly expanding options for donor-recipient matching and equitable allocation, (c) enhancing screening for transmissible diseases and malignancies, (d) decreasing costs and enabling flexible scheduling of surgeries, and (e) allowing for organ quality assessment and reconditioning. Infants and small children in need of a transplant have an especially hard time finding a suitable donor nearby and during the specific time period, resulting in a higher organ discard rate than adults. Serendipitously, the physics of heat transfer make it exponentially easier to cryopreserve smaller pediatric vs. larger adult organs. Our team have recently demonstrated the world’s first and only, successful, repeat transplants after ice-free cryogenic preservation of mammalian kidneys using the nanowarming technology. Building on the project’s Phase I feasibility success, in this Phase II project, we will apply our combined expertise in nanowarming, organ machine perfusion and organ transplant to young pediatric size kidneys in a juvenile pig model and human pediatric kidneys.",1900452;1929821;10504815;11211676 (contact),"BISCHOF, JOHN C;FINGER, ERIK BRIAN;TING, ALISON Y;WEEGMAN, BRADLEY P (contact)","MINNICOZZI, MICHAEL",2018-09-14,2027-06-30,3-Dimensional;Acceleration;Achievement;Address;Adolescent;Adult;authority;Autologous Transplantation;Award;biomaterial compatibility;Biomedical Research;Brain Death;Child;Childhood;Clinical;Clinical assessments;clinical practice;clinical translation;combinatorial;Complex;conditioning;Congresses;Convection;cost;cryogenics;Cryopreservation;Cryopreserved Tissue;Cryoprotective Agents;Data;Disease;End stage renal failure;Equity;European;experience;Family suidae;fertility preservation;Fingers;flexibility;Fracture;Glass;Goals;Graft Rejection;Graft Survival;Growth;Heating;high throughput screening;Human;Ice;Immune Tolerance;Immunosuppression;improved;Incidence;Inequity;Infant;Inferior;Injury;innovation;iron oxide nanoparticle;Kidney;kidney preservation;Kidney Transplantation;Lead;Letters;life span;Link;Living Donors;Logistics;Malignant Neoplasms;Marketing;Modeling;Modification;nanoparticle;nanowarming;natural hypothermia;Nature;Neonatal;neonate;new technology;novel strategies;older patient;Operative Surgical Procedures;Organ;organ allocation;Organ Donor;Organ Preservation;Organ Transplantation;Organ Viability;Oryctolagus cuniculus;Outcome;Patients;Performance;Perfusion;PF4 Gene;Phase;phase 1 study;Physics;Play;porcine model;preconditioning;preservation;prevent;prospective;Protocols documentation;Publishing;Quality-Adjusted Life Years;radio frequency;Randomized;Rattus;Recovery;Reperfusion Therapy;Rewarming;Role;scale up;Schedule;screening;Slice;success;Surgeon;Techniques;Technology;Time;Tissue Engineering;Tissues;Toxic effect;Transplantation;Transportation;United Network for Organ Sharing;United States National Institutes of Health;Waiting Lists;Woman,Neonatal and Young Pediatric Kidney Preservation through Nanowarming and Vitrification,186974,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1 KUDS-R (11)],NA,NA,2,674503,259801,999705,NA

To do this, we will apply a range of imaging and molecular profiling modalities, including in vivo MRI and ultrasound imaging, and ex vivo extracellular matrix proteomics, formal histopathologic evaluation, imaging mass cytometry, single-nucleus multiomics, spatial transcriptomics and deep morphologic and hyperplex spatial immunoprofiling. The resulting data will be analyzed and distributed to the broader research community in collaboration with the HuBMAP Integration, Visualization, and Engagement (HIVE) Collaboratory.

These could someday also be used as companion diagnostics for the drugs they help discover, to monitor the effectiveness of treatment, finding resistance earlier so patients can try alternatives that could improve their treatment outcomes.
