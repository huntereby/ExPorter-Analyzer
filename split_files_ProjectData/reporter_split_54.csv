HDAC- inhibitors may further succeed in producing robust auditory remediation on an individual-person basis, especially when sound exposure therapies alone fail to induce relief, as in cases of long-standing hearing problems, in the aged brain where cholinergic signaling is known to be disrupted, or in rehabilitation following extreme auditory disturbances including cochlear implants.",8842699 (contact),"BIESZCZAD, KASIA  (contact)","POREMBA, AMY",2020-09-15,2025-08-31,Acceleration;Acoustics;adenovirus mediated delivery;Adult;aging brain;Anesthesia procedures;Animals;Association Learning;Auditory;Auditory area;auditory discrimination;Auditory system;Behavior;Behavioral;Behavioral Assay;Behavioral Model;Brain;Candidate Disease Gene;Categories;cholinergic;Cholinergic Receptors;Chromatin;Chronic;Cochlear Implants;Communication;Complex;Coupled;Cues;Data;Deacetylase;designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs;Desire for food;Discrimination;Discrimination Learning;Electrophysiology (science);Ensure;Enzymes;Epigenetic Process;Event;experience;Family;Food;Future;gene discovery;Gene Expression;gene interaction;Gene Targeting;Genes;Genetic;genetic approach;Genetic Transcription;Genome;genome-wide;Genomics;Goals;Hearing;Hearing problem;Histone Acetylation;Histone Deacetylase;Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor;Hour;Human;Individual;inhibitor;learned behavior;Learning;Life;Link;Maintenance;Mediating;Medical;member;Memory;Molecular;Molecular Conformation;mutant;neural;neuromechanism;Neuronal Plasticity;Neurosciences;Outcome;Persons;pharmacologic;Physiological;Physiology;precision medicine;Process;Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR;Rattus;Recording of previous events;Regulation;Rehabilitation therapy;remediation;Research;response;Rewards;Rodent;Role;Sensory;sensory cortex;Signal Transduction;Site;Sleep;small molecule;sound;Specificity;stem;synergism;System;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;tool;Training;transcriptome sequencing;Transgenic Organisms;Viral,Molecular epigenetic mechanisms that transform the auditory system for learning and memory,18561,AUD,Auditory System Study Section[AUD],NA,NA,5,212500,119000,331500,NA

It consists of overlapping spindle midzone microtubules which are coated with electron dense material called the midbody matrix. Long conceptualized as a structural remnant subject to degradation following cytokinesis, emerging data suggest that midbody remnants (MBsomes) play instructive post-mitotic roles in establishing cell fate, proliferation state, tissue polarity, cilia formation, neuron function, and oncogenesis. However, very little is known about the functional significance of the electron dense material. My lab has uncovered a surprising novel function for this electron dense material in that it is a site of RNA storage and is a novel actively translating RNP granule with a uniquely complex life cycle comprised of both membrane-less and membrane-bound phases, that we are calling the MB-granule (for Midbody-granule).

We will investigate interactions between whole-genome sequence variations and COVID-19 on the risk of cognitive decline in 4,300 individuals recruited in Texas, New York, Washington State, Ibadan (Nigeria), and Jujuy (Argentina). Participant assessments will include neurological, cognitive, imaging and blood-based biomarker evaluations using harmonized protocols and at 3 time points. Three highly integrated Projects will be supported by 4 equally integrated Cores. All projects involve integrated multidisciplinary teams within a consortium of institutions in the US, Nigeria and Argentina. Resources and study expertise will be tightly coordinated across multiple sites and Cores, and integrated to the National Institute of Aging Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project and National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center which will help ensure optimal sharing of the acquire data.",6806465 (contact);77851965;8508348;1966963;8666855,"DE ERAUSQUIN, GABRIEL ALEJANDRO (contact);GONZALEZ ALEMAN, GABRIELA ;KATZ, MINDY ;PATTERSON, THOMAS F.;SESHADRI, SUDHA","MILLER, MARILYN",2023-08-15,2028-07-31,2019-nCoV;Acute;Address;Admixture;Adult;Affect;Africa;African;African American;African American population;age group;Age Years;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Alzheimer&apos;s disease related dementia;Alzheimer&apos;s disease risk;Amerindian;amnestic mild cognitive impairment;Anosmia;apolipoprotein E-4;Argentina;biomarker evaluation;blood-based biomarker;Brain;Central Nervous System;cerebrovascular;Cessation of life;Chronic;Clinical;Cognitive;cohort;college;Complex;coronavirus pandemic;COVID-19;COVID-19 associated anosmia;COVID-19 severity;COVID-19 susceptibility;Data;Data Analyses;Data Collection;data management;data quality;data sharing;Dementia;design;Diet;Disease;DNA;early onset;Emotional;Ensure;Epidemiology;Event;experience;experimental study;Exposure to;follow-up;Foundations;gene environment interaction;Genetic;genetic predictors;Genetic Variation;Genome;genome sequencing;genomic variation;Genotype;Guidelines;Health;Hispanic;Hispanic Americans;human old age (65+);Image;Impaired cognition;In Vitro;Individual;Induced pluripotent stem cell derived human neuron;Infection;Inflammation;Institution;International;Knowledge;Latino Population;Long COVID;Longitudinal cohort;longitudinal course;Lung;Mediating;medical schools;Medicine;Mexican Americans;Moods;multidisciplinary;National Institute on Aging;Native Americans;Nature;Nerve Degeneration;neural;Neurocognitive;neuroimaging;Neurologic;Neurologic Symptoms;neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19;neuropsychiatry;neurotoxicity;New York;Nigeria;Obesity;older adult;Olfactory Cortex;Participant;Performance;Persons;Phase;Population;post SARS-CoV-2 infection;Prevention strategy;programs;Protocols documentation;Province;Recovery;recruit;Research;Research Personnel;resilience;resilience factor;Resources;respiratory;Risk;Risk Factors;Risk Marker;risk prediction;Rural;Sampling;SARS-CoV-2 exposure;SARS-CoV-2 infection;Science;Secondary Prevention;Severities;Site;Smoking;South America;statistics;Symptoms;Testing;Texas;Time;Traditional Medicine;treatment strategy;Underrepresented Minority;Universities;Variant;variant of interest;Viral;Virus;Washington;whole genome,Interactions of SARS-CoV-2 infection and genetic variation on the risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease in Ancestral and Admixed Populations,76581,ZAG1,ZAG1-ZIJ-R(J4),NA,NA,2,7563907,1046915,8610822,NA

The highlights of our plans for this cooperative agreement are outlined here but described in detail in the Research Strategy. AFDO will conduct another series of state retail food safety interviews and will include specific questions about key criteria for risk-based inspections and how they have been implemented within each state. We will use the information gathered to develop some key measurements and comparability among the states. We will add data to the Data Analytics project including data from additional jurisdictions and years of data, completing further analysis. Focus will be on analysis of key areas related to foodborne illness risk factors and the frequency of “not observed” in these areas. Further, we anticipate comparing the inspection results with the frequency of foodborne illness risk factor violations and type of certified food protection manager training required by the state. The state surveys will also include questions about barriers to Food Code adoptions and what tools could be helpful for state programs to complete adoptions of more recent Food Codes including key provisions. We will create a webinar on completing regulatory adoptions, which was cited as one of the key barriers to Food Code adoption. We will also maintain the interactive maps developed during the initial cooperative agreement, including changes to contact information. AFDO will continue identify and to promote food borne illness outbreak investigation tools and best practices for posting on the Collaborative website. In the area of Active Managerial Control, AFDO will put on a series of train-the-trainer courses developed under the initial cooperative agreement for corporations, develop and disseminate guidance documents, infographics, and best practices through data from an industry survey, and create a training resource for smaller/regional food industry operators.

Persons of all ages with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) are at risk for opioid overdose, which can cause Opioid Induced Respiratory Depression (OIRD), leading to hypoxia and death. Most overdose deaths in the U.S. occur without anybody else present, preventing bystander administration of the lifesaving drug naloxone. Technology to detect OIRD and issue an emergency signal could help ensure responders arrive at the scene of an overdose to administer naloxone in a timely fashion. Currently, there are no FDA-approved products to detect opioid overdose or OIRD that are designed for continuous wear in a discreet location on the body. Resilient Lifescience’s goal is to develop a wearable medical device that can detect OIRD and issue an emergency alert, calling a friend, loved one, or emergency medical service to the scene. The central hypothesis to test in this proposed work is that a patch-based wearable medical device worn on the abdomen will be effective at detecting OIRD in patients and will be a well-accepted form factor for use by individuals with OUD. The overall objective of Phase I in this proposal is to determine technical feasibility of the project by showing that the device is effective at measuring oxygen saturation using reflective photoplethysmography (PPG) on the abdomen and to demonstrate commercial viability of the product by showing that individuals with OUD will adhere to use of the product. Resilient Lifescience will do this by 1) completing feasibility research to evaluate the device’s ability to measure oxygen saturation using reflective PPG on the abdomen, 2) executing user-centered industrial design, and 3) demonstrating that opioid users will adhere to use of the device during a two-week pilot study. The overall objective of Phase II in this project is to de-risk the commercialization of the device by demonstrating that the device is suitable for manufacture, passes required compliance testing, and is effective at detecting OIRD within patients receiving opioid analgesia in a hospital setting. The research team will accomplish this by 1) reaching design-freeze and soliciting quotes for small batch production of the device, 2) testing the ability of the device to detect OIRD in a hospital setting, and 3) completing required electromagnetic compatibility, biocompatibility, ingress protection, and human factors testing for the device.",79262832 (contact),"HOLDEN, BRADFORD A (contact)","SABIRZHANOV, BORIS YEVGENYEVICH",2024-09-15,2025-08-31,Abdomen;Accelerometer;Adherence;Adhesions;Adhesives;Affect;Age;Algorithms;American;Apnea;Area;biomaterial compatibility;Calendar;Carbon Dioxide;Cause of Death;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.);Cessation of life;Clinical;commercialization;design;Detection;Development;Device Designs;Devices;Diagnostic;effective therapy;Electromagnetics;Emergency medical service;Emergency Situation;Ensure;Environment;experience;feasibility research;Freezing;Friends;Future;Goals;Guidelines;Health;Home;Hospitals;Hour;Human;Hypoxia;illicit opioid;Individual;Industrialization;Life;Location;loved ones;manufacture;Measures;Mechanics;Medical Device;Methods;Monitor;Naloxone;National Institute of Drug Abuse;Opioid;Opioid Analgesics;opioid mortality;opioid overdose;opioid use;opioid use disorder;opioid user;Overdose;overdose death;overdose risk;Oxygen;Participant;Patients;performance tests;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Photoplethysmography;Pilot Projects;prevent;Production;prototype;Research;Research Design;resilience;respiratory;response;Risk;Sample Size;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Transduction;Small Business Innovation Research Grant;Specificity;stimulant use disorder;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;United States Food and Drug Administration;United States National Institutes of Health;user centered design;Validation;validation studies;Ventilatory Depression;wearable device;Work,Developing a wearable medical device to detect opioid overdose,60643,ZDA1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZDA1 SUY-S (J1)],NA,NA,1,266749,106699,399589,NA

Data from China, Europe and US indicate that underlying cardiovascular conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and coronary artery disease, lead to higher likelihood of getting COVID-19, more severe disease, and greater risk of death.

Of critical importance, there are few approved antibacterial drugs currently available to treat many Gram-negative bacterial infections and few new drugs in the pipeline. The most difficult to treat pathogens are the Gram-negative bacteria that are resistant to all antibiotics (so called “Superbugs” containing NDM and KPC enzymes). Most worrisome is their resistant to Imipenem, the “last line” agent that is used in the most serious cases. We have also found that some Superbugs are also resistant to the recently developed drugs just released (e.g., Avibactam). Even new drugs being developed are at risk. We are taking new approaches based on basic research to understand why resistance to Imipenem and Avibactam occurs in KPC and how resistance to cephalosporins can further emerge in NDMs. We have been extremely fortunate to have built a program that has been at the forefront of new drug resistance research in the VA for nearly 20 years.",1878119 (contact),"BONOMO, ROBERT A.

The findings from this study will demonstrate whether CPP-FC is effective in reducing behavior problems in young foster children and whether that contributes to reduced caregiver stress, increased caregiver confidence, and longer lengths of time that children remain with foster caregivers, avoiding unnecessary moves from one caregiver to another and improving child wellbeing.",11361613 (contact),"BEAL, SARAH  (contact)","ESPOSITO, LAYLA E",2022-09-01,2027-08-31,"Address;adverse outcome;African American;Age;Aggressive behavior;Behavior;Behavioral;burnout;care systems;caregiver education;caregiver stress;Caregivers;Caring;Chicago;Child;Child Abuse and Neglect;Child Behavior;Child Care;Child Rearing;Child Welfare;Clinic;Clinical Trials;Day Care;design;Development;Discipline;Effectiveness;Elements;Ensure;evidence base;Evidence based program;experience;Family;family support;foster care;foster child;Fostering;Future;Gender;Goals;health care delivery;Health Care Visit;high risk behavior;Home;Household;improved;Incentives;Individual;Informal Social Control;Institution;Intervention;Latinx;Left;Length;Licensing;Low income;maltreatment;Measures;Methods;Minority;minority children;Modeling;Modification;non-compliance;Nursery Schools;parenting intervention;Parents;Play;Policies;Population;pragmatic trial;Preparation;Preschool Child;prevent;Prevention;Problem behavior;programs;public health relevance;Race;Randomized;Randomized, Controlled Trials;real world application;Recording of previous events;Reporting;response;Risk Behaviors;Role;Schools;Self Efficacy;Services;social;Source;Stress;Structure;Suspensions;synchronous delivery;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Training;Transportation;Trauma;treatment as usual;Trust;United States;virtual platform;Youth",Prevention of behavior problems among preschool children in foster care through group-based foster caregiver training at the time of placement,105727,PDRP,"Psychosocial Development, Risk and Prevention Study Section[PDRP]",NA,NA,3,454215,237633,691848,NA
