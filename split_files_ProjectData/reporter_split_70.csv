Resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a rapidly developing approach for presurgical mapping of cortical brain function that does not require patient participation. It can complement task-based functional MRI in patients who have difficulties performing tasks and can efficiently map a large number of functional brain systems to guide surgery. It replaces traditional approaches of functional MRI that require patient participation in patients with functional impairment and holds considerable promise for intra-operative guidance of minimally invasive surgery. Here, we propose a fully automated, highly sensitive and cost-effective real-time resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging analysis software tool on a custom high-performance computer workstation for presurgical and intraoperative mapping of cortical brain function, building on TurboFIRE, a powerful real-time rtfMRI and sfMRI analysis software tool and the success of a prior Phase I STTR program. This approach meets urgent clinical needs and has high commercial potential for seamlessly integrating resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging into the clinical workflow of presurgical planning and intra-operative MRI.

The localized distribution of 2C-ARs in the limbic regions of the brain and their presynaptic function as autoreceptors and heteroreceptors, which regulate the levels of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin in the synapse, motivated us to develop more practical and useful F-18 PET radiotracers for 2C-ARs based on [11C]ORM13070 and to monitor the receptors in viable states to help set up the therapeutic strategy for 2C-ARs. This proposal will use a stepwise approach to synthesize seven 1,4- benzodioxane derivatives followed by receptor-binding assays for the in vitro screening, and the selected compounds will be prepared as F-18 radiotracers for preclinical PET imaging studies and autoradiography, which will be compared to immunohistochemistry work to validate the PET imaging data.",11429111 (contact),"KIL, KUN-EEK  (contact)","ROVESCALLI, ALESSANDRA C",2024-09-15,2026-06-30,Adrenergic Agents;Adrenergic Agonists;Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists;Adrenergic beta-Antagonists;Adrenergic Receptor;Affect;Affinity;aging population;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;antagonist;Anxiety Disorders;Area;Arrhythmia;Autoradiography;Autoreceptors;Behavior;Binding;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Monitoring;Blood Pressure;Brain;Brain Diseases;Brain region;Carbon;Cardiac;Cardiovascular Diseases;cardiovascular emergency;Cardiovascular system;Central Nervous System;Central Nervous System Diseases;Circulation;Clinical Trials;Cognition;Collaborations;commercialization;Computer Assisted;Consumption;Contrast Media;Corpus striatum structure;Dangerousness;Data;design;Development;Diagnosis;Digestion;Disease;Docking;Dopamine;Drug Industry;Drug Kinetics;Drug Targeting;Emotions;experience;Failure;Fluorine;Funding;Future;Goals;Heart failure;Hippocampus;Hyperactivity;Hypertension;imaging agent;Imaging Device;imaging study;Immunohistochemistry;improved;in vitro Assay;instrument;interest;Intervention;invention;Investigation;Judgment;Label;Lead;Legal patent;locus ceruleus structure;Marketing;Mediating;Medical;Medical Imaging;Memory;Mental Depression;middle age;Modeling;Molecular;molecular imaging;Monitor;nanomolar;neuron loss;Neurons;Neurotransmitters;noradrenaline transporter;noradrenergic;Norepinephrine;novel;Older Population;Panic Disorder;Parents;Pathologic;Patients;Penetration;Peripheral;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacologic Substance;Physiological;Piperazines;piperidine;Positron-Emission Tomography;pre-clinical;preclinical evaluation;preclinical imaging;Prefrontal Cortex;presynaptic;prevent;Property;Proteins;Radioactive;radioligand;radiotracer;receptor;receptor binding;Research;Respiration;Risk Reduction;screening;Selection Criteria;Serotonin;side effect;Specificity;Stimulant;Study models;Substance Use Disorder;success;Synapses;synaptic function;System;Therapeutic;Time;United States;Visualization;Work;X-Ray Computed Tomography;Yohimbine,"Development of 1,4-Benzodioxane Derivatives as F-18 PET Radiotracers for Alpha-2C Adrenergic Receptors and Their Preclinical Evaluations",83663,IPCA,Imaging Probes and Contrast Agents Study Section[IPCA],NA,A1,1,150000,83402,233402,NA

The IMPROVE expansion project teams will work with the IMPROVE COE Implementation Hub to disseminate any products generated, which will focus on recruitment, retention, and engagement of pregnant/postpartum women with OUD. Project 1: Personally-Tailored Opioid-overdose and Medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) Education (TOME) for pregnant and postpartum persons in MOUD: A pilot randomized trial (TOME trial) This study plans to evaluate the benefit of personally-tailored opioid overdose and medication for opioid use disorder education in pregnant and post-partum individuals receiving medication for opioid use disorder. Approximately 120 PP will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to TOME or control balancing on site. TOME participants will receive a 15-minute intervention in which a trained research staff member reviews personal feedback reports with the recipient to provide information on the items missed on the opioid overdose (OOD) and MOUD knowledge assessment. Control participants will receive SAMHSA handouts about OOD and MOUD. Project 2: Successful Recruitment and Retention in a Randomized Controlled Trial of Pregnant People with Opioid Use Disorder (SUCCESS STUDY) This study plans to identify currents strategies, facilitators and challenges in recruitment and retention among sites in the MOMs trial. This project will conduct surveys, focus groups and interviews with research staff and individuals currently enrolled in the study. This project will develop a manual with recommendations for strategies and approach for trials to recruit and retain PP with OUD in RCTs. Project 3: Promoting Research with Mothers receiving OUD Treatment; a focus on Equity (PRoMOTE) This study plans to understand patient and provider perspectives and key facilitators and barriers to treatment engagement for women in color and living in rural areas. The study will invite patients and providers to participate in surveys and focus interviews; the patient interviews will be completed by mothers in recovery (trained and mentored on interviewing skills) who have expertise in interviewing women of color and women living in rural areas with SUD. The studies will seek to understand the needs of pregnant women who use opioids (including fentanyl) from diverse communities that include communities with differing laws regarding reproductive health. The data will assist in future outreach and engagement in MOUD. Project 4: Improved Messaging Strategies for MOUD for Underserved Populations of Pregnant and Postpartum Individuals with OUD. This project plans to develop innovative and meaningful education/messaging strategies regarding (1) addiction disease & NOWS, (2) the role of medications in the management of OUD and overdose prevention, (3) stigma and health system mistrust, and (4) PP persons rights to treatment.

The contribution of conver- gence with behavioral development (i.e., approach growth corresponding with shifts towards relative left frontal activation) will be considered, along with infant emerging regulation and maternal sensitivity as moderators22,23. While the parent study provides a comprehensive examination of risk for anxiety and related internalizing symptoms, it does not address disruptive/externalizing outcomes. Yet factors considered as antecedents of anxiety symptoms are also relevant to the development of disruptive symptoms, and it may be that a trajectory of neurophysiological changes protective with respect to anxiety/internalizing symptoms accentuates external- izing symptoms, possibly depending on the inputs from regulatory capacity and caregiving. The proposed pro- ject provides an opportunity to leverage extensive infancy neurophysiological and behavioral assessments conducted in the context of the parent investigation to answer critical research questions concerning disruptive behavior problems, significantly extending the impact of obtained results. It is hypothesized that the pattern of reciprocal brain activity effects wherein dominant left frontal acti- vation (associated with approach/reward orientation) will translate into greater risk for disruptive symptoms. Specifically, we anticipate that (1) dominance of left hemisphere change effects on right activation growth across infancy will confer risk; (2) this risk will be accentuated by slower advances in child regulatory capacity and attenuated by higher maternal sensitivity across infancy. We plan to test these primary hypotheses and attain the objective of this application by pursuing two specific aims:  Aim 1. Modeling frontal EEG changes as predictors as of emerging disruptive symptoms/disorders. Bimonthly assessments of infant EEG, temperament and maternal sensitivity from 6 to 18 months will be con- sidered in predicting previously omitted disruptive symptoms and disorders (e.g., Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder). Assessments begin at 2 months of age measuring covariates: infant birth/medical (e.g., gestational age/weight, APGAR score), family demographic factors, and maternal depres- sion/anxiety. Infant EEG asymmetry markers (i.e., frontal alpha power values), temperament, and maternal sensitivity are evaluated bimonthly starting at 6 months. Laboratory observations provide measures of maternal sensitivity with parent-report used to assess infant temperament, specifically regulatory capacity. Mothers with infants (n=300) recruited at three sites: Pullman, WA, Blacksburg, VA, and Jupiter, FL in the context of the par- ent R01 funded investigation will be asked to contribute data to the proposed study. Specifically, all 300 care- givers will participate in clinical interviews, this time to ascertain severity of externalizing/disruptive problems, also providing responses to related questionnaires. Children will be followed, conducting semi-structured clini- cal interviews with mothers addressing disruptive starting at 24 months. It is hypothesized that greater base- line left frontal activation and stronger left frontal EEG effects across infancy (i.e., left hemisphere dy- namic effects driving change in right activation) would contribute to more severe/frequent disruptive behaviors and increased risk for symptoms/disorders8,24.  Aim 2. Moderation by temperament and caregiving: Child regulatory capacity and maternal sensitivity. We will determine moderating effects of child regulatory capacity and maternal sensitivity on links between EEG markers and disruptive symptoms/disorders. Sensitive caregiving is examined in the parent project and the proposed study provides an opportunity to discover if protective mechanisms are similar for externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Child self-regulation was not considered as a moderator in the parent investiga- tion, yet has been widely demonstrated as protective25,26 and will be examined herein with respect to disruptive problems. Latent changes in child EEG – dominant left hemisphere effects on right frontal activation are expected to confer risk with respect to disruptive behaviors, accentuated by slower advances in atten- tion-based regulation from 6 to 18 months and attenuated by higher levels of maternal sensitivity. Be- cause maternal sensitivity is assessed every two months, we will be able to identify specific develop- mental periods associated with reliable protective effects. This dynamic approach pioneered in the parent study will now be aimed at elucidating risk vs. protection with respect to early disruptive problems and is ex- pected to transform etiology-oriented research in developmental psychopathology. This study will clarify the role of changes in neurophysiology in the emergence of disruptive symptoms8,27, informing preventative efforts by providing potential therapeutic targets. The proposed study will provide currently lacking information related to accentuated risk for disruptive symptoms/disorders as a function of infant neurophysiology and tempera- ment, which can be applied in screening efforts, with malleable periods identified. Importantly, this study prom- ises to specify periods wherein maternal sensitivity can be modified to provide increased protection with re- spect to disruptive behaviors26,28. Identifying these markers is expected to translate into low-cost preventive approaches, in lieu of more intensive services later in childhood29.",1963580;1911349 (contact);3065993,"BELL, MARTHA ANN ;GARTSTEIN, MARIA A.

It is very important to identify which patients are at risk for CRE and to identify the best treatment for CRE. We propose to develop and test a tool that predicts whether a person carries CRE, and to identify the best treatment options for CRE infections. We will use large databases to find patients at risk for CRE and patient who have CRE infections.

Ca2+ in turn is a potent regulator of neuronal excitability and gene expression. During our work on the role of b amyloid peptide 1-42 (Ab) on LTD via regulation of Cav1.2 by the beta 2 adrenergic receptor we realized that in adult mice standard LTD can only be induced during the active circadian phase of mice and requires the regulation of Cav1.2 by the b2 AR by its natural ligand, norepinephrine (NE), which mediates wakefulness. For the Supplement we propose to test whether LTD in adult mice has a circadian rhythm that is driven by the established increase NE during active (night) phase and acts via b2 AR – Cav1.2 signaling.
