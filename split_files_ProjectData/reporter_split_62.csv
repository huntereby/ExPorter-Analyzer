While animal models have demonstrated the contributions of neuroinflammation to the pathology of glaucoma, important differences exist between animal models and human patients, including low conservation of RGCs as well as numerous functional differences in glia. Thus, to better recapitulate interactions between RGCs and glia in glaucoma, the current application leverages human pluripotent stem cell-derived retinal ganglion cells, astrocytes, and microglia in a robust and reproducible in vitro microfluidic platform that recreates the spatial interactions of glia upon human RGC axons relevant to the neuroinflammatory phenotypes observed in glaucoma.",9297551 (contact),"MEYER, JASON STEPHEN (contact)","SONG, HONGMAN",2021-09-01,2026-08-31,Address;Adopted;Affect;Animal Model;Astrocytes;Axon;Axonal Transport;Blindness;Brain;Cell Compartmentation;Cell Differentiation process;Cell model;cell type;Cells;Central Nervous System;Coculture Techniques;Dendrites;Development;Disease;Disease Progression;Ensure;Eye;Gene Expression Profile;Genetic Transcription;Glaucoma;Health;Human;human model;human pluripotent stem cell;In Vitro;in vitro Model;Injury;Label;Length;Microfluidics;Microglia;Modeling;Morphology;Mutation;Nature;Nerve Degeneration;Neurodegenerative Disorders;neurodegenerative phenotype;Neuroglia;neuroinflammation;neuron development;Neurons;neurotoxic;neurotoxicity;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;Optic Disk;Optic Nerve;patch clamp;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Patients;Phenotype;Play;real-time images;Reproducibility;Retina;retinal axon;retinal ganglion cell degeneration;Retinal Ganglion Cells;retinal neuron;Role;Signal Pathway;Site;stem cell model;Study models;success;System;Testing;Thalamic structure;transcriptome sequencing;transmission process;visual information,Establishing a human cellular model of retinal ganglion cell compartmentalization in neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation,33022,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-ETTN-P(81)S],NA,NA,4,252739,147852,400591,NA

Because transcription factors regulate the genes that control cell behaviors, our goal is to ensure that the effects of transcription factor deletion on the cells are accurately and consistently quantified so that this information can ultimately be used by the biomedical community to improve healthcare. Thus, we propose to establish a MorPhiC Data Analysis and Validation Center to 1) computationally analyze the quality of multiple types of genomic data collected from these cells and 2) determine whether these data can be used to accurately identify the network of genes regulated by a specific transcription factor.",8956575 (contact),"WHITE, BRIAN S (contact)","PILLAI, AJAY",2023-09-11,2028-07-31,Address;Affect;Alleles;ATAC-seq;Auxins;Biological;Biological Assay;biological heterogeneity;Biological Models;Biomedical Research;Catalogs;cell behavior;Cell model;cell type;Cells;Characteristics;ChIP-seq;Chromatin;Collaborations;Collecting Cell;Communities;Computing Methodologies;CRISPR/Cas technology;crowdsourcing;Data;Data Analyses;data mining;Databases;differential expression;diverse data;Drops;dynamic system;Ensure;Epigenetic Process;experimental study;Gene Expression Regulation;gene function;gene network;gene regulatory network;Gene Targeting;Genes;Genetic Transcription;genomic data;Genomic medicine;genomic variation;Goals;Healthcare;heterogenous data;Human;Human Genome;improved;in silico;Individual;knock-down;knockout gene;Knockout Mice;Knowledge;Messenger RNA;Methods;Molecular;molecular phenotype;Molecular Profiling;Molecular Target;multimodal data;multiple omics;National Human Genome Research Institute;Noise;novel;novel strategies;Outcome;Participant;Penetrance;Performance;Phase;Phenotype;phenotypic data;Positioning Attribute;power analysis;Production;programs;Proteins;Protocols documentation;Publishing;Recommendation;Regulation;Regulon;Reporter;Role;single cell sequencing;single-cell RNA sequencing;Source;success;System;The Jackson Laboratory;Time;tissue/cell culture;Tissues;tool;transcription factor;Transcriptional Regulation;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomics;Validation;Vision;Work;XCL1 gene,Multi-omic phenotyping of human transcriptional regulators,13175,ZHG1,ZHG1-HGR-M(M3)1,NA,NA,2,322338,231052,553390,NA

Research on frontline treatments for CDNP (enhanced glycemic control, exercise, pharmacological agents), shows inconsistent outcomes and dissatisfaction among Veterans. Veterans and clinicians have shown significant interest in cannabis derivatives (THC, CBD) for neuropathic pain control, but there are no well-controlled trials guiding expectations for benefit and adverse outcomes associated with cannabis for CDNP. Because Veterans are likely to present with pain and pain-related polymorbidity significant differing from that of civilians, a well-structured clinical trial of cannabinoids for Veterans with CDNP is vital.

Understanding the basic principles of how mTORC1 inhibition supports AMPK’s ability to reprogram metabolism and restore energy homeostasis provides conceptual advances for understanding these key mediators of cellular metabolism and offers mechanistic insight into how dysregulation of these pathways can lead to metabolic dysfunction and disease to allow us to identify new therapeutic strategies for treatment of metabolically-linked human disease.",10997719 (contact),"VAN NOSTRAND, JEANINE L (contact)","MASKERI, BAISHALI",2022-09-16,2027-07-31,5&apos;-AMP-activated protein kinase;Alanine;Autophagocytosis;Biochemical;cell growth;cell growth regulation;Cell Physiology;Cells;Complex;Diabetes Mellitus;Disease;energy balance;Energy consumption;Environment;experimental study;Failure;FRAP1 gene;functional genomics;Gene Expression;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Growth;Health;Homeostasis;Human;human disease;innovation;insight;Knowledge;Laboratories;Link;Lipids;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediator;Metabolic;Metabolic Control;Metabolic Diseases;Metabolic dysfunction;Metabolic Pathway;Metabolism;Molecular;mouse model;Mus;Mutant Strains Mice;Mutation;Nervous System Disorder;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;Nutrient;Pathway interactions;Phosphorylation;Phosphorylation Site;Phosphotransferases;Play;Process;programs;Protein Synthesis Inhibition;Regulation;Research;Role;Serine;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Stress;Tissues;treatment strategy;Work,The functional role of mTORC1 regulation by AMPK in cellular metabolic reprogramming,146762,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-CB-M(55)R],NA,NA,3,250000,150000,400000,NA

Currently, VT is treated with Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs), expensive devices that halt VT by delivering shocks to the patient.

A recent first in human clinical trial showed that the Durablate can eliminate or substantially reduce the number of shocks that refractory patients are receiving from their ICDs.

Add scale to the study of genetic variants related to CKD, more particularly by having power to identify  rare variants associated with this condition which has not been addressed by prior studies. By conducting  gene-burden analysis in a diverse sample comprising 850,000 participants with whole-genome or whole-  exome sequencing information, we will improve our ability to identify people carrying increased genetic  risk related to CKD, opening opportunities for primary and secondary prevention. 2. This will be the largest study addressing the penetrance of CKD-related variants in an unbiased way.  Absolute and unbiased association estimates between CKD-related variants and CKD and other renal  phenotypes will be computed and stratified by age, sex, and comorbidities. These findings will be useful  the interpretation of genetic variants in scenarios where the clinical trait is absent or just partially present.  In conjunction with the finding of rare variants, the results of this proposal are expected to support  investigations in translational research, more specifically in terms of mechanisms of disease,  development of biomarkers, and identification of possible targets for intervention and new therapies. 3.

Recently, about 1.5 million adults in the US said that their tinnitus was a “big or very big problem.” Veterans report higher rates of tinnitus than the public, so we expect there to be proportionately more Veterans bothered by their tinnitus. There are no practical ways to measure tinnitus because we cannot pinpoint its location, making it hard to treat. We think that when tinnitus becomes difficult to ignore, people must work harder to listen. We also think that when tinnitus makes people feel depressed or anxious, their bodies respond negatively to certain sounds and pictures.

The performance of the VAD pump is in part dependent on the physical and functional aspects of the pump itself, but equally important is the moment to moment interaction between the pump and the patient’s native cardiovascular system, and while current generation pumps have internal monitors of pump performance, their capabilities are rudimentary and typically require advanced cardiovascular diagnostics (transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography) for correlation with patient signs and symptomatology.

Veterans with PTSD engage in low levels of physical activity and spend much of their time in sedentary activities, adding to their risk of physical disability.

Skeletal muscle function and health are severely reduced after SCI and this is associated with negative health factors such as insulin resistance, inflammation and obesity. Protecting mitochondrial health after paralysis may be a way to preserve muscle health after SCI. There are no FDA-approved treatments to preserve mitochondrial health.

Many of these stroke survivors are living with walking disabilities. Gait problems result in inability to function independently, high risk of falls and poor quality of life. Unfortunately, current gait rehabilitation treatments are limited and many stroke survivors do not achieve full recovery. Therefore, it is critical to develop new approaches to enhance gait rehabilitation methods. We propose to evaluate a brain stimulation treatment called transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) that can be added to physical therapy. tDCS has been applied for arm rehabilitation after stroke with positive results, but gait-related investigations are lacking. We will test whether simultaneous tDCS and gait training produces greater improvement in walking abilities than gait training alone. Adjunct tDCS therapy may improve outcomes, and reduce cost of both rehabilitation and post-stroke care. !",9473960 (contact),"PUNDIK, SVETLANA  (contact)",NA,2018-10-01,2024-09-30,"Activities of Daily Living;Address;Admission activity;Affect;American;Anodes;Area;arm;Bilateral;Brain;Brain Stem;Caregivers;Caring;Chronic;chronic stroke;Clinical;clinically significant;Cohort Studies;Communities;Corticospinal Tracts;cost;Cross-Over Studies;Data;density;Dependence;design;Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging;disability;Distal;effectiveness study;Electrodes;Enrollment;Equilibrium;Exhibits;fall risk;falls;follow-up;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Future;Gait;gait rehabilitation;Gait speed;high risk;Impairment;improved;improved outcome;Individual;insight;Intervention;Intervention Studies;Investigation;Ipsilateral;kinematics;Lesion;Limb structure;Lower Extremity;Measures;meter;Methods;military veteran;Minor;Modeling;Motor;Motor Cortex;Motor Evoked Potentials;motor impairment;motor learning;Motor output;motor recovery;Movement;multidisciplinary;neurological rehabilitation;Neuronal Plasticity;neurophysiology;noninvasive brain stimulation;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutic intervention;Outcome Measure;Paresis;Pathway interactions;patient population;Performance;Peripheral;Personal Satisfaction;Physical therapy;Pilot Projects;post stroke;Predictive Factor;primary outcome;Protocols documentation;Quality of life;Randomized;randomized, controlled study;Randomized, Controlled Trials;Reaction;Recovery;recruit;Recurrence;Rehabilitation Outcome;Rehabilitation therapy;Research Design;Residual state;response;Rest;Safety;secondary outcome;Sensory;spatiotemporal;Stroke;stroke rehabilitation;stroke survivor;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;tool;Training;transcranial direct current stimulation;treadmill;Upper Extremity;virtual reality environment;Walking",Transcranial Direct Current stimulation for post-stroke gait rehab,2620,RRD1,Brain Health and Injury[RRD1],NA,NA,6,NA,NA,NA,NA

My long-term goal is to understand gene regulation from genetic variations to phenotypic variations, which will eventually pave the road for the discovery of drug targets and early intervention strategy for the different complex diseases.",12559010 (contact),"LIU, YAPING  (contact)","YEH, ALVIN TIEN-WEI",2022-08-01,2027-07-31,3-Dimensional;Academic Training;Address;Aliquot;Binding;Biological Assay;cell type;Cells;Complex;Computing Methodologies;Cultured Cells;design;Development;Disease;DNA Methylation;Drug Targeting;Early Intervention;Epigenetic Process;epigenomics;experimental study;Gene Activation;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Regulation;gene repression;Genetic;genetic variant;Genetic Variation;Genome;Genomics;Goals;histone modification;individual variation;infancy;Intervention;Knowledge;Maps;Measurement;Measures;method development;Modification;multidisciplinary;multiple omics;Pathologic;Phenotype;predictive modeling;Protocols documentation;Public Health;Role;Sampling;single cell sequencing;single-cell RNA sequencing;Techniques;Technology;Tissues;transcription factor;transcriptomics;Variant,Method Development for Single-Cell Multi-omics,147283,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-GGG-S(55)],NA,NA,4,250000,150000,400000,NA

Distraction osteogenesis (DO) is a widely recognized treatment modality for craniofacial abnormalities that harnesses the body’s natural ability to regenerate bone in order to correct skeletal deficiencies and defects. While surgeons have shown the utility of DO for restoring functional discrepancies in patients born with craniofacial differences, the technique has not been widely adopted due to numerous limitations of current DO systems stemming from their semi- buried design and burdensome reliance on caregivers to follow precise treatment protocols.

Pritelivir is a promising α-helicase inhibitor that has proved superior to existing therapies in Phase 2 clinical testing, but whose clinical development as a systemic therapy has been slowed due to observed unexplained systemic toxicity in primates. Local therapy is therefore of special interest. Using our proprietary Versa technology platform, we have developed an intravaginal ring (IVR) formulation of pritelivir.

The findings from this research may lead to a better understanding of the events that lead to accurate embryo development and how genetic and epigenetic alterations can disrupt them, resulting in birth defects.

Increasingly large and complicated data sets are being collected, but the tools for analyzing and modeling the data are not yet available. More researchers trained in computational neuroscience are desperately needed. This project supports interdisciplinary graduate training programs in computational neuroscience (TPCN) at both Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt), and a summer school in computational neuroscience for undergraduates, which are available to students coming from colleges and universities throughout the United States. Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) is a world leader and innovator in quantitative fields such as machine learning, computer science, and artificial intelligence, and recently, neuroscience has emerged as a field for strategic growth at the university. The University of Pittsburgh is renowned for the strength of its clinical and biomedical research programs. The TPCN is set within a highly collegial, cross-disciplinary environment of our Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which is operated jointly by CMU and Pitt. The CNBC was established in 1994 to foster interdisciplinary research on the neural mechanisms of brain function, and now comprises 162 faculty having appointments in 32 departments. Goals: The goals of the TPCN are to: 1) Support computational training of PhD students across the neurosciences, 2) Broaden accessibility for students historically underrepresented in STEM by augmenting an existing MS-to-PhD training program that prepares them for advanced graduate training in computational neuroscience, 3) Expand computational training of undergraduate students through a formal academic minor in computational neuroscience, 4) Support an undergraduate summer program that combines a two-week “boot-camp” overview of computational neuroscience with an 8-week research experience, 5) Create online materials that not only serve our own students but are publicly available on the web, and 6) Enhance our recruitment through relationships we have developed with minority-serving institutions.",10003131 (contact);10909949,"CHASE, STEVEN M (contact);TORRES-OVIEDO, GELSY","MOLLICK, JESSICA ANN",2023-09-15,2028-06-30,academic minor;Appointment;Artificial Intelligence;Biomedical Research;Brain;Brain Diseases;Clinical Research;Cognition;college;computational neuroscience;computer science;data modeling;Data Set;Doctor of Philosophy;doctoral student;Environment;experience;Faculty;Fostering;Goals;Growth;Interdisciplinary Study;Internet;Machine Learning;Minority-Serving Institution;neural;neuromechanism;Neurosciences;programs;recruit;Research;Research Personnel;Schools;Students;summer program;tool;Training;Training Programs;undergraduate student;United States;Universities,Interdisciplinary Training in Computational Neuroscience,60340,ZDA1,ZDA1-SRC(99),NA,NA,2,309717,19433,329150,NA

Severe RIL has been linked to poor cancer treatment outcomes, presumably due to the reduced tumor surveillance by the immune system, thereby increasing disease recurrence and distant metastasis after RT. We propose approaches to identify clinical and dosimetric factors that predict the risk and severity of RIL and understand the impact of RIL on the immune diversity and profile as it affects clinical outcomes; to develop models that can accurately predict the risk of RIL individualized to a patient’s baseline clinical factors; and to use such models in the optimization of radiation dose distributions to mitigate RIL and its impact on outcomes.",10298380 (contact),"LIN, STEVEN HSESHENG (contact)",NA,2021-09-21,2026-08-31,Adaptive Immune System;Affect;Biological Factors;Cancer Patient;cancer therapy;cancer type;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;Cells;Characteristics;Clinical;clinical practice;clinical prognostic;clinical translation;clinically relevant;clinically significant;Computer Simulation;Cytometry;cytotoxic;cytotoxicity;Data;Databases;Development;Disease;Disease Outcome;Distant Metastasis;DNA Damage;Dose;evidence base;experimental study;Fractionation;functional status;Future;Goals;Heterogeneity;high risk;Immune;Immune system;Immunity;Immunologic Surveillance;immunological diversity;immunological status;Immunosuppression;Immunotherapy;improved;improved outcome;Incidence;individual patient;Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy;Ionizing radiation;Link;Location;Lymphocyte;Lymphocyte Count;Lymphocyte Depletion;Lymphocyte Subset;Lymphopenia;Machine Learning;Malignant neoplasm of brain;Malignant neoplasm of esophagus;Malignant neoplasm of liver;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Mediating;Mediator;Modality;Modeling;optimal treatments;Outcome;Patient risk;patient subsets;Patients;Pattern;personalized approach;personalized care;personalized predictions;personalized strategies;Phenotype;Photons;population based;Pre-Clinical Model;Predictive Factor;predictive modeling;Predisposition;preservation;Process;Prognostic Factor;prospective;proton therapy;Protons;Radiation;Radiation Dose Unit;radiation mitigation;radiation risk;Radiation therapy;Radiation Tolerance;Radiation-Induced Cancer;Recurrent disease;Regimen;Research;Risk;risk mitigation;risk prediction;risk prediction model;Roentgen Rays;Role;Selection for Treatments;Severities;side effect;Site;Solid Neoplasm;Structure;T cell clonality;T-cell diversity;T-Cell Receptor;T-Lymphocyte;Techniques;Testing;therapy outcome;Time;treatment optimization;Treatment outcome;treatment planning;tumor;Tumor Immunity;Tumor Volume;Vaccination;Work,"Project 2: Radiation-Induced Lymphopenia: Understanding, Predictive Modeling and Developing Photon and Proton-Based Mitigation Strategies.",261669,ZCA1,ZCA1-RPRB-L,5927,NA,4,501879,28572,NA,530451

The current and newer therapies are fairly effective at decreasing the morbidity of RA but still have unintended consequences. One commonality of all of the disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) therapies is that they are immunosuppressive in a variety of ways. Analysis of response to the new recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) in RA patients proposed in this study has direct clinical relevance and translational potential. It may influence the choices of therapies to be utilized as there are many options for treating RA. It could provide data that supports a clinical trial using drug windowing where the immunemodulatory drug is withheld transiently after vaccination to improve the response.

Finally, understanding how to expand acceptance of extended-release and sublingual buprenorphine in jails, has far-reaching implications for expanding treatment access in this population.",15282641;8544735 (contact),"BLUE, THOMAS ;GORDON, MICHAEL SCOTT (contact)","MULFORD, CARRIE FRIED",2023-09-30,2028-06-30,"Accidents;Administrator;Adoption;Adult;Adverse event;Award;Back;Buprenorphine;buprenorphine treatment;care coordination;Cessation of life;Cities;Clinical Trials;Communities;community reentry;comparative effectiveness trial;compare effectiveness;Conduct Clinical Trials;Continuity of Patient Care;cost;Cost Analysis;cost effectiveness;County;Crime;Day Care;design;dosage;Dose;Dropout;Drug usage;Effectiveness;effectiveness evaluation;Ensure;Event;experience;Formulation;Funding;Health Services Accessibility;Health system;Healthcare;HIV risk;illicit opioid;Imprisonment;Individual;Injectable;Injections;innovation;Intake;Intervention;Jail;Longterm Follow-up;Medical;medication compliance;medication for opioid use disorder;Mental Health;metropolitan;Needles;open label;Opioid;Opioid agonist;opioid use;Overdose;overdose death;overdose risk;Patient Preferences;Patient Self-Report;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;physical conditioning;Policy Maker;Population;preference;Pregnant Women;primary outcome;Prisons;Procedures;Public Health;Quality of life;Randomized;Randomized, Controlled Trials;rearrest;Regulation;reincarceration;Relapse;Research;Research Design;Research Personnel;Risk;Risk Behaviors;risk minimization;Safety;secondary outcome;sexual risk behavior;Site;Subcutaneous Injections;Suboxone;substance use;Surveys;System;Time;timeline;Toxicology;Urine;Visit",A comparative effectiveness trial of sublingual versus extended-release buprenorphine with individuals leaving a carceral setting,58674,IPTA,Interventions to Prevent and Treat Addictions Study Section[IPTA],NA,NA,2,854592,231451,1086043,NA
