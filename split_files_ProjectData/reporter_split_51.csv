We hypothesize that: (i) the stress of pregnancy augments pre-existing metabolic and inflammatory derangements in certain women, making them more susceptible to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; (ii) in this setting, affected women are prone to developing coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), a previously unrecognized driver of CVD risk; and, (iii) women affected by a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, especially in the setting of pre-existing metabolic and inflammatory risk and CMD, are more likely to experience accelerated subclinical cardiac disease and progression to clinical CVD. To test our hypotheses and determine mechanisms by which certain women are made vulnerable to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and subsequent CVD, we will comprehensively interrogate the clinical, biochemical, and physiological determinants of pregnancy-associated CVD risk in both a community cohort enriched with cardiometabolic traits and a clinical cohort that is deeply phenotyped using advanced non-invasive cardiovascular imaging.",8895454 (contact),"QUESADA, ODAYME  (contact)","WEBB, STEPHANIE JOHNSON",2020-05-04,2025-08-30,Acceleration;Adult;Affect;Age;aged;Award;Biochemical;Cardiac;cardiometabolism;Cardiovascular Diseases;cardiovascular disorder prevention;cardiovascular disorder risk;cardiovascular health;cardiovascular imaging;cardiovascular risk factor;Cardiovascular system;career development;case control;Cicatrix;Clinical;Clinical Investigator;clinical translation;cohort;Communities;Conceptions;Coronary;Coronary Arteriosclerosis;coronary fibrosis;Data;design;Development;Diagnostic;Disease Outcome;Echocardiography;Endothelium;Epidemiology;Etiology;Event;Exhibits;experience;Functional disorder;Future;Goals;Heart Abnormalities;Heart Diseases;Heart failure;heart imaging;Heterogeneity;high risk;Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos;Hispanic Women;Hypertension;Impaired fasting glycaemia;indexing;Inflammation;Inflammatory;inflammatory marker;Investigation;Knowledge;Magnetic Resonance;Measures;Mediating;men;Metabolic;Metabolic syndrome;Microvascular Dysfunction;Mission;Modeling;mortality;normotensive;Outcome;Oxidative Stress;Participant;Pathway interactions;perfusion imaging;Phenotype;Physiological;Population;Population Sciences;Pre-Eclampsia;Predisposition;Pregnancy;Pregnancy Complications;pregnancy disorder;pregnancy hypertension;Pregnancy Interval;Program Development;prospective;Recording of previous events;recruit;Reporting;Research;Risk;Risk Factors;sex;Sex Differences;Site;skill acquisition;Stress;Structure;Testing;Time;Training;trait;United States National Institutes of Health;Visit;Woman;Women&apos;s Health,Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy: Pathways to Future Cardiovascular Disease,151867,MPOR,NHLBI Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Study Section[MPOR(JA)],NA,NA,6,149825,11986,161811,NA

The goal of this project is to develop, evaluate and disseminate an evidence-based Adult Immunization Quality Improvement Program – Adult IQIP - that integrates adult-specific strategies across healthcare provider settings to increase coverage for adults as similar programs have for childhood immunization coverage. To accomplish Aim 1, systematic reviews of the published and grey literature will be conducted; 64 federally funded state, territorial, and local public health immunization programs (IPs) will be surveyed; and site visits will be conducted including Root Cause Analysis. This information will be synthesized to create an Adult IQIP program (Aim 2). To accomplish Aim 3, our Adult IQIP program will be implemented, supported and monitored in 20 adult immunization practices (FQHC/RHC, Free Clinics, Family Medicine) in Virginia and Washington state. Changes in adult immunization coverage, before and after implementation will be determined and compared to control practices.

We have studied the androgen receptor (AR) as a target for vaccination, and recently completed a phase I trial evaluating an AR-targeted vaccine. We have also recently identified that androgen deprivation, the cornerstone of therapy for men with recurrent prostate cancer, results in AR overexpression in prostate cancer cells, and this makes them more amenable to recognition by AR-specific CD8+ T cells. Combining these treatments results in a greater anti-tumor response in murine models. We have further found, in preclinical studies and clinical trials, that T-cell checkpoint blockade (notably targeting PD-1) with vaccination leads to greater anti-tumor effects. Together these findings form the basis for the current proposal using murine models and a pilot clinical trial to evaluate AR-targeted vaccination in combination with androgen deprivation and T-cell checkpoint blockade for their anti-tumor efficacy and establishment of immune memory.

My research will provide new insight into the mechanisms that drive ciliary membrane shaping and maintenance by investigating the roles of the membrane-binding ciBAR proteins in ciliogenesis and airway ciliated cell differentiation, thus furthering our current understanding of the biology of cilia and ciliopathies.",78592655 (contact),"KIM, EUNICE NA YOUNG (contact)","REYES, MADELYN",2023-08-23,2026-08-22,Address;Affect;Age;amphiphysin;Antibodies;Apical;apical membrane;base;Binding;Binding Proteins;Biochemical;Biogenesis;Biological;Biological Models;Biological Process;Biology;Biosensor;Body System;Cell Differentiation process;Cell membrane;Cell surface;Cells;Centrioles;Chronic;Chronic lung disease;Cilia;ciliopathy;cilium biogenesis;cilium motility;clinical phenotype;Complex;Data;Defect;Defense Mechanisms;Development;dimer;Dimerization;Disease;Distal;DNA Sequence Alteration;Docking;Endocytosis;Epithelial Cells;Exhibits;Functional disorder;Goals;Hair;Histology;Homeostasis;Human;Immunofluorescence Immunologic;Impairment;In Vitro;in vitro Assay;in vivo;Inhalation;insight;kinetosome;Knockout Mice;Knowledge;Label;Laboratories;Link;Lipids;Liposomes;Literature;loss of function;Lung;Lung Diseases;Maintenance;Mammalian Cell;Mediating;Membrane;membrane assembly;Membrane Lipids;Methods;Microtubules;Molecular;Morphology;mouse model;Mucociliary Clearance;Mucous body substance;Mus;Natural Immunity;novel;Organ;Organelles;pathogen;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Phospholipids;Physiological;Play;Preventive treatment;Primary Cell Cultures;Process;Property;Proteins;recruit;Reporting;Research;Respiration Disorders;Respiratory System;Role;SARS-CoV-2 infection;Scanning Electron Microscopy;Sedimentation process;Shapes;Stains;Structure;symptom treatment;System;Tertiary Protein Structure;Testing;Trachea;Tracheal Epithelium;Transmission Electron Microscopy;Vesicle;wasting,Elucidating the Roles of the Membrane-Binding Proteins ciBAR1 and ciBAR2 in Ciliogenesis,168828,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-F10A-K(20)L],NA,NA,2,41340,0,41340,NA

Certain individuals are highly susceptible to infection and suffer from serious disease requiring hospitalization. Serious influenza is often associated with the development of an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) characterized by an uncontrolled inflammatory `cytokine storm' and severely compromised lung function that can be fatal. Current treatments for severe IAV and ARDS are limited to the use of high doses of antivirals, such as Oseltamivir phosphate (tradename Tamiflu) that is most effective when given early during infection, and invasive ventilation, which can double the risk of death. Innovative clinical interventions able to prevent severe respiratory virus infection are urgently needed, especially approaches that can be initiated at later stages of infection. Herein, using a preclinical murine IAV infection model, we will determine key mechanistic underpinnings of a novel application of an interleukin-2-(IL-2) based therapeutic approach that directly (i) promotes pathways to temper inflammation and improve tissue integrity while (ii) concomitantly, also, enhances anti-viral immunity. This proposal is based on our recent observations that directing IL-2 towards the high affinity CD25 subunit of the IL-2 receptor during IAV infection significantly reduces lung immunopathology and improves infection outcomes even when treatment is initiated on day 4 post infection. In addition to promoting expansion of Foxp3+ CD4+ regulatory T cells (T regs), as has often been reported in studies of CD25-targeted IL-2 treatment, we find that innate lymphoid cells (ILC) involved in tissue repair and activated anti-viral T cells, which both also express CD25, are mobilized with treatment. Our findings support that CD25-targeted IL-2 can simultaneously shape both anti- and pro-inflammatory responses during respiratory viral infection. Finally, we also find improved establishment of memory CD4 T cells following infection and treatment, indicating an adjuvant-like quality of this therapeutic approach. The first aim of this proposal will explore how to best utilize this intervention to improve the outcomes of severe IAV infection, in part, by revealing mechanistic insights into how deleterious inflammatory responses arise during serious IAV infection. Our second aim will delineate the role of T regs, ILC, and activated, anti-viral immune cells, in the regulation of IAV infection induced immunopathology and inflammation following CD25-targeted IL-2 treatment. Lastly, the third aim will investigate in depth the persistence and protective functions of IAV-specific immune memory induced in the presence of CD25-targeted IL-2 by IAV infection and vaccination. The insights gained from these studies will advance the development of this IL-2-based therapeutic approach as a treatment for severe respiratory viral infection, as well facilitate its potential use as an adjuvant to boost universal, IAV-specific immunity following vaccination.",11022554 (contact),"STRUTT, TARA MARLENE (contact)","ARNOLD, MICHELLE MARIE",2021-09-22,2026-08-31,Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome;Adjuvant;Advanced Development;Affinity;Animals;Anti-viral Agents;Antibody Formation;antiviral immunity;B-Lymphocytes;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;Cells;Clinical;Combined Modality Therapy;cytokine release syndrome;Development;Disease;Dose;effector T cell;FOXP3 gene;Generations;global health;Goals;Hospitalization;IL2RA gene;Immune;Immunity;Immunoglobulin Class Switching;Immunologic Memory;immunopathology;improved;improved outcome;Individual;Infection;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Response;Influenza;Influenza A virus;influenza infection;innovation;inorganic phosphate;insight;Interleukin 2 Receptor;Interleukin-2;Intervention;Knowledge;Lung;Lymphocyte;Lymphoid Cell;Memory;memory CD4 T lymphocyte;Modeling;mortality risk;Mus;Names;Natural Killer Cells;novel;Oseltamivir;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Plasma Cells;Population;pre-clinical;Predisposition;prevent;Public Health;pulmonary function;Regulation;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Reporting;respiratory infection virus;response;Role;Shapes;Signal Transduction;Structure of germinal center of lymph node;T-Lymphocyte;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;tissue repair;Tissues;Treatment outcome;Vaccination;ventilation;Viral;Viral Respiratory Tract Infection;Virus;Virus Diseases,Harnessing targeted IL-2 to reduce immunopathology and enhance immunity against respiratory virus infection,165406,IHD,Immunity and Host Defense Study Section[IHD],NA,NA,4,250000,130000,380000,NA

Therefore, investigating the mechanism of codon optimality- mediated decay is imperative to understanding how transcript half-lives are determined and will open avenues for therapeutic intervention into haploinsufficiency as well as cancer.",15797778 (contact),"CHRISTENSEN, LANA NICOLE (contact)","STAMM, JOYCE CHIN-CHIN NG",2023-08-01,2025-07-31,Acute T Cell Leukemia;Address;Adult Precursor T Lymphoblastic Leukemia;Affect;Binding;Biological Models;Bone Marrow;Cells;Codon Nucleotides;Communication;Complex;Couples;Cryoelectron Microscopy;Data;Defect;Disease;dosage;Eukaryota;Event;Excision;Exhibits;Genetic Transcription;Health;Homologous Gene;Human;human disease;insight;Knowledge;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;member;messenger ribonucleoprotein;Messenger RNA;Molecular;Monitor;mRNA capping;mRNA decapping;mRNA Decay;mRNA Stability;mRNA Transcript Degradation;mutant;Mutate;N-terminal;nanopore;Northern Blotting;Open Reading Frames;Pathway interactions;Phenotype;Physiological;Poly(A) Tail;polysome profiling;Post-Transcriptional Regulation;Process;Production;Proteins;Radiolabeled;recruit;Reporter;Ribosomal Interaction;Ribosomes;RNA Decay;Role;Saccharomyces cerevisiae;Saccharomycetales;Scaffolding Protein;Series;Site;Structure;Tail;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;Time;Transcript;Translating;Translations;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;Western Blotting;Work;Yeasts,Investigating the role of the Ccr4-Not complex in regulating codon optimality-mediated mRNA decay,151817,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-F05-Q(20)L],NA,NA,2,48974,0,48974,NA

Concurrently, SARS-2 and the antiviral cytokine milieu mitigate PMN recruitment and antifungal effector activation resulting in spore germination into large invasive hyphae that overwhelm antifungal immunity enabling 2° mold infection in an otherwise immunocompetent host.

To resolve this translational barrier, we propose to better understand human cardiac cell specification in vitro through temporal profiling of high and low purity hPSC-CM differentiations using single nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing at key progenitor states in the differentiation process. Using this knowledge, we expect to understand how low purity hPSC-CM differentiations assume an alternate differentiation trajectory to inform methods to reproducibly generate high purity hPSC-CMs for cell therapy, drug toxicity, and disease modeling applications.",16167631 (contact),"FEENEY, AUSTIN K.

But how do abnormal changes in a gene’s sequence cause or contribute to disease? These changes, called mutations, can either be inherited (like the mutation that causes cystic fibrosis) or acquired during a person's life (like the mutations that cause many types of cancer). If researchers can learn how mutations cause diseases, they can better understand how to prevent them or develop drugs to prevent or treat them. Fortunately, the genes and biology of mice and humans are very similar and mouse genes can be easily mutated. But scientists need strains of mice with a mutation in every gene to explore how any one mutated gene causes disease. This project will create mouse models with single gene mutations for 600 human genes, especially genes with little to no known functional information. We will also analyze them with the same kind of tests used on people like vision tests, blood samples, and medical imaging to identify abnormalities (called ‘phenotypes’) that might be caused by any of the mutated genes. Our project will ask the community which genes to work on, and all the mutated mouse models and phenotype data will be available to any scientist around the world. We will also do technology development to improve how we produce and phenotype mice and share that information with the scientific community.

Neuronal wiring is achieved in a series of discrete and modular developmental decisions. First, neurons become ‘polarized’, extending dendrites that receive input from other neurons and a single axon that conveys information to other neurons. Next, ‘axon guidance’ describes the process by which the axon is guided to the correct target, often extending great distances through the developing body and brain. Once in the appropriate target region, the axon forms specialized connections with other neurons, a process that is termed ‘synapse formation’. Finally, neural circuitry is refined through the elaboration or elimination of synaptic connections. Understanding these sequential processes has profound implications for human health. Regeneration of damaged axons and neural circuitry will require a clear understanding of development. Diverse neurological diseases are now being clearly associated with defects in these processes. This conference of international scientists will meet to discuss the latest research in this important field of axon wiring, dendrite formation, synaptogenesis, regeneration and degeneration of neuronal connections.",7039607 (contact),"STEWART, DAVID J.
