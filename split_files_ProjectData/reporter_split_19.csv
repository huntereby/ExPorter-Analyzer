The people, communities, air pollution sources and mixtures, and adaptive capacities to extreme heat and cold may differ in rural settings, such that current strategies (i.e., federal air quality regulations) may not adequately protect rural populations, although these populations have poorer health outcomes, and limited research suggests that racial health disparities may be even larger in rural compared to urban areas.

Non- viral gene delivery with engineered extracellular vesicles is a novel concept for the treatment of discogenic back pain and there is a critical need to develop non-addictive treatments that target both the underlying cause of disease as well as pain to improve human health and quality of life.",12674217;10755258 (contact),"HIGUITA-CASTRO, NATALIA ;PURMESSUR (WALTER), DEVINA  (contact)","MARQUITZ, ARON",2022-04-10,2027-01-31,Address;Age;age effect;Animal Model;Animals;Award;Back Pain;Biological;Blood Vessels;Brachyury protein;Cell Survival;Cell Therapy;cell type;Cells;Chronic low back pain;clinically relevant;comparative;comparison control;Data;Development;discogenic pain;Disease;DNA;Drug Delivery Systems;Economic Burden;effective therapy;efficacious treatment;Engineering;Extracellular Matrix;Extracellular Matrix Proteins;extracellular vesicles;FOXF1 gene;Functional disorder;gene delivery system;Gene Expression;gene therapy;Goals;Growth;Health;Human;Hydration status;improved;In Situ;In Vitro;in vivo;in vivo Model;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Injury;innovation;Intervertebral disc structure;intervertebral disk degeneration;Ligands;Low Back Pain;Mechanics;Membrane;minimally invasive;Mission;Modeling;mouse model;Mus;Nerve;neurotrophic factor;non-viral gene delivery;novel;nucleus pulposus;Operative Surgical Procedures;opioid epidemic;opioid use;Pain;pain behavior;pain reduction;pain symptom;Pathologic;Pathology;Patients;Phenotype;phenotypic biomarker;programs;protein expression;Proteomics;Publishing;Quality of life;Research;Role;scleraxis;sex;socioeconomics;Specificity;Structure;success;symptom treatment;targeted delivery;targeted treatment;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Tissues;tool;transcription factor;treatment strategy;United States National Institutes of Health;uptake;Vertebral column;Viral;Vision;Work,Novel non-viral reprogramming strategies to treat Discogenic back pain via engineered extracellular vesicles,79485,SBSR,Skeletal Biology Structure and Regeneration Study Section[SBSR],NA,NA,3,328618,163713,492331,NA

Therefore, srvc- EHSR will increase the efficiency of literature reviews, make literature reviews more applicable to risk assessments, produce standardized data for research consumption, inform new and more powerful in silico models, decrease the scientific community's reliance on animal testing, and promote safe chemical use in consumer and industrial products and formulations.",15890231 (contact),"LUECHTEFELD, THOMAS  (contact)","RAVICHANDRAN, LINGAMANAIDU V",2024-01-01,2024-12-31,Academia;Adoption;Agriculture;Agrochemicals;Animal Testing;Architecture;base;Chemical Actions;Chemicals;cloud based;Code;commercialization;Communities;Complex;Computer software;consumer product;Consumption;Cosmetics;cost;Data;Data Aggregation;data curation;data standards;Data Store;design;Development;Ensure;Environmental Health;Evaluation;Expenditure;Food Additives;Formulation;Government;Health;health data;Home;Hour;in silico;Individual;Industrial Product;Industrialization;Industry;innovation;interoperability;Intervention;large language model;Link;Literature;Machine Learning;machine learning model;Manuals;Maps;Marketing;Medical Device;Methodology;Modeling;novel;Pharmacologic Substance;Phase;phase 1 study;Poison;Process;prototype;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Review Literature;Risk Assessment;Safety;Series;Site;Source;Standardization;success;systematic review;Testing;Time;tool;Toxicology;usability,srvc-EHSR: Sysrev Version Control - Environmental and Health Related Systematic Reviews,35359,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1 MCST-B (14)],NA,A1,1,252500,23300,293741,NA

We applied genetic studies in humans to identify a new cellular enzyme associated with increased platelet counts, and now propose to further characterize how metabolic function(s) involving the enzyme and its cellular pathway components affect human platelet production and erythrocyte development. This direction of research highlights its importance for blood cell development, most prominent in situations of aging or stress. During the grant period, we propose to complete more detailed biochemical and genetic studies to further study its mechanism of action.

A key early step in the progression to metastatic disease is an increase in cell state plasticity that allows some cancer cells to adapt to new environments and take on new migratory and invasive capabilities.

Having recently identified two small molecules that potently lower PrP with good proteomic selectivity through unknown mechanisms, we will combine targeted genetic perturbations and molecular biology follow-up with proteome-, transcriptome- and genome-wide methods in order to illuminate these novel mechanisms governing PrP expression, while also probing their in vivo relevance.

We have shown that chronic HIV or HCV infection can accelerate premature T cell aging due to telomere attrition - a hallmark of cellular senescence; however, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this proposal, we will investigate how chronic HIV infection induces telomere attrition and T cell aging and how these molecular changes lead to HBV vaccine failure during HIV infection. This study will enhance our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying immune aging in chronic viral infection and develop effective means to restore immune competence and improve vaccine efficacy in HIV-infected patients.

As the largest exposed surfaces of the body, billions of cells are shed from the human gut epithelium every day. These lost cells are constantly replaced by intestine stem cells. Activity of intestine stem cell has to be precisely controlled or it may cause tumorigenesis. Currently, 200,000 new cases of gastrointestinal tract cancers are reported each year.

Although patient satisfaction with this device is high, the weaker link is the vulnerable epidermis-to-implant interface, where interfacial epidermis grows down uncontrollably and produces a sinus tract. Literature indicates that percutaneous healing may be directly related to the biocompatibility of the device material, and importantly, the epidermal adhesion and proliferative patterns. The lack of epidermal integration with the device keeps the interfacial epidermal cells in a migrative phenotype. It is believed that the key for preventing epidermally mediated downgrowth is to use surfaces that promote epidermal cells to form adhesion with them.

Our preliminary data demonstrate that epigenetic changes in diabetic keratinocytes, driven by JAK/STAT/SETDB2, regulate the activity of inflammatory cytokine production (i.e., TNFα). Increased production of TNFα by diabetic keratinocytes then functions to impair keratinocyte migration and further promotes inflammation by promoting a pro- inflammatory macrophage phenotype. The success of the human and animal studies outlined in this proposal may lead to improved understanding of the pathophysiology of non-healing diabetic wounds and test novel therapeutic targets and allow me to develop as a translational scientist.",78743869 (contact),"MOON, JADIE  (contact)","CASTLE, ARTHUR",2023-08-01,2027-07-31,Amputation;Animals;Blood specimen;Cell Physiology;Cells;Chromatin;Complex;cost;cytokine;Data;Death Rate;Defect;Development;diabetic;Diabetic mouse;diabetic ulcer;diabetic wound healing;diet-induced obesity;dietary;Enzymes;Epigenetic Process;epigenetic regulation;experimental study;Failure;Functional disorder;Gene Expression;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;healing;Healthcare Systems;Histone H3;histone methylation;histone methyltransferase;Human;human RNA sequencing;IL17 gene;Immune;Immunologist;Impaired wound healing;Impairment;improved;in vivo;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Interferon-beta;Janus kinase;keratinocyte;Link;Lysine;Macrophage;Mediating;Mediator;migration;Molecular;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality;mouse model;Mus;new therapeutic target;NF-kappa B;non-healing wounds;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;novel;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Patients;pharmacologic;Phenotype;Play;prevent;Process;Production;re-epithelialization;Regulation;Repression;Research Design;Resolution;Role;Signal Transduction;single-cell RNA sequencing;skills;Skin;Skin repair;STAT protein;STAT1 gene;Stat3 protein;success;targeted treatment;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic Agents;therapeutic target;tissue repair;Tissue Sample;TNF gene;translational approach;translational scientist;Treatment Efficacy;United States;Up-Regulation;wound;wound care;wound healing;Wound models,Epigenetic regulation of keratinocyte function in normal and pathologic skin repair,136199,ZDK1,ZDK1-GRB-2(J1),NA,NA,2,43027,0,43027,NA
