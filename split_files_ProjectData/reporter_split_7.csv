New biophysical tools are urgently needed to study membrane proteins. The research discussed in this MIRA R35 application will develop new biophysical methods for studying the structural and dynamic properties of integral membrane proteins and channels. We will also apply these methods to probe the structure of several different biological systems.  We will focus on investigating the structural and dynamic properties of integral membrane proteins in the KCNE family which is responsible for the modulation of voltage gated potassium (Kv) channels including KCNQ1 (Q1). This channel is expressed throughout the body to regulate physiological functions and mutations in this channel are linked to several diseases such as Long QT syndrome and other heart diseases. Increased understanding of the molecular underpinnings of KCNE modulation of potassium channels, specifically Q1, would help expand our understanding of the etiology of these diseases. We will study three members of the KCNE family: KCNE1(E1), KCNE3(E3), and KCNE4(E4). When E1 forms a complex with Q1, it causes the activation kinetics of the channel to slow, giving rise to the slow-delayed rectifier potassium channel, IKs, which is crucial to the repolarization of cardiac action potential. E3 forms a complex with Kv channels that are voltage-independent under physiological ranges. Q1/E3 channels are important for cardiac action potentials and transport of nutrients across epithelial cells. A major gap in our understanding of E3 is due to limited structural information. E4 has been shown to inhibit current in Kv channels, including Q1. Previously, the role of E4’s tetraleucine motif has been tied to its inhibitory effects and interaction with Kv channels. It is currently not understood how the tetraleucine motif drives protein-protein interactions and how this leads to changes in the structure of E4 Presently, E3 and E4 are being studied in the Lorigan lab to provide knowledge regarding structure, topology, and dynamics which can lead to better molecular level understanding as previously done with E1.  Over the next five years, we will: (1) Develop new biophysical techniques to dramatically improve structural studies of membrane proteins, (2) Probe the structural and dynamic properties of E3, and E4, (3) Elucidate the binding mechanism of E1 and Q1 to help us better understand the mechanism of Q1 regulation, and (4) Apply the membrane protein techniques that we develop to investigate the structure of several biologically important integral membrane proteins (S2E Coronavirus Envelope Protein, Canonical Holin, TRPV1, and Grp94) using pulsed EPR spectroscopy. The TRPV1, and GRP94 projects will be done via collaboration. Each lab will send us samples for pulsed EPR measurements. Transformative biophysical techniques will be developed to study the structural and dynamic properties of membrane proteins. These state-of-the-art pulsed EPR spectroscopic techniques will move the field forward by dramatically increasing sensitivity and distance measurements of membrane protein systems such as E3 and E4.

Elucidating LTCC mechanisms regulating neuronal plasticity is relevant for understanding normal learning and memory as well as learning deficits in intellectual disabilities, neuropsychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Changes in LTCC channel function and regulation of synapse structure and gene expression have been implicated in cognitive impairments associated with Alzheimer’s disease, Down syndrome, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. Linkage of LTCC’s to multiple neuropsychiatric and neurological diseases further supports a key role for these channels in regulating central forms of plasticity that control neuronal function throughout the brain. Previous studies demonstrated that highly localized signaling processes occur near the LTCC that are important for both channel modulation and downstream signaling to transcription factors in the nucleus. However, the molecular mechanisms that coordinate coupling of LTCCs to signaling molecules that regulate synapses in neuronal dendrites and also transcription factors that ultimately act in the nucleus are not well understood. Thus, given LTCC links to multiple nervous system diseases, it is becoming increasingly important to understand these fundamental mechanisms by which LTCCs control synapse structure and neuronal gene expression. Accordingly, here we will characterize fundamental mechanisms by which LTCCs regulate postsynaptic dendritic spine structure and also relay information from synapses to control gene expression in the nucleus, including in pathways relevant to synapse loss Alzheimer’s, autism, and schizophrenia.",1879703 (contact),"DELL'ACQUA, MARK L (contact)","DRISCOLL, JAMIE",2021-04-01,2026-01-31,A kinase anchoring protein;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;autism spectrum disorder;Binding Proteins;Biochemical;Bipolar Disorder;Brain;Calcineurin;calcineurin phosphatase;Calcium Channel;Calcium ion;Cell Nucleus;Complex;Coupling;Cyclic AMP;Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases;Dendrites;Dendritic Spines;Distal;Down&apos;s Syndrome;Endoplasmic Reticulum;Equilibrium;Excitatory Synapse;Face;Feedback;Gene Expression;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Glutamate Receptor;Glutamates;Hippocampus;Human;Impaired cognition;Intellectual functioning disability;Knowledge;Lead;Learning;Link;Long-Term Potentiation;Maintenance;Major Depressive Disorder;Mediating;Memory;Mental Depression;Molecular;myocyte-specific enhancer-binding factor 2;N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors;N-Methylaspartate;Nervous System Disorder;Neurodegenerative Disorders;neuronal cell body;Neuronal Plasticity;Neurons;neuropsychiatric disorder;novel;nuclear factors of activated T-cells;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases;Phosphotransferases;Play;postsynaptic;Potassium;Process;Protein Dephosphorylation;Protein Kinase;Proteins;receptor;Receptor Activation;Regulation;Research;response;Response Elements;Rodent;Role;Scaffolding Protein;Schizophrenia;sensor;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Signaling Molecule;STIM1 gene;Structure;Synapses;synaptic function;Synaptic plasticity;transcription factor;Transcription Factor AP-1;Transcriptional Regulation;Vertebral column;voltage;Work,L-type Ca2+ Channel Spike Regulation of Spine Structural Plasticity and Excitation-Transcription Coupling,123700,NTRC,"Neurotransporters, Receptors, and Calcium Signaling Study Section[NTRC]",NA,NA,4,366823,198536,565359,NA

The goal of this project is to build statistical and computational methods, databases, and specimen biorepositories using the VA medical record that follow Veterans over time to support research into building tools that include polyp genetic information for better CRC risk stratification.",2499987 (contact),"HAUSER, ELIZABETH R (contact)",NA,2022-10-01,2026-09-30,age effect;Algorithms;analytical tool;Big Data;biobank;Biological;Biological Specimen Banks;Biometry;Cancer Etiology;cancer risk;Catalogs;Cessation of life;Clinical;Clinical Data;clinical practice;clinical risk;cohort;colon cancer screening;Colonic Adenoma;Colonoscopy;Colorectal Cancer;colorectal cancer prevention;colorectal cancer progression;colorectal cancer risk;colorectal cancer screening;Colorectal Neoplasms;Computational Biology;computerized tools;Computing Methodologies;cooperative study;Data;data integration;data quality;data resource;Data Science;Data Scientist;Data Set;data tools;Databases;design;Development;Disease;Evaluation of Risk Factors;Excision;experience;Exposure to;follow-up;Frequencies;Future;Genetic;genetic analysis;genetic information;Genetic Markers;Genetic Models;Genetic Risk;genetic risk factor;genomic biomarker;genomic data;Genomics;Goals;Grant;Guidelines;Healthcare Systems;high risk;high risk population;Histopathology;Human Genetics;improved;Incidence;Individual;Joints;Libraries;Longitudinal cohort;Longitudinal Studies;Medical Records;military veteran;Modality;Modeling;mortality;mortality risk;Mutation;novel;Pathology;personalized medicine;phenomics;Phenotype;Pilot Projects;polygenic risk score;Polyps;Precancerous Polyp;prevent;Prevention;Preventive;prognostic;programs;progression risk;prospective;Recording of previous events;Research;Research Personnel;research study;Research Support;Resources;Risk;Risk Assessment;Risk Factors;risk prediction;risk prediction model;risk stratification;Safety;Sampling;screening;Somatic Mutation;Specimen;Statistical Methods;Statistical Models;Testing;Time;tissue resource;Tissues;tool;tv watching;United States;Universities;Veterans;Work,Building Data Science Tools for Genetic Models of Colorectal Cancer Progression and Risk,5718,ZRD1,ZRD1-ONCC-Y(01),NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA

Further, the etiology and features of PASC in SARDs may be unique because of differences in their immune responses to infection and predisposition to autoimmunity and fibrosis.  These studies will comprehensively investigate the immunologic and clinical outcomes after COVID-19 in patients with SARDs. To achieve our aims, we have assembled a cohort of vaccinated SARDs, systematically identified all SARDs with COVID-19, and are prospectively enrolling patients into an observational study. In the first aim, we will investigate risk for breakthrough infection after vaccination among RA patients on immunosuppressants. We will follow SARO patients acutely infected with COVID-19 to determine whether immunosuppressants prolong viral shedding that may result in viral evolution. In the second aim, we will measure autoantibodies as well as antibodies to pathogens to determine changes induced by COVID-19 and identify antibody profiles associated with PASC among SARDs. In the third aim, we will obtain chest imaging and respiratory phenotyping to determine if COVID-19 may induce fibrotic lung disease in RA patients.  Dr. Jeffrey Sparks (Assistant Professor of Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, HMS) and Dr. Zachary Wallace (Assistant Professor of Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, HMS) will lead these studies as Principal Investigators. Dr. Sparks and Dr. Wallace are rheumatologists and research leaders related to SARDs and the COVID-19 pandemic.

The course will accept junior oncologists and fellows/residents in an oncology specialty, who are novice in cancer clinical research. The course will deliver in Part 1, The Fundamentals of Clinical Research, a semester long virtual immersive educational experience across all areas of cancer clinical research, then culminate in an in-person Trial Concept Writing Camp (Part 2) during the annual American Association of Cancer Institute (AACI) Clinical Research Innovation (CRI) meeting where participants will be mentored by experienced clinical investigators from different AACI member institutions during which time, they will finalize a clinical trial concept (also called letter of intent (LOI)), the end product of this course. Participants are selected through a competitive application process consisting of a CV, personal statement, letter of support from a local clinical research mentor, and a career development plan. Accepted participants will first receive scientific and GCP training over 20 virtual sessions covering the 6 major modules of protocol development that encompass the eleven domains of clinical trial expertise, including oncology, science, medicine, business/negotiation, accounting, statistics, pharmacy, pharmacology, laws and regulations, ethics, and clinical trial management. The curriculum will be loaded on a web portal developed for educational purposes under another U24 NCI award to OSUCCC. The virtual training will use a flipped classroom approach to maintain participant attentiveness. At the CRI meeting, participants will interact with Key Faculty mentors, nationwide experts in clinical research, who will help them complete a realistic concept form that meets scientific standards. Participants will take part in pre- and post-tests to determine the cogency of the CTC curriculum for their professional practice, and the effectiveness of the course logistics. They will complete the course by submitting a finalized clinical trial concept to the CTC course directors. Afterwards, they should be able to use their concept to develop a full protocol at their own institutions or though the NCI clinical research networks or other clinical trial networks. After the course, public data will be used to track participants’ career trajectories to determine the long-term effects of the course on their careers, working with Academics Analytics, a company contracted with OSU. Impact. Investigators must apply GCP and the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines to the design and scientific approach of their clinical research. The basics of clinical research are not taught in medical schools or residencies. The pool of clinical investigators has also decreased in the US, creating a serious shortage of clinical trial experts. At the same time, there has been an explosion of biological discoveries and technological advances. This innovative and necessary CTC course will address the need for thorough and specific training on clinical trial design and execution to eventually benefit patients with cancers and support the professional development of junior oncology faculty.",14803312;1888509 (contact),"OWEN, DWIGHT H.;VERSCHRAEGEN, CLAIRE F.

Since obesity is becoming a prevalent and destructive health disorder linked to some of the leading causes of preventable death including type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and osteoporosis, there is an urgent need to understand the molecular pathways driving the pathogenesis of obesity-related disorders such as T2DM and osteoporosis. Based on our novel discovery that disruption of Kinase Suppressor of Ras (Ksr) 2, a gene recently implicated in obesity and T2DM, leads to a dramatic increase in trabecular bone mass, our proposed efforts in this grant application will delineate the mechanisms by which this obesity gene regulates the skeletal phenotype.

Financial data is likely to be an important tool for helping with early diagnosis because people’s financial decisions are typically some of the first things affected by the disease.,3054110 (contact),"GRESENZ, CAROLE R (contact)","JAIN, KRITI MUNJAL",2023-02-01,2027-01-31,Acceleration;Address;Adult;Affect;Algorithms;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Alzheimer&apos;s disease diagnosis;Alzheimer&apos;s disease related dementia;Alzheimer&apos;s disease risk;Automobile Driving;Biological Markers;Brain imaging;Caring;Characteristics;comorbidity;Computational algorithm;cost;Data;Data Sources;Databases;Dementia;Diagnosis;diagnostic tool;digital;digital technology;Disease;Early Diagnosis;Early identification;Economics;Education;emerging adult;Enrollment;Equilibrium;Equity;Ethnic Origin;experience;Family;financial decision making;Gender;Goals;Habits;Health;Home;Household;Individual;Life Style;Liquid substance;Machine Learning;machine learning algorithm;machine learning method;machine learning model;Medicare;Medicare claim;modifiable risk;Monitor;Moods;Neurobehavioral Manifestations;New York;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Patients;payment;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;prediction algorithm;Predisposition;preference;Probability;Quality of life;Race;Research;research clinical testing;response;Risk;Risk Factors;Safety;Screening procedure;Signal Transduction;Signs and Symptoms;Social Security Number;Source;Structure;Support System;Symptoms;Time;tool;Update,Using Digital Signals from Credit Data for Early Detection of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias,80623,SSPA,Social Sciences and Population Studies A Study Section[SSPA],NA,NA,2,469228,260389,729617,NA

These functions likely depend on the interaction between the cerebellum and key nodes in emotional circuits, such as the amygdala and nucleus accumbens; however, these interactions and their disruption in mental disorders are not understood. The central goal of this proposal is to dissect the connectivity between the cerebellum and the limbic system, using a combination of approaches that span levels of analysis, and to link the connectivity to learned behavior.",10296849 (contact),"FIORAVANTE, DIASYNOU  (contact)","VICENTIC, ALEKSANDRA",2022-04-01,2027-01-31,Affective;Amygdaloid structure;Anatomy;Area;autism spectrum disorder;Behavior;Behavioral Genetics;Behavioral Paradigm;Brain;Calcium;Cell Nucleus;cell type;Cells;Cerebellum;Cognitive;Communication;Data;Dimensions;Disease;Dissection;Electrophysiology (science);Elements;Emotional;emotional behavior;entorhinal cortex;Experimental Genetics;experimental study;Extinction;Fiber;Fright;Generations;Goals;Habenula;Hippocampus;Image;Impairment;in vivo;in vivo calcium imaging;Individual;innovation;insight;Investigation;Knowledge;Lateral;learned behavior;Learning;learning extinction;Limbic System;Link;Maps;Measurement;Medial;Mediating;Memory;Mental disorders;Mental Health;metaplastic cell transformation;Molecular;Molecular Profiling;Monitor;motor control;motor learning;Movement;Mus;neural;Neurons;Nodal;novel;Nucleus Accumbens;optogenetics;patch sequencing;Pathway interactions;Photometry;Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders;Process;Property;Psyche structure;Reaction Time;Regulation;Reporting;Resolution;response;reward processing;Role;Signal Transduction;single cell sequencing;single-cell RNA sequencing;stem;Structure;Synapses;Testing;Thalamic structure;Time;transcriptomics;Ventral Tegmental Area;Viral;Well in self,Multi-level dissection of cerebello-limbic connectivity,128744,LMDN,"Learning, Memory and Decision Neuroscience Study Section[LMDN]",NA,NA,3,386894,214593,601487,NA
