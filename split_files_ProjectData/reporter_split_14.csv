Understanding the mechanisms of how IL17RB links p53’s crosstalk with other signaling pathways and how p53 attenuates oncogenic effects of chronic inflammation through repressing IL17RB will lead to the development of novel anti-cancer strategies and inflammation inhibitors.",8918960 (contact),"ZHU, YAN  (contact)","LUO, RUIBAI",2023-12-15,2026-11-30,adaptive immune response;anti-cancer;Apoptosis;Attenuated;attenuation;Biochemical;Biological Response Modifiers;Biomedical Research;cancer cell;career;Cell Cycle Arrest;Cell Death;Cells;Chronic;Coculture Techniques;Colon Carcinoma;cytokine;Cytokine Receptors;Data;Data Set;Development;Dimethyl Sulfoxide;Disease;DNA Repair;Environment;Family;functional loss;Future;Gene Expression Profiling;Genes;Goals;graduate student;HCT116 Cells;human disease;IL17 gene;IL8 gene;Immune;Immune response;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Response;inhibitor;Innate Immune Response;Interleukin Activation;Interleukin-1;Investigation;Lead;Learning;Link;Lipopolysaccharides;LNCaP;Macrophage;Malignant neoplasm of prostate;Malignant Neoplasms;MDM2 gene;Mediating;Metabolism;mRNA Expression;mRNA sequencing;novel;Oncogenic;Osteosarcoma;overexpression;Play;Predisposing Factor;prevent;prostate cancer cell;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt;Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR;Reaction;receptor;Reporting;Repression;Research;response;RNA;Role;Sampling;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;System;Testing;Time;TP53 gene;transcription factor;transcriptome sequencing;tumor;tumor progression;Tumor Suppression;tumorigenesis;undergraduate student;Universities;Work,ELUCIDATING THE FUNCTION OF P53-MEDIATED IL17RB REPRESSION,287406,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1 BTC-Q (81)],NA,NA,1,300000,192000,492000,NA

We will then examine how two different types of movement feedback (movement amplification or reduction) affect the way stroke survivors control their hand muscles. Finally, we will study if the dynamic condition of the training, i.e., force production or movement, can affect the way they control their hand muscles.

This research proposal aims to commercialize a breakthrough TxGuardTM pulmonary-valved graft (PVG) device that is designed to resist early degeneration and allow for regeneration with host cells, ensuring that the device grows with the pediatric patient. The proposed Phase IIB SBIR grant will help to de-risk several critical aspects of the research and complete pre-clinical test data required for FDA humanitarian device exemption (HDE) submission.

Our studies demonstrate that Zbtb44, a member of ThPOK family of transcription factors forms a complex with the T-box transcription factor, Eomes which is critically essential for effector function of CD8+ T cells. In the ‘exhausted’ CD8+T cells, Trim47 degrades Zbtb44 and disrupts the Zbtb44-Eomes complex resulting in the inhibitory transcriptional profile. We aim to prevent CAR-T exhaustion by blocking the Zbtb44- Trim47 pathway.

We will determine the signaling events within tumor microenvironment required for emergence of disseminating cancer cell phenotype (invasive and stem). We will also determine the mechanisms by which these cancer cells re-disseminate from metastatic foci, a process that may perpetuate metastases even after the removal of the primary tumor. Since the majority of patients with metastases are treated with chemotherapy we will determine the effect of chemotherapy on these two processes.  To capture the true biology of the tumor microenvironment we will employ novel technologies for in vivo imaging of large volumes of tissue along with our novel biosensors, both in primary tumors and in the lungs, with single cell resolution, and over many days.

We have recently developed a novel, multi-faceted anemia screening and monitoring suite of products comprising 3 key products for home testing: 1) AnemoCheck Home test kit (under FDA interactive review)– a “single drop of blood” fingerstick test that utilizes our clinical FDA- cleared technology to elicit a color change that correlates with degree of anemia, 2) AnemoCheck app – a smartphone app that screens for anemia using only smartphone photos and the phone itself with no additional equipment and 3) AnemoCheck MyMobile– a marriage of the AnemoCheck Home test kit and AnemoCheck app products in which the app is “personalized” for each patient to significantly improve accuracy and enable self-monitoring of anemia. In this proposal, we aim to expand upon testing in Phase II answering to a request for additional data from FDA to 1) conduct human factors validation 2) implement quality control features and changes in workflow informed by human factors and 3) characterize the performance of AnemoCheck MyMobile head to head against comparator, reference method and when trained with AnemoCheck Home (versus a traditional blood test to train AnemoCheck MyMobile, versus traditional blood testing) for chronic anemia management to expand our use and allow for a completely home-based access to cost-effectively empower patients to manage their own care.",12469887 (contact),"TYBURSKI, ERIKA AMY (contact)","WARREN, RONALD Q",2018-01-01,2026-11-30,Address;Adult;Affect;algorithm training;Algorithms;Anemia;Beds;Biological Assay;Blood;Blood Tests;Calibration;Cardiovascular system;Caring;Cellular Phone;Chronic;Chronic Kidney Failure;Clinical;Clinical Research;clinical research site;Clinics and Hospitals;cohort;Collaborations;Color;Communication;Complete Blood Count;Computer software;Cooley&apos;s anemia;cost;Data;Death Rate;design;Detection;Devices;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Diagnostic Reagent Kits;Diagnostic tests;diagnostic tool;Drops;empowerment;Epidemiology;Equipment;Equity;Etiology;Familiarity;Fatigue;Fingers;Foundations;Funding;gastrointestinal;Goals;Head;Health;Hematological Disease;Hematology;Hemoglobin;Hemoglobin concentration result;high risk;Home;home test;Human;Human Resources;Image;improved;improved outcome;individual patient;Journals;Left;Life;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Malnutrition;Marketing;Marriage;Measurement;Measures;meter;Methods;Monitor;Morbidity - disease rate;Nature;novel;Outcome;Output;Oxidation-Reduction;Patients;pediatric patients;Peer Review;Performance;personalized medicine;Persons;Phase;point of care;Population;Pregnant Women;Productivity;Public Health;Publishing;Quality Control;Quality of life;Reaction;Reagent;Recommendation;Recurrence;Risk;Risk Assessment;screening;self testing;Severities;Sickle Cell;Sickle Cell Anemia;Small Business Innovation Research Grant;smartphone application;Source;Structure of nail of finger;Symptoms;System;Technology;technology validation;Telephone;Testing;Thalassemia;Time;tool;Training;Translations;treatment response;Validation;validation studies;Visit,"Translation of a personalized, non-invasive smartphone app for hemoglobin monitoring for chronic anemia patients",139250,ZHL1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZHL1 CSR-F (O1)],NA,NA,4,788945,133177,986670,NA

We found aberrant activation of the innate immune response in human subjects and a murine model of CML. We also found enhanced reactive oxygen species production with efficient detoxification in CML until TKI-resistance or BC develop. The first goal of these studies is to determine the role of immune dysregulation in disease progression in CML. 50% of CML patients with a sustained, major molecular response to TKIs remain in remission after stopping these agents.

Intercellular crosstalk of hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells (i.e. Mφ and LSEC) is crucial for the maintenance of liver homeostasis. Under the pathological condition, hepatocyte damage results in the activation of fibrotic Mφ and LSEC. Thereby these cells play a critical role in the control of hepatic inflammation and the development of liver fibrosis. Exosomes are small membrane-bound extracellular vesicles and serve as natural carriers of signaling molecules such as cytokines for prompting cellular crosstalk. This project will identify a major cellular and molecular mechanism for the role of exosomes released from HCV-infected hepatocytes in promoting intercellular communication with non-parenchymal cells (i.e. Mφ and LSEC), leading to the development of liver fibrosis.

To overcome these barriers, we will develop new and robust statistical methods to 1) identify latent groups of PA patterns based on device-based functional curves prone to heteroscedastic measurement errors and determine the association between the identified PA patterns with T2D status adjusting for PA biomarkers, age, sex, and race/ethnicity; 2) better reduce the impact of measurement error-related biases in PA and DI data on the quantile functions of body mass index and fat mass index; and 3) correct for measurement error biases associated with device-based PA and self- reported DI when evaluating their influences on T2D status. These newly developed models and related software will be widely applicable in studies of objective measures of PA and DI in chronic health conditions, which can lead to more targeted and effective interventions and address health outcomes disparities among vulnerable populations in various biomedical contexts.",12158533 (contact),"TEKWE, CARMEN D.

Results will advance methods for understanding alcohol regulation and measures of population health among communities experiencing some of the most disparate health inequities in the United States, demonstrate the utility of including community voices to enrich our empirical assessments of contextual factors associated with alcohol-related outcomes, and support community advocacy for policy change by improving understanding of policy effects on health outcomes.",6270530 (contact),"LEE, JULIET P (contact)","BLOSS, GREGORY",2021-03-05,2026-02-28,Accident and Emergency department;Address;Adopted;Advocacy;Affect;Alaska Native;Alcohol abuse;alcohol availability;Alcohol consumption;Alcohol dependence;alcohol measurement;alcohol policy information system;alcohol related problem;Alcohols;American Indian Tribe;American Indians;AODR mortality;Area;Attitude;authority;behavioral study;Charge;Communities;community advisory board;community based participatory research;community engagement;Community Health;comparative;Congresses;contextual factors;Data;design;Documentation;Economics;Effectiveness;Ensure;Epidemiologic Methods;Epidemiology;epidemiology study;evidence base;experience;Foundations;Genetic;Hand;Health;health assessment;health disparity;health inequalities;Health Policy;heterogenous data;High Prevalence;Hospitalization;Hospitals;improved;Indian reservation;Indigenous;Individual;Information Dissemination;Information Systems;Injury;insight;Intervention;Interview;Investigation;Joints;Knowledge;Law Enforcement;Laws;Legal;Literature;Low Prevalence;Measures;Methods;Modeling;National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism;Outcome;Police;Policies;Policy Making;Policy Research;Population;population health;Prevention approach;Prevention Research;Price;Psychology;Public Health;Public Policy;public policy on alcohol;Qualitative Research;Records;Regulation;repository;Research;Research Institute;Research Methodology;Research Personnel;Reservations;Risk;Sales;Sampling;Scientist;Site;social;social structure;spatial epidemiology;structural determinants;Surveys;tribal community;tribal health;tribal lands;tribal leader;tribal Nation;Tribes;Typology;underage drinking;United States;Universities;US State;Vehicle crash;Voice;Washington;Work;Writing,Healthy Native Nations: Identifying Effective Alcohol Policies for American Indian Tribes,28236,CIHB,Community Influences on Health Behavior Study Section[CIHB],NA,NA,4,328596,192875,521471,NA

This proposal aims to understand the brain physiology underlying defensive response by mapping and decoding the neurophysiological signals across multiple brain sites and the connections between these sites in response to multiple threat stimuli. Naïve animals are exposed to threat both before and after a traumatic social defeat stressor to determine how this stressor affects the responses to threat.

Aside from patients with advanced cardiogenic shock wherein inotropes are necessary for survival past the operating room, limited evidence exists to support the ability of inotropes to improve survival or reduce complications among the majority of 300,000 patients undergoing cardiac surgery each year, and as a result, inotrope practice patterns vary widely across clinicians and hospitals, contributing to wide variation in mortality and major complication rates. We seek to (i) identify patient, clinician, and institution phenotypes associated with inotrope practice patterns; (ii) characterize and quantify institutional barriers to inotrope practice change; and (iii) estimate context-specific causal effects of inotropes on outcomes through a novel integration of cardiac surgical databases which address unmeasured confounders historically biasing previous observational studies.",14151726 (contact),"MATHIS, MICHAEL ROBERT (contact)","ANAYA, GABRIEL",2023-12-15,2027-11-30,"Address;Adult;Adverse effects;Anesthesiology;Arrhythmia;Attitude;Automobile Driving;Benefits and Risks;Cardiac;Cardiac Surgery procedures;Cardiogenic Shock;Clinical;Clinical Trials;cohort;Complication;cost;Data;data registry;Data Set;Databases;Death Rate;design;Development;EHR research;Feedback;Future;Goals;Graph;Health system;Heart Contractilities;hemodynamics;Hospital Societies;Hospitals;improved;improved outcome;insight;Institution;Intensive Care Units;Interview;Life;Malignant - descriptor;member;Methods;Michigan;Minority;Modeling;Modernization;mortality;Multicenter Studies;Myocardial Ischemia;National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute;novel;Nurses;Observational Study;Operating Rooms;Operative Surgical Procedures;Organ;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Patient risk;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Pattern;Perfusion;Perioperative;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Population;Postoperative Complications;preference;Process;Records;Recovery;Registries;Reporting;Research;Resources;Risk;Risk Factors;Risk Reduction;Role;Selection Bias;Societies;Specific qualifier value;Standardization;structural determinants;Structure;Surgeon;surgery outcome;surgical research;Surveys;Testing;Thoracic Surgeon;Traction;treatment as usual;Universities;Variant",COmparing iNoTRope prACtice variaTION in Cardiac Surgery (CONTRACTION-CS),167790,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1 HSS-F (90)],NA,A1,1,452898,253623,706521,NA

However, anhedonia is a multi-faceted deficit involving several mechanisms of goal- directed reward behavior, which are still poorly understood in relation to alcohol use and AUD outcomes. The proposed research will use computational modeling and functional neuroimaging to identify mechanistically driven anhedonic markers of alcohol recovery in Veterans with AUD completing standard care EBT.

Increasing age is associated with changes in immune function (immunosenescence) that result in increased susceptibility to diseases and poor vaccine responses in older adults. This proposal is designed to bring together very recent and significant advances in dermatology and skin biology to address critical problems in human health. Specifically, we propose to modulate local immune regulatory circuits in the skin to enable the induction and regulation of antigen-specific systemic immune responses. The studies we propose will investigate the effect of locally delivered immune modulators on the mechanisms underlying cutaneous immune regulation in young and aged skin. Importantly, our studies include translational studies using living human skin to enable the rapid advancement of novel cutaneous immunomodulation strategies into clinical trials. An improved understanding of these underlying skin immune mechanisms will enable the development of localized skin targeted immunization strategies to induce antigen-specific systemic immune responses for the prevention or treatment of a broad range of diseases across the lifespan.",1860503 (contact),"FALO, LOUIS D (contact)","BELKIN, ALEXEY",2021-03-04,2026-01-31,2019-nCoV;adaptive immune response;Address;Adjuvant;Age;age related changes;aged;Antibodies;Antibody Response;Antigen-Presenting Cells;Antigens;Biology;biomarker identification;Bronchoalveolar Lavage;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;Cell Physiology;Cellular Immunity;Clinical;clinical application;clinical translation;Clinical Trials;Combined Vaccines;COVID-19;COVID-19 vaccine;Cutaneous;Data;Dermatology;design;Development;Disease;Dose;draining lymph node;Engineered skin;Engineering;experience;Funding;Generations;Goals;Health;Human;Immune;immune function;Immune response;Immune system;Immunity;Immunization;Immunobiology;immunoengineering;immunogenicity;Immunologics;Immunomodulators;immunoregulation;immunosenescence;improved;In Situ;Inflammatory;Injections;innate immune mechanisms;Innate Immune Response;Learning;life span;Lung;Lymphoid Tissue;Methods;Natural Immunity;Needles;neutralizing antibody;next generation;novel;old mice;older adult;Organ;pathogen;peripheral blood;Phase I/II Clinical Trial;Predisposition;Prevention;Protein Subunits;Publishing;rational design;Regulation;Reproducibility;Safety;SARS-CoV-2 antigen;SARS-CoV-2 immunity;Skin;Skin Aging;Skin Cancer;Spleen;Subunit Vaccines;T-Lymphocyte;targeted delivery;technology platform;translational study;Translations;United States National Institutes of Health;Vaccination;vaccination strategy;vaccine delivery;vaccine development;vaccine efficacy;vaccine response;Vaccines,Engineering the Skin Immune System to Induce Systemic Immune Responses,79233,ACTS,"Arthritis, Connective Tissue and Skin Study Section[ACTS]",NA,NA,4,409885,232767,642652,NA

The p53 tumor suppressor is frequently inactivated by mutations in cancer. Currently no approved drugs are available for restoring the activity of mutant p53. Although p53 missense mutants are inactive at 37°C, ~14% are temperature-sensitive (ts) that regain activity at 32°C. The p53 ts mutants represent a unique class that may be activated by mild hypothermia, which is currently standard of care for post- cardiac arrest patients. We have established conditions for inducing controlled hypothermia in mice. Preliminary experiments demonstrated the ability of hypothermia to induce regression and stable remission of tumors expressing ts mutant p53. We will use this system to further investigate conditions that can improve the efficacy of ts p53 targeting and achieving long-term remission. We will also test the effect the hypothermia against clinically-relevant patient-derived xenograft models (PDX) expressing ts mutant p53, and against spontaneous tumors developed in a mutant mouse with germline ts p53 mutation.",1972427 (contact),"CHEN, JIANDONG  (contact)","VENKATACHALAM, SUNDARESAN",2021-03-01,2027-02-28,Apoptosis;Binding;Biological Assay;Brain;Bypass;Cancer Patient;cancer therapy;Categories;Cell Cycle;Cell Cycle Arrest;Cell Death Induction;chemotherapy;Clinical;clinical translation;clinically relevant;CRISPR/Cas technology;Databases;deep sequencing;Disease remission;DNA Binding;DNA Binding Domain;DNA Sequence;Drug Targeting;Energy Metabolism;experimental study;Frequencies;functional status;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Germ Lines;Heart Arrest;Human;Immunocompetent;improved;in vivo;Individual;induced hypothermia;Induction of Apoptosis;Libraries;Lung Neoplasms;Lymphoma;Malignant Neoplasms;MDM2 gene;Modeling;Molecular;mouse model;Mus;mutant;Mutant Strains Mice;Mutation;natural hypothermia;neglect;neoplastic cell;novel strategies;pancreatic neoplasm;patient derived xenograft model;Patient Selection;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;pharmacologic;Point Mutation;prevent;Procedures;Refractory;Relapse;response;senescence;Solid Neoplasm;standard of care;Structural defect;Surface;System;targeted treatment;Temperature;temperature sensitive mutant;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Effect;Therapeutic Uses;Thermogenesis;TP53 gene;translational potential;Treatment Efficacy;tumor;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;tumor xenograft;Variant;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure,Anti-tumor potential of temperature-sensitive p53 mutants,260356,MCT1,Mechanisms of Cancer Therapeutics - 1 Study Section[MCT1],NA,NA,4,250659,171701,422360,NA
