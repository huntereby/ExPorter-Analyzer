The clinical use of today’s FDA-approved L-asparaginases is complicated by life-threatening toxicities that result from the immunogenicity of these bacterial enzyme drugs and their L-glutaminase co-activity. Toxicity often severely limits their use in adult patients, whose cure rate is therefore significantly lower. Here we will perform IND-enabling studies of a novel L-asparaginase that is of mammalian origin (thereby reducing the immunogenicity of the drug) and that is totally devoid of the L-glutaminase co-activity (thereby reducing toxicity that arises from glutamine depletion). The safer L-asparaginase developed by this work will not only impact ALL treatment, but in addition will provide a new therapeutic and much needed option to additional hematological cancers (e.g. AML) and solid tumors (e.g. pancreatic) for which efficacy of this drug is expected based on pre-clinical studies.",6167160 (contact),"LAVIE, ARNON  (contact)",NA,2019-04-01,2024-09-30,acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell;Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia;Acute Myelocytic Leukemia;Address;Adult;Adult Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia;Affect;Amino Acids;anti-cancer;Antineoplastic Agents;Apoptosis;asparaginase;Asparagine;Biological;Blood;C-terminal;Cancer Patient;Canis familiaris;Catalytic Domain;Cavia;cell killing;Cells;Childhood Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia;Circulation;Clinic;Clinical;clinical efficacy;Data;Disease;Dose;drug action;drug development;drug efficacy;Drug Kinetics;Drug usage;Enzymes;Escherichia coli;Exhibits;experimental study;FDA approved;Glutaminase;Glutamine;Goals;Hematologic Neoplasms;Homologous Gene;Human;humanized mouse;Hydrolysis;Immune system;immunogenic;immunogenicity;improved;in vivo;Investigational Drugs;Investigational New Drug Application;Kinetics;Lead;Legal patent;leukemia treatment;Leukocytes;Life;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Malignant Neoplasms;mortality;mouse model;Mus;neoplastic cell;novel;novel therapeutics;Pancreas;pancreatic cancer patients;patient population;Patients;Pectobacterium chrysanthemi;Pegaspargase;Pharmaceutical Preparations;pharmacologic;pre-clinical;preclinical efficacy;preclinical study;preclinical toxicity;prevent;Prognosis;Property;Protocols documentation;Publishing;Rattus;Reaction;reconstitution;Reporting;Risk;Safety;Side;side effect;Site;Solid;Solid Neoplasm;Source;standard of care;Structure;success;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Toxic effect;Toxicology;Variant;Work,Pharmacological and toxicological testing of a novel L-asparaginase,4589,ZRD1,ZRD1-HEMA-M(01)1,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA

Initially, myocardial and cellular remodeling serve to compensate for decreased systolic function by maintaining stroke volume and systemic perfusion. However, progressive remodeling can become injurious leading to further myocyte loss and decompensation. One pivotal factor that determines the degree to which remodeling occurs is the constitutive properties of the focal scar. Data suggest that there is a direct relationship between replacement scar stiffness and subsequent ventricular remodeling. Therefore, to improve outcomes for Veterans who suffer myocardial ischemia and infarction it is critical and necessary to define the cellular, molecular and biomechanical processes that govern and determine myocardial scar physical properties.

However, despite these advances, bacteria-related infections remain a serious public health concern. Approximately 35,000 patients die every year in the United States alone. With the rare properties to both kill bacteria and potentially neutralize endotoxins in addition to overcoming common bacterial drug resistance mechanisms, AMP-based cationic peptide antibiotics (PAX) with properly optimized structures for systemic efficacy would constitute an effective therapeutic option for the treatment of MDR-related infections. We propose that PAX optimization can effectively overcome changes in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or lipid A (a submolecular component of LPS) that confer resistance to AMPs, including bacterial resistance to the membrane-active cyclic lipopeptide colistin used as a drug of last resort against MDR gram-negative bacteria (GNB). Elucidating the molecular determinants for iterative PAX design will inform PAX optimization to overcome bacterial resistance.

We will test this hypothesis using a rigorous experimental design in a phase II, randomized clinical trial to evaluate the bioavailability, safety, effectiveness and mechanism by which GTC prevents clinical progression of disease in men on AS for PCa.

Accordingly, there is a dire need for new therapeutic strategies to treat DHL and DEL and, using a novel cell-based platform and unbiased screening approaches, we discovered that these lymphomas have a unique transcriptional landscape that relies on protein kinases called CDK7 and CDK9 that are necessary to sustain the expression of genes in these lymphomas that control B-cell fate or that function as oncoproteins, including MYC. The proposed studies will define the role and mechanism by which CDK7 and CDK9 sustain DHL growth, survival and tumorigenicity, and will pre-clinically validate a therapeutic strategy that combines drugs that disable CDK7, CDK9 and BCL2 as a new therapeutic approach to treat DHL and DEL patients.",1877243 (contact),"CLEVELAND, JOHN L.

Despite advances in therapeutic options, optimizing glycemic control still remains an elusive goal. Since excessive glucose production is the main source of increased glucose levels in T2D, understanding mechanisms that regulate glucose production would have important therapeutic implications. Our recent data suggest that the brain exerts important restraining effects on the liver’s glucose production, but that elevated fatty acid levels in T2D impair this regulation. Using studies in both humans and rats, we hope to clearly elucidate the impact of fatty acids on the cells in the brain that control glucose production.

A challenge in treating CDI is the production of spores that germinate to vegetative cells, which cause the infection. Recurrence of infection occurs in 25% of patients. There are no antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent CDI. CDI is the deadliest of the five bacterial urgent threats. Understanding the process of spore germination is key to elucidating the basis for recurrent CDI. If spore germination could be prevented, the nefarious cycles of CDI can be interrupted. We disclose the discovery of a new class of antibiotics (the oxadiazoles) that kill C. difficile in the growing phase (vegetative cells). We also have found that certain oxadiazoles also inhibit spore germination.

We have recently identified a specific subpopulation of neurons in a region called the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH). These specific neurons control WAT function, while WAT controls the activity of those neurons. The strength of this interesting feedback loop wanes over time, but why and how this feedback loop wanes over time remains unknown. In this research proposal, we will address this question and analyze how the functions of the DMH neurons and WAT deteriorate.

PTSD is a frequent comorbidity in this population, with almost 35% of mTBI exposed Veterans reporting qualifying symptoms associated with their service in theater. The presenting symptomatology of PTSD (i.e., emotion dysregulation and cognitive deficits) may have an underlying basis in the biomechanical disruption by TBI of brain regions underlying emotional processing and memory. This same disruption may interfere with effective treatment. Animal models are necessary in order to unravel the effect of TBI on the brain circuitry underlying PTSD.

SCI typically results in loss of bowel function. The standard of care for individuals with neurogenic bowel dysfunction involves the implementation of a bowel program for predictable, effective elimination of the bowels. The bowel routine can require over an hour to evacuate the bowels and this process typically requires the assistance of a caregiver, which adds to the cost of care and reduces independence. Restoring bowel function is considered a high priority by individuals with SCI, but remains a critically unmet need requiring further development (Anderson 2004).

This project will also examine the extent to which improvements in insomnia are associated with longer-term functional benefits. If CBT-I delivered in line with these guidelines is effective, the guidelines can be integrated into the existing national VA CBT-I trainings, manual, and online treatments to enhance the rehabilitation of this highly affected yet underserved Veteran population.",12225526 (contact),"KLINGAMAN, ELIZABETH A (contact)",NA,2021-06-01,2026-05-31,"Acceleration;actigraphy;active control;Address;Affect;Aftercare;Area;Behavioral;Caring;Chronic;Chronic Insomnia;Cladribine;Clinical;clinical practice;Cognitive;cognitive function;cognitive recovery;Cognitive Therapy;Complex;Consensus;cost;daily functioning;Data;Development;disability;Distress;Effectiveness;efficacy evaluation;Emotional;emotional functioning;evidence base;experience;Feedback;follow up assessment;follow-up;Functional impairment;functional improvement;functional outcomes;Funding;Guidelines;handbook;health related quality of life;Health Services Accessibility;Health Surveys;Healthcare;Healthcare Systems;Impairment;improved;improved outcome;improvement on sleep;indexing;Inequity;Internet;Intervention;Letters;lifetime risk;Manuals;Maryland;Mediating;Mediation;Medical;Medical center;Mental disorders;Mental Health;Mental Health Services;Methods;military veteran;Modeling;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Participant;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Philadelphia;physical conditioning;Population;primary outcome;Process;Provider;psychiatric symptom;Psychoses;psychosocial;Psychotherapy;Psychotic Disorders;psychotic symptoms;Quality of life;Randomized, Controlled Trials;Recovery;Recovery of Function;Rehabilitation therapy;Reporting;Research;Research Priority;Research Support;Resolution;Resources;secondary outcome;severe mental illness;Severities;Severity of illness;side effect;Site;Sleep;Sleep disturbances;Sleeplessness;Social Functioning;standard care;standard of care;Suicide attempt;Symptoms;System;Testing;Training;Translating;treatment effect;trial comparing;Veterans;Veterans Health Administration;Visit;Work;World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule;Wrist",Cognitive Behavioral Therapy For Insomnia (CBT-I) to Improve Functional Outcomes in Veterans with Psychosis,3213,RRDE,Behavioral Health & Social Reintegration[RRDE],NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA

The only option physicians have to slow progression of DPN is glycemic control but in type 2 diabetes, the most prevalent form in the veteran population, good glycemic control is ineffective. There is a desperate need for an effective treatment. Our pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that increasing the dietary intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), commonly found in fish oil, slows the progression of DPN and induces nerve repair through reducing inflammatory stress and increasing the production of resolvins, neuroprotectin and maresins, metabolites of the omega-3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and/or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).

Suicide prevention is a top priority for VA as we continue to seek new and inventive ways to reduce suicide rates among Veterans. Many experts agree that suicide prevention efforts could be improved by making suicide-specific interventions easier to access. The current project aims to move toward that goal by testing a web-based suicide prevention intervention using an experimental design. The 30-minute intervention aims to teach Veterans coping skills that are designed to ease the emotional distress that often comes with thoughts of suicide. The project will evaluate whether Veterans report more improvement in suicidal ideation severity when this intervention is added to their normal course of treatment.

The established premise that DR is only a microvascular disease, as clinically defined, has been challenged in recent years by evidence that retinal neurons undergo changes in function and structure prior to the vascular pathology. A fundamental gap in our knowledge of DR pathology is whether neuronal dysfunction is associated with or causal to the late stage vascular defects. The proposed experiments in Veterans with diabetes are designed to elucidate if neuronal defects precede vascular defects in DR and if treating neuronal deficits with levodopa early in DR will prevent the late-stage vascular defects that result in vision loss.

Although risk factors contributing to these disparities have been broadly studied, we have only a superficial understanding of how these factors “get under the skin” to influence biological processes that shape key developmental outcomes like language and cognition. The goal of this proposal is to integrate approaches from the biological and psychological sciences to understand SES disparities in language and cognitive development. Using state-of-the-art methods from across the social and biological sciences, we investigate the contributions of adverse gestational environments and postnatal caregiving environments to SES disparities in language and cognition in the infant-toddler period and at age 5.

A better understanding of neuron-satellite glia interactions is critical for a fundamental knowledge of the normal sympathetic nervous system, and will guide new treatments for devastating disorders linked to sympathetic dysfunction such as chronic heart failure and hypertension.",8350556 (contact),"KURUVILLA, REJJI  (contact)","TYLER, WILLIAM A",2023-07-01,2028-06-30,Ablation;Address;Adhesives;Axon;BAX gene;Biochemical;Biochemistry;Brain;Candidate Disease Gene;Cell Communication;Cell Physiology;cell type;Cell-Cell Adhesion;Cellular biology;Cellular Morphology;chronic pain;Coculture Techniques;Communication;conditional knockout;Congestive Heart Failure;Cues;Defect;defined contribution;Dendrites;Dependence;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Disease;EGF gene;Environment;fighting;Functional disorder;Ganglia;Genetic;glial cell development;Glial Cell Proliferation;Goals;Growth;Heart failure;Homeostasis;Human;Hypertension;Image;In Vitro;in vivo;Individual;Insulin Resistance;Integral Membrane Protein;Knockout Mice;Knowledge;Link;Mediating;Membrane Proteins;Modeling;Molecular;Morphogenesis;Morphology;mouse genetics;mouse model;Mus;Muscle satellite cell;Mutant Strains Mice;Nerve Regeneration;nerve supply;Nervous System;neural circuit;Neuroglia;neuron development;neuron loss;neuronal cell body;neuronal survival;Neurons;neurotrophic factor;Neurotrophic Tyrosine Kinase Receptor Type 1;NGFR Protein;notch protein;Organ;Output;Parkinson Disease;Pathway interactions;Peripheral;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;Physiology;prevent;Process;receptor;receptor binding;Reporting;Research;response;Role;Signal Transduction;single cell sequencing;single-cell RNA sequencing;Structure;Sympathetic Ganglia;Sympathetic Nervous System;Synapses;Synaptic Transmission;System;Testing;Tissues;Work,Neuron-satellite glia interactions in the sympathetic nervous system,133423,NDPR,"Neurodifferentiation, Plasticity, Regeneration and Rhythmicity Study Section[NDPR]",NA,NA,2,339706,210205,549911,NA

Additional studies have shown that PARP inhibitors, a recently developed class of drugs that extend relapse-free and overall survival when administered to ovarian cancer (OC) patients as maintenance therapy after initial chemotherapy and surgery, increase the already high rate of tMNs in OC patients. These tMNs typically have mutations in the TP53 gene that make them relatively insensitive to conventional anti- leukemic treatments. Building on preliminary studies showing that a class of targeted agents called replication checkpoint modulators is active against TP53-mutant AML, we now propose to i) study the underlying mechanism by which replication checkpoint modulators kill TP53-mutant AML and ii) assess the activity of replication checkpoint modulators against tMNs isolated from OC patients.
