Telomeres do this by controlling the number of times each cell can divide. Once a cell becomes damaged or acquires a potentially harmful mutation, telomeres signal to other proteins that elicit a permanent cessation of cell division. This prevents the development of cancer. However, mutations can bypass this arrest in cell division and re-initiate cellular division. These cells must also re-activate a mechanism that ensures that telomeres once again maintain the structural integrity of chromosomes but are no longer capable of blocking cell division. This is achieved by activating one of two different telomere maintenance mechanisms. One of these mechanisms is known as alternative lengthening of telomeres, or simply ALT. Cancers that rely on ALT tend to be among the most aggressive and patients often have a poor prognosis. Therefore, understanding the molecular basis for the activation and maintenance of the ALT pathway and identifying the key regulators of ALT is critically important for improving the detection and treatment of this devastating disease. We have identified an essential mediator of ALT telomere maintenance named HIRA. We show that deletion of HIRA or attenuating its function is capable of killing cancer cells that rely on ALT. Developing a greater understanding of the molecular function of HIRA and evaluating its potential as a cancer therapy target is the focus of our study.",12451195 (contact),"O'SULLIVAN, RODERICK  (contact)","WITKIN, KEREN L",2022-06-23,2027-04-30,Acute;Adopted;ADP ribosylation;Affect;ATRX gene;Automobile Driving;Bypass;cancer cell;Cell Cycle;Cell division;Cells;Cessation of life;Chromatin;Chromatin Modeling;chromatin remodeling;Chromatin Remodeling Factor;Chromosomes;Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease;Compensation;Complex;cytotoxicity;Data;DAXX gene;Dedications;Deposition;Detection;Development;Disease;Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm;DNA Damage;DNA Sequence Alteration;Enhancers;Ensure;Epigenetic Process;epigenome;epithelial to mesenchymal transition;Event;Exhibits;G2 Phase;gain of function;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;genome integrity;Genomic approach;genomic locus;Glioma;Histone H3.3;histone modification;improved;innovation;loss of function mutation;Maintenance;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Mediator;Metabolic;Microscopy;Missense Mutation;Modeling;Molecular;Mutation;Names;Nucleosomes;Patients;prevent;Prognosis;promoter;Property;Proteins;Proteomics;public health relevance;reconstitution;recruit;Recurrence;Regulation;repaired;Reporting;response;Role;Signal Transduction;Stress;Structure;targeted cancer therapy;telomere;Telomere Maintenance;Telomere Pathway;therapeutic target;trait;tumor;tumorigenesis;ultra high resolution,Co-Regulation of Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres and Chromatin Dynamics in ATRX-DAXX deficient cancer cells,262316,CE,Cancer Etiology Study Section[CE],NA,NA,3,283699,156682,440381,NA

Previous work focused on podocyte actin cytoskeleton in the Glomerulus. Our recent work established a novel function for Myh9&10 proteins in cargo transport in the thick ascending limb (TAL) epithelium, and loss of this function in mice resulted in rapidly progressing kidney disease.

Based on our novel data this proposal will explore the hypothesis that EMT requires the generation of specific modified ribosomes that translate EMT-driven mRNAs that fuels metastasis. We propose that EMT-specific ribosomes are manufactured by (i) activation of ribosome genes by a Pol I-Snail transcriptional complex and (ii) Snail promotes binding of METTL5 on de novo synthesized rRNA enabling rRNA specific m6A modifications before its incorporation into the ribosome. By forming a complex with METTL3 Snail also directs m6A modifications of selective mRNA enabling recruitment of the non-canonical DAP5/eIF3d/METTL3 translation complex to drive selective m6A marked mRNA translation in the mesenchymal state.,12269520 (contact),"VINCENT, CLARA THERESA (contact)","MERCER, NATALIA",2022-06-01,2027-05-31,Aftercare;Animal Model;Applications Grants;Binding;Binding Sites;Biogenesis;Biopsy;Blood Vessels;Breast Cancer Cell;Breast Cancer cell line;breast cancer metastasis;cancer cell;cell motility;Cells;Chemoresistance;ChIP-seq;Clinical Treatment;Complex;Data;Development;Disease;Disease Progression;Distant;DNA Polymerase I;DNA Polymerase II;Drug Targeting;effective therapy;Epithelial Cells;epithelial to mesenchymal transition;Epithelium;G1 Phase;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Regulation;Generations;Genes;Genetic Transcription;genome-wide;Human;infectious disease treatment;Investigation;Knowledge;Link;Malignant Breast Neoplasm;manufacture;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Mediating;Mesenchymal;Messenger RNA;Metastatic breast cancer;methylome;Methyltransferase;Modification;Molecular;molecular marker;mRNA Translation;Mus;Neoplasm Metastasis;neoplastic cell;novel;novel therapeutics;Nuclear;Organ;overexpression;Paraffin Embedding;Patients;Peptide Initiation Factors;Physiological;Play;Positioning Attribute;power analysis;prevent;Primary Neoplasm;Process;programs;Property;recruit;Recurrence;Research;Ribosomal DNA;Ribosomal RNA;Ribosomes;RNA Polymerase I;Role;Signal Transduction;Snails;Stimulus;Therapeutic;therapeutic target;transcription factor;Transcriptional Regulation;Transforming Growth Factor beta;Translating;Translational Regulation;Translations;triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma;tumor;tumor progression;vector,Translation regulation of the mesenchymal transition by the rRNA and mRNA m6A axis,270241,CAMP,Cancer Molecular Pathobiology Study Section[CAMP],NA,NA,3,238718,165908,404626,NA

This project addresses issues of critical importance to management of vector-borne disease (VBD) in the United States, including those caused by viruses transmitted by mosquitoes (West Nile) as well as tick-borne pathogens like Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme Disease). Because the upper Midwest is a national hotspot for Lyme Disease and other tick-borne diseases and is notable for endemic transmission and periodic epidemics of West Nile and Eastern Equine Encephalitis viral diseases, we believe the Midwest Center of Excellence for Vector-borne Disease (MCE-VBD) is ideally positioned to address these challenges. The Center is a truly regional organization covering Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, and Iowa. Center activities will focus the efforts of a formidable group of nationally recognized public health entomologists, epidemiologists, public health experts, and public and private vector control leaders to improve prevention and control practices. The goals include testing and improving existing methods of mosquito and tick management and bite prevention, evaluating new products and methods, supporting the training of the next generation of medical/public health entomologists, and enhancing a strong community of practice. Our efforts will engage academics, public health partners, public vector control agencies, and private pest control operators.

We will determine the role of GABAergic inhibitory circuits in the gustatory cortex (GC) in the postnatal development of taste preference. GC is required for taste-motivated behaviors and for learning about the chemosensory and affective dimensions of tastants, but no study to date has investigate the role of gustatory experience on the maturation of this important circuit.

To address this problem, we seek to establish a vast collection of induced pluripotent stem cells from children with sepsis, which can be used to better understand disease mechanisms and improve patient health outcomes.",77918005 (contact);15215711;2200444,"ATREYA, MIHIR R (contact);LAUTZ, ANDREW JOHN;ZINGARELLI, BASILIA","ZHAO, XIAOLI",2023-05-04,2025-04-30,Acceleration;Acute;Address;advanced disease;age related;Antibiotics;Benchmarking;biobank;Bioinformatics;biological heterogeneity;Biological Markers;Biology;Body System;Caring;CD34 gene;Cell Line;Cell Therapy;cell type;Cells;Child;Clinical Data;Clinical Trials;Collecting Cell;Collection;Communities;Complex;Core Facility;Coupled;Critically ill children;Cryopreservation;Databases;Dedications;Development;differentiation protocol;Disease;disease model;disease phenotype;Drug Screening;Endothelial Cells;Enrollment;epigenomics;experience;experimental study;Exposure to;Faculty;Failure;Funding;gene environment interaction;Generations;genome editing;Goals;Health;Heterogeneity;Human;human induced pluripotent stem cells;Immune response;improved;improved outcome;in vitro Model;in vivo;Individual;induced pluripotent stem cell;induced pluripotent stem cell technology;Infection;Infrastructure;Institution;Leadership;Leukocytes;Life;Malignant Neoplasms;Modeling;Molecular Target;monocyte;mortality risk;multiple omics;National Institute of General Medical Sciences;next generation;novel;Organ;Organoids;Outcome;participant enrollment;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells;Patient Recruitments;patient response;Patients;Pediatric cohort;pediatric patients;pediatric sepsis;Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Phased Innovation Awards;Phenotype;pluripotency;Pluripotent Stem Cells;precision medicine;Precision therapeutics;prevent;Process;Protocols documentation;PTPRC gene;Research;Research Personnel;response;Risk;risk stratification;RNA;Role;Sampling;scale up;Scientific Advances and Accomplishments;Scientific Inquiry;Sepsis;septic;Septic Shock;Serum;single cell genomics;Source;Standardization;Therapeutic;transcriptomics;Whole Blood;XCL1 gene,Establishment of a multi-center biobank of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells for pediatric sepsis research,150093,EDIT,"Etiology, Diagnostic, Intervention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases Study Section[EDIT]",NA,NA,2,134397,81310,215707,NA

Non- coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are powerful regulators of coding and non-coding gene expression, critical for maintaining homeostasis, resisting cellular stresses, and preventing disease processes. Here we systematically identify ncRNAs that regulates the resilience in AD using comparative transcriptomic analysis, explore the regulatory mechanisms these ncRNAs in neural cells, and validate their protective roles using advanced three-dimensional human neural cell culture models of AD.

This project addresses these important obstacles to evidence-based obesity care by providing accurate, patient-specific estimates of benefits and risks of various obesity treatment options to inform shared decision making about obesity treatment. In this project we implement a scalable, web-based point-of-care decision-support intervention in primary care that provides patient-specific estimates of obesity treatment benefits and risks in a randomized trial in 40 primary care clinics with 15,814 eligible patients, and assess intervention impact on (i) appropriate active management of obesity in eligible patients, (ii) weight trajectories, and (iii) patient and clinician satisfaction with the decision support intervention.",2256476 (contact),"O'CONNOR, PATRICK J (contact)","UNALP-ARIDA, AYNUR",2021-05-01,2026-04-30,Address;Adopted;Adult;adult obesity;Affect;Age;American;Arthritis;bariatric surgery;Behavior Therapy;Benefits and Risks;blood glucose regulation;Body mass index;Body Weight decreased;care delivery;Caring;Clinic;Clinical;clinical care;clinical decision support;Clinical Decision Support Systems;clinical encounter;Cluster randomized trial;Communication;Data Reporting;Decision Support Model;design;diabetes management;Diabetes Mellitus;Disease;effective therapy;Effectiveness;Electronic Health Record;electronic medical record system;Eligibility Determination;Equation;Evaluation;evidence base;FDA approved;Health;Health Information System;high risk;Hypertension;improved;indexing;innovation;Intervention;Investments;Life Style;lifestyle intervention;Link;Metabolic;Morbid Obesity;Myocardial Infarction;neglect;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;obese patients;Obesity;obesity management;obesity treatment;Online Systems;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Outpatients;Patient Care;patient oriented;Patients;Performance;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacologic Substance;Pharmacotherapy;point of care;predictive modeling;Prevalence;Primary Care;primary care clinic;primary care clinician;primary outcome;Privatization;Randomized;randomized trial;Regimen;Reporting;Sampling;satisfaction;sex;shared decision making;Sleep Apnea Syndromes;Stroke;Suggestion;Surveys;Time;Translating;treatment as usual;Update;Visit;Weight;Weight maintenance regimen;Work,Reducing Clinical Inertia in Obesity Management of Diabetes in Primary Care: Cluster-Randomized Trial,128281,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-HDM-E(09)],NA,NA,4,391760,223303,615063,NA

In this proposal, we will use cord blood-humanized (and non-humanized) mouse models and a novel cell culture system to define mechanisms by which stringent latent EBV infection collaborates with activated oncogenes, inhibited tumor suppressors, and growth signals derived from the tumor microenvironment to drive BL and HL lymphomas.",1860327 (contact),"KENNEY, SHANNON CELESTE (contact)","DASCHNER, PHILLIP J",2023-07-01,2028-06-30,Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome;AIDS-Related Lymphoma;Apoptotic;B-Cell Antigen Receptor;B-Lymphocytes;BCL6 gene;Blood Cells;Burkitt Lymphoma;CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes;Cell Culture System;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Line;Cells;Collaborations;cyclin D3;EBNA2 protein;Epstein-Barr Virus Infections;Epstein-Barr Virus latency;Epstein-Barr Virus-Related Lymphoma;Gene Mutation;Growth;Growth Factor;HIV Infections;Hodgkin Disease;Human;Human Herpesvirus 4;humanized mouse;Immunocompromised Host;immunogenic;In Vitro;in vitro Model;in vivo;in vivo Model;Induction of Apoptosis;infected B cell;interleukin-21;large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma;LMP1;Lymphocyte;Lymphoma;matrigel;MicroRNAs;Modeling;mouse model;Mus;mutant;Mutation;MYC gene;NF-kappa B;notch protein;novel;Oncogene Activation;Oncogenes;Oncogenic;overexpression;Pathway interactions;Patients;plasma cell differentiation;PRDM1 gene;Pre-Clinical Model;Prevention;Proteins;public health relevance;Retroviridae;Role;Signal Transduction;small hairpin RNA;Small Nuclear RNA;stable cell line;STAT3 gene;Structure of germinal center of lymph node;synergism;TNFRSF5 gene;TNFSF5 gene;transcription factor;transforming virus;tumor;tumor microenvironment;Tumor Suppressor Genes;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;Umbilical Cord Blood;Viral;Viral Proteins;Virus;Virus Latency,Stringent Latent Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Infection Collaborates with Cellular Gene Alterations to Induce EBV+ Lymphomas,281379,HCAC,HIV Coinfections and HIV Associated Cancers Study Section[HCAC],NA,NA,2,261194,144963,406157,NA
