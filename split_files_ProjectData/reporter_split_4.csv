Specifically, we will explore whether NE can be taken up by neurons to augment via paradigm-shifting intracellular signaling the phosphorylation of glutamate receptors (AMPARs) and thereby their postsynaptic accumulation and synaptic strength. We will characterize activation of the Ca2+ channel CaV1.2 upon stimulation of AMPAR activity by NE at postsynaptic sites, with CaV1.2 and AMPARs being major targets for NE in the brain. Aberrant functioning of NE signaling, of glutamate receptors, and of CaV1.2 are implicated in neurological and mental diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, posttraumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, and ADHD. Defining new molecular aspects of NE signaling will identify important new drug targets for treatment of these diseases.

However, many Veterans with OUD are not engaged in care (e.g., do not receive available treatment or discontinue treatment prematurely). Providing patient-centered care, or care that is specific to patient preferences, needs, and values of each Veteran, can improve engagement in care, but the extent to which this occurs in VA is not known. VA is committed to delivering patient-centered care. Key to fulfilling that commitment is Veteran patients’ involvement in defining how care should be delivered to meet their needs and in developing appropriate measures of patient-centered care to provide meaningful feedback to OUD clinicians and improve clinical performance.

We propose that it is an active cross talk and cellular signaling between dysregulation of both Fe and Ca that leads to myocardial contractile failure, ischemia reperfusion injury and ultimately cardiomyopathy (CM). We will identify triggers and signaling pathways that are involved in the observed systolic and diastolic dysfunction and ferroptosis associated with iron induced CM and Duchenne muscular dystrophy associated CM.

Therefore, drugs that are capable of suppressing DNA repair responses of cancer cells will have promising therapeutic outcomes. This study proposes to develop a novel inhibitor that is derived from a FDA approved anti-depressant, which will suppress breast cancer growth and metastasis by inhibiting key proteins such as FOXM1, which are involved in DNA repair pathway. Furthermore, this inhibitor has potential to enhance the efficacy of the current chemotherapy drugs and prolong survival of breast cancer patients.",7788508 (contact);6880185,"RAO, MANJEET KUMAR (contact);VADLAMUDI, RATNA K","AGYIN, JOSEPH KOFI",2019-12-15,2025-11-30,aggressive breast cancer;analog;anti-depressive agents;Anti-estrogen Therapy;Binding;Biochemical;Biological Assay;Biophysics;BRCA1 gene;Breast Cancer Patient;breast cancer progression;breast cancer survival;cancer addiction;cancer cell;Cancer Center;Cancer Patient;cancer subtypes;Cell model;Cells;chemotherapy;Chemotherapy and/or radiation;Clinic;Clinical;clinical development;Confocal Microscopy;coping;Defect;Distant Metastasis;DNA;DNA biosynthesis;DNA Damage;DNA Repair;DNA Repair Gene;DNA Repair Pathway;drug development;Endocrine;Estrogen receptor positive;Excision Repair;FDA approved;Feedback;FOXM1 gene;Funding;Future;Genes;genotoxicity;Goals;Growth;homologous recombination;hormone therapy;Human;humanized mouse;Imipramine;Immune;Immunofluorescence Immunologic;improved;inhibitor;innovation;knock-down;Legal patent;Lesion;Malignant Breast Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Modeling;Molecular Biology;Mutation;Neoplasm Metastasis;Nodal;Nonhomologous DNA End Joining;Normal Cell;novel;novel therapeutics;Oncogenic;Outcome;overexpression;Pathway interactions;patient derived xenograft model;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics;Phase I Clinical Trials;Play;Positioning Attribute;Predisposing Factor;Privatization;programs;Proliferating;Proteins;Regimen;Relapse;repaired;Reporting;Resistance;response;Role;safety testing;Signal Transduction;Structure;Tamoxifen;targeted treatment;Testing;Therapeutic;therapeutic evaluation;therapeutic target;therapy development;therapy outcome;therapy resistant;Toxic effect;Translating;translational potential;treatment response;triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma;tumor;tumor xenograft;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure,FoXM1 inhibition: a novel therapeutic avenue to treat breast cancers,239227,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-MCT2-C(01)S],NA,NA,5,265202,112619,377821,NA

We previously showed that Diacylglycerol kinase-α (DGKα) is a potential therapeutic target for GBM, with DGKα inhibition having the exciting potential to directly attack cancer cells but possibly also boost the anti-tumor immune response. More recently we showed that the abandoned drug ritanserin could be repurposed as a DGKα inhibitor, potentially accelerating the clinical development of this strategy. Ritanserin has shown greater promise in combination with other agents. Our newest results show that intermittent dosing of ritanserin—with a low dose every two to three days—is extremely effective in a mouse model of GBM with an intact immune system. We have also found a potential new mechanism of DGKα inhibition in the immune system. This proposal will test the effects of DGKα inhibition on these immune cells, as well as following up on the mechanisms and activity of intermittent low dosing of DGKα inhibitors, alone and combined with other agents, in treating GBM in mouse models.

Our work will address two key knowledge gaps on this topic. First, while low-value services are common, it is not clear why Veterans receive them. We will test whether the Choice/MISSION Act reforms, which increased Veterans’ access to non-VA clinicians, increased Veterans’ risk of receiving low- value services. Second, we lack high-quality evidence on what constitutes low-value care as well as what strategies are effective for translating evidence into clinical decision-making.

Both genetic and environmental triggers are linked to disease pathogenesis and progression. Mutations of the epithelial cell-specific gene encoding for the surfactant protein-C (SP-C) are linked to clinical PF. To longitudinally examine endpoints relevant to PF, we developed a novel murine model that leverages the most common human mutation in the SP-C gene. The ubiquitous air pollutant ozone (O3) represents a major environmental contributor to disease exacerbation in vulnerable populations, including PF. Monocytes and macrophages are centrally involved in ozone toxicity and represent a predictor in PF severity. This project aims to functionally link monocyte/macrophage populations as central players in the exacerbation of PF resulting from ozone exposure of the SP-C mutant mice. Ultimately, we hope to identify a unique subset of monocyte- derived cells responsible for tissue damage, and thus develop a cell specific approach to improve health of PF patients.",14957889 (contact),"VENOSA, ALESSANDRO  (contact)","SITAULA, SADICHHA",2021-02-01,2025-11-30,Acceleration;Acute;Air Pollutants;Bleomycin;Cells;Cessation of life;Chemical Injury;chemokine receptor;Clinical;clinically relevant;cytokine;Data;Degenerative Disorder;Dependence;Diagnosis;Disease;Ectopic Expression;effective therapy;Environmental Exposure;Environmental Risk Factor;Epidemiology;Epithelial Cells;Epithelium;fibrogenesis;Fibrosis;fibrotic lung;Flow Cytometry;fractalkine receptor;Future;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Heterogeneity;Histologic;Histology;Human;improved;Infiltration;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Response;Inhalation;injured;Injury;Lesion;Life Expectancy;Link;Lung;Lung Diseases;lung health;Lung Transplantation;Macrophage;Mediator;Methods;Modeling;monocyte;mouse model;mutant;Mutant Strains Mice;Mutation;Myeloid Cell Activation;Myeloid Cells;novel;Oxidative Stress;Ozone;ozone exposure;Pathogenesis;Patients;Peripheral;pharmacologic;Phenotype;Population;Pre-Clinical Model;Predisposition;Property;Publishing;Pulmonary Fibrosis;Pulmonary Inflammation;Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein C;recruit;response;Role;Severities;Signal Transduction;single-cell RNA sequencing;Sorting;System;Testing;Time;Tissues;Toxic effect;Toxic Environmental Substances;transcriptome sequencing;ventilation;Vulnerable Populations;Work,Role of Surfactant Protein-C Mutation and Ozone Exposure in the Exacerbation of Pulmonary Fibrosis,32553,ZES1,ZES1-LAT-D(R1),NA,NA,4,249260,130862,380122,NA

However, many patients at high-risk for CVD do not accept or adhere to statins. This gap in patient’s use of statins limits the full impact of these effective medications resulting in higher cholesterol levels and CVD risk. The main barriers to using statins are patients’ perceived lack of benefit, excess risk of statin toxicity as well as their misperceptions of their CVD risk. Statin pharmacogenomic testing – an application of precision medicine – is a readily available, feasible, and inexpensive intervention that addresses this barrier by using genetic testing to identify the nearly 1 out of 2 patients with enhanced benefit and/or reduced risk of statin toxicity or increased risk for CVD. By communicating statin pharmacogenomic test results to Veterans at high- risk for CVD not taking statin therapy, we aim to improve patients’ perceptions of their risk of CVD and statins and, in turn, their acceptance of and adherence to statins to reduce their cholesterol levels and CVD risk.",9566608;9543513 (contact),"BRAVATA, DAWN MARIE;VOORA, DEEPAK  (contact)",NA,2024-08-01,2028-07-31,"Address;Adherence;Affect;Appointment;Atherosclerosis;atherosclerosis risk;Belief;Benefits and Risks;budget impact;Cardiology;Cardiovascular Diseases;cardiovascular disorder risk;cardiovascular risk factor;Cholesterol;cholesterol control;Clinical;clinically significant;Communication;contextual factors;cost effective;cost effectiveness;cost estimate;Data;data warehouse;Disclosure;Disease;Dissemination and Implementation;Dose;Economic Factors;Economic Models;Education;Effectiveness;Electronic Health Record;electronic medical record tool;Eligibility Determination;Enrollment;Ensure;experience;future implementation;Genetic Risk;genetic testing;genetic variant;Genomic medicine;Genomics;Goals;Guidelines;Health;health belief;Health Care Costs;Health system;Healthcare;high risk;implementation determinants;implementation evaluation;improved;Infrastructure;innovation;Intervention;intervention cost;intervention delivery;Laboratories;LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins;Measures;Mediator;Methodology;Modeling;Musculoskeletal;Outcome;Participant;Patient Preferences;Patients;Perception;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacogenomics;Pharmacy facility;precision medicine;prevent;Prevention;Primary Care;primary care patient;primary care practice;primary care provider;primary outcome;Process;programs;Protocols documentation;Provider;Quality of Care;Randomized;randomized trial;Randomized, Controlled Trials;Recommendation;Reporting;Research;Research Priority;Risk;risk perception;Safety;secondary outcome;shared decision making;side effect;Test Result;Testing;tool;Toxic effect;Translating;Treatment Effectiveness;uptake;Veterans;Work",Reducing Veterans' Risk of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Through Pharmacogenomics Informed Statin Prescribing,3477,HSR1,HSR-1 Health Care and Clinical Management[HSR1],NA,A3,1,NA,NA,NA,NA

In probing ways to mitigate NAFLD and its harmful consequences, which are rising at an alarming rate in the U.S., we have built on intriguing findings from our lab showing that a protein, IRE1alpha (IRE1a), in a specific class of immune cells called myeloid cells (MCs), mediates activation of a powerful inflammatory apparatus, called the NLRP3 inflammasome, in response to high levels of saturated fats which are often elevated in the livers of people with NAFLD. Here, using cutting-edge genetic tools to manipulate IRE1a specifically in MCs both in culture and in living mice, we aim to A) test the extent to which MC- specific IRE1a can be targeted to prevent and potentially reverse NAFLD and its consequences, and B) identify the specific region of IRE1a that saturated fats interact with in order to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is an active clinical target for treatment of obesity-associated metabolic diseases.",11400254 (contact),"BOLUS, WILLIAM REID (contact)","DENSMORE, CHRISTINE L",2022-01-01,2024-12-31,Affect;American;Apoptosis;Biomedical Research;Bolus Infusion;Caliber;Cells;Cholesterol;Chronic;Cicatrix;Clinical;comorbidity;Coupled;Cre-LoxP;cytokine;Data;design;Development;Diet;dietary;dietary excess;Disease;Elemental Diets;Elements;Endoplasmic Reticulum;endoplasmic reticulum stress;Endoribonucleases;Engineering;Environment;Enzymes;experience;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Fatty Liver;Fibrosis;Fostering;Fructose;Funding;Genetic;Goals;Grant;Health;Healthcare;Hepatic;Human;Immune;immunoregulation;improved;Incidence;Individual;Infiltration;Inflammasome;Inflammatory;innovation;Inositol;Institution;Insulin Resistance;Knowledge;Kupffer Cells;Letters;Liver;Liver Cirrhosis;Liver diseases;Liver Failure;Liver Fibrosis;liver function;liver inflammation;liver transplantation;Macrophage;Malignant neoplasm of liver;Measures;Mediating;Mediator;Membrane;Mentorship;Metabolic Diseases;Metabolic dysfunction;Modernization;Molecular;monocyte;mouse model;Mus;Myelogenous;Myeloid Cells;non-alcoholic fatty liver disease;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;nonalcoholic steatohepatitis;Nutrient;Obesity;obesity treatment;Pathogenesis;Pathology;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phospholipids;Population;prevent;Primary carcinoma of the liver cells;Process;Production;Proteins;Publishing;Reagent;recruit;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;response;Ribonucleases;Risk;RNA Splicing;Role;saturated fat;Saturated Fatty Acids;sensor;Severity of illness;Signal Transduction;skills;sugar;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissues;tool;Training;Type 2 diabetic;United States National Institutes of Health;verbal;Visual;western diet;Work;Writing;XBP1 gene,Myeloid-specific IRE1alpha as a mediator of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,126423,ZDK1,ZDK1-GRB-7(O1)L,NA,NA,3,83932,0,83932,NA

Our research program addresses three major questions related to the assembly of neural circuits: 1) How do transcription factors that control neuronal subtype identity coordinate the expression of axon guidance molecules that control wiring specificity? 2) What are the signaling mechanisms that allow conserved families of guidance receptors to control direction-selective axon growth and targeting? 3) How do navigating axons coordinate their responses to the diverse array of cues present during development to ensure assembly of functional circuits? Disruption of the function of many axon guidance molecules has been implicated in a number of human neuronal developmental disorders, as well as in various kinds of cancer.

Obstructive vascular disease results from changes in cells in blood vessel walls as they respond to various stresses and disease conditions, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, and genetic factors. We focus here on a protein called FAT1 that controls the production within cells of energy and biochemical ‘building blocks’ necessary for cell growth and other activities, and also affects gene expression. We believe that these different effects of FAT1 arise from fragments of the protein that are located in distinct compartments within cells. The studies we propose here are designed to understand how these FAT1 fragments control important cellular activities, and how these activities in turn affect the development of vascular obstruction.

However, few Veterans receive evidenced-based psychosocial interventions or medications to treat alcohol use disorder. Barriers to receiving these treatments include long wait times, stigma, and long distances from treatment facilities. Even fewer Veterans receive psychosocial and medication interventions together, despite clinical practice guidelines recommending both and evidence of better outcomes. Expanding access to these treatments in primary care is a VA priority but delivering psychosocial interventions is difficult in this setting, and medication is often the only option.

Approximately half are left with permanent and significant disability of their shoulder, arm, and hand, including extreme weakness and abnormal muscle activity. Thus far, rehabilitation therapy has resulted in limited gains. Efforts to use the shoulder often result in unintentional muscle contractions through the rest of the arm making functional use even more challenging, leading to a pattern of disuse. One solution is to support the shoulder and hand with a combination of two exoskeletons to compensate for the weakness and minimize these abnormal muscle contractions. Supporting the shoulder with a wearable device is novel and necessary to regain maximal range of motion and function after stroke.

These observations set the stage for our new plan of work, which aims at understanding common factors affecting residence time and function of plasma PCSK9 and how these can be exploited to develop new diagnostics or therapeutic leads.",10501089 (contact),"PAMIR, NATHALIE  (contact)","HASAN, AHMED A K",2016-09-01,2024-12-31,Acceleration;Affect;Affinity;Antibodies;Apolipoproteins B;Binding;Biological;Biology;Blocking Antibodies;cardiovascular risk factor;Cholesterol;Cholesterol Homeostasis;cholesterol trafficking;Circulation;Data;Dedications;Diagnostic tests;diagnostic tool;drug development;Event;extracellular;Generations;glycosylation;Grant;Half-Life;Hepatic;Hour;Human;hypercholesterolemia;Impairment;improved;In Vitro;inhibiting antibody;Injections;innovation;Intervention;Investigation;Kinetics;Knowledge;LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins;Length;Lipoprotein (a);Lipoproteins;Liver;Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor;Low-Density Lipoproteins;Marketing;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolic Clearance Rate;Modeling;Modification;Molecular;Monoclonal Antibodies;mouse model;Mus;Mutation;Myocardial Infarction;N-Glycosylation Site;novel;novel diagnostics;novel therapeutics;Output;Paper;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;pharmacologic;Plasma;Plasma Proteins;Play;Post-Translational Protein Processing;preservation;Production;Productivity;programs;Proprotein Convertases;Protein Degradation Induction;protein function;Proteins;Proteolysis;Regulation;Reporting;Research;residence;response;Risk Reduction;Role;Site;Solid;Subtilisins;success;System;Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies;therapeutic target;Time;Work,Functional and structural correlates of PCSK9 association with lipoproteins,132985,INMP,Integrative Nutrition and Metabolic Processes Study Section[INMP],NA,NA,8,331209,178853,510062,NA

As the Veteran population ages, the number of Veterans at risk for cognitive decline increases. Veterans are also more likely to have psychological, physical, and social conditions directly tied to their service that increase their risk for cognitive decline. Luckily, over the past two decades there has been an increased appreciation for the role of lifestyle interventions to improve brain health, with research showing that participation in consistent exercise, healthy diet, sufficient sleep, socialization, and engagement in cognitively stimulating activities can reduce dementia risk.

We will perform this by enrolling 320 Veterans from two large VA sites, 80 each of whom will be healthy, 80 will have PTSD only, 80 with cirrhosis only and 80 with PTSD+Cirrhosis. We will study their gut microbes, which will be linked to brain function, and severity of PTSD symptoms.

Our ‘panomic’ approach and longitudinal high-density data sets will allow us to develop a comprehensive “atlas” of persistent VR and the cellular immune neighborhoods in which they reside within key organ systems and tissue compartments, and will help identify and characterize novel cellular pathways and factors, phenotypic characteristics and inflammatory immune pathways involved in viral persistence.",7883563 (contact),"ESTES, JACOB D (contact)","REFSLAND, ERIC WILLIAM",2019-12-03,2025-11-30,Adherence;adverse outcome;Anatomy;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;antiretroviral therapy;Atlases;Autopsy;Binding;Biochemistry;Blood;Body System;cell type;Cells;Characteristics;Chronic;Clinical;Communities;cost;Cues;Data;Data Set;density;Dissociation;Event;Gastrointestinal tract structure;Genetic Transcription;Goals;HIV;HIV Infections;Immune;immune activation;Immunology;improved;In Situ;In Situ Hybridization;in situ sequencing;Individual;Infection;Inflammation;Inflammatory;innovation;insight;Interdisciplinary Study;Interruption;laser capture microdissection;Lymphoid Tissue;Maps;Mass Spectrum Analysis;memory CD4 T lymphocyte;mesenteric lymph node;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Analysis;Monkeys;multiple omics;Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging;Neighborhoods;next generation;nonhuman primate;novel;novel strategies;Organ;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Peripheral;peripheral blood;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Proteins;Proteomics;Research Proposals;Residual state;Resistance;Resolution;response;Rest;RNA;Sampling;Scientist;side effect;SIV;social stigma;Sorting;Source;spatiotemporal;Spleen;Testing;Time;tissue mapping;Tissues;Transcript;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomic profiling;Viral;Viral Genome;Viral reservoir;viral RNA;Virion;Virus;Virus Diseases;Virus Latency;Virus Replication,Defining Mechanisms of Viral Persistence in Situ at the Single-Cell Level,149672,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-AARR-Q(50)R],NA,NA,5,626525,176543,803068,NA

Furthermore, there is uncertainty around the benefits of modest weight loss in achieving meaningful outcomes in OSA. To overcome access and knowledge gaps, this trial will examine the effectiveness of a population health approach to weight loss care among Veterans with OSA. We will use a remote lifestyle-based weight loss intervention that is self-directed, low- technology, and likely low cost.
