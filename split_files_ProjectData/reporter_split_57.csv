By in- corporating objective visio-vestibular deficits into risk models, and utilizing an innovative mobile health in- tervention to improve specialist access and care continuity, we can more successfully match novel inter- ventions to those most in need of their benefits, ultimately reducing recovery times and the related physi- cal, cognitive, and emotional morbidity for pediatric concussion patients.",14601428 (contact),"CORWIN, DANIEL  (contact)","AWWAD, HIBAH OMAR",2022-08-01,2027-07-31,18 year old;Accident and Emergency department;Acute;Adoption;Age;Applied Research;Area;Award;barrier to care;Biometry;Brain Concussion;career;career development;Caring;Child;Child health care;Childhood;Clinic;Clinical;clinical center;clinical epidemiology;Clinical Trials;Cognitive;comorbidity;Continuity of Patient Care;cost;Data;Dedications;design;Development;Diagnosis;disability;Discrimination;Early Intervention;Ecological momentary assessment;Ecosystem;Educational process of instructing;effectiveness evaluation;efficacy evaluation;efficacy outcomes;Emergency Care;Emergency Department patient;Emergency Department Physician;Emergency Medicine;Emotional;Enrollment;Environment;evidence base;experience;Family;Female;Functional disorder;Goals;health communication;health economics;Health system;Health Technology;high risk;Hour;improved;improved outcome;Incidence;Individual;Injury;innovation;Institution;Intervention;Judgment;male;Measures;medical specialties;Mentors;Methodology;Methods;mHealth;mhealth interventions;Modeling;Monitor;Morbidity - disease rate;Nature;novel;novel therapeutics;Observational Study;Outcome;patient oriented research;Patients;pediatric emergency;Pediatric Hospitals;Pennsylvania;Performance;persistent symptom;Persons;Philadelphia;Physicians;Physiological;Population;Positioning Attribute;Post-Concussion Syndrome;predictive modeling;prevent;Prevention;prospective;Provider;public health insurance;Recommendation;Recovery;reduce symptoms;Registries;Research;research and development;Resources;Rest;Risk;Risk Assessment;Risk Factors;risk stratification;ROC Curve;Science;Scientist;sex;skills;Specialist;Sports Medicine;standard of care;Symptom Burden;symptomatology;Symptoms;System;targeted delivery;telehealth;Time;tool;Training;Underrepresented Minority;Universities;usability;Vestibular dysfunction;vestibular system;women versus men;Work;Youth,Risk Stratification Using Physiologic Markers and Mobile Health-Facilitated Specialist Management to Improve Outcomes in Pediatric Concussion Patients,128275,NST,NST-1 Study Section[NST-1],NA,NA,3,199625,15970,215595,NA

Here we propose to continue our new approach for developing therapies for these diseases. Rather than focusing on individual diseases, we focus on the genetic differences between successfully aged, healthy centenarians and control individuals with no family history of extreme longevity. Based on results from the previous project period, many of such genetic differences involve physiological processes that have previously been shown to be involved in extreme longevity of model organisms. Using extensive genetic resources, including whole exome sequences of our ~ 700 centenarians (in the process of significant expansion), we aim to discover novel genetic variants involved in healthy aging and longevity. We will then validate these human genetic variants in other centenarian cohorts, subsequently functionalize the top candidates in vitro and in mice in vivo, and develop drug screening assays for these variants. This genes-to-drugs collaborative project is the first to use the genetics of the very rare individuals aged over a hundred in relatively good health to identify therapeutic approaches for targeting aging itself rather than its composite diseases for preventing, delaying onset and progression, and possibly even reverting many of the multiple age-related diseases.",1878122;1888670;1881928 (contact),"BARZILAI, NIR J;ROBBINS, PAUL D.;VIJG, JAN  (contact)","GUO, MAX",2017-09-15,2028-08-31,Affect;age acceleration;age related;age-related disease;aged;Aging;aging mechanism;aging related;Alzheimer&apos;s disease pathology;appropriate dose;Biological Assay;Candidate Disease Gene;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cell Aging;Cell model;Cells;Centenarian;Chronic;Chronic Disease;Clinical;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Code;cohort;college;Communities;Data;data integration;data portal;Data Set;data sharing;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Disease;DNA Damage;DNA Resequencing;drug development;drug discovery;Drug Kinetics;Drug Screening;Drug Targeting;exome;extend lifespan;extreme human longevity;Family history of;FDA approved;fly;Foundations;FOXO3A gene;Freezing;Funding;FVB Mouse;Genes;Genetic;genetic analysis;genetic association;genetic information;genetic resource;Genetic Screening;genetic variant;Genome;Genomics;Goals;Growth;Health;healthspan;healthy aging;high throughput screening;Human;human disease;Human Engineering;Human Genetics;human pluripotent stem cell;Hybrids;IGF1R gene;improved;In Vitro;in vivo;Individual;induced pluripotent stem cell;interdisciplinary approach;Intervention;Intervention Studies;late life;Lead;Leadership;Link;Longevity;Longevity Pathway;MADH3 gene;Malignant Neoplasms;Medicine;Metabolism;model organism;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;mouse genetics;mouse model;multiple chronic conditions;Mus;Natural Products;Nematoda;Nerve Degeneration;new therapeutic target;NF-kappa B;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;old mice;Outcome;p65;Pathway interactions;Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell;Pharmaceutical Preparations;pharmacologic;Phenotype;Physiological Processes;prevent;Process;programs;promote resilience;rare variant;Regimen;repository;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Resources;response;Risk Factors;Role;Route;screening;small molecule;Specificity;stem;stem cell biology;stressor;success;Testing;Therapeutic;therapeutic target;therapy development;TNFRSF5 gene;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomics;Untranslated RNA;Validation;Variant;Work,Genetic variant-based drug discovery targeting conserved pathways of aging,56278,ZAG1,ZAG1-ZIJ-5(M3),NA,NA,8,2383400,311243,2694643,NA

Reported adverse events associated with use of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active component in cannabis, include sedation, confusion, loss of balance, nausea, vomiting, and hallucination. These side effects suggest that cannabis, when used in combination with opioids—which also cause sedation, confusion, respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting and constipation— may be harmful. On the other hand, several studies suggest that state-based recreational legalization may be associated with a decrease in opioid related deaths. Thus, it is plausible that cannabis use, by reducing the use of opioids, reduces respiratory depression and the risk of overdose.

This is not just a necessity for minority faculty, but also essential for faculty at minority-serving institutions. Beyond the direct benefits to Scholar Awardees, the program has potentially wider implications for the health status of the minority population in general, resulting from the formation of a larger pool of experienced minority basic cancer researchers and clinicians to contribute, thrive, and gain health equity in the field. The enhancement of the MSI faculty member’s research program enriches the experience of the minority students he or she trains. Additionally, minority investigators are more likely to explore the issues relating to minority health disparities, as well as to have a better prospect of recruiting and collaborating with minority study subjects, and a significant increase in the number and visibility of minority cancer researchers might serve as an effective antidote to attitudes of distrust on the part of study participants and help lead to greater trust on the part of minorities in the medical and research institutions.",8011666 (contact),"FOTI, MARGARET  (contact)","LIU, JIEXIN",1997-09-25,2028-08-31,Address;Advanced Malignant Neoplasm;Alaska Native;American Association of Cancer Research;anti-cancer research;Antidotes;Area;Attitude;Award;Awareness;Caliber;Cancer Science;career;Clinical;Collaborations;COVID-19 impact;Development;distrust;Economics;ethnic minority;Exhibits;expectation;experience;Exposure to;Faculty;Funding;Funding Mechanisms;Future;Goals;Grant;Growth;Health Disparities Research;health equity;health inequalities;Health Status;Hispanic-serving Institution;Historically Black Colleges and Universities;innovation;Institution;interest;International;Knowledge;knowledge base;Laboratories;Lead;Malignant Neoplasms;Medical;meetings;member;Minority;Minority Groups;minority health disparity;minority investigator;minority student;Minority-Serving Institution;National Cancer Institute;Native Hawaiian;next generation;Outcome;Participant;peer;professor;programs;Public Health;Publications;Race;racial minority;recruit;Research;Research Personnel;Resources;Science;skills;social;Students;Study Subject;symposium;Time;Training;Travel;tribal college;Trust;Underrepresented Minority,Minority and Minority Serving Institution Faculty in the Field of Cancer Research,76526,ZCA1,ZCA1-PCRB-9(M1),NA,NA,25,54350,0,54350,NA

We have developed a mouse model of chronic TBI that identifies sleep-wake disturbances by electroencephalogram (EEG). One brain mechanism for these sleep- wake problems in TBI involves the neuropeptide orexin (ORX). We propose to test the treatment effects of an ORX receptor antagonist medication in male and female mice with chronic TBI.

Despite the damage to individuals and society that alcohol-induced blackouts impose, Medicine has fallen short in understanding the mechanisms of their occurrence and in providing pharmacotherapeutics to counteract them. Departing from all previous work, which focused on mechanisms operating within hippocampal neurons, this study proposes a hippocampal vascular mechanism for the condition and thus, will: (a) identify the molecular target in the brain arteries that facilitates the occurrence of alcohol-induced blackouts, (b) address its likely contribution to the differences in alcohol-induced blackout between biological sexes, and (c) establish the efficacy of endothelium-independent vasodilators newly discovered by our group to selectively affect the vascular target of alcohol and thus counteract alcohol-induced blackouts.",1861056 (contact),"DOPICO, ALEX M.

A primary reason for this is that many rural Veterans reside prohibitively far from VA facilities that offer specialty substance use disorder treatment. While primary care services are more readily available to rural Veterans through VA community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs), within VA, the large majority of prescribing for OUD occurs within the context of specialty substance use disorder treatment settings, rather than primary care.

Increasing evidence indicates that outcomes of the different vascular access types vary widely based on patient characteristics, so much so that the recent update of the National Kidney Foundation Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines states “…there is insufficient evidence for KDOQI to make recommendations on choice of incident vascular access type,” leaving providers and patients to select a vascular access type without adequate evidence of likely outcomes. To overcome this key barrier, the goal of this R01 proposal is to optimize the patient experience of vascular access decision- making by a) developing an interactive, evidence-based guide to vascular access outcomes that incorporates a prognostic model for short and long-term outcomes of vascular access and b) identifying best practices for utilization of the guide during the clinician-patient encounter.",12573700 (contact),"WOO, KAREN  (contact)","CHAN, KEVIN E",2022-09-01,2027-08-31,adverse outcome;Age;Anatomy;Arteriovenous fistula;arteriovenous graft;Attitude;Bayesian Network;Blood Vessels;Calibration;Catheters;Characteristics;Client satisfaction;Clinical;cohort;Collaborations;comorbidity;Data;data registry;Data Set;Data Sources;Decision Making;design;Development;Dialysis procedure;Disease Outcome;Disparate;education access;Educational Materials;End stage renal failure;evidence base;experience;Face;Failure;Feedback;Fistula;Foundations;frailty;Goals;Guidelines;Health Services Accessibility;Health system;Hemodialysis;improved;Individual;Information Systems;innovation;Institution;Interview;Kidney;Kidney Diseases;large scale data;Life;Link;Logistic Regressions;machine learning method;Maintenance;Medicare claim;Methods;Modeling;multiple data sources;novel;Obesity;operation;Outcome;outcome prediction;patient engagement;Patient observation;patient response;Patients;Perception;Performance;Peripheral Vascular Diseases;Physicians;Population;preference;Procedures;Process;Prognostic Factor;prognostic model;Provider;provider communication;Qualitative Methods;Race;random forest;Recommendation;Registries;Research;satisfaction;Sensitivity and Specificity;sex;sociodemographics;statistical and machine learning;Structure;Surgeon;Testing;trustworthiness;United States;Update;Venous,Improving the patient experience of hemodialysis vascular access decision making,129810,HSQE,Health Services: Quality and Effectiveness Study Section[HSQE],NA,NA,3,201645,112921,314566,NA

Resistance training (RT) is an effective approach to preserve muscle mass and improve these health outcomes in non-metastatic CSPC survivors receiving ADT; however, there is a gap in our understanding of how RT impacts outcomes in mCSPC survivors, and the impact of 52-weeks of RT in a home-based setting, a setting that is more practical for sustained adherence and the reported preferred setting for exercise in mCSPC survivors receiving ADT. Furthermore, the addition of creatine monohydrate supplementation to an RT program (Cr+RT) enhances the effects of RT in cancer-free older adults and individuals with advanced head and neck cancer, and creatine supplementation has demonstrated anti-cancer effects in preclinical models including prostate cancer; as such, this 52-week, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial will compare our established, effective, home-based, telehealth RT program with creatine or placebo (PLA; Cr+RT vs. PLA+RT) in order to identify the superior strategy to preserve muscle mass, improve health outcomes, and attenuate cancer progression in mCSPC survivors receiving ADT.",9629904;14657323 (contact),"AGARWAL, NEERAJ ;COLETTA, ADRIANA  (contact)","PERNA, FRANK",2023-09-01,2028-08-31,"Address;Adherence;Adopted;Advanced Malignant Neoplasm;analog;androgen deprivation therapy;Androgens;anti-cancer;Attenuated;cancer biomarkers;cancer survival;Cancer Survivorship;cancer therapy;Caring;Castrate sensitive prostate cancer;cell free DNA;chemotherapy;Clinical;Colorectal Cancer;Complement;Creatine;Disease;Double-Blind Method;double-blind placebo controlled trial;Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry;Educational Intervention;Effectiveness;efficacy testing;Elasticity;Energy Metabolism;Exercise;exercise capacity;exercise training;Exhibits;Fatigue;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Head and Neck Cancer;Health;Home;improved;Incidence;Individual;inhibitor;Institution;insulin sensitivity;Intervention;intervention effect;Intervention Studies;Knowledge;Life Style;Link;Literature;Malignant neoplasm of prostate;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;men;Metastatic Prostate Cancer;Modeling;muscle form;Nonmetastatic;older adult;Older Population;Outcome;patient oriented;Phosphocreatine;Physical Function;Physical Performance;Placebos;Play;Population;Pre-Clinical Model;preservation;primary outcome;Proliferating;prostate cancer survivors;Protocols documentation;Quality of Care;Quality of life;Randomized;Randomized, Controlled Trials;Reporting;Research;Resistance;resistance exercise;Role;Safety;Signal Transduction;Skeletal Muscle;Supplementation;Survival Rate;Survivors;survivorship;System;telehealth;Telemedicine;Testing;Thinness;Training Programs;Translating;tumor growth;tumor progression;Vertebral column;week trial;Work",Creatine supplementation and resistance training to preserve muscle mass and attenuate cancer progression: A double-blind randomized controlled trial,281759,ZCA1,ZCA1-SRB-2(M1),NA,NA,2,427136,224119,651255,NA

The present study extends this work to the scientifically and societally critical group of children with ASD with severe language and cognitive impairment, whose participation in this multimodal brain imaging study is made possible via a behavioral and technical protocol we have recently developed, called MEG-PLAN.

Kentuckians are disproportionately affected by many chronic diseases, including obesity, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, fatty liver disease, etc., which are all aspects of cardiometabolic syndrome. Certain communities are more highly impacted than others, and it is critical to understand why. We hypothesize that exposure to toxics, specifically VOCs, initiates/exacerbates these conditions. It is fundamental to our understanding of the effects of these toxics to engage the communities most deeply affected by exposure to these pollutants and to try to mitigate the effects of these exposures. Thus, determining the influence of pollutant exposures on the development/progression of these chronic conditions is vital. Also vital is examining this influence within the proposed areas within West and Southwest Louisville, Kentucky that face added social environmental health burdens, including an uneven distribution of race and ethnicity, a traumatic introduction into the racial reckoning, historic redlining, and poverty.

Therefore, we propose to conduct a small clinical trial to test the safety of d- limonene given with radiation and chemotherapy in HNC patients and to identify the maximum dose that is tolerable to these patients; at the same time we will also study its effect on protecting other normal tissues from radiation damage and collaborate with the other projects to develop novel ways to protect salivary glands and other tissues from radiation injury.",6592029 (contact),"LE, QUYNH-THU XUAN (contact)",NA,2022-09-21,2027-08-31,Address;Adult;aldehyde dehydrogenases;Aldehydes;Ames Assay;Apoptosis;bone;cancer cell;Cancer Patient;cancer radiation therapy;cancer therapy;carcinogenicity;cell killing;Cells;Chemopreventive Agent;chemoradiation;Chemotherapy and/or radiation;Chest;Clinic;clinical candidate;clinical translation;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;comparison group;Complication;cost;Cytoprotection;Data;Deglutition;Dental caries;Dermatitis;Dose;draining lymph node;Eating;Enzyme Activation;Enzymes;Epithelium;Esophageal mucous membrane;Esophagitis;European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer;follow-up;Functional disorder;Genes;Genetic;Gland;Glutaminase;Goals;Head and Neck Cancer;head and neck cancer patient;Head and neck structure;implantation;improved;In Vitro;in vivo;Injections;instrument;Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy;Intestinal Mucosa;irradiation;Knowledge;limonene;Location;Mass Fragmentography;Maximum Tolerated Dose;Measures;Mitochondria;Molecular;Morbidity - disease rate;Morphology;mouse model;Mucositis;Mus;mutant;Natural Products;Normal tissue morphology;novel;novel strategies;Oral;Oral Administration;oral infection;Oral mucous membrane structure;Outcome;Parotid Gland;Pathway interactions;Patient Outcomes Assessments;patient prognosis;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;phase I trial;Plant Extracts;Plasma;Platinum;preservation;primary endpoint;Procedures;Production;Quality of life;Questionnaires;Radiation;Radiation induced damage;Radiation Injuries;Radiation Protection;Radiation therapy;Radiation Tolerance;radioprotected;Radiosensitization;Reactive Oxygen Species;Recurrence;Rest;Risk;Safety;safety testing;Saliva;saliva function;Salivary;Salivary Glands;side effect;Skin;small molecule;Statistical Data Interpretation;stem cell self renewal;stem cell survival;stem cells;Submandibular gland;Survivors;Terpenes;Testing;Therapeutic Index;Time;Tissues;Toxic effect;treatment duration;tumor growth;Work;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure;Xerostomia,Project 2: ALDH3A1 Activation for Radioprotection of Salivary Glands and Other Head and Neck Epithelial Tissues,257907,ZCA1,ZCA1-TCRB-Q,8431,NA,3,244688,128222,NA,372910
