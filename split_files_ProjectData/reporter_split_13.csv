Our previous studies identified a molecular adjuvant that uses CD40 and TLR agonists that induces protective long lived T cell populations in mice and primates but why this approach is so effective is unclear. Our preliminary data indicate that dendritic cell production of IL-27 activates metabolic changes in recently primed T cells that result in sustained cMyc activation required for this long-lived response. This project will will use intravital imaging of Tâ DC interactions and the manipulation of IL-27, DC functions and c-Myc pathways to understand the mechanistic determinants that determine the efficacy of combined CD40L/TLR adjuvant.

Drugs are responsible for roughly one-quarter of acute kidney injury (AKI) cases, and antibiotics are implicated in approximately half of these events. Broad spectrum antibiotics are frequently used in hospitalized patients with vancomycin plus piperacillin/tazobactam being one of the most commonly prescribed combinations.

In order to gain insights needed for future human clinical trials, we will undertake novel studies using genetically engineered mouse models and sophisticated molecular methodologies to determine how spermidine is beneficial, studying effects on cells of the immune system and the cells that line the colon, and by detoxifying highly reactive, injurious molecules that could otherwise damage proteins and DNA within cells of the colon and lead to cancer.",1877317 (contact),"WILSON, KEITH T.

The proposed study will characterize previously unknown functions of vIRF-3, vIRF-3 regulation by a novel peptide reagent as a means of lytic suppression, and potentially provide the basis for development of antiviral and therapeutic strategies, via vIRF-3 manipulation and corresponding regulation of RTA, vIL-6, and productive replication.",1858107 (contact),"NICHOLAS, JOHN  (contact)","LINDE, AMBER SHRYER",2023-02-24,2025-01-31,Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome;adaptive immune response;AIDS related cancer;Anti-viral Agents;antiviral drug development;Binding;Biological;Biological Assay;Biology;Cell Proliferation;Cell Survival;cell type;Cells;co-infection;Complex;Custom;Cycloheximide;cytokine;Dactinomycin;Data;density;Development;DNA Polymerase II;Elements;Endothelial Cells;Enhancers;EP300 gene;Epithelial Cells;Equilibrium;Etiology;expectation;Future;gammaherpesvirus;Gene Expression Regulation;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Growth;Growth Factor;HIV;HIV Infections;HIV/AIDS;Homologous Gene;Human Herpesvirus 8;Immune;Immune signaling;Infection;Interferon Regulatory Factor 2;Interferons;Interleukin-6;Investigation;Kaposi Sarcoma;Knock-out;Lentivirus;Lymphoma cell;Lytic;lytic gene expression;Lytic Phase;lytic replication;Macaca;Malignant - descriptor;Mediating;Mediator;Messenger RNA;Modeling;Molecular;Multicentric Angiofollicular Lymphoid Hyperplasia;novel;novel strategies;Oncogenic;pathogen;Pathogenesis;Peptides;Phase;Phenotype;Post-Transcriptional Regulation;posttranscriptional;primary effusion lymphoma;Process;Production;Productivity;promoter;protein aminoacid sequence;Proteins;Proto-Oncogenes;Publishing;Reagent;Regulation;Reporter;Reporting;Repression;Research;Ribosomes;RNA;Role;Signal Transduction;small molecule;Stress;System;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Agents;TP53 gene;Transcription Coactivator;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;Viral;viral fitness;Viral Genes;viral interferon regulatory factor;viral interferon regulatory factor-1;viral interferon regulatory factor-3;Viral Pathogenesis;Viral Physiology;Viral Proteins;Virus;Virus Diseases;virus host interaction;Virus Latency;Xeroderma Pigmentosum,AIDS malignancy-associated human herpesvirus 8 viral interferon factor regulation of lytic-trigger and pathogenesis-associated viral RTA and vIL-6 proteins,174854,HCAC,HIV Coinfections and HIV Associated Cancers Study Section[HCAC],NA,NA,2,150000,95625,245625,NA

TDP-43 is an RNA-binding protein known to regulate many facets of RNA metabolism; thus, TDP-43- associated toxicity in AD may result from the accumulation of key aberrant transcripts, such as the recently discovered truncated stathmin-2 (tSTMN2) transcript, as a result of TDP-43 mislocalization to the cytoplasm, abnormal post-translational modifications and/or TDP-43 sequestration into inclusions. Thus, in an effort to transform the AD field and improve our understanding of TDP-43-associated disease mechanism driving AD, our goals are to: 1) determine the pathological relationships between TDP-43 and tSTMN2 in AD, 2) evaluate whether tSTMN2 is associated with cross-sectional and longitudinal clinical and neuroimaging measures of neurodegeneration in AD, and 3) identify transcriptome changes in TDP-43-affected neurons that are unique to AD.",9036083 (contact);11644820,"JOSEPHS, KEITH A (contact);PRUDENCIO, MERCEDES","MCGAVERN, LINDA",2021-04-01,2026-04-30,Acceleration;Affect;Age;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Alzheimer&apos;s disease patient;Amyloid beta-Protein;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis;Apolipoproteins;Automobile Driving;Autopsy;axon regeneration;Behavioral;Biological;Brain;brain tissue;brain volume;Cell Nucleus;cerebral atrophy;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Classification;Clinical;Cognition;Cognitive;cohort;Cytoplasm;Data;Dementia;Deposition;Disease;Disease Progression;episodic memory impairment;Etiology;Exons;experience;experimental study;fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography;Freezing;frontal lobe;Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations;frontotemporal lobar dementia amyotrophic lateral sclerosis;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Genotype;Goals;hippocampal atrophy;Hippocampus;immunoreactivity;improved;Knowledge;Lead;Link;Measures;Memory Loss;Microtubule-Associated Proteins;Molecular;Mutation;Names;Nerve Degeneration;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neurofibrillary Tangles;neuroimaging;Neurons;neuropathology;novel;Onset of illness;Pathogenesis;Pathologic;Pathology;Patients;Phosphorylation;Play;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Process;Progressive Supranuclear Palsy;protein TDP-43;Proteins;Reporting;Repression;RNA;RNA metabolism;RNA-Binding Proteins;Role;Series;stathmin;superoxide dismutase 1;tau Proteins;Testing;Time;Tissues;Toxic effect;Transcript;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing;Variant,Stathmin-2 and TDP-43 neurodegeneration in Alzheimerâs and multi-etiology dementias,120992,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-BDCN-L(02)M],NA,NA,2,677452,113753,791205,NA
