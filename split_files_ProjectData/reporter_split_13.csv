Our previous studies identified a molecular adjuvant that uses CD40 and TLR agonists that induces protective long lived T cell populations in mice and primates but why this approach is so effective is unclear. Our preliminary data indicate that dendritic cell production of IL-27 activates metabolic changes in recently primed T cells that result in sustained cMyc activation required for this long-lived response. This project will will use intravital imaging of T– DC interactions and the manipulation of IL-27, DC functions and c-Myc pathways to understand the mechanistic determinants that determine the efficacy of combined CD40L/TLR adjuvant.

We previously demonstrated the efficacy of Project LifeSkills (the only “best evidence” HIV risk reduction intervention for YTW included among the CDC’s compendium of evidence-based interventions), a group based, face-to-face delivered HIV prevention interventions for YTW, and the adapted it to an online-delivered, mobile app platform (containing 4 online modules). We propose to test the efficacy of LifeSkills Mobile in the current application; given inherent limitations to widespread dissemination of face-to-face, group-based interventions, LifeSkills Mobile extends the potential reach of the intervention via the development of a mobile version, and provides content on, and access to, current biobehavioral prevention technologies (e.g., PrEP).",1863064;9193405;8755422 (contact),"BELZER, MARVIN E;KUHNS, LISA MARY;MIMIAGA, MATTHEW JAMES (contact)","ZIMAND, LORI B",2021-03-09,2026-02-28,"acceptability and feasibility;Accounting;Address;Adherence;Adult;Affect;Age;AIDS prevention;Antibodies;Anus;Area;Award;Behavior;biobehavior;Birth;California;care systems;Caring;Cellular Phone;cohort;community advisory board;community based participatory research;condoms;cost;Data;Development;Diagnostic Reagent Kits;digital;Disparity;Economics;Educational Curriculum;efficacy evaluation;efficacy testing;efficacy trial;empowerment;Evidence based intervention;experience;Exposure to;Facebook;Feasibility Studies;Feminine;Funding;Gender;Gender Identity;gender minority;Geography;group intervention;handheld mobile device;Health Care Costs;Health Care Sector;health service use;Healthcare;high risk;HIV;HIV Infections;HIV risk;Home;Human immunodeficiency virus test;Incidence;incremental cost;innovation;Intervention;Interview;Knowledge;Laboratories;Letters;Life;Link;Location;Los Angeles;male;marginalization;Mediator;mhealth interventions;mobile application;Modeling;models and simulation;Motivation;National Institute of Mental Health;online delivery;Participant;participant enrollment;Pediatric Hospitals;Persons;pilot test;pilot trial;Population;Populations at Risk;pre-exposure prophylaxis;Prevalence;prevent;Prevention;Prevention strategy;preventive intervention;primary outcome;Procedures;Process;psychosocial;Randomized;Randomized, Controlled Trials;recruit;reproductive;Research;Research Design;Research Infrastructure;Research Personnel;Research Support;Resources;Risk;Risk Reduction;rural area;Sampling;San Francisco;satisfaction;Screening procedure;secondary outcome;Self Efficacy;self esteem;sex;Sexual Partners;Site;skills;social disparities;social stigma;sociodemographic variables;socioeconomics;standard of care;substance use;Surveys;Technology;Testing;theories;Time;transgender;transgender women;Treatment Efficacy;Universities;Update;uptake;usability;Vagina;web app;Work","Digital, Limited Interaction Efficacy Trial of LifeSkills Mobile to Reduce HIV Incidence in Young Transgender Women",156875,ZAI1,ZAI1-CB-A(S1),NA,NA,4,1952764,378123,2330887,NA

Drugs are responsible for roughly one-quarter of acute kidney injury (AKI) cases, and antibiotics are implicated in approximately half of these events. Broad spectrum antibiotics are frequently used in hospitalized patients with vancomycin plus piperacillin/tazobactam being one of the most commonly prescribed combinations. Over 20% of patients treated with this combination develop AKI with mechanism postulated to be related to oxidative stress. Targeting the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 transcriptional pathway has great potential to up-regulate antioxidant responses and restore mitochondrial membrane potential.

Importantly, the spinal cord is damaged in MS, potentially leading to neurological deterioration, however, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and in particular, diffusion MRI are poorly suited to offer information about the biological substrates of MS in the spinal cord primarily because of its size and constant motion. Recently advancements in diffusion MRI (and associated modeling of diffusion contrasts) have been made and hold the promise of providing insight into the biophysical substrates of tissue damage in MS, but the application in the cervical spinal cord, the relationship between diffusion MRI and conventional MRI, and a more complete description of neurological damage in the spinal cord with advanced diffusion MRI has not been adequately evaluated or vetted, which is the thrust of this proposal.",9367303 (contact),"SMITH, SETH A (contact)","UTZ, URSULA",2021-02-15,2026-01-31,Address;Affect;Age;Animal Model;Architecture;Area;Atrophic;Attention;Axon;axon injury;Biological;biophysical model;Biophysics;Brain;Cervical spinal cord structure;Chronic;Clinical;Clinical assessments;Clinical/Radiologic;clinically relevant;cohort;Critiques;Data;density;Deterioration;Diffusion;Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging;disability;Disease;Disease Progression;Electron Microscopy;emerging adult;Evaluation;Evolution;Gender;Goals;Grant;gray matter;Health;healthy volunteer;Human;Image;improved;in vivo;indexing;Inflammation;insight;Knowledge;Lesion;Literature;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measurement;Measures;Methods;Modeling;Motion;Multiple Sclerosis;multiple sclerosis patient;Nervous System Disorder;Nervous System Physiology;Nervous System Trauma;neural;Neurites;Neurologic;Neurologic Deficit;Neurological disability;Neurological status;neuroprotection;novel;Paint;Paralysed;Pathologic;Pathology;Patients;Process;Publications;Publishing;Radiology Specialty;recruit;Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis;Reporting;Reproducibility;Scanning;Sensorimotor functions;Societies;Specificity;Spinal Cord;Spinal cord damage;Spinal Cord Diseases;Spinal Cord Lesions;Synapses;Techniques;Testing;Time;Tissues;tool;Validation;Variant;white matter,Evaluating Advanced Diffusion of the Human Spinal Cord: Application to MS,117816,CTIS,Clinical Translational Imaging Science Study Section[CTIS],NA,NA,4,233276,153383,386659,NA

We here study the mechanism by which the heart maintains its function in the presence of high blood pressure. We will test our hypothesis that a mechanism that stimulates the use of glucose for energy supply and production of building blocks coordinates the adaptation of the heart to stress so that the heart can continue to eject the blood.

The broader goal of this research is to bring a similar clarity to our understanding of the generation of cone signals in the fovea. Determining the molecular factors involved in phototransduction that make foveal cones so unique will identify potential substrates for therapy in disease conditions such as macular degeneration. By providing the first detailed insight into cone photoreceptor function in the fovea and across primate retina we will provide a benchmark to evaluate cellular function in stem cell - derived retinas which will be an important step in devising targeted interventions for millions of people with deficits in their central vision.,12566728 (contact),"SINHA, RAUNAK  (contact)","NEUHOLD, LISA",2021-03-01,2026-02-28,Address;Behavioral;Benchmarking;biological systems;biophysical model;Blindness;Brain;Cell Physiology;Cells;Cessation of life;Computer Models;Cone;Degenerative Disorder;density;design;Disease;effective therapy;Electrophysiology (science);Exhibits;experience;Eye Movements;Foundations;fovea centralis;Frequencies;Generations;Goals;GTP-Binding Proteins;Heterogeneity;Human;human stem cell-derived;improved;Individual;insight;interest;Intervention;Kinetics;Knowledge;Light;light intensity;Location;luminance;Macaca;Macular degeneration;Measurement;Mediating;Medical;Modeling;Molecular;Morphology;Movement;Neurons;Night Blindness;Noise;novel;Organism;Output;Perception;Performance;Peripheral;Persons;Photons;Photoreceptors;Phototransduction;Physiological;Primates;Process;Property;Prosthesis;Recording of previous events;Replacement Therapy;Research;Resolution;response;Rest;Retina;Retinal Cone;Retinal Degeneration;Retinal Diseases;retinal rods;retinotopic;Rod;Signal Transduction;stem cell therapy;stem cells;Stimulus;Testing;Time;tool;transmission process;Vision;Visual;Visual Cortex;Visual Fields;visual information;visual stimulus;Visual System;Work,Photoreceptor signaling in primate retina,31411,BVS,Biology of the Visual System Study Section[BVS],NA,NA,4,250000,116550,366550,NA
