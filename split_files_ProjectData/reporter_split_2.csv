The proposed studies are focused at investigating mechanisms that could effectively decrease bile acid absorption and also impact fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism to aid in the development of superior treatment for hypercholesterolemia. Diseases associated with hypercholesterolemia such as diabetes mellitus are highly prevalent among the veterans.

One feature of our approach is that we use augmented reality to present the results from artificial intelligence predictions to endoscopists. This gives endoscopists immediate intuitive visual feedback about the polyp’s classification. Additional potential benefits of this research relating to healthcare include the following: 1.

The goal of this project is to use nanotechnology to control signal processing in lymph nodes, tissues that regulate immune function. This ability could promote regulatory immune cells that specifically control the inflammatory cells attacking myelin. This advance would benefit Veteran’s health in three ways. First, myelin-specific tolerance that controls disease without hindering healthy immunity would improve efficacy and Veteran quality of life.

Clearly, there is an unmet medical need for improved, less toxic therapy for lymphoma. Our initial observations suggest that enhanced FASN activity functionally regulates the eIF4B -driven protein translational machinery in DLBCL cells.

In mouse models and in humans, we have shown that these pathways interact with iron to determine insulin secretion and production of a major regulator of metabolism, leptin. Major changes in blood glucose levels can be achieved by manipulating one or both. We therefore propose studies to further define these effects and their molecular mechanisms, focusing on a pathway that we have found to integrate iron status in other tissues. Our goal is to define potential new targets for diabetes therapy, and define personalized “ideal” iron levels for diabetes prevention and treatment. !",1891372 (contact),"MCCLAIN, DONALD A.

However, the exact mechanism by which APOE contributes to AD remains elusive. Several lines of evidence suggest the presence of other AD-risk loci in close proximity to APOE gene. In our preliminary study, we observed that SNPs in an extended APOE region carry strong AD association signals independent of the APOE ε4 allele, and that multiple genes in this region have altered mRNA expression in AD postmortem brain. From this evidence, we hypothesize that multiple genes/loci in the extended APOE locus have a compound effect on AD risk. Our short-term goals are to identify APOE ε4-independent genetic loci associated with AD, and to precisely define how these loci work together to modify AD risk.

The reduction of GH and IGF1 may contribute to more weight gain, increase the severity of diabetes and cause fat to build up in the liver, ultimately leading to liver injury (referred to as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH]). NASH increases the risk of developing liver cancer and is now recognized as the leading cause for liver transplantation. In addition, the reduction in IGF1 may contribute to poor wound healing observed in diabetic patients.

Protease- mediated cleavage of PRR generates soluble PRR (sPRR), the extracellular domain of this protein. Circulating sPRR is widely regarded as a biomarker for a number of human diseases such as cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, etc. Recently, we first reports a novel biological function of sPRR in regulation of fluid balance. While furin and ADAM19 were originally thought to mediate sPRR production, new evidence demonstrated site-1 protease (S1P) as the predominant cleavage enzyme. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to define the regulation and function of S1P- derived sPRR in renal handling of Na+ balance and BP. Compelling preliminary data demonstrated that S1P is indispensable to Aldo-induced ENaC activation and is also implicated in the development of salt- sensitive hypertension in Dahl S (SS) rats via generation of sPRR. It is further intriguing that sPRR directly interacts and activates angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) to induce α-ENaC expression. Therefore, we hypothesize that S1P-derived sPRR induced ENaC activation via interaction with AT1R, thus serving a common downstream pathway responsible for salt-sensitive hypertension. To test this hypothesis, we will define the function of S1P/sPRR in different salt-sensitive hypertensive models with use of pharmacological inhibitors or renal tubule-wide deletion of S1P. Reversibility of the effect of S1P inhibition is tested by supplement of exogenous sPRR. Lastly, we propose to test the direct interaction between sPRR and AT1R and further explore its implication in regulation of ENaC. Overall, this proposal is expected to offer novel insight into the function of a newly described S1P/sPRR pathway in the kidney.",7367571 (contact),"YANG, TIANXIN  (contact)",NA,2020-10-01,2024-09-30,"Anti-Hypertensive Agents;Attenuated;Binding;Biological Markers;Biological Process;Blood Pressure;Cardiovascular Diseases;Chronic Kidney Failure;Data;Development;Enzymes;epithelial Na+ channel;Equilibrium;Extracellular Domain;Fluid Balance;Generations;Goals;human disease;Hypertension;hypertension treatment;hypertensive;Inbred Dahl Rats;inhibitor;Injury to Kidney;insight;Kidney;Mediating;member;Modeling;neutralizing antibody;novel;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Peptide Hydrolases;pharmacologic;Production;Rattus;receptor;Receptor Signaling;Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 1;Regulation;Renal tubule structure;Renin;Renin-Angiotensin System;Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System;Reporting;Role;salt sensitive;salt sensitive hypertension;site-1 protease;Tertiary Protein Structure;Testing;Water",Defining renal S1P/sPRR/AT1R pathway  in salt-sensitive hypertension,4871,ZRD1,ZRD1-NEPH-D(01)1,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA

From these studies, Dr. Wingo hopes to contribute to a better understanding of the neurobiology of PTSD, depression, and Alzheimer’s dementia in order to find more effective interventions and enhance resilience among Veterans.",9229826 (contact),"WINGO, ALIZA PHAM (contact)",NA,2020-10-01,2025-09-30,Address;Affect;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Anxiety;Area;Autopsy;Award;Awareness;Behavioral;Biological Models;Biological Psychiatry;Blood;Board Certification;Brain;brain tissue;career;Caring;Chromosome 1;Cognitive;Communication;comorbid depression;Complex;coping;Data;Data Set;Dementia;dementia risk;Development;DICER1 gene;Doctor of Medicine;effective intervention;Elderly;epidemiology study;Etiology;Event;experience;Female;Formulation;Funding;Future;Genes;Genetic;Genetic study;genetic variant;genome wide association study;Genomic medicine;Genotype;geriatric depression;Goals;Health;Healthcare;high risk;Human;Impaired cognition;Individual;innovation;intergenerational;Intervention;Journals;K-Series Research Career Programs;Life;Life Experience;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Meaning and purpose;Medical center;Mental Depression;Messenger RNA;Meta-Analysis;MicroRNAs;Modeling;Molecular;mRNA Expression;Multiomic Data;multiple omics;National Institute of Mental Health;Nature;Neurobiology;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;novel therapeutics;offspring;Outcome;Paper;Participant;Pathway interactions;Patient Care;positive emotional state;Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders;Prefrontal Cortex;Pregnant Women;Principal Investigator;programs;promote resilience;protective effect;protein expression;Proteins;Proteome;Proteomics;Psyche structure;Psychiatrist;Psychiatry;psychologic;Publications;Publishing;Regulation;Research;Research Personnel;Research Priority;resilience;resilience biomarker;Role;Seminal;Shapes;statistics;Stress;Symptoms;Systems Biology;Techniques;transcriptome;transcriptomics;Transition Career Development Award (K22);Translating;Trauma;United States National Institutes of Health;Veterans;Weight;Woman;Work,BLR&D Research Career Development Transition Award Application,5219,ZRD1,ZRD1-PSYC-F(01)1,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA

One-fifth of those who were ambulatory before their hip fracture require long-term care afterward. Beyond their age, other lifestyle factors make veterans particularly susceptible to osteoporosis, including smoking, alcohol consumption, and an inactivity. Moreover, many Vietnam veterans were exposed to environmental factors during the war, such as the dioxin TCDD (found in Agent Orange), which put them at much greater risk for osteoporosis. Recently, the VA amended its adjudication regulation to establish a presumption of service connection for osteoporosis for former Prisoners of War (POWs) who were detained or interned for at least 30 days, and more recently, for those diagnosed with posttraumatic stress dis-order (PTSD), and whose osteoporosis is at least 10% disabling.

Current results from strategies targeting innate immunity to treat acute brain injury are encouraging. We use an experimental mouse model of TBI to apply elegant approaches to study neuroinflammation. For this proposal, we seek to better understand changes in the immune response to TBI over time, including during chronic TBI. In collaboration with pharmaceutical companies, we test the efficacies of therapeutic approaches that have not been tested in TBI before to alter inflammation and improve functional behavior outcomes in preclinical studies. In particular, we will determine the cellular mechanisms driving a potent innate immune pathway propagated by type I interferons in TBI, and test targeting these cells/pathway to treat TBI in preclinical studies.

Treatments that promote the recovery of some lower-extremity motor and sensory activity after a complete paraplegic spinal cord injury could have significant value. Currently, effective treatments are limited. There are relatively few efforts to develop small-molecule therapeutic agents to treat spinal cord injury patients. In this project, we propose to develop small molecules that could lead to therapeutic agents that could be used either alone, or in combination with existing therapies.

If a Veteran is eligible for the study by making enough residual urine, he/she will have a 50% chance to be offered the usual three-times-per-week dialysis vs. twice-per-week dialysis that is gradually increased to three-times- per-week over one year. We will compare health-related quality of life, how long residual kidney function lasts, and other measures including safety in these two groups. By conducting this study, we hope to understand 1) whether starting dialysis with less frequency is safe, effective, and can help Veterans and their care-partners to better cope with dialysis, and 2) if incremental dialysis can result in major cost benefits to the VA health care system, thus allowing more patients to stay in VA dialysis clinics vs. being transferred to outside clinics.",6522816 (contact);9951377;2049163,"KALANTAR-ZADEH, KAMYAR  (contact);KOVESDY, CSABA PAL;UNRUH, MARK LYNN",NA,2022-10-01,2027-09-30,"Address;Adverse event;American;Ancillary Study;arm;Blood Vessels;Cachexia;Cardiac;Cardiovascular system;Caregiver Burden;Caring;Client satisfaction;Clinic;Clinic Visits;Clinical;Clinical Trials;coping;cost;Costs and Benefits;design;Dialysis patients;Dialysis procedure;Dose;Eating;Eligibility Determination;Emergency department visit;End stage renal failure;Event;experience;Fatigue;frailty;Frequencies;functional status;Future;GDF15 gene;Growth;health care service utilization;health related quality of life;Healthcare Systems;Hemodialysis;Hospitalization;Human Resources;hyperkalemia;Hypotension;Hypotensives;Impaired health;improved;indexing;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Injury to Kidney;Intervention;Kidney;Kidney Diseases;Left;Left Ventricular Mass;Life;Longevity;Maintenance;Malnutrition;Measures;Medical center;mortality;mortality risk;Muscle;muscle form;nutrition;Nutritional;Nutritional status;Organ;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Outpatients;Output;Parents;Patient Outcomes Assessments;Patients;physical conditioning;Physical Function;Physical Performance;Population;Pragmatic clinical trial;pragmatic study;precision medicine;preference;preservation;primary endpoint;primary outcome;Proteins;Protocols documentation;Provider;Randomized, Controlled Trials;Regimen;Renal function;Research Design;Research Personnel;Residual state;Resources;Safety;safety assessment;safety outcomes;safety testing;scale up;Schedule;secondary endpoint;secondary outcome;Serum;Site;standard of care;survival prediction;Symptoms;System;Testing;Time;Time trend;Urea;Urine;Veterans;Veterans Health Administration;wasting;Withdrawal","Incremental Hemodialysis for Veterans in the First Year of Dialysis (IncHVets): A Pragmatic, Multi-Center, Randomized Controlled Trial",2382,ZRD1,ZRD1-NEPH-N(01)1,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, our work shows that men with 2 X chromosomes are at the same lupus risk as women, and women with 3 are at an even higher risk for lupus. So, we think that the risk of lupus is related to the number of X chromosomes, not sex. Furthermore, we have identified several genes on the X chromosome that we think may mediate this X chromosome dose effect. This proposal will determine the role of these genes in lupus and the sex bias of the disease. Lupus is a common illness among otherwise healthy young adults.

During a blocked artery heart attack, elderly patients unfortunately sustain greater heart damage compared to younger patients. This disparity persists despite successful treatment of the heart attack with rapid restoration of blood flow back to the heart muscle. Our research found that the aged heart is intrinsically more susceptible to injury during a heart attack. This increased risk is due to dysfunctional mitochondria, the “powerhouses” of the heart cell. During a heart attack, these deranged mitochondria cause more heart cell death.

Within the VA Health Care System, the incidence of gonorrhea increased between 2013 and 2017 with the total number of cases at 10,587. There is no vaccine to N. gonorrhoeae and a great need for new antibiotics due to the alarming rise in multidrug resistant strains, which is making emergence of untreatable gonococcal infections a real prospect. The high-risk environment of active military service is thought to increase risky behavior and, thus, the rate of sexually transmitted infections.

This proposal is built on the novel concept that pancreatic tumors produce high levels of mucins, which promote the tumor growth and limit the therapeutic effects. We discovered that the Core2 mucin synthesis gene is overexpressed and responsible for various subtypes of mucins. We identified talniflumate as a novel inhibitor of the Core2 gene. In this proposal, we establish talniflumate as the inhibitor of pancreatic tumor growth and the combining of therapeutic drugs, gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel, may significantly improve therapeutic efficacy.

The overall strategy of the CMA is to pursue mechanistic strategies to improve diagnostic and molecular therapies targeted at CIS. In CMA1, we focus on the genetic, epigenetic and expression-based pathways of proliferation, the hallmark of CIS. Our central hypothesis is that alterations of the RB1 pathway cause activation of E2F and the Enhancer of Zeste-2 (EZH2) causing cellular proliferation and immune suppression. In this proposal we will define the genetic and immunologic landscape of CIS in Veterans with smoking, and deployment related occupational chemical and biologic warfare exposure to identify new therapies for Veterans with BCa.

With normal aging and in response to several diseases, arteries stiffen, which plays a key role in major cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, heart failure, and stroke. Arteries contain smooth muscle cells (SMCs), which constrict and relax to regulate blood flow. It recently became recognized that SMCs themselves stiffen with aging. In addition, SMCs, like other cells throughout the body, become senescent, which leaves them unable to divide and makes them secrete proteins that promote inflammation. This proposal will examine how plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a protein that controls blood clotting and several cell functions, promotes stiffening and senescence of SMCs and arteries.

New insights into the disease and new therapeutic options thus must be developed. By revealing its mechanism of action, the proposed study aims to demonstrate CCN5 as a novel for TNBC.

They present to acute outpatient settings such as the emergency department, urgent care clinics, and primary care offices for infectious and pain-related complaints, and in many cases, are treated with antibiotics and non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Unfortunately, 30% of these medications are inappropriately prescribed and may cause patient harm. Without a systematic process to give providers feedback on their prescribing, the opportunity to learn from experience and prevent future adverse events is lost. By placing the provider at the center of the design of a feedback system, this study seeks to develop a feedback system using potentially inappropriate antibiotic and NSAID prescribing as two primary opportunities to improve acute outpatient care delivery.

Sleep disruption in PTSD is very common and hyperarousal features of PTSD have a bidirectional relationship to sleep problems. Current treatment options have limited efficacy. Further, pharmacological treatments for poor sleep quality often deleteriously affect sleep architecture and may also be addictive. We will examine the efficacy of a non-invasive treatment option called transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation (tVNS) to improve sleep architecture (aim 1), hyperarousal symptoms of PTSD (aim 2), and predictors of individual differences in response (e.g., mild TBI features) (aim 3). tVNS is promising because the vagus nerve affects brain structures that underlie core hyperarousal PTSD symptoms.

Food insecurity is associated with a wide range of poor health outcomes as well as higher healthcare costs and utilization. In 2017 the VA launched a national initiative to screen all Veterans in the VA for food insecurity and help connect them with resources. Little is known about variation in screening implementation across VA sites; how sites respond when a Veteran screens positive for food insecurity; or what VA practices following a positive screen best improve Veteran food security status, experiences of care, and health outcomes. This study will address these knowledge gaps by examining the scope of Veteran food insecurity in the VA, variation and site-level innovations in how the screener is being implemented, and Veteran experiences of screening and follow-up. Findings will help optimize screening and referral processes for connecting food insecure Veterans to relevant VA and community resources.",15727497 (contact),"COHEN, ALICIA  (contact)",NA,2020-10-01,2025-12-31,acceptability and feasibility;Acute;Address;Advisory Committees;Area;career;Caring;Chronic;Clinical;clinical encounter;clinical implementation;clinical practice;cohort;Communities;community engaged intervention;community partnership;Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research;Country;data warehouse;design;Dietitian;effective intervention;Eligibility Determination;Emotional;Evaluation;evidence base;experience;Family health status;Family Practice;feasibility testing;Feedback;follow-up;Food;Food Access;food insecurity;food security;Fostering;Foundations;Future;Goals;Health;Health Care Costs;Health Services Research;high risk;Homelessness;implementation science;improved;informant;innovation;Intervention;Intervention Trial;Interview;Investments;Knowledge;Literature;Manuals;Medical;member;Mental Health;Methodology;Methods;Modeling;multi-site trial;novel;Nutritional;Outcome;Patients;Phase;Physicians;pilot test;pilot trial;poor health outcome;Process;prospective;Protocols documentation;Reporting;Research;Research Methodology;Research Personnel;Research Training;Resources;Sampling;Scientist;screening;Services;Site;skills;social health determinants;Social Workers;stressor;Structure;therapy design;Time;Training;Variant;Veterans;Visit;Work,Implementing a Clinical-Community Partnered Intervention to Address Food Insecurity Among High-Risk Veterans,3013,MRA0,Research Career Scientist[MRA0],NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA

Public Health Relevance.  Social communications are critically dependent on the proper processing of social information. The social cues detected by the sensory systems can induce neuroendocrine responses that control multiple aspects of the nervous system and elicit innate behaviors. The proper function of these systems is crucial to the health and wellbeing of human beings. Malfunction of these sensory systems that result in the improper processing of sensory information can lead to deficit in cognitive function and psychiatric disorders. By investigating the neural circuitry that mediates social communications among animals, which has a direct influence on the endocrine control of reproductive and aggressive behaviors, we will be able to elucidate the functional logic of the circuit and provide insights into the brain mechanisms of processing sensory information, mediating social communications, and exerting endocrine control.

Metformin, a drug widely used to treat diabetes, could slow the aging process and improve health span, the part of a person’s life during which they are in good health.

Afterwards, deployed veterans reported more chronic lung symptoms (coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath) than were reported by non-deployed veterans. Airborne pollution is known to cause and worsen lung symptoms and lung diseases. How airborne pollution causes lung problems is not fully understood.

Furthermore, insomnia is comorbid in 36-91% of individuals with AUD and jeopardizes recovery by increasing their risk for relapse and complicating their clinical profile. The VA/DoD guidelines recommend four medications for the treatment of AUD. Among them, topiramate (TOP) has demonstrated promise in improving abstinence and decreasing heavy drinking but without any clinical improvement in sleep continuity. The recommended treatment for insomnia is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I), and it has shown efficacy in improving insomnia but with minimal benefit in improving abstinence. The proposed study will evaluate whether augmenting TOP with CBT-I bolsters recovery in AUD, by improving abstinence and decreasing insomnia.

We have discovered that dietary cholesterol and its metabolites oxysterols shapes innate T lymphocytes resident in the skin that are equipped with sensors of altered oxysterol homeostasis. We will test the hypothesis that the fine specificity of skin positioning of these dermal T cells guided by oxysterols produced in a specialized skin niche is obligatory for proper immune reactions.

Precision oncology identifies these drivers in order to exactly target the most effective therapy available. The drivers are diverse and can also reveal cancer risks in the family, often unanticipated. Inherited drivers occur more often among men with a family history of prostate cancer and men with metastatic prostate cancer. Although prostate cancer has greater heritable risk than any other common cancer, its broad diversity has also proven to be a formidable obstacle for traditional family-based study to reveal its inherited causes.

Myeloid cell accumulation is a hallmark of human colorectal cancer and PD-L1 is a major immune suppressive ligand of MDSCs. In the preliminary studies, we determined that PD-L1 engages PD-1 of myeloid cells to inhibit type I interferon signaling to suppress CTL tumor infiltration. Therefore, it is critical to study type I interferon signaling in myeloid cells in human colorectal cancer patients.

Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) is a severe type of antibiotic-resistant bacteria because it is resistant to almost all antibiotics and can be very deadly. It is very important to identify which patients are at risk for CRE and to identify the best treatment for CRE. We propose to develop and test a tool that predicts whether a person carries CRE, and to identify the best treatment options for CRE infections.

The brain is one of the common organs for cancer recurrence. Unfortunately, cancer brain metastasis is increasingly becoming a significant clinical problem due to its rising incidence and limited efficacy of existing systemic therapies. Metastasis is the consequence of favorable interactions between the invaded cancer cells and the microenvironment in the distal organ. To cancer cells, the brain has the most unique microenvironment since almost all the cells in the brain do not exist in any other organs. Thus, this proposal is designed to study crosstalks between cancer cells and brain stromal cells. If we can identify key changes in this process, we can better target brain metastatic cancer cells, in order to eradicate them and provide more effective therapies for cancer patients.",10943112 (contact),"CHEN, QING  (contact)","SNYDERWINE, ELIZABETH G",2019-12-01,2025-11-30,Address;Agonist;aldehyde dehydrogenases;antagonist;Apoptosis;Arachidonic Acids;Astrocytes;astrogliosis;beta catenin;Binding;Biological Assay;Brain;brain cell;cancer cell;Cancer Patient;cancer recurrence;cell motility;cell type;Cells;Cephalic;Cessation of life;Clinic;Clinical;Coculture Techniques;Coin;Complex;Data;design;Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm;Distal;E-Cadherin;effective therapy;Epithelium;Experimental Models;experimental study;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Fatty Acids;Gene Expression Profiling;Genes;Genetic;Goals;Growth;In Vitro;in vitro Model;in vivo;Incidence;Individual;insight;intravital microscopy;Invaded;Kinetics;Location;Malignant neoplasm of brain;Malignant Neoplasms;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Mediator;Melanoma;Melanoma Cell;Melanoma patient;Mesenchymal;Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain;Metastatic Melanoma;metastatic process;migration;Modeling;mouse model;Neoplasm Metastasis;Neuroglia;Neurons;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;Oleic Acids;Organ;Pathway interactions;Patients;Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors;pharmacologic;Phenotype;PPAR gamma;pre-clinical;Primary Neoplasm;Process;Production;Proliferating;promoter;receptor;Relapse;Reporter;Research;Response Elements;Role;Sampling;Signal Transduction;Site;small molecule inhibitor;Soil;spatiotemporal;Stains;Stromal Cells;Systemic Therapy;Techniques;Testing;therapeutic target;therapy resistant;Time;Unsaturated Fatty Acids;Xenograft procedure,Understanding PPARgamma signaling in melanoma brain metastasis,241490,TME,Tumor Microenvironment Study Section[TME],NA,NA,5,221345,165736,387081,NA

The Southern California Research Center for ALPD and Cirrhosis is a regional, multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary center which continues to strive for integrated and comprehensive efforts to advance research, education, training and dissemination on the diseases. In support of its mission, Administrative Core provides administrative and logistic support; Animal Core produces innovative animal models of ALPD and cirrhosis; and Pilot Project Core provides seed funds to early-career investigators who are aspired to pursue independent ALPD research. The Center also supports four leading-edge research projects to help understand: how gut viruses contribute to alcohol- associated liver disease (AALD); how liver cancer is promoted by metabolic reprogramming in AALD; what cellular and molecular events drive excessive liver scarring in AALD; and how alcohol causes pancreas damage and inflammation via cholesterol dysregulation. High-impact outcomes from these activities are improving our understanding of the diseases and facilitating developments of new preventive and therapeutic approaches while serving as a unique national resource of technical, intellectual and collaborative services to investigators across the nation.",2105294 (contact),"TSUKAMOTO, HIDEKAZU  (contact)","GAO, PETER",1998-12-31,2029-04-30,acute pancreatitis;alcohol consequences;Alcohol consumption;alcohol use disorder;Alcoholic Hepatitis;Alcoholic Liver Diseases;Alcohols;Animal Model;Animals;Automobile Driving;Award;Bacteriophages;base;Basic Science;California;career;career development;Cells;Cholesterol;Cicatrix;Cirrhosis;Clinical Research;clinically relevant;Collaborations;Communities;community center;Cytolysins;Development;Disease;Double-Blind Method;drinking behavior;Education;Educational process of instructing;Educational workshop;Enterococcus faecalis;Environment;Event;Faculty;Feasibility Studies;Fellowship;Fostering;Funding;Future Generations;Generations;Genetic Transcription;Goals;graduate student;Grant;Growth;gut bacteria;Health Personnel;Hepatitis;Home;humanized mouse;IL17 gene;improved;Inflammation;Infrastructure;innovation;insight;Institution;interleukin-23;International;Investments;K-Series Research Career Programs;Life Style;Liver;Liver diseases;Liver neoplasms;Logistics;Malignant neoplasm of liver;Medical;Medical Students;member;Mentors;Metabolic;Metabolic Diseases;microbiota;Mission;Modality;Modeling;Molecular;Monoclonal Antibodies;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality;mouse model;multidisciplinary;National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism;Nature;novel;novel therapeutics;Oncoproteins;Outcome;outreach;Pancreas;Pancreatic Diseases;Pancreatitis;Patients;Phase I Clinical Trials;phase I trial;Pilot Projects;Placebo Control;Positioning Attribute;Postdoctoral Fellow;pre-clinical;premature;Preventive;programs;Publications;Publishing;Randomized;Recurrence;Reporting;repository;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Research Training;Resources;Science;Scientist;self-renewal;Seminal;Service delivery model;Services;Simvastatin;Specimen;stemness;Students;summer research;symposium;Technology;Therapeutic;therapeutic development;therapeutic target;TP53 gene;Training;Training and Education;Translational Research;translational study;trial planning;Trypsinogen;tumor initiation;undergraduate student;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Virus,Southern California Research Center for ALPD and Cirrhosis,11999,ZAA1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZAA1 DD (60)],NA,NA,26,1214910,511907,1726817,NA

This includes having disproportionately high rates of obesity, in part due to PTSD symptoms interfering with physical activity and healthy diet. Unfortunately, Veterans with PTSD have poorer weight loss outcomes than those without PTSD in VA’s existing weight management program, MOVE!. Based on pilot work, it appears that a weight management program that augments standard PTSD care and targets PTSD-related barriers to weight loss improves weight and PTSD symptoms. Whether it improves these issues more than standard VA care is in need of study, which is the focus of the proposed research. The proposed study also seeks to understand factors that would interfere with and facilitate implementing the program in VA if it is effective.
