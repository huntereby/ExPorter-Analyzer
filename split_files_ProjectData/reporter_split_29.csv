Thus, we propose to leverage the large-scale ongoing national randomized clinical trial called COSMOS to evaluate the effect of cocoa supplementation on longitudinal change in biological aging including epigenetic aging and inflammation aging in relation to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Parallel assessments of the randomized multivitamin intervention on the same biological aging and CVD outcomes will be also performed, as multivitamins have remained the most common dietary supplement, taken by at least one-third of US adults.

It is estimated that nonsense mutations represent the underlying cause of ~30% of human genetic diseases, but that nonsense-containing mRNA could, in many cases, produce sufficient amounts of functional protein if either the decay of the transcript by NMD and/or extent of premature translation termination was attenuated.

Interestingly, while both stem cell populations also express the collagenolytic metalloproteinase, MT1-MMP, the molecular mechanisms that control stem cell fate in these two populations remain undefined. Herein, we outline a series of new animal models and experimental approaches to define an unexpected role for MT1-MMP – independent of cathepsin K – in defining periosteal and paratenon stem cell fate and function by controlling a novel, dual YAP/TAZ-linked mechanotransduction and TGFβRIII/ TGFβ signaling axis in vitro and in vivo.",1899079 (contact),"WEISS, STEPHEN J (contact)","PINTUCCI, GIUSEPPE",2022-08-05,2027-05-31,Anatomy;Animal Experiments;Animal Model;bone;Bone Marrow;carboxypeptidase C;Caspase;cathepsin K;Cell Lineage;Cell Physiology;Cells;Chondrogenesis;Collagen;Collagen Type I;Cytoskeleton;Data;design;Family;Genetic Transcription;Growth and Development function;In Vitro;in vivo;intramembranous bone formation;Ligaments;Light;Link;Matrix Metalloproteinases;mechanotransduction;Membrane;Mesenchymal;Metalloproteases;MMP14 gene;Modeling;Molecular;novel;Outcome;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Periosteum;Phenotype;Physiologic Ossification;Physiological;Play;Population;programs;proteinase In;Proteolysis;receptor;Regulation;Reporting;Role;Route;Series;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;skeletal stem cell;stem;stem cell differentiation;stem cell fate;stem cell function;Stem Cell Mobilization;stem cell population;stem cells;Stromal Cells;Structure;Tendon structure;Tissues;trafficking;Transforming Growth Factor beta;Transgenic Organisms;Trauma;Work,Pericellular Proteolysis and the Regulation of Bone/Tendon Stem Cell Fate,78783,SBSR,Skeletal Biology Structure and Regeneration Study Section[SBSR],NA,NA,3,270469,151463,421932,NA

Several lines of evidence have demonstrated that oncogenic transcription factors are both necessary and sufficient to drive cancer initiation and progression. Although targeting transcription factors has proven difficult to date, we propose to build on work that has identified initial inhibitors of a key epigenetic mechanism, histone acetylation, that regulates gene expression. Using a novel high throughput small molecule screen, fit for purpose biochemical and cellular assays, medicinal chemistry and systematic genetics, we propose to identify histone acetyl transferase inhibitors suitable for clinical development and the means to stratify patients most likely to respond to these inhibitors.",1925058 (contact),"HAHN, WILLIAM C.

Although there are currently several methods for producing antibodies, including hybridomas and in vitro immune display libraries, the process is laborious, costly, and inefficient. Screening these antibody libraries requires iterative rounds of affinity screening and cloning without functional validation, which is typically post-screening against a limited number of antibody clones. To improve the efficiency of this process, we propose this Phase II study using a fully automated method for functionally screening hundreds of thousands of primary B-cells from immunized animals on the high throughput CellRaft-HTS array and automated CellRaft AIR® System.

This platform has been sought without success for over 40 years, because it can be applied to every area of medical research, diagnostics, and disease treatment. As just four examples, modification may attach a payload to the protein, allowing it to be internalized to cancer cells. It may fluorescently tag cancer cells to guide a surgeon cutting out a tumor.

In low to moderate-transmission settings slated for elimination, imported cases become an increasingly important epidemiological consideration. In these settings, imported cases may a) represent a high but poorly defined proportion of the overall malaria burden, b) result in secondary transmission that can impede local elimination efforts, and c) may require additional or alternative interventions than standard control measures. Imported cases, when currently evaluated at all, are operationally defined as infections acquired outside of a defined geographic area and identified based on travel history. However, lack of capture of asymptomatic infections together with variable quality of travel history collection limit the utility of this standard approach to identifying imported infections and quantifying their role in transmission. Further, there are no routinely collected data that would allow evaluation of the impact of imported cases on local transmission. In this proposal, we will collect detailed travel histories, perform active surveillance for asymptomatic infections, and generate parasite genomic data to more accurately define the role of imported infections in two representative border regions of sub-Saharan Africa (Tororo District, Uganda and Mutasa District, Zimbabwe) that leverage substantial surveillance infrastructure from the NIH-funded International Centers of Excellence for Malaria Research (ICEMR) network and will employ active (via a longitudinal study) and passive (via health facility surveillance) designs to capture asymptomatic and symptomatic infections. We propose the following Specific Aims.1) To quantify and characterize imported malaria infections. We will use a probabilistic approach to classify infections as imported or local via detailed travel and other behavioral survey data and determine the travel patterns and risk factors associated with importation. 2) To determine the impact of importation on local transmission and identify appropriate targeted interventions. We will use parasite genomics and epidemiological data to define local transmission and the impact of imported infections, taking advantage of dense sampling of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections in focused geographies. We will use a robust set of statistical modeling approaches, including Bayesian estimation of transmission networks incorporating all genomic and epidemiologic data. We will use these data to model the predicted impact of various combinations of targeted interventions. The expected outcome of the proposed research is evidence on appropriate surveillance methods for imported malaria infections and on the contribution of these infections to sustaining transmission. By identifying ways to better target interventions, these results will impact malaria control efforts as they strive for elimination and require evidence on how to mitigate the risk of imported malaria infections.",14202088 (contact);11909239,"RODRÍGUEZ-BARRAQUER, ISABEL  (contact);WESOLOWSKI, AMY","RAO, MALLA R",2021-06-16,2026-05-31,Adult;Africa South of the Sahara;Alternative Therapies;analytical method;Area;Behavioral;Cessation of life;Classification;Clinical Management;Collection;Data;design;Diagnosis;epidemiologic data;Epidemiology;Failure;Funding;genomic data;Genomics;Geographic Locations;Geography;Health care facility;Household;Impact evaluation;improved;Individual;Infection;Infrastructure;International;international center;Interruption;Intervention;Longitudinal Studies;Malaria;malaria infection;malaria transmission;Measures;Mozambique;Outcome;Parasites;Pattern;Plasmodium falciparum;predictive modeling;Recording of previous events;Reporting;Research;Residual state;Resources;Risk Factors;risk mitigation;Role;Sampling;Site;Statistical Models;Surveillance Methods;Surveys;Testing;transmission process;Travel;Uganda;United States National Institutes of Health;vector control;Zimbabwe,Malaria across borders:  Measuring imported infections and contributions to local transmission in Uganda and Zimbabwe,163201,CRFS,Clinical Research and Field Studies of Infectious Diseases Study Section[CRFS],NA,NA,4,570274,207978,778252,NA

Studying where HIV hides in the brain and effects of HIV and Meth on the brain is difficult because the brain cannot be accessed unless the person is deceased and even then, there are limits to what one can learn from these brains. As a result, there are animal models that are half human/half mouse brain that can be used to understand where HIV hides in the brain of Meth users. We will u se these models in a unique way by taking cells from Meth using/ HIV positive people and reprogramming them to become brain cells to put into these mice to understand the extent of where HIV hides, effects on the brain, and how HIV genotype changes over time (evolution).

However, Staphylococcus aureus, a serious threat to human health flagged by the U.S. CDC, has been found to be much more tolerant of antimicrobial blue light at 405 nm due to its high antioxidant capability. A recent study discovered that the antioxidant capability of S. aureus can be mitigated using 460-nm wavelength irradiation. As such, this application aims to investigate the utility of an innovative dual-wavelength irradiation strategy, by using the combination of 460 nm and 405 nm wavelength irradiation, for improved killing of S. aureus. If this strategy can be demonstrated to be both effective and safe, it would potentially be a further advancement in the treatment of localized S. aureus infections.",8956950 (contact),"DAI, TIANHONG  (contact)","HUNTLEY, CLAYTON C",2023-05-18,2025-04-30,Abscess;Acinetobacter baumannii;Affect;alternative treatment;Animals;anti-microbial tolerance;Antibiotic Resistance;Antibiotic Therapy;Antibiotics;antimicrobial;Antimicrobial Resistance;Antioxidants;Attention;Bacteria;bactericide;Biological;bioluminescence imaging;Carotenoids;Cells;Clinic;Clinical;Community-Acquired Infections;Cutaneous;cytotoxic;cytotoxicity;Development;DNA Damage;Effectiveness;effectiveness evaluation;efficacy evaluation;Elderly;Endothelial Cells;Epithelial Cells;Exhibits;Exposure to;Fibroblasts;Foundations;Genetic Engineering;genotoxicity;Health;Hospitalization;Human;Immune;improved;In Vitro;Incidence;Individual;Infection;Inflammatory Response;innovation;Interruption;interstitial;irradiation;keratinocyte;lens;Light;methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus;Microbial Biofilms;mortality;Mus;Myoblasts;Needles;Neisseria gonorrhoeae;Nonpharmacologic Therapy;novel;Optics;Oxidative Stress;pathogen;pathogenic bacteria;Penetration;Phagocytes;Photobleaching;Photosensitizing Agents;Pigments;preclinical study;Predisposition;Prevalence;Production;Prophylactic treatment;Protocols documentation;Pseudomonas aeruginosa;Reactive Oxygen Species;real time monitoring;Regimen;Reporting;Resistance development;Resistance profile;resistant strain;Safety;safety study;Site;Staphylococcus aureus;Staphylococcus aureus infection;staphyloxanthin;Testing;Tetracyclines;Therapeutic;Time;Tissues;Toxic effect;Translating;Treatment Cost;Treatment Protocols;Virulent;wound healing,Dual-Wavelength Blue Light Irradiation for Improved Treatment of Staphylococcus aureus Infections,178585,RTB,Radiation Therapeutics and Biology Study Section[RTB],NA,NA,2,150000,100165,250165,NA

Therefore, control of platelet activity is a high impact research goal broadly affecting many disease states as well as aging; however, thorough understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate platelet reactivity remains incomplete.

Typhi entered Samoa decades ago and expanded into the dominant circulating strain, and asymptomatic chronic gallbladder carriers of the strain serve as an effective long-term reservoir and source of infection. Through our close collaboration with the Samoa Ministry of Health, the “Samoa Typhoid Fever Surveillance Initiative,” we propose a series of comparative genomic and geospatial analyses integrating whole genome sequence data of Salmonella Typhi isolates from Samoa with clinical and household epidemiologic data to determine the population structure, evolutionary origins, and local patterns of transmission including the relative role of asymptomatic chronic carriers of Salmonella Typhi. Where previous large scale phylogenetic studies of Salmonella Typhi have demonstrated the feasibility and public health utility of our experimental approaches, none have focused on Samoa nor been implemented as part of an accelerated and coordinated national typhoid control program; therefore, our results will not only contribute a Polynesian perspective to the field of Salmonella Typhi genomics, but also present new information on endemic typhoid fever to assist the Samoa Ministry of Health and our international collaborators in public health decisions.",16016942 (contact),"SIKORSKI, MICHAEL JOSEPH (contact)","ALEXANDER, WILLIAM A",2021-06-01,2024-06-30,Acceleration;Acute;Age;Age Years;Antibiotic Resistance;Bacteremia;Bacteria;bacterial genome sequencing;Bacterial Infections;Bile fluid;Biliary;Blood;Blood Circulation;Bone Marrow;chlorination;Cholelithiasis;Chronic;Cities;Clinical;Collaborations;Collection;Communicable Diseases;Comparative Genomic Analysis;comparative genomics;Consumption;contaminated water;Country;Data;Disease;disease model;Disease Outbreaks;Duodenum;Environment;Environmental Risk Factor;epidemiologic data;Epidemiology;Etiology;Evolution;Exhibits;extensive drug resistance;Family member;Female;Filtration;Flushing;food consumption;Food Contamination;Fostering;Founder Effect;Funding;Gallbladder;Gene Deletion;Genes;Genome;genome sequencing;genomic epidemiology;Genomic Segment;Genomics;Genotype;Geography;Goals;Health;Hepatobiliary;Household;Human;improved;Incidence;Incubated;Individual;Infection;International;Intestinal Mucosa;Intestines;Investigation;Island;Link;Liquid substance;Liver;lymphatic drainage;Macrophage;Methods;Modeling;Modernization;Molecular;Mononuclear;Obesity;Pacific Islands;Pattern;Persons;Phagocytes;Phylogenetic Analysis;Phylogeny;Policies;Polynesian;Population;Predisposition;Prevalence;programs;Public Health;Recording of previous events;Relapse;resistance factors;Resolution;Risk;Risk Factors;Role;Salmonella typhi;Samoa;Samoan;Sanitation;Seasons;Sepsis;septic;Series;Silicon Dioxide;Single Nucleotide Polymorphism;Source;spatiotemporal;Spleen;Structure;System;Systemic infection;Technology;Testing;Time;tool;Training;transmission process;Trees;Typhoid Fever;Variant;Virulence Factors;Water;water quality;Water Supply;waterborne;whole genome,Genomics of Salmonella Typhi in Samoa: Population structure and genomic epidemiology,156973,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-F13-Z(20)L],NA,NA,4,28727,0,28727,NA

Yet how mTBI may contribute to the development of this tau buildup remains unknown. Disruption of normal sleep-wake patterns is a frequent complaint after mTBI, while in aging populations, sleep disruption appears to promote the development of neurodegenerative pathology. In this study will test whether sleep disruption after mTBI exposure contributes to the development of post-traumatic tau pathology. We will also specifically test whether the dysfunction of the brain's waste clearance system, called the glymphatic system, links mTBI with tau pathology.

Respiratory suppression occurs because neurons in the brain that drive breathing are inhibited (turned off) by narcotics; thus, understanding the neural pathways for breathing will allow us to devise effective neuromodulatory strategies to treat opioid-induced respiratory depression.

In veterans, elevated exposure to UV irradiation and tobacco carcinogens make the total and high-risk SCCs significantly higher than the civilian population. The dearth of spontaneous SCC lung metastasis models has hindered identification of their therapeutic targets. We have developed a genetic mouse model with spontaneous SCC lung metastasis that can be transplanted to immune competent or compromised mice.

Food allergy is mediated by antigen crosslinking of IgE antibody bound to mast cells (MC), and is often associated with intestinal dysbiosis. IgE sensitization to food is not sufficient by itself to drive food anaphylaxis. Intestinal MC load, which controls intestinal permeability and systemic antigen absorption, is an important determinant. DOCK8 deficiency is characterized by recurrent infections, eczema and food allergy with a high incidence of food anaphylaxis As food allergy and anaphylaxis are cardinal features of DOCK8-deficient patients, DOCK8 deficiency constitutes a disease model for identifying mechanisms underlying food allergy. We will test the hypothesis that DOCK8 deficient mice, which show increased susceptibility to anaphylaxis caused by food ingestion, have dysregulated immunity that results in an abnormal intestinal microbiome, which results in an increased intestinal MC load and exaggerated susceptibility to ingested antigens. We will examine whether the principles learned from studying food allergy in Dock8 deficiency are applicable to patients with food allergy. The results obtained.

Up to two-thirds of HIV infections among MSM occur within the context of primary partnerships, and these rates are highest among younger men who have sex with men (aged 18-29). Despite its promise, the current CHTC protocol is limited in two ways. First, CHTC does not incorporate a focus on drug use – a well-established correlate of HIV infection risk among YMSM specifically. Second, CHTC provides limited guidance for formal communication skills training in instances where partners have substantial communication deficits. Building upon pilot research funded by DA036419, the proposed project seeks to evaluate the efficacy of the We Test intervention – which includes two adjunct CHTC components: a substance use module (SUM) and an assertive communication training (CT) video.

However, the benefits of medications for opioid use disorder are not fully realized for individuals with serious injection- related infections due to limited treatment retention. This Career Development Award will use insights from public health treatment data and qualitative interviews to systematically adapt and evaluate a medication for opioid use disorder retention intervention, Recovery Management Checkups, for individuals with serious injection-related infections.
