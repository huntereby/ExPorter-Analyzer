This potential is attributed to the coordinated regulation of genes that drive proliferation. We [1, 2] and others [3] demonstrated that this transcriptional response is governed by a hepatic epigenetic code characterized by bivalent marks on pro-regenerative genes and that there is a repressive code on transposable elements (TEs). Our central hypothesis is that the youthful epigenetic code permits transcription factor access to pro-regenerative genes while restricting access to TEs, and that this code is rewritten during aging, resulting in TE activation, parainflammation [4, 5] and regenerative decline [6-8]. To test this, we will establish which elements of the code are critical for regeneration and TE suppression in young animals, determine the mechanism by which these elements compensate for each other in response to epigenome repatterning, and will then define how this code changes during aging.  Using a machine learning approach on multi-omic datasets, we defined the relationship between the chromatin states that comprise the epigenomic landscape in young, quiescent mouse livers and the expression of genes and TEs both in quiescent and regenerating livers following partial hepatectomy (PH) [2]. As expected, TEs are silent, and reside in closed chromatin states, while highly expressed genes fundamental to liver function reside in open states. Surprisingly, open chromatin states also contained thousands of genes that were silent in quiescent livers, including pro-regenerative, E2F target genes. We found that these genes were bivalently marked with active (H3K4me3) and repressive (H3K27me3) modifications in quiescent livers, and, strikingly, that H3K27me3 was depleted from their promoters following PH, concomitant with their activation. This suggests that H3K27me3 is a key element of the epigenetic code that confers regenerative potential to the liver. This is supported by our finding that hepatocyte specific knockout of a key DNA methylation factor, Uhrf1 (Uhrf1HepKO) results in the repatterning of H3K27me3, so that it is depleted from promoters of E2F target genes and enriched on hypomethylated TEs in a process we termed epigenetic compensation. The result is that Uhrf1HepKO mice show premature and sustained activation of pro-regenerative genes and enhanced liver regeneration following PH [1]. We will use a combination of genomic and functional approaches to investigate the role of H3K27me3 in gene and TE regulation in quiescent and regenerating livers and in epigenetic compensation. This will advance the important goal of understanding how the young liver epigenome sustains liver regeneration and suppresses transposon threat, which could be leveraged to develop therapeutic interventions to sustain liver health.  The loss of regeneration capacity in the aged liver [12-17]. is accompanied by widespread epigenetic changes, TE activation and inflammation [9-11]. We hypothesize that these are linked due to shifting of pro-regenerative genes to repressive chromatin states and TEs to active ones. The finding that young animals with constitutive H3K27me3 depletion in hepatocytes develop some of these phenotypes found in older animals [18-20], combined with our hypothesis that H3K27me3 is a key element in the hepatic epigenetic code in young animals, suggests that this mark as a regulator of the hepatic healthspan. We will test the exciting possibility that promoting epigenetic compensation in aged livers could rejuvenate them by facilitating activation of pro-regenerative genes. If successful, this could guide development of therapies to augment regeneration in elderly patients and those suffering from liver failure. specific aims, we will to uncover fundamental mechanisms about how the epigenome regulates genes, TEs and regeneration in the liver throughout the lifespan:  Aim 1. Determine the role of H3K27me3 and Uhrf1 in setting the epigenetic code in young livers. Hypothesis: Epigenetic compensation in Uhrf1HepKO livers shifts H3K27me3 from promoters to suppress TEs. NEW Approaches: In Uhrf1HepKO and WT mouse livers, we will:  1A. Profile genome occupancy of E2F1 and EZH2; and 1B. Deplete H3K27me3 from hepatocytes using pharmacological and genetic approaches and evaluate the effects on TE and gene expression in quiescent and regenerating livers.  Aim 2. Decipher how aging rewrites the hepatic epigenetic code.  Hypothesis: Pro-regenerative genes shift to repressed chromatin states and TEs to active states in aged livers.  NEW Approach: Using publicly available epigenomic data, define chromatin state and transcriptomics of aged human and mouse livers and determine how these changes relate to regeneration component in young livers.  Aim 3. Determine if epigenetic compensation can rejuvenate the liver.  Hypothesis: Epigenetic compensation induced in young mice can extend the youthful epigenetic code to prevent TE expression, parainflammation and enhance liver regeneration during aging.  Approach: Induce epigenetic compensation in young mice by constitutive Uhrf1HepKO and inducible H3K27me3 depletion and, when these animals age, assess changes in TE and gene expression and liver regeneration.",1929819 (contact),"SADLER EDEPLI, KIRSTEN C (contact)","BURGESS-BEUSSE, BONNIE L",2009-09-01,2027-04-30,Acceleration;access restrictions;Age;aged;Aging;animal old age;Animals;Cell Physiology;Chromatin;Code;Compensation;Complex;Cytoprotection;Data;Data Set;DNA;DNA biosynthesis;DNA Damage;DNA Methylation;DNA Transposable Elements;E2F transcription factors;Elderly;Elements;Epigenetic Process;epigenome;epigenomic profiling;epigenomics;EZH2 gene;flexibility;Foundations;gene discovery;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Regulation;Gene Silencing;Genes;genetic approach;Genetic Transcription;Genome;Genomic Instability;Genomics;Goals;Health;healthspan;Hepatic;Hepatocyte;Human;Inflammation;juvenile animal;Knock-out;life span;Link;Liver;Liver Failure;liver function;Liver Regeneration;Machine Learning;Mammals;Modification;Molecular;Multiomic Data;Mus;Natural regeneration;novel strategies;old mice;older patient;Outcome;Partial Hepatectomy;Pattern;pharmacologic;Phenotype;premature;prevent;Process;programs;Proliferating;promoter;regeneration potential;regenerative;Regenerative capacity;Regulation;Rejuvenation;Repression;response;Role;Signal Transduction;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;therapy development;transcription factor;transcriptomic profiling;transcriptomics;Work;Writing,Regulation of Liver Regeneration by UHRF1,80789,HBPP,Hepatobiliary Pathophysiology Study Section[HBPP],NA,NA,11,211200,21120,232320,NA

This program of work will also, through structured and dedicated career development, strengthen South African analytical capacity in the microbiome and inform future clinical trials that modulate the microbiome in the context of TB.",14680228 (contact),"NAIDOO, CHARISSA CAMILLE (contact)","SINA, BARBARA J",2022-07-27,2027-06-30,"16S ribosomal RNA sequencing;absorption;Acetates;Adolescent;Adult;Affect;African;Aftercare;Anaerobic Bacteria;Antibiotic Therapy;Antibiotics;Antitubercular Antibiotics;Butyrates;career;career development;Cause of Death;Clinical;Clinical Trials;cohort;Collaborations;combinatorial;Combined Antibiotics;commensal microbes;Computing Methodologies;Data;Dedications;design;diagnostic tool;Dietary Supplementation;Dose;Drug Kinetics;Drug resistance in tuberculosis;drug-sensitive;Enterobacter;Enterobacteriaceae;Epidemic;Ethambutol;Etiology;experimental study;Feces;Foundations;Funding;Future;global health emergency;gut microbiota;Health;Health Benefit;HIV;Hospitals;host microbiome;Human Microbiome;human microbiota;Immune;immunoregulation;improved;Inflammatory;Injections;Intervention;isoniazid;Klebsiella;Knowledge;Leukocytes;Levaquin;Life;Linezolid;longitudinal analysis;low and middle-income countries;Mass Chromatography;Mass Fragmentography;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Measures;Mediator;medical schools;Mentors;Mentorship;Metabolic;Metadata;microbial;microbial community;microbial host;microbiome;microbiome research;microbiome therapeutics;microbiota;microbiota profiles;Monitor;mortality;multidisciplinary;Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis;Mus;New York;Oral;Outcome;Pantoea;Parents;Pathogenesis;Pathway Analysis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physiological;Production;programs;Propionates;Prospective, cohort study;Province;Pulmonary Tuberculosis;Pyrazinamide;Regimen;Research;Research Priority;Research Support;resilience;Resistance;response;Rifampicin resistance;Rifampin;risk prediction;Sampling;Scientist;South Africa;South African;Sputum;Structure;Testing;Treatment outcome;treatment response;Tuberculosis;tuberculosis drugs;tuberculosis treatment;Uncertainty;Universities;Volatile Fatty Acids;Withholding Treatment;Work",Longitudinal microbiome-host interactions and clinical outcomes in drug-resistant tuberculosis patients,12302,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-ICP-L(57)R],NA,NA,3,82971,6638,89609,NA

Patients may benefit from the amplification or from modern hearing aid features such as noise reduction technology and the ability to stream sounds from a desired sound source directly to their ears thus reducing the background noise.

Many blast-exposed Veterans experience “functional hearing difficulties” (FHDs): problems in challenging listening environments despite clinically normal hearing as measured by the pure-tone audiogram. VA audiologists have begun using low-gain hearing aids to treat FHDs, but there are no concrete guidelines for this application given standard procedures rely on the pure-tone audiogram.

The goal of this proposal is to characterize the key markers of the brain’s response to repeated doses of TMS with high resolution using invasive brain recordings in humans, and relate these brain markers to noninvasive recordings. These markers will improve our understanding of TMS and can be used to optimize and enhance clinical efficacy for depression and other psychiatric disorders. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective treatment for depression, but clinical outcome is suboptimal because we don’t understand how rTMS affects the brain and we do not have brain measurements that indicate when stimulation reaches the target location in the brain (target engagement) and when stimulation changes the target (plasticity). The goal of this proposal is to characterize the key signatures of the brain’s response to rTMS with high resolution using invasive brain recordings (Aim 1), investigate how these recordings relate to noninvasive brain measures (Aim 2), and study how noninvasive brain measures relate to clinical outcome after TMS treatment for depression. Linking noninvasive brain measures to both invasive measurements and clinical outcome can greatly improve our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying TMS-induced clinical outcome and provide a path for optimizing TMS around these measures to improve clinical efficacy. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an effective treatment for depression, but clinical outcome is suboptimal with up to half of patients not responding. A critical missing factor that may improve TMS treatment are markers that TMS is modifying activity at the intended target in the brain.

This research will help our understanding of how transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) affects the brain. We will develop new methods of measuring TMS-induced changes in brain activity with high spatial and temporal accuracy that is only possible with intracranial recording and relate them to noninvasive recording measures that are more commonly used and to treatment outcome in depressed patients receiving therapeutic TMS.

The current project addresses this gap by conducting the world's first well-powered Phase 2 clinical trial of tDCS therapy in PPA, in order to more definitively determine whether tDCS paired with behavioral naming treatment results in lasting improvement in naming ability and also to identify the characteristics of persons with PPA for whom treatment with tDCS is most likely to be effective.

At the same time, the neural signaling patterns used by LGN neurons are much less abstract than those of the visual cortex, thereby allowing for more straightforward encoding schemes with the prosthesis. While it has been challenging to develop a high- count, multi-channel device that can safely be implanted into a deep brain structure, our colleagues have recently developed such a device, and here we are studying how to effectively stimulate LGN neurons including how to optimize transmission to downstream cortical neurons.

Our studies have important therapeutic implications as PGI2 and PGI2 analogs are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of pulmonary hypertension, and therefore their use could be extended for the treatment of allergic airway diseases such as asthma. ted",1903042 (contact),"PEEBLES, RAY STOKES (contact)",NA,2018-10-01,2027-06-30,airway inflammation;Allergens;allergic airway disease;allergic airway inflammation;Allergic Disease;Allergic inflammation;Allergic rhinitis;Alternaria;Amino Acids;analog;Animals;Antiinflammatory Effect;Arachidonic Acids;Asthma;Award;Basic Science;CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes;Cell Separation;Cells;Cellular Metabolic Process;Chronic Disease;clinically relevant;CRISPR screen;cytokine;Data;Development;Disease;Disease Pathway;Effector Cell;Energy-Generating Resources;Enzymes;Eosinophilia;Epoprostenol;experimental study;Extrinsic asthma;fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography;Funding;Genetic;Glucose;Glucose Transporter;glucose uptake;Glutamate Metabolism Pathway;Glutamates;Glutaminase;Glutamine;Glycolysis;Glycolysis Inhibition;Health;Human;Human Biology;human disease;Hypersensitivity;In Vitro;in vivo;in vivo Model;Inflammatory;Interleukin-13;Interleukin-5;Link;LoxP-flanked allele;Lung;Lymphocyte;Metabolic;Metabolic Pathway;Metabolism;metabolomics;Military Personnel;model organism;Morbidity - disease rate;Mucous body substance;Mus;novel;novel therapeutics;Nutrient;Pathogenicity;Pathway Analysis;Pathway interactions;Pharmaceutical Preparations;pharmacologic;Positron-Emission Tomography;Prevalence;Principal Investigator;programs;Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase;Prostaglandins;Public Health;Publishing;Pulmonary Hypertension;receptor;Regulation;Reporter;Resources;restraint;Role;Signal Transduction;Testing;Therapeutic;translational study;United States;United States Food and Drug Administration;uptake;Veterans,PGI2 regulation of CD4+ Th2 metabolism in allergic airway inflammation,4299,ZRD1,ZRD1-IMMA-G(01),NA,NA,6,NA,NA,NA,NA

The project proposes that children with DLD demonstrate overreliance on explicit learning, and are failing to initiate a shift to implicit learning during complex learning, because of their impaired executive function of shifting. Children will perform two artificial grammar learning tasks that require the extraction of regularities from a complex structure. Behavioral and electrophysiological measures of learning outcomes, learning strategies, and implicit knowledge will be assessed in relation to the executive function of shifting, and compared between children with DLD and age and gender matched controls. The two learning tasks will differ in the extent to which the use of explicit learning is suppressed. The suppression of explicit learning will allow the evaluation of implicit learning without the interference of explicit learning, and without reliance on shifting. The study will subsequently determine whether the suppression of explicit learning improves learning of complex structures in children with DLD.",8893065 (contact),"ARBEL, YAEL  (contact)","STORKEL, HOLLY LYNN",2020-07-01,2025-06-30,Adult;Affect;Age;Awareness;behavior measurement;Behavioral;Child;Clinical;clinically relevant;Cognitive;Communication impairment;Complex;Conscious;Data;design;Development;Disease;Educational process of instructing;effective intervention;Electrophysiology (science);Evaluation;Event-Related Potentials;Executive Dysfunction;executive function;Exhibits;explicit bias;Gender;Goals;hearing impairment;Human;Impairment;improved;innovation;Intellectual functioning disability;Intervention;Knowledge;Language;Language Development;Language Development Disorders;language impairment;Learning;Learning Difficulty;learning outcome;learning strategy;life-long learning;Linguistics;Measures;Memory;mental set;Methodology;Neurologic Deficit;neurophysiology;novel;operation;Pathologist;Pattern;peer;Pilot Projects;Reaction Time;Reporting;response;School-Age Population;Speech;Structure;Subconscious;success;syntax;Techniques;Testing;theories;Training;verbal,Examining the impaired learning mechanism in children with developmental language disorder,18295,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-BBBP-Y(90)S],NA,NA,5,227665,136599,364264,NA

The central hypothesis of the proposed study is that the available drugs, including FDA-approved drugs, could bind TREM2 at either basic and/or hydrophobic binding site, allosteric effect of drugs at TREM2 either or two binding sites could regulate ligand binding at both sites to modulate TREM2-mediated immune activation in AD, and compensate for the loss of TREM2-mediated immune activities by AD-associated TREM2 variants.

Disruption of the normal patterns of phosphorylation has been implicated in the etiology of a variety of major human diseases, including cancer. The ability to modulate signaling pathways selectively holds enormous therapeutic potential. The first drugs directed against protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) have now entered the market and represent breakthroughs in the treatment of cancer; however, challenges remain, including the fact that patients develop resistance to such drugs. Therefore, despite the obvious potential of PTK inhibitors as drug candidates, alternative approaches, to target simultaneously different signaling enzymes and events, are expected be more effective than focusing on PTKs alone. But what are those alternative approaches? The focus on PTKs for drug development ignores the other major component of phosphorylation-dependent regulation of signaling. Protein phosphorylation is a reversible process, in which the coordinated and competing activities of kinases and phosphatases are important for determining signaling outcome. The protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), which work in combination with the PTKs, have been garnering attention as potential therapeutic targets, but remain a largely untapped resource for drug development. This proposal focuses on a functional analysis of specific PTPs in models of cancer. The hypothesis to be tested is that PTPs function as specific regulators of tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent signaling pathways and thus manipulation of PTP function in cell and animal models will reveal new insights into the critical signaling events that underlie the disease. The overall goal is to define functional links between particular PTPs and specific signaling pathways in cancer, with a view to establishing how disruption of such functions affects the etiology of the disease and to reveal novel therapeutic targets from among the PTPs themselves or from the signaling pathways they regulate. Furthermore, we have now developed new approaches to “drugging” the PTPs themselves, producing drug-like molecules that are opening up new opportunities for cancer therapy.",1898919 (contact),"TONKS, NICHOLAS K (contact)","XU, WANPING",1991-08-01,2026-06-30,acquired drug resistance;Active Sites;Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome;Address;Affect;Animal Model;Architecture;Attention;Biological;C-terminal;Cancer Model;cancer therapy;Catalysis;Cell model;Cells;Charge;chemical property;Copper;Copper Chelation;COVID-19;Cues;cytotoxic;Data;Development;Disease;drug candidate;drug development;Drug resistance;drug resource;drug-like compound;Enzymes;Etiology;Event;Excision;extracellular;Family;Frustration;Funding;Generations;Goals;Grant;Growth;human disease;improved;Industry;inhibitor;innovation;inorganic phosphate;insight;interest;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Marketing;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Mediating;member;Metabolism;Modeling;Movement;mutant;neutrophil;Neutrophil Activation;new therapeutic target;novel;novel strategies;Oncogenic;Outcome;Pathologic;Patients;Pattern;Pharmaceutical Preparations;phosphatase inhibitor;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Physiological;Play;prevent;Process;programs;Proliferating;Protein Dephosphorylation;Protein Family;Protein Inhibition;protein protein interaction;Protein Tyrosine Kinase;Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase;Proteins;PTPN1 gene;Regulation;Resistance;Resistance development;response;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Signal Transduction Pathway;small molecule;small molecule inhibitor;Stimulus;Structure;success;targeted treatment;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;therapeutic development;Therapeutic Intervention;therapeutic target;transfusion related acute lung injury;Trastuzumab;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;Tyrosine;Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor;Tyrosine Phosphorylation;Validation;Work,Protein Tyrosine Dephosphorylation & Signal Transduction,53840,MIST,Molecular and Integrative Signal Transduction Study Section[MIST],NA,NA,32,380450,350013,730463,NA
