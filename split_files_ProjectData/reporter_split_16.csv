Unfortunately, the cancer usually recurs as aggressive, incurable “castration-resistant prostate cancer” (CRPC) that often metastasizes and dramatically degrades quality of life. To combat or prevent CRPC, new therapies must be found. We identified a gene termed BUB1B (known to increase cell division) that is present at high levels in CRPC and in metastatic CRPC. Reducing BUB1B protein in genetic experiments halts the growth of CRPC cells. For clinical purposes, however, no BUB1B drugs exist. We will determine how BUB1B promotes CRPC growth, pinpoint BUB1B activity that is vulnerable to drugs, and deploy a computational and experimental approach to identify BUB1B drugs.

The research proposed here will directly address the mechanisms by which this pathology arises, how the signal-carrying capacity of the auditory nerve is compromised in this condition, and how the condition can be diagnosed non-invasively. The proposed research will also extend our work on the development of therapies for this type of neural damage.

MIDDLETON MEMORIAL VETERANS HOSP,WI,537052254,"Veterans are at increased risk for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA)—a type of liver cancer—due to their advanced age and increased incidence of hepatitis C virus and chronic liver disease. Despite the use of systemic chemotherapy, CCA is deadly with a 5-year survival of 10% in the advanced setting. Recent work has defined distinct molecular subtypes of CCA, however tuning precision strategies for an individual remains limited to a few select biomarkers and chemotherapy remains a standard of care, despite significant clinical toxicities.

Cannabis and related drugs have been increasingly used by US Veterans to try and treat several diseases including chronic pain, epilepsy, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Unfortunately, cannabis and related drugs also cause unwanted side effects that limit their usefulness.

As many as one third are resistant to antidepressants and they are at greatest risk for suicide. We have identified a proteomic biosignature for depression and responsiveness to therapy. Most recently, we have learned that platelets from depressed subjects show this biomarker and those from subjects undergoing successful treatment revert to “normal”.

Despite recent medical advances, there remains a substantial unmet need for additional effective MS treatments. Injury to the brain and spinal cord in MS is caused by autoimmune inflammatory T cells that enter the central nervous system and attack the myelin sheath. T cell activity is regulated by lipid and vitamin A metabolism. Our project focuses on the role of a metabolic enzyme we recently discovered to be expressed in T cells. Inhibiting this enzyme protects animals from developing MS- like symptoms. A detailed understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of immune suppression by targeting this metabolic enzyme may lead to new approaches to treat or prevent MS and possibly other autoimmune or inflammatory disorders.

Here we will develop a new animal model of Salla disease that circumvents the lethality of ISSD and other models through use of genetic and pharmacological combinations designed to uncover neuromodulators of SLC17A5 and enable the examination of two primary symptoms – convulsions and progressive neurodegeneration, to accelerate the path of therapeutic discovery for adults with this rare disorder.",1875985 (contact),"CALDWELL, GUY A (contact)","UMANAH, GEORGE KWABENA ESSIEN",2024-01-01,2025-12-31,Acceleration;Acute;Address;Adult;Age;Aging;alpha synuclein;Amino Acids;Animal Model;Animals;associated symptom;Ataxia;autosome;Behavior;Biological Assay;Biological Models;C. elegans genome;Caenorhabditis elegans;Carrier Proteins;CCL21 gene;Cell membrane;Cell model;Charge;chemical genetics;cholinergic;Classification;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Compensation;Convulsions;Coupled;course development;Databases;design;Disease;dopaminergic neuron;drug action;early childhood;Epilepsy;Equation;Exhibits;experience;Experimental Models;Finnish Type Sialic Acid Storage Disease;Functional disorder;gene product;Genes;Genetic;genetic analysis;genetic approach;Genetic Crosses;Genetic Induction;Glucuronic Acids;Glycolipids;Glycoproteins;Goals;Heritability;high reward;high risk;Human;Hydrolysis;Impairment;Incentives;Individual;infancy;Infantile Form Sialuria;Intellectual functioning disability;Invertebrates;Investigation;knockout animal;Knockout Mice;Link;lysosome membrane;Lysosomes;marginalization;Membrane Proteins;model development;model organism;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Muscle hypotonia;mutant;Mutation;Names;Nature;Nematoda;Nerve Degeneration;Nervous System;neural;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neuromodulator;neuronal excitability;neuronal survival;Neurons;neuroprotection;neuroregulation;neurotoxic;Organelles;Orphan Drugs;Orthologous Gene;overexpression;Pathogenicity;Patients;pharmacologic;Phenotype;Pilot Projects;Population;pre-clinical;Pre-Clinical Model;Predisposition;premature;progressive neurodegeneration;Proteins;Protons;Rare Diseases;Recycling;Research;Risk;Role;screening;Sialic Acids;solute;Statutes and Laws;sugar;Surveys;symporter;Symptoms;Therapeutic;Transgenic Animals;United States;United States National Institutes of Health;Variant,Phenotypic Analysis of SLC17A5 Neuromodulation in Salla Disease,135559,ZTR1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZTR1 RD-1 (01)],NA,NA,1,100000,49000,149000,NA

Contingency management (CM) is an intensive behavioral treatment that has significantly improved rates of stopping smoking in people with psychiatric disorders. CM provides positive reinforcers (e.g., vouchers, money) to Veterans who pass a biological test to show that they have not smoked since the last therapy session. This trial aims to test whether adding contingency management to combined PTSD and smoking cessation treatment will significantly increase treatment attendance and completion, greater reduction of PTSD and depressive symptoms, and greater rates of stopping smoking.",10353386 (contact),"DEDERT, ERIC A (contact)",NA,2019-10-01,2025-09-30,Abstinence;Aftercare;arm;Behavior Therapy;Behavioral;Biological Testing;Bupropion;Cessation of life;Cigarette;cigarette smoke;cigarette smoking;Clinic;Clinical Trials;Cognitive;Compensation;contingency management;Cotinine;Counseling;Data;depressive symptoms;disability;discounting;drug abstinence;Drug usage;effective intervention;Effectiveness;efficacy evaluation;evidence base;Evidence based treatment;experience;Fright;General Population;Goals;Guidelines;improved;Incentives;Individual;Intervention;long term abstinence;Manuals;Measures;Mediating;medical specialties;medication compliance;Mental disorders;Monitor;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality;negative affect;Nicotine;payment;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;Populations at Risk;Positive Reinforcer;Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders;Prevalence;prevent;programs;psychiatric symptom;Psychological reinforcement;Public Health;Randomized;reduce symptoms;Relapse;relapse prevention;Salivary;Self Efficacy;Smoke;Smoker;Smoking;smoking abstinence;smoking cessation;Smoking Cessation Intervention;smoking intervention;Smoking treatment;substance abuse treatment;substance misuse;Substance Use Disorder;substance use treatment;Symptoms;test strip;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;Time;Trauma;Treatment Efficacy;United States;Veterans;voucher,CPT-SMART for Treatment of PTSD and Cigarette Smoking,1757,ZRD1,ZRD1-MHBB-O(01)1,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA

Shared decision-making is a model that allows for discussion of all treatment options and empowers women to make informed health care decisions with consideration for their needs and preferences, usually through the use of a shared decision-making tool that decreases provider bias and increases provider knowledge while increasing the acceptability of care and counseling to the patient and the likelihood of adherence to the determined care plan.
