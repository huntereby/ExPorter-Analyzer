Decreased DNA methylation in heterochromatin is associated with aberrant expression of transposable elements, parasitic DNAs which are normally repressed in the genomes of healthy cells, and whose derepression leads to inflammation. The underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, but inflammation is almost invariably observed in both cancer and aging. We have recently observed that cells deficient in DNMT or TET proteins, which act to add or remove DNA methylation respectively, show similar losses of DNA methylation in heterochromatin, concomitantly with increased transposable element expression and inflammation.

Chronic pain in the setting of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is particularly prevalent and difficult to treat. Patients suffering TBI and additional injuries (polytrauma) are even more likely to experience chronic pain. Commonly employed treatments such as the use of opioids and NSAIDS are highly problematic in Veterans with TBI. On the other hand, recent evidence suggests that persistent pain after TBI results from damage to endogenous pain control mechanisms residing in the brainstem. Thus we may be able to reduce or even prevent pain after TBI by augmenting the actions damaged neural circuitry.

Clinicians lack the ability to provide the most accurate and up-to-date information to the family so that they can come to the best decision for the infant, as current prediction models rely on older data, are not tailored to the individual institution where the birth is occurring, and use limited information to make predictions; furthermore, there is a gap in knowledge in the following: how the use of prediction tools might impact counseling and clinical practice; whether tools can make any difference in outcomes such as survival without morbidity and length of stay before death; and the cost impact and cost-effectiveness of using such tools.  We propose to expand the knowledge base on prediction models for periviable gestation in an existing network of neonatal intensive care units in California – involving 140 hospitals from which to obtain data—by implementing the prediction model with established collaborative quality improvement methods, evaluating the impact of implementation on practices and outcomes, and examining the cost impact of implementation in clinical practice.",9254520 (contact),"LEE, HENRY CHONG (contact)","LONGO, MONICA",2023-06-01,2025-05-31,2 year old;Address;anxious;Behavior;Birth;California;Cessation of life;Clinic;Clinical;clinical care;clinical decision-making;clinical practice;cohort;Communities;cost;Cost Analysis;cost effectiveness;Cost Effectiveness Analysis;cost estimate;Counseling;Data;Data Aggregation;Data Collection;data infrastructure;data platform;Decision Making;Delivery Rooms;demographics;disability;electronic data;falls;Family;fetal;fetal diagnosis;follow-up;Gestational Age;hospital care;Hospitals;improved;improved outcome;Individual;Infant;Infant Care;innovation;Institution;Knowledge;knowledge base;Lead;Length of Stay;Life;Lifelong disability;Link;Methods;model building;Modeling;Modernization;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality;Mothers;National Institute of Child Health and Human Development;Neonatal;Neonatal Intensive Care Units;neonate;Neurodevelopmental Disability;Neurodevelopmental Impairment;Neurologic;Outcome;Outcome Study;Palliative Care;Patients;Performance;Perinatal;periviable;Population;population based;predict clinical outcome;predictive modeling;predictive tools;Pregnancy;Premature Birth;Prognosis;prognostic;Quality of Care;Randomized;Research;Resources;respiratory;Resuscitation;risk prediction;risk prediction model;Source;Survivors;Testing;Time;tool;Trauma;Uncertainty;Use Effectiveness;Variant,Improving outcomes of periviable births via an enhanced prediction tool,98287,HSOD,Health Services Organization and Delivery Study Section[HSOD],NA,NA,6,220386,93372,313758,NA

Developing innovative treatments that address these problems is necessary to improve long-term outcomes for stroke survivors. Aerobic exercise (AEx) can improve physical and cognitive function, and reduce depression. Additionally, AEx may enhance physical rehabilitation by making the brain more receptive to, and consequently improving the response to an intervention. Therefore, combining AEx with physical rehabilitation has the potential to improve multiple aspects of stroke recovery.

I will address these knowledge gaps by asking: (1) Does PV hypofunction arise from defective homeostatic plasticity within PV circuits, possibly related to a broad impairment of cellular homeostasis in ASD? (2) What transcriptional and translational mechanisms mediate PV circuit homeostasis, are these abnormal in ASDs, and can they be rescued by novel CRISPR-based strategies? (3) Do top-down feedback sensory projections exhibit abnormal PV inhibition?

Red blood cells, the most abundant cell type in the body, play a critical role in oxygen transport, a process that is mediated by hemoglobin and iron. Indeed, 66% of bodily iron is stored in red cells. Dysregulated iron metabolism has been shown to promote oxidative stress. Oxidant stress promotes lipid peroxidation, a hallmark of cell death by a mechanism referred to as “ferroptosis”. Red blood cells not only harbor many of the enzymes involved in the regulation of ferroptosis, but iron-induced oxidant stress is an established regulator of red cell aging and clearance in circulation. In this project we will leverage recently developed genetic and pharmacological tools to mechanistically test the role of ferroptosis on red blood cell aging, both in circulation in vivo and in vitro, during storage in the blood bank for transfusion purposes, a life-saving intervention for ~5 million Americans every year, ranked 1st in the list of historical breakthroughs that saved the most human lives (1 billion).",12431352 (contact);2098815,"D'ALESSANDRO, ANGELO  (contact);ZIMRING, JAMES C.","ZOU, SHIMIAN",2019-08-01,2028-04-30,Adult;Affect;African;Aging;Altitude;American;Anemia;Antioxidants;Area;Birth;Blood;Blood Banks;Blood Circulation;blood glucose regulation;Carcinogens;Cell Aging;Cell Death;Cell Death Process;Cell Nucleus;cell type;Cells;Chemistry;Circulation;Cysteine;Down-Regulation;Drug Metabolic Detoxication;Electrons;enzyme pathway;Enzymes;Erythrocyte Transfusion;Erythrocytes;Erythropoiesis;Etiology;Exercise;Exposure to;Face;Funding;gain of function;Genes;Genetic;genetic manipulation;Genetic Polymorphism;Genetic study;Genetic Transcription;Germ-Line Mutation;Glucose;Glutathione;Glutathione Disulfide;glutathione peroxidase;Hallmark Cell;Health;Hematopoiesis;Hematopoietic stem cells;heme a;Heme Group;Hemoglobin;Hemolysis;Hospitals;Human;Human body;Hypoxia;In Vitro;in vitro Model;in vivo;Individual;Inherited;inorganic phosphate;Intervention;Iron;iron (III) reductase;iron metabolism;Life;life span;Link;Lipid Peroxidation;Logistics;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Medical;Metabolism;methyl group;metropolitan;Mitochondria;Modeling;mouse model;Mouse Strains;Mus;Mutate;Mutation;NADP;novel;Organ;Organelles;oxidant stress;Oxidants;Oxidation-Reduction;oxidative damage;Oxidative Stress;Oxidoreductase;Oxygen;oxygen transport;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Pentosephosphate Pathway;Peptides;Peripheral;Persons;pharmacologic;Physiological Processes;Play;Population;Prevalence;prevent;Procedures;Process;Protein Biosynthesis;Proteins;Public Health;Reactive Oxygen Species;Recording of previous events;Recovery;Recycling;Regulation;repaired;Residual state;response;Role;six transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 3;Somatic Mutation;System;Testing;Time;Tissues;tool;TP53 gene;Transfusion;tumor;Up-Regulation;uptake;Vaccination;Variant;volunteer,The role of ferroptosis in red cell aging in vivo and in vitro,146442,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1 IVBH-D (02)],NA,NA,6,560598,163668,724266,NA

Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is an inherited disorder of mineral metabolism in patients with loss of function mutations in the tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase gene (ALPL). This disorder is associated with high neonatal morbidity and mortality, impaired musculoskeletal development, and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), yet the in utero origins of the disease are unknown and the ontogeny of development of lung pathology is poorly understood. The PI’s laboratory developed the first large animal model of HPP in sheep, creating an ALPL gene mutation in exon 10 (c.1077C>G) recapitulating the human HPP phenotype. As observed in human patients, but not in mice, neonatal lambs carrying a loss of function mutation in ALPL commonly have respiratory complications as neonates and have an increased incidence of pneumonia compared to wildtype control lambs throughout life. Preliminary findings in HPP sheep demonstrate severe lung pathology on Day 100 of gestation (GD100), suggesting programming of the postnatal lung phenotype during fetal development, and that the known postnatal respiratory complications result from more than insufficient rib cage mineralization. This sheep HPP model will be used to test the hypothesis that reduced TNSALP activity causes lung-specific developmental abnormalities, as well as deficiencies in diaphragm structure and respiratory function that contribute to RDS by the analyses of WT and HPP fetuses on GD130 and in lambs at 4 months of age. Specific Aim 1 will characterize the respiratory phenotype in WT and HPP sheep throughout development (GD130 and postnatal 4 months of age). Specific Aim 2 will determine the impact of HPP on resting lung function in 4 month old WT and HPP sheep by measuring arterial blood gases (pO2, pCO2), bicarbonate, pH, ammonia and lactate, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Specific Aim 3 will determine the efficacy of recombinant TNSALP therapy to rescue the developmental respiratory phenotype in HPP sheep using lentiviral GFP control or ALPL-GFP constructs injected into WT or HPP sheep zygotes. This interdisciplinary collaborative team includes a current clinical veterinary physiologist collaborator (an expert on respiratory diseases in ruminants) who will collect arterial blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids for assessment of lung pathophysiology. This study will provide the first investigations into the in utero developmental origins of the severe respiratory phenotype in sheep with HPP, and describe contributions of non-skeletal tissues (lung, lung-resident immune cells, diaphragm) to RDS in HPP. These findings will have immediate relevance to the management of RDS in human HPP.",1864743 (contact),"GADDY, DANA  (contact)","BARDHAN, SUJATA",2024-08-19,2026-07-31,Age;Age Months;Alkaline Phosphatase;Alveolar;Ammonia;Anesthesia procedures;Animal Model;Architecture;Bacterial Infections;Bicarbonates;Birth;Blood;Blood gas;Bronchoalveolar Lavage;Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid;Candidate Disease Gene;candidate validation;Cells;Clinical;Conceptus;CRISPR/Cas technology;Development;Disease;efficacy evaluation;Etiology;Exons;Exploratory/Developmental Grant;Fetal Development;Fetal Lung;Fetus;Functional disorder;Gene Mutation;gene therapy;Genes;Growth;Hereditary Disease;Histology;Human;Hypophosphatasia;Immune;Impairment;in utero;Incidence;Individual;Inflammation;Inflammatory;innovation;insight;Investigation;Laboratories;Life;loss of function mutation;Lung;lung development;Measures;Metabolism;mineralization;Minerals;Modeling;mouse model;Mus;Musculoskeletal Development;Musculoskeletal System;Neonatal;neonatal morbidity;Neonatal Mortality;neonate;novel;Pathogenesis;Patients;Phase;Phenotype;Pneumonia;Positioning Attribute;postnatal;Postnatal respiratory distress;Pregnancy;Protein Analysis;pulmonary function;Pulmonary Pathology;Recombinants;Reporting;Respiration;respiratory;Respiratory Diaphragm;Respiratory Disease;Respiratory distress;respiratory distress syndrome;Respiratory physiology;Rest;Rewards;rib bone structure;Risk;Role;Ruminants;Sheep;sheep model;single-cell RNA sequencing;Structure;Testing;Time;Tissues;Veterinarians;zygote,"Respiratory Distress in Sheep with Hypophosphatasia: Etiology, Functional Consequences and Rescue",114076,RIBT,Respiratory Integrative Biology and Translational Research Study Section[RIBT],NA,NA,1,150000,73105,223105,NA

As Type II Diabetes Mellitus rates continue to reach epidemic proportions, driving health and economic costs higher, the need to find safe, effective, and economically achievable therapies for the treatment of this disease is ever increasing. For this reason, much attention has been devoted to investigating pharmacological drugs based on the hormone GLP-1 for diabetes treatment, as it lowers blood glucose concentrations. Unfortunately, nausea and vomiting are the major side effects of all GLP-1-based drugs on the market, with ~25% of patients unable to tolerate effective doses. Novel research proposed here fully analyzes the effects of chemical attachment of vitamin B12 with an FDA approved GLP-1 based drug, the result of which is the complete elimination of all nausea and vomiting side effects, but retention of the desired blood glucose lowering profile – in essence creating a new second generation of improved GLP-1 therapeutics for diabetes treatment, which improves patient quality of life and expands the population that can benefit from such important therapies.",10499379;8870622;8077884 (contact),"DE JONGHE, BART C;DOYLE, ROBERT P;HAYES, MATTHEW R (contact)","LI, YAN",2021-03-01,2025-02-28,Acute;Agonist;Amaze;analog;Anatomy;Animal Model;Animals;Attention;Automobile Driving;Behavior;Behavioral;Beta Cell;Binding;Binding Proteins;Biological Assay;Blood;Blood Glucose;Body Weight;Body Weight decreased;Brain;Brain Stem;Cachexia;Carrier Proteins;Cell Line;Central Nervous System;Chemicals;Chronic;Clinical;cobinamide;comorbidity;Complex;Cystic Fibrosis;Data;design;diabetes management;Diabetes Mellitus;Diagnosis;diet-induced obesity;Disease;Dorsal;Dose;Drug Kinetics;Eating;Economic Burden;economic cost;Emetics;Epidemic;euglycemia;Event;exenatide;experience;experimental study;Family;FDA approved;Gastric Emptying;GCG gene;Generations;GLP-I receptor;Glucagon;glucagon-like peptide 1;Glucose tolerance test;glycemic control;Health Care Costs;HIV;Hormones;Human;human model;Hyperglycemia;Hypoglycemia;Hypothalamic structure;improved;In Vitro;in vivo evaluation;Incidence;incretin hormone;inhibitor;innovation;Insulin;insulin secretion;Intake;Intestines;Intracellular Transport;Intrinsic factor;Kaolin;Life;Ligands;Malaise;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammals;Marketing;Mediating;Mediator;Medical;meter;Modeling;mouse model;Mus;Nausea;Nausea and Vomiting;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;novel;Obesity;Outcome;Pancreas;Patient Compliance;Patients;Pattern;Penetrance;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacodynamics;pharmacologic;Pharmacologic Substance;Pharmacopoeias;Pharmacotherapy;Physiological;Population;pre-clinical;pre-clinical assessment;Prognosis;Public Health;Publishing;Quality of life;Rattus;reduced food intake;Reporting;Research;Rodent Model;Role;Shrews;Sick Role;side effect;Site;Structure of beta Cell of islet;subcutaneous;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Effect;Thinness;Tissues;Transcobalamins;United States;Vagus nerve structure;virtual;Vitamin B 12;Vitamins;Vomiting,Second generation GLP-1 agonists without nausea/emesis side effects,128443,IPOD,Integrative Physiology of Obesity and Diabetes Study Section[IPOD],NA,NA,4,422206,146859,569065,NA

To determine how auditory mechanics work in humans, we will measure the cochlear partition motion of very fresh human cadaveric ears, investigate relevant cochlear anatomical properties, and incorporate the resulting motion and anatomical information into computational models that will allow us to further investigate and explain human cochlear behavior. Our proposed research will advance our understanding of human hearing mechanics to elucidate how the cochlea functions (e.g., to achieve sensitive hearing and fine frequency discrimination), enable us to better understand the applicability and limitations of animal experiments for human hearing, and result in computational models that are valuable for both scientific investigation and for improving the diagnosis and treatment of hearing disease.  ",10281299 (contact),"NAKAJIMA, HIDEKO HEIDI (contact)","CYR, JANET",2013-09-17,2026-02-28,3-Dimensional;Affect;Anatomy;Animal Experiments;Animal Model;Animals;Architecture;Auditory;Automobile Driving;Autopsy;Basilar Membrane;Behavior;Bone Conduction;Cadaver;Cavia;Characteristics;Chinchilla (genus);Cochlea;Cochlear duct;comparative;Computer Models;Coupled;Data;Development;Diagnosis;Discrimination;Ear;Elements;Etiology;Felis catus;flexibility;Frequencies;Fresh Tissue;Future;Gerbils;Hair;Hair Cells;Hearing;Hearing problem;Histologic;Histology;Hour;Human;human model;Image;improved;In Situ;Inner Hair Cells;Investigation;Knowledge;Laboratory Animals;Learning;Location;Mammals;Measurement;Measures;mechanical drive;Mechanics;Microscopy;Modeling;morphometry;Motion;Mus;Names;Optical Coherence Tomography;Organ of Corti;Outer Hair Cells;Pathology;Pillar Cell;Preparation;pressure;Process;Property;Psychoacoustics;Radial;reconstruction;Research;Research Personnel;Resolution;Rest;Rotation;Scanning Electron Microscopy;Scientific Inquiry;Sensorineural Hearing Loss;soft tissue;Specimen;Spiral Lamina;Structure;Surface;Techniques;tectorial membrane;Testing;Time;Tissues;Transducers;Translations;vibration;Visual;Work;X-Ray Computed Tomography,Human Cochlear Structure & Function,13303,AUD,Auditory System Study Section[AUD],NA,NA,10,289184,202430,491614,NA

Identifying mechanisms underlying morphine’s proinflammatory effects worsening allodynia rather than suppressing it in PAE offspring is critical as clinical research suggests that individuals with a history of PAE are more likely to engage in substance use disorders, and a biological vulnerability to develop adverse neuroimmune interactions from opioids exposure may play a role, in part, to future opioid misuse.",12608751 (contact),"NOOR, SHAHANI  (contact)","EGLI, MARK",2022-03-01,2027-02-28,Acute;Adult;Alcohol abuse;alcohol exposure;Alcohols;allodynia;Animal Model;antagonist;Astrocytes;Behavioral;Biological;cell type;Cells;Central Nervous System;Chronic;chronic pain management;circular RNA;Clinical;Clinical Research;Cognitive;Curiosities;cytokine;Data;Disease susceptibility;Dose;Down-Regulation;Endogenous Factors;enhancing factor;Etiology;Evaluation;Family;Fetal alcohol effects;Fetal Alcohol Exposure;Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder;Functional disorder;Future;Gene Expression Profiling;Goals;High Prevalence;Hyperalgesia;Immune;Immune System Diseases;Immunologic Receptors;in vivo;Individual;Infiltration;Inflammasome;Inflammatory;Injury;Interleukin-1 beta;Investigation;late life;Light;Macrophage;Macrophage Activation;marenostrin;Mediating;Messenger RNA;Minor;Modeling;Morphine;mouse model;mu opioid receptors;Mus;Naloxone;Nerve;nerve injury;neurobehavioral;Neuroglia;Neuroimmune;Neurologic Dysfunctions;novel;offspring;Opioid;opioid exposure;opioid misuse;Outcome;overexpression;Pain;Pain management;Pathologic;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Peripheral;Physiological Adaptation;Population;pre-clinical;Predisposition;Pregnancy;Prevalence;Process;Production;Proteins;Public Health;Rattus;receptor;Receptor Activation;Receptor Signaling;Recording of previous events;response;Risk;Risk Factors;risk mitigation;Role;Signal Transduction;single-cell RNA sequencing;Spinal;stem;Substance abuse problem;substance use;Substance Use Disorder;Therapeutic;TNF gene;Toll-like receptors;Touch sensation;Transcription Initiation;Untranslated RNA;Work,Prenatal alcohol exposure generates vulnerability to the proinflammatory effects of morphine and adverse neuroimmune consequences,29694,NAL,Neurotoxicology and Alcohol Study Section[NAL],NA,NA,3,252549,124037,376586,NA
