To facilitate positive maternal-newborn interactions, mothers need to learn effective caregiving NAS strategies while they are pregnant, yet, an enormous gap exists in the early education of mothers on the symptoms and progression of NAS, in part because no interventions exist to prepare future mothers for the challenges of caring for their newborns at risk for NAS.

It is characterized by extensive hypoxia-induced, mitochondria-dependent phenotypic changes such as a glycolytic respiration, decreased ability to undergo apoptosis and extensive invasiveness which are linked to GBM's resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. Mitochondrial LonP1 is an ATP-stimulated protease, directly up-regulated by HIF-1α. LonP1 is overexpressed in human malignant gliomas and its elevated expression levels are associated with high glioma tumor grade and poor patient survival. Therefore, regulation of mitochondrial function by inhibiting LonP1 protease could represent a novel approach for GBM and potentially other fast-growing malignancies which heavily depend on hypoxic adaptation. The proposed project is based on our preliminary results obtained from in vitro (cell-based) studies with our LonP1 inhibitor compound BT317 and in vivo LonP1-overexpression xenograft models studies.

Limited patient ambulation is the norm of care for older adults during hospital stay and is directly related to the loss of independent ambulation that occurs in hospital settings.

We will advance the opportunities for use of silk proteins in biomedical applications by tailoring the sequence and structure of the silk fiber produced by the Indianmeal moth through control over environmental conditions (humidity, temperature, pathogens) and control over the actual biopolymer sequence using targeted genetic engineering strategies, highlighting a new way to leverage the biodiversity of insect species for healthcare applications.",10492444 (contact),"STOPPEL, WHITNEY L (contact)","ASLAN, KADIR",2022-08-15,2027-06-30,Address;Agriculture;Amino Acid Sequence;aqueous;Award;Bacteria;Binding;Biochemical;Biodiversity;Biological;Biophysics;Biopolymers;Bombyx;Bombyx mori;Chemicals;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Collection;design;Embryo;Fiber;Fibroins;Future;Gene Modified;Genetic Engineering;Goals;Growth Factor;Healthcare;Human;Humidity;Immune response;Implant;implantation;improved;In Vitro;in vivo;Injections;Insecta;Interruption;Investigation;Length;Lepidoptera;Life Cycle Stages;Mammalian Cell;manufacture;mechanotransduction;Medical Device;Medicine;Modification;Moths;Muscle rehabilitation;Natural regeneration;Outcome;pathogen;Peptides;Pharmacologic Substance;Phase;Phenotype;Polymers;Population;Process;Production;protein aminoacid sequence;Proteins;Public Health;Pupa;Research;Research Personnel;scale up;Silk;Site;Solvents;Stimulus;Structure;success;surgery material;Temperature;Tissue Engineering;tissue reconstruction;tool;Traction;Transcriptional Regulation;Translations;United States Food and Drug Administration;Work,Leveraging biodiversity and utilizing genetic engineering to expand the structure and function of silk fibroin biopolymers for biomedical applications,147041,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-BCMB-F(55)R],NA,NA,3,250000,111192,361192,NA

In this proposal, we build on our formative feasibility trial of the Mediational Intervention for Sensitizing Caregivers for CBOs (MISC-CBO) that has shown positive mental health outcomes for Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC). We will conduct a repeated measures cluster randomized trial to fully establish the effectiveness and transdiagnostic mechanisms of action, cost- effectiveness and implementation climate and readiness of MISC-CBO. Our program of research is therefore in line with the third strategic objective of the NIMH (“Strive for prevention and cure”) that articulates the need for validated targets for interventions, and improved methods to match interventions to underserved individuals and populations that can be scaled for greater public health impact. Once the efficacy of MISC-CBO has been fully established, it has the potential to be adapted and used to address other public health epidemics that impede supportive caregiving and positive child development. Empowered CBO careworkers can for instance work with parents to transfer their MISC skills, or MISC can be adapted and evaluated in families in which one or both parents are substance abusers, have serious mental illness or other disabilities, and/or are absent from the home due, for example, to incarceration or death.

Thus, multimodal, robust therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to eliminate HBV cccDNA, which sustains viral replication and is refractory to the current antiviral regimens. Recently, we have designed and selected the most specific and potent gRNA/Cas9 HBV gene-editing drugs using HBV cellular models. We have also developed an exosome-based drug delivery system that can specifically deliver these synthetic gRNA/Cas9 RNP drugs to human hepatocytes. In this proposal, we will evaluate the antiviral efficacy and any potential off-target effects of these dual specific HBV gene-editing drugs, both in vitro and in vivo. The objective of this project is to lay the foundation for future clinical studies to achieve our long-term goal of curing chronic HBV infection.

The proposed studies will provide a high-resolution roadmap of critical gene expression programs and intercellular interactions in the pancreatic cancer microenvironment that facilitate perineural invasion, which will guide the repurposing and development of therapeutics against this pervasive cause of morbidity and mortality in pancreatic cancer and many other malignancies.",10675977 (contact),"HWANG, WILLIAM L (contact)","LIM, SUSAN E",2022-07-01,2027-06-30,Address;Adrenergic beta-Antagonists;Advisory Committees;Alleles;Area;axon guidance;Biochemical;Cancer Biology;cancer cell;Cancer Etiology;cancer initiation;Candidate Disease Gene;career development;Cell Communication;Cell Nucleus;cell type;Cells;Cessation of life;Coculture Techniques;cohort;Collaborations;Committee Members;CRISPR-mediated transcriptional activation;Critical Pathways;Custom;Data;density;Development;Development Plans;digital;Education;epidemiology study;Epithelium;Excision;experience;Fibroblasts;Formalin;Frequencies;Future;Gene Expression;Gene set enrichment analysis;Genes;Genetic Heterogeneity;Genetically Engineered Mouse;glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor;Goals;Guide RNA;Heat-Shock Response;Human;human data;Immune;Immunofluorescence Immunologic;Immunohistochemistry;immunoregulation;improved;in vivo;in vivo Model;Invaded;Investigation;Kinetics;Knock-in;Knowledge;lentivirally transduced;Libraries;Link;Literature;live cell imaging;lymphatic Invasion;Machine Learning;machine learning classifier;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Malignant Neoplasms;Maps;Mediating;Mediator;medical schools;Mentors;Mesenchymal;Metabolic;migration;Molecular;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality;mouse model;multiplexed imaging;nano-string;Nature;Neoplasm Metastasis;neoplastic;neoplastic cell;Nerve;Nerve Fibers;neurogenesis;Neuroglia;neuron component;neuronal tumor;Neurons;neurotransmission;Non-Malignant;novel;organoid transplantation;Organoids;Outcome;Pain;Pancreas Transplantation;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Paraffin Embedding;Pathologic;Pathologic Processes;Patients;perineural;Peripheral Nerves;Phenotype;Physicians;Play;preclinical study;preservation;Principal Investigator;Prognosis;programs;Property;Proteomics;recruit;Recruitment Activity;Recurrence;Research;Research Proposals;Resolution;Role;Sampling;Scientist;SEMA3E gene;single nucleus RNA-sequencing;spatial relationship;symposium;Synaptic plasticity;targeted treatment;Techniques;therapeutic development;therapy development;therapy resistant;Tissue Microarray;Tissue-Specific Gene Expression;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomics;transplant model;tumor;Tumor Biology;tumor microenvironment;tumorigenesis;tumorigenic;United States;Universities;Work,Elucidating cancer-intrinsic mechanisms of perineural invasion in pancreatic cancer,270417,NCI,Career Development Study Section (J)[NCI-J],NA,NA,3,292150,22757,314907,NA

We aim to identify the neurophysiological brain signature of pain relief using resting state Near Infrared Spectroscopy and Electroencephalography (rsNIRS/EEG).

Successful completion of these studies will a) identify a critical period during pregnancy or early infancy when iron treatment is effective, b) provide mechanistic insights into how early life iron nutrition programs brain mitochondrial functional capacity across the lifespan and c) provide a biological foundation for the need for early-life biomarkers of brain iron status to prevent long-term dysfunction.",1863083 (contact),"GEORGIEFF, MICHAEL K.

The inability of insulin to suppress hepatic glucose output but still to activated de novo lipogenesis has been referred to as selective insulin resistance.
