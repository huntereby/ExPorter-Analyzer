Sepsis is caused by infections, including bacteria and viruses. Sepsis can result in widespread inflammation and, in severe cases, death and disability. Small circulating cells in the bloodstream, called platelets, mediate inflammation and blood clotting during sepsis. We have found that sepsis increases interferon-responsive genes in platelets and their parent cells, megakaryocytes. Interferon is an inflammatory cytokine that is usually increased during sepsis. We have also found that one of these interferon-regulated genes, called IFITM3, controls the movement of proteins in platelets and megakaryocytes. Our studies will examine how IFITM3 controls protein movement in cells to regulate blood clotting during inflammation and sepsis.

The goal of this project is to develop novel computational radiomic tools which with routine CT scans could help identify those Veterans with Stage III NSCLC who could (1) potentially avoid immunotherapy since it might not confer added benefit over chemoradiation alone, (2) determine when a disease stable status has been achieved so that an IO duration prediction can be made (6 vs 12 months), and (3) predict adverse events like pneumonitis to inform Veteran care.",8352708 (contact);9761583,"MADABHUSHI, ANANT  (contact);NOCK, CHARLES J",NA,2019-01-01,2027-09-30,Adverse effects;Adverse event;American Society of Clinical Oncology;Artificial Intelligence;Biological;Biological Markers;Biopsy;cancer diagnosis;cancer immunotherapy;Cancer Patient;Caring;Cessation of life;chemoradiation;Chemotherapy and/or radiation;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Computers;cost;Cost Savings;Data;Development;Diagnosis;Disease-Free Survival;Goals;Habitats;Healthcare Systems;Image;Immune;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immune system;immune- related response criteria;immune-related adverse events;Immuno-Chemotherapy;Immunotherapy;Maintenance;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Molecular;Morbidity - disease rate;Morphology;Mutation;New York;Nodule;Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma;novel;Ohio;optimal treatments;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pattern;PD-1/PD-L1;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Placebos;Prediction of Response to Therapy;predictive marker;prognostic;programmed cell death ligand 1;Progression-Free Survivals;Publications;Publishing;Pulmonary Inflammation;Quality of life;Radiation;radiological imaging;radiomics;Regimen;response;Shapes;Stable Disease;standard of care;success;Survival Rate;Texture;tool;Toxic effect;Travel;treatment duration;Treatment Protocols;tumor;tumor microenvironment;Universities;University Hospitals;Unresectable;Veterans;Veterans Health Administration;Work;X-Ray Computed Tomography,RadIO: A Novel Radiomics Toolkit to Predict and Characterize Response to Immunotherapy in Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,4121,ZRD1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRD1 ONCB-A (01)],NA,A1,6,NA,NA,NA,NA

We have found that mild hypoxia triggers blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption in young mice that is exacerbated by microglial depletion, and that hypoxia-induced BBB disruption is far greater in aged mice, suggesting that microglia play an important vasculoprotective role in young mice, but this mechanism may be less effective in the aged brain. As aging induces the appearance of a “primed”, pro-inflammatory microglial phenotype, here we will test the hypothesis that : (1) mild hypoxia triggers vascular leak and microhemorrhage in the brain, resulting in neuronal damage and cognitive decline, (2) vascular disruption is worse in the aged and the hypertensive, (3) microglia play an important vasculoprotective role in stabilizing the BBB, but this declines with age, and (4) repopulating the aged brain with young microglia or attenuation of microglial activation state, could stabilize the BBB and reduce cognitive impairment.",7124829 (contact),"MILNER, D.

Thus, oligodendrocyte replacement therapy is a critical prerequisite for white matter restoration and cognitive dysfunction and dementia. CCA hypoperfusion activate astrocytes, which will eventually form glial scar that impedes the regeneration and reestablishment of fiber networks. The proposed experiment will use a novel strategy to convert activated astrocytes into oligodendrocytes in situ in a novel model CCA hypoperfusion models that mimic arteriosclerotic CCA stenosis.

The mechanism by which TX attenuates Mn toxicity is not well understood, but our preliminary findings show that a transcription factor RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) is critically involved in TX-induced neuroprotection against Mn toxicity. Delineating the molecular mechanism by which REST affords neuroprotection will not only impart novel insight into mechanisms of Mn-induced neurotoxicity, but also identify novel targets for strategies to combat manganism and diseases related to dopaminergic neuronal dysfunction, such as PD.

Injury to white matter (WM) is present in most stroke patients. Importantly, stroke in small brain vessels, occurs in subcortical WM regions and accounts for 25% of all strokes, and is the second leading cause of dementia.

Inappropriate antibiotic use contributes to bacteria developing resistance to these drugs and adverse patient outcomes. The nursing home population is particularly vulnerable to the effects of inappropriate antibiotic use due to their increased susceptibility to infections, high antibiotic use, and increased susceptibility to adverse drug effects, including drug side effects and complications such as Clostridium difficile colitis. Antibiotic choice is guided in part by the patient’s allergy history, with penicillin being the most commonly reported and over-diagnosed allergy leading to unnecessary avoidance of these and related drugs with potentially negative consequences, including increased drug resistance and adverse events. The current project is a crucial first step toward improving evaluation and management of penicillin allergies of veterans in nursing home settings, thereby providing better and safer care for this vulnerable population.",8582453 (contact),"BORZECKI, ANN MARIE (contact)",NA,2020-08-01,2022-01-31,acceptability and feasibility;Address;Administrator;Adverse drug effect;Adverse effects;Adverse event;adverse outcome;Advisory Committees;Affect;Allergic;Antibiotic Resistance;Antibiotics;antimicrobial;Area;Awareness;Bacteria;Belief;care costs;Caring;Clinical;Clinical Pathways;Clinical Pharmacists;community living;Consensus;Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research;contextual factors;design;Development;Diagnosis;Discipline of Nursing;Drug resistance;Drug Side Effects;effectiveness testing;emerging antibiotic resistance;Evaluation;evidence base;Exposure to;Family;Family member;frailty;Future;Geriatrics;Goals;Guidelines;health belief;Health Care Costs;Hospitalization;Hypersensitivity;Hypersensitivity skin testing;implementation strategy;implementation study;improved;improved outcome;Individual;Infection;infection burden;innovation;Inpatients;Instruction;interest;Intervention;Interview;Knowledge;Label;Leadership;Long-Term Care;Methodology;Methods;Modeling;Modification;Nurse Practitioners;Nurses;Nursing Homes;older patient;Oral;Outcome;Outpatients;Pathway interactions;patient oriented;patient safety;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Penicillin Allergy;Penicillins;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacy facility;Physicians;Pilot Projects;Policy Maker;Population;Predisposition;Process Assessment;Provider;Pseudomembranous Colitis;Public Health;Publishing;Recommendation;Recording of previous events;Reporting;residence;Resistance development;Risk;risk perception;Role;Site;Specific qualifier value;Structure;Testing;tool;Treatment Failure;uptake;Veterans;Vulnerable Populations,Improving the Evaluation and Management of Penicillin Allergy,3143,HSR6,"HSR-6 Aging, Recovery, and Workforce[HSR6]",NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA

PTBS has been widely advertised throughout the VA and Veteran service organizations. However, use of PTBS has been only modest.

We are proposing to integrate outcome-driven and machine learning-based techniques together to first  estimate a desired postoperative face, and then plan the bony surgery, which will revolutionize the  surgical planning technique and enable clinicians to develop an optimal surgical plan based on both facial  and bony information, on-the-fly, using a single software in their routine clinical practice.",6803709 (contact),"GATENO, JAIME  (contact)","IIDA, HIROKO",2013-05-01,2026-07-31,3D Print;Achievement;Algorithms;American;Anatomy;Appearance;Biomechanics;bone;Clinical;clinical practice;Complex;Computer software;Computer-Assisted Surgery;Congenital Abnormality;craniomaxillofacial;Databases;Defect;Deformity;design;Development;Ear;Elements;Face;Generations;Goals;Head;Hour;Impairment;improved;Individual;Jaw;Laboratories;Learning;learning network;Lip structure;Location;Machine Learning;mandible/maxilla;Methods;Modeling;Motivation;Movement;Operative Surgical Procedures;orthognathic;Outcome;Patient Care;Patients;personalized care;Planning Techniques;Positioning Attribute;Postoperative Period;Precision therapeutics;prevent;Process;Progress Reports;Psyche structure;psychologic;Quality of Care;Reconstructive Surgical Procedures;Reporting;Residual state;risk minimization;Running;Shapes;skeletal;Skeleton;Slide;soft tissue;Structure;success;Surgeon;surgery outcome;System;Techniques;Testing;Time;Trauma;Treatment outcome;treatment planning;Validation;virtual surgery;Work,Outcome-Driven Approach to Minimize the Risks of Facial Distortion Following CMF Surgery,21863,BCHI,Biomedical Computing and Health Informatics Study Section[BCHI],NA,NA,9,478944,143126,622070,NA

Under the guidance of my mentors, I will 1) characterize the preferences of patients, parents, and oncologists with respect to optimal content, timing, and delivery of prognostic disclosure, 2) partner with stakeholders to develop a framework and communication intervention, and 3) test the feasibility and acceptability of implementing this intervention to promote timely, individualized prognostic communication in the setting of advancing pediatric cancer.",12507299 (contact),"KAYE, ERICA CARMEN (contact)","RADAEV, SERGEY",2022-08-01,2027-11-30,"acceptability and feasibility;advanced disease;Advanced Malignant Neoplasm;aged;anti-cancer research;arm;Award;Bereavement;cancer care;Cancer Patient;career;career development;Child;Child Care;Clinical;Clinical Investigator;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials Design;cognitive testing;cohort;Communication;communication behavior;Communication Research;Concept Formation;Data;Data Analyses;Decision Making;Dedications;design;Development Plans;Diagnosis;Disclosure;dissemination trial;Distress;Documentation;evidence base;Evolution;experience;Family;feasibility testing;Future;Goals;improved;Intervention;Intervention Studies;Interview;Investigation;K-Series Research Career Programs;Knowledge;Learning;Longitudinal Studies;Malignant Childhood Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;member;Mentors;Mentorship;Methods;Oncologist;Palliative Care;parenting intervention;Parents;Patient Preferences;Patients;Pediatric Oncologist;Pediatric Oncology;Perception;personalized approach;phase 3 study;Phase I/II Trial;Pilot Projects;pilot test;Positioning Attribute;post intervention;preference;preservation;primary outcome;Process;Prognosis;prognostic;prognostication;programs;randomized trial;Randomized, Controlled Trials;Recommendation;Refractory;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Science;secondary outcome;Site;skills;stakeholder perspectives;Structure;Testing;Therapeutic;therapy design;Time;tool;Training;trial enrollment;usability;user centered design;Work",IMPROVING PROGNOSTIC COMMUNICATION IN PEDIATRIC CANCER,266935,NCI,Career Development Study Section (J)[NCI-J],NA,NA,2,233411,18673,252084,NA

Approximately 90% of infected persons have latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), have protective immunity and remain well, but 10% develop primary tuberculosis (TB) soon after infection or reactivation TB many years later. TB is the leading cause of death in HIV-infected persons and more than half a million coinfected people die annually. Children are more susceptible to TB infection, due to an immature immune system. HIV infection in children markedly increases susceptibility to TB. To develop adequate prophylaxis or therapy, it is important to understand immune responses to Mtb. Identification of HIV+ children with LTBI who are at greatly increased risk for development of TB would allow treating only high-risk children, facilitating completion of therapy for LTBI and preventing future development of TB. To identify these children, it is important to pinpoint the nature of the defective immune responses that permit development of active TB in HIV+LTBI+ pediatric patients. This proposal will identify a novel memory-like NK cell subpopulation mediated mechanisms that regulate immune responses and pinpoint the nature of the defective responses that permit development of active TB in HIV-LTBI+ and HIV+LTBI+ children.

Obesity worsens many aspects of cardiovascular disease by increasing insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. One strategy for promoting weight loss is to increase energy expenditure by activating brown adipose tissue. Brown adipose tissue metabolizes fat to generate heat rather than usable energy. We have discovered a secretory phospholipase that activates brown adipose tissue. We propose to further define the novel role of this phospholipase. We will discover the mechanisms underlying the activation of brown adipose tissue and determine how this secretory phospholipase improves insulin sensitivity. Answering these questions will suggest strategies for altering adipose tissue metabolism and improving insulin responsiveness.

While much emphasis has been placed on studying beta cell biology, very little is known about the mechanisms controlling alpha cells in health or in diabetes. Decreased levels of islet-enriched nuclear factors may contribute to islet dysfunction in T2D. In this grant, we will investigate how loss of one such factor, MAFB, affects the function of human alpha cells. In addition, we will broadly define how alpha cell activity and health are compromised under insulin resistant conditions that mimic the metabolic environment of T2D.

The initial tissue damage in the spinal cord tissue is caused by the mechanical impact, but then significantly enlarged by a cascade of reactions, including inflammation in the spinal cord. Messenger factors, so called cytokines, are important regulators of the inflammatory response. We have previously shown that the cytokine IL-12 mediates tissue damage and impairs recovery in a model of SCI.

Within minutes after nerve injury, there is a robust inflammatory response characterized by the release of pro-inflammatory mediators from specialized cells in the spinal cord and the periphery. These mediators initiate neuropathic pain through the hyperexcitation of pain-propagating nerve cells which then ultimately leads to chronic pain. This proposal will investigate SRI-42127, a novel drug that inhibits HuR, a key protein which drives the production of inflammatory mediators linked to neuropathic pain. This molecule can be given peripherally (e.g. on the battlefield) and it quickly suppresses the induction of these pain-producing inflammatory mediators and mitigates the genesis of NP.

Fibrosis can affect every organ or tissue and, when it develops, diminishes the quality of life and can be even deadly. Fibrosis is particularly prevalent in Veterans as a consequence of their military exposures. There is no cure for fibrosis and the available therapies provide limited to moderate relief. A body molecule called IL-33 works in conjunction with another molecule called ST2 to promote fibrosis. Previous studies focused on this IL-33 – ST2 axis and yielded important information that may allow for therapeutic targeting by innovative therapies. However, not all IL-33-driven features of fibrosis can be explained by this axis’ functioning. Our research has suggested that both IL-33 and ST2 can also contribute to the fibrotic process independently, in an “off-axis” fashion. We will study such independent contributions by IL-33 and ST2 to lay the ground for future development of better therapies against fibrosis.",8684601 (contact),"LUZINA, IRINA G.

Particularly, A. baumannii is a leading cause of hospital acquired infections as well as secondary infections in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, A. baumannii has become increasingly difficult to treat due to antibiotic resistance, leaving few, if any, options for treatment; therefore, new approaches to treat these infections are critically needed. P-lactamase enzymes, which inactivate P-lactam antibiotics, are a nearly universal resistance mechanism present in A. baumannii; however, the collateral consequences due to P-lactamase overexpression are not well understood.

In the past few years, ASO and similar biologicals have been approved for the treatment of uncommon genetic diseases and most recently high cholesterol. Here we test an ASO that causes a shift in naturally occurring enzyme isoforms in blood vessel smooth muscle cells. It is predicted to make them more sensitive to the signals that dilate the blood vessel; thereby, lowering blood pressure and improving blood flow and ameliorating symptoms of heart failure. Advantages over current therapies could include greater potency by influencing multiple signlaing pathways, and prolonged duration of effect enabling infrequent treatment and improved patient compliance.

Opioids are a poor option for managing mTBI and other chronic pain conditions because of significant side effects, paradoxical pain, and misuse potential. We have shown that green light therapy (GLED) is effective in several pain conditions, including mTBI.

Many recent deployments including to Somalia, Iraq, and Afghanistan were in dengue endemic areas; veterans who served in these areas are potentially at risk for severe dengue disease if exposed again. A dengue vaccine, TDV/TAK003, has recently shown good safety and protection in 4.5 years of followup. However the mechanisms of protection are not yet fully understood. Using samples already collected from vaccinees and U.S. veterans as part of our ongoing study, and collaborations which will provide us with samples from people who have had multiple dengue infections and are therefore protected, we will define the durability of immunity provided by the TDV/TAK003 vaccine. We will determine the specificity and durability of antibodies, memory B cells, and other potentially protective antibody mediated functions. We will determine if a recently described T cell phenotype is able to kill dengue infected cells in the lab. Finally, we will use a mouse model to determine if immune cells and antibodies can mediate durable protection in a mouse model.

The negative impact of this devastating condition on veterans will increase enormously unless new therapies that can minimize the secondary brain damage during acute phase after TBI are tested in preclinical animal models and propagated to clinical trials. Vitamin C (ascorbate) is an FDA-approved and safe compound for human use which is shown to promote neuroprotection by modifying epigenetics. Hence, we will test the long-term effects of ascorbate therapy in rodents of both sexes subjected to TBI.

Understanding how they and future variants resist this fundamental antiviral system will provide insights into SARS-CoV-2 transmission and illness. The science to be done is important for pushing the field forward by helping us understand early stages of human immune defense against SAR-CoV-2, and how that impacts development of later “adaptive” immune responses such as antibodies and T cells.

These exposures are now presumed to be linked to the development of lung cancer and other respiratory diseases. Yet, the mechanism by which DRREs in the Persian Gulf render Veterans susceptible to lung cancer is poorly understood. Our findings in mouse models indicate that respiratory exposure to Gulf War Toxins induces sustained inflammation in the lung, driven by alterations in how genes are expressed (epigenetics). We propose to (1) study epigenetic changes in lung specimens from deployed Gulf War Veterans with lung cancer, (2) expose mice to aerosolized gulf war toxins and determine the impact on developing cancer, and (3) reverse epigenetic alterations in cancer causing pathways.

The aims of this proposed study will address this need and are consistent with the VA’s clinical care goals. Findings will potentially greatly benefit the VA and its role as a leader in providing high quality care and empirically-validated treatments to Veterans.",9845253 (contact),"SCHIEHSER, DAWN M.

We will identify patient groups at higher risk of adverse outcomes from PS (mortality, overdose, psychosis, mania, and substance abuse), and quantify the amount of increased risk. This will enable our Partners (OMHSP & PBM) to promote reduced use or increased monitoring of PS in these high- risk groups. We will also quantify risks attributable to prescriber choices, such as prescribing certain forms (immediate versus extended release) or high doses of PS, or choosing to continue PS despite “warning signs” (e.g., tox screen results). Findings will directly inform the PDSI as it occurs.

Through supportive accountability, Peer Specialists can maximize the reach and engagement of these apps with patients and improve drinking outcomes.

The knowledge gained by our Center will inform future NIMBC management through 1) the development of novel urinary profiling strategies that could risk stratify aggressive NMIBC (Project 1-3); 2) the identification of targets for future precision intervention, either by enhancing/sustaining the tumor- restraining mechanisms (Project 1) and/or inhibiting the tumor-promoting mechanisms (Project 2).",8781273 (contact);6182841,"CHAN, KEITH SYSON  (contact);THEODORESCU, DAN","KAI, MIHOKO",2022-09-22,2027-08-31,Address;Affect;anti-cancer research;Antitumor Response;B-Lymphocytes;Basic Science;Benchmarking;Bioinformatics;Biological;Biological Markers;Biology;biomarker development;biomarker validation;Bladder;Cancer Biology;Cancer Patient;cancer recurrence;cancer type;candidate marker;carcinogenesis;Carcinogens;Cell Communication;cell type;Cells;Clinical;clinical practice;cohort;Coin;Communication;Communities;Data;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;driving force;Ensure;fibroblast-activating factor;Fibroblasts;Fingerprint;functional genomics;Funding;Future;Genes;Genomics;Goals;Human;Immune;Immunoassay;Individual;induced pluripotent stem cell;innovation;insight;Knowledge;knowledge integration;Lesion;Lymphoid Tissue;lymphotoxin beta receptor;Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder;Malignant Neoplasms;Maps;Mediating;Medical center;Modeling;mouse model;Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial;multidisciplinary;Muscle;neoplastic cell;non-muscle invasive bladder cancer;novel;Organ;Outcome;Paracrine Communication;Pathologic;Pattern;personalized intervention;Persons;Pilot Projects;Population;Primary Lesion;progenitor;Prognosis;programs;Property;prospective;Protein Secretion;Proteins;Proteomics;recombinase;recruit;Recurrence;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Resource Sharing;restraint;risk stratification;Role;Sampling;Side;single cell technology;single-cell RNA sequencing;success;T-Lymphocyte;tertiary lymphoid organ;transcriptomics;translational oncology;tumor;tumor growth;tumor progression;Tumor Promotion;understudied cancer;urinary;Urine;urologic;Urothelial Cell;Validation;Yin,The stromal microenvironment as a co-organizer of bladder carcinogenesis  and progression,274375,ZCA1,ZCA1-SRB-2(M1),NA,NA,3,1325665,239162,1564827,NA

US service personnel and Veterans are exposed to various conditions representing risk factors for vestibular hypofunction, including jet fuel vapors and treatments with known ototoxic agents including aminoglycoside antibiotics. There is recent evidence indicating that it may be associated with dizziness secondary to traumatic brain injury. The proposed research plan represents a comprehensive investigation of peripheral vestibular hypofunction in an animal model through which direct cellular, electrophysiologic, and behavioral correlates will be obtained. In particular, we will test whether vestibular hypofunction is associated with loss of synaptic structures as has been found in the cochlea.

This project proposes to study a strength training program using blood flow restriction (BFR) in people with advanced disability due to MS. BFR uses a device that partially blocks blood flow to the exercising limb and causes a response in the muscle which can replicate the effects of high-intensity training using much lower intensities. This is ideal for people with MS who have advanced disability, as they often cannot tolerate higher intensity exercise due to severe weakness and fatigue.
