We propose to test the R-pyocin susceptibility of a panel of P. aeruginosa isolates under conditions relevant to the cystic fibrosis lung environment and in an acute murine respiratory model of infection to provide the much-needed justification for further consideration of R-pyocins as potential antibacterial agents to treat P. aeruginosa infections.",1860790 (contact),"GOLDBERG, JOANNA B (contact)","XU, ZUOYU",2023-07-01,2025-06-30,Acute;acute infection;Acute Pneumonia;Anti-Bacterial Agents;Antibiotic Resistance;Antibiotics;antimicrobial;Antimicrobial Resistance;Award;Bacteremia;Bacteria;Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance;bacteriocin;Bacteriophages;Binding;Biological Assay;Cessation of life;Chemicals;Chronic;chronic infection;cystic fibrosis infection;cystic fibrosis patients;Cystic Fibrosis sputum;Development;efficacy testing;Environment;Gene Expression;Genetic Materials;Goals;Grant;Growth;Head;hospital care;Hour;improved;In Vitro;in vivo;Individual;Infection;Laboratories;Life;Lipopolysaccharides;Lung;Lung infections;Lytic;Methods;Modeling;mouse model;Multi-Drug Resistance;Mus;Nosocomial Infections;Nosocomial pneumonia;novel therapeutics;Nucleic Acids;Nutritional;O Antigens;opportunistic pathogen;pathogen;pathogenic bacteria;Patients;Pneumonia;pneumonia model;Predisposition;priority pathogen;Pseudomonas aeruginosa;Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection;Publishing;Pulmonary Cystic Fibrosis;Reporting;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Resistance;resistance gene;respiratory;Serotyping;Site;Spottings;Structure;Tail;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Agents;Translating;United States National Institutes of Health;validation studies;virulence gene,Pyocins as antibacterials to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections,178702,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-AIRT-J(01)],NA,NA,2,168029,70540,238569,NA

Thus, the development of novel treatments to eliminate apnea and mitigate associated co-morbidities is imperative. We will address this mandate by determining if repeated exposure to mild intermittent hypoxia (MIH) mitigates cardiovascular dysfunction and performance fatigability. We propose that exposure to MIH has a multipronged effect. MIH directly targets cardiovascular co-morbidities, while simultaneously enhancing upper airway stability and increasing the arousal threshold. These modifications may serve to directly mitigate apnea. Alternatively, these modifications may serve to improve treatment adherence with continuous positive airway pressure.

As a CAP member, the laboratory actively participates in all activities associated with the Cooperative Agreements: sample collection, testing, proficiency testing, training seminars, conferences, face-to- face annual meetings, IT integration and method validation assignments. As an ISO17025:2005-2017 accredited laboratory, we’ve had a quality management system in place since 2011 with a dedicated quality assurance staff and procedures in place to assure good laboratory practices. We have laboratory facilities to assure the proper environment for advanced instrumentation in addition to secure sample custody and laboratory space. As a current FDA FERN, ISO and AFRPS cooperative agreement-funded laboratory, the laboratory is applying for five years of funding through the FDA Laboratory Flexible Funding Model (LFFM) Cooperative Agreement Program’s Discipline A Microbiology Track 2, 3, 4 and 5 and Discipline D Special Project Track 1, 2, 3 in order to enhance the capacity and capabilities of the laboratory in support of an integrated food safety system. The laboratory will participate in:  1. The use of various standardized cultural, biochemical and molecular analytical methods for the  detection and identification of foodborne pathogens in human and animal food (Discipline A  Microbiology Track 2 and 3). The laboratory will participate in human and animal food  sample analysis for surveillance assignments, food emergency outbreak testing, and ensure  large-scale food emergency event surge capacity by using various standardized cultural and  biochemical analytical methods for the detection and identification of pathogens. The WSDA  FS&CS Laboratory has trained staff and equipment to perform testing of pathogens as well as  serological analysis for Listeria monocytogenes (Poly O, Type 1 and Type 4), Escherichia coli  O157:H7 (O157 and H7), and E. coli STEC Big Six (all six O types).  2. Sequence using Whole Genome Sequencing for at least 100 isolates of pathogens.  The laboratory has the training and equipment to sequence and will upload sequences into  GenomeTrakr (Discipline A Track 4).  3. Gaining capacity for Cyclospora testing (Discipline A Track 5). The laboratory needs to gain  capacity by request of our food safety partners and to be a supportive member of the  integrated national laboratory system. The laboratory has worked hard to find funding to  support Cyclospora testing and was able to secure very small funding support to send its  microbiologists for a week long training at FDA Bothell in FDA BAM 19b Molecular Detection  of Cyclospora cayetanensis in Fresh Produce using Real-Time PCR method. We have some  equipment to support the test but we must purchase several more pieces, therefore we  require support.  4. The collection of samples (>1,000) (Discipline D Track 1). For decades, we have utilized  annual sampling agreements with our regulatory inspection partners. Our laboratory’s self-  sample collection history dates back to 2001 as a member of the USDA AMS Microbiological  Data Program (MDP) and for regulatory purposes. Training provided by USDA included  aseptic sampling technique, preserving sample integrity during transit, and maintaining  complete chain of custody documentation. Our sampling experience has only grown stronger  as a FDA FERN MCAP participant. For instance we collected over 3,600 samples in the last 2  years for testing by our FERN lab.  5. The integration of NFSDX-ORAPP systems with our data collection systems. We worked  closely with FDA for integrating our system to eLEXNET, so we desire to work on this new  integration. (Discipline D Track 2)  6. The Validation of a qPCR screening method for Salmonella in Foods (Discipline D Track 3).
