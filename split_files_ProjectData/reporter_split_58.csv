Implementing new programs in the 37 TCUs across the country, AIHEC will provide additional resources for American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) students to pursue coursework and careers that will enable them to act as healthcare providers and researchers. This project provides a comprehensive approach to growing a networked community of AIAN and non-Native researchers, educators, and community practitioners to implement traditional knowledge practices in addressing AIAN health issues and continuously improve Native health and health research practices and outcomes. The lack of tribal healthcare researchers and providers perpetuates health disparities and a lack of equity in tribal communities. Furthermore, studies show that communities with tribal healthcare providers and researchers have a higher treatment adherence and fewer mortalities or serious illnesses. Promoting the advancement of AIAN students will not only benefit the students. Still, it will also lead to healthier tribal communities, increased compliance with healthcare visits and interventions, participation in clinical trials, and a reduction in the primary causes of illness and mortality such as diabetes, substance use disorders, injuries, homicide, and suicide. The long-term goals of the project are: To expand a community of Indigenous research practice in health/health sciences at the nation’s TCUs; to establish TCUs as essential tribally-centered components of the national health sciences research and education infrastructure; to improve the quality of health services provided to AIANs using a science-based empirical approach to intervention development and evaluation that is relevant to Native peoples and communities and based on core tribal values, cultures, and traditions; to expand the TCU component of the health research and education career pipeline to recruit, support, and provide critical linkages for AIAN students to pursue health careers; to empower tribes and tribal communities to develop and control their research agenda and connect that research to tribal values and needs, and to promote the integration of Indigenous knowledge and Western knowledge.",16306083 (contact),"CHARETTE, RENO L (contact)",NA,2022-09-20,2026-07-31,Address;Alaska Native;American Indian community;American Indians;Biological Sciences;career;career development;Career Exploration;Case Study;Clinical Trials;Communities;Community Networks;Country;Course Content;COVID-19;design;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Education;Educational process of instructing;Educational workshop;Elements;empowerment;Epidemiology;Equity;Evaluation;expectation;experience;Faculty;Focus Groups;Future;Goals;graduate student;Group Interviews;Health;Health Care Visit;health disparity;Health Personnel;health science research;Health Sciences;Health Services;higher education;Homicide;Hybrids;improved;Indigenous;indigenous community;Individual;infection rate;Infrastructure;Injury;Instruction;interest;Intervention;Interview;Knowledge;Learning;learning materials;learning outcome;Logistics;meetings;member;Mentors;Modification;mortality;Native-Born;non-Native;online delivery;Outcome;outreach;Ownership;pandemic disease;Participant;Persons;programs;Provider;recruit;Research;research in practice;Research Personnel;Resources;response;Risk;satisfaction;Schedule;Science;Specialist;Student Persistence;Student recruitment;Students;Substance Use Disorder;success;Suicide;summer institute;Surveys;symposium;System;therapy development;Time;Travel;treatment adherence;tribal community;tribal healthcare;tribal Nation;Tribes;United States Indian Health Service;Vision;web site;webinar;Work,American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC) Building Indigenous Research Capacity in Health (BIRCH) project,142131,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-BDCN-N],9317,NA,3,390477,105076,NA,495553

These data will be used to guide a future randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study to test the efficacy of real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback as a first-line treatment intervention for reducing suicide-specific rumination in Veterans.",1988051 (contact),"SZESZKO, PHILIP R (contact)",NA,2024-07-01,2026-06-30,acceptability and feasibility;Adult;Aftercare;age difference;Attenuated;Autobiography;Award;Brain;Brain imaging;Brain region;Client satisfaction;Clinical;Clinical assessments;clinical care;cognitive reappraisal;Communities;Data;Daydreams;Diagnostic;disability;Disability scale;Double-Blind Method;efficacy evaluation;efficacy testing;experience;Feasibility Studies;Feedback;Feeling suicidal;follow-up;frontal lobe;Functional impairment;functional independence;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Funding;Future;Goals;Health;imaging study;improved;insight;Interruption;Intervention;Learning;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Maintenance;Measures;Medial;Mental Health Services;Meta-Analysis;Methods;military veteran;Mind;Mission;neural circuit;Neurobiology;neurofeedback;Patient Self-Report;personalized strategies;Pharmaceutical Preparations;placebo controlled study;Play;Prefrontal Cortex;Psyche structure;Psychologist;Publishing;Quality of life;Questionnaires;Randomized;Recording of previous events;reducing suicide;Reporting;Research;Rest;Risk Factors;Role;rumination;sample fixation;Sampling;satisfaction;Severities;Sex Differences;Signal Transduction;Social Adjustment;Stimulus;suicidal behavior;suicidal risk;Suicide;Suicide attempt;Suicide prevention;suicide rate;Testing;Thinking;Time;Veterans;Work;World Health Organization,Reducing Suicide-Specific Rumination in Veterans using Real-time Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Neurofeedback,5132,RRDS,Rehabilitation Research and Development SPiRE Program[RRDS],NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA

Cardiac arrest is a common and devastating cardiac and neurological emergency affecting almost 400,000 victims in the US every year, many of whom are successfully resuscitated but then die in the hospital or are left with severe disability from injury to the brain during the cardiac arrest. Immediate temperature control and cooling of comatose survivors of cardiac arrest is now commonly used to try to reduce the brain injury, but it remains uncertain whether it is truly effective, how long a survivor of cardiac arrest should be cooled, and which patients are more likely to benefit. This clinical trial proposes to first determine whether longer durations of cooling improve recovery better than shorter durations, and secondly to determine the best duration of cooling, in comatose patients resuscitated from either of two different types of cardiac arrest.",6613979;7929197 (contact),"RAMAKRISHNAN, VISWANATHAN ;YEATTS, SHARON DZIUBA (contact)","SOPKO, GEORGE",2019-09-19,2025-08-31,"Accident and Emergency department;Address;Affect;Applications Grants;Assessment tool;Brain;Brain Injuries;Cardiac;Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation;Case Report Form;Categories;Cerebral Ischemia;Cessation of life;Clinical;clinical investigation;clinical practice;clinical research site;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees;Collection;Coma;Common Data Element;Companions;Data;Data Coordinating Center;data management;data quality;Data Set;Databases;design;Development;Devices;disability;Dose;electronic data;Eligibility Determination;Emergency Situation;Enrollment;Evaluation;experience;Goals;Guidelines;Health Sciences;Heart;Heart Arrest;Hospitals;implementation facilitation;improved;improved outcome;Infrastructure;Injury;innovation;Left;Link;Manuscripts;Medical;method development;Methods;Michigan;Monitor;Multi-site clinical study;Multicenter Trials;National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute;natural hypothermia;Neurologic;Neurological emergencies;Neurological outcome;neurological recovery;novel;Online Systems;organizational structure;out-of-hospital cardiac arrest;Outcome;Outcome Assessment;patient population;Patient Selection;Patients;Performance;Periodicals;pre-clinical;Procedures;Protocols documentation;Public Health;Qualifying;Randomized;Recommendation;Recovery;Reporting;Research Design;Resources;response;Risk;Role;Safety;Selection Criteria;South Carolina;Specific qualifier value;Survivors;System;Talents;Temperature;Therapeutic;treatment effect;trial design;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Work",2/2 ICECAP: Influence of Cooling duration on Efficacy in Cardiac Arrest Patients,145272,CLTR,Clinical Trials Review Study Section[CLTR(MA)],NA,NA,5,1,0,1,NA

Identification of the ontogenic, molecular, cellular and circuit mechanisms is crucial for understanding childhood social, cognitive and anxiety disorders and for the identification of intervention and treatment advances. Neuregulin 1 (NRG1), and CHRNA7 [15q13.3] (encoding the a7nAChR) are key modulators of nervous system development. Signaling via the a7nAChR is a critical driver of the GABA excitatory/inhibitory [E/I] shift, mediated via the chloride transporters, NKCC1 and KCC2. Here we will use a novel transgenic mouse model of NRG1 overexpression, molecular biology, cell biology, slice electrophysiological approaches and behavioral neuroscience to examine the role of a novel NRG1 isoform on brain development (spanning from birth to adulthood) as it mechanistically relates to cortical maturation of GABA transmission and E/I balance, neurobehavior.

Recently, we discovered that this disparity may be the result of a heightened adaptive stress response signaling in the tumor microenvironment of AA linked to IBC risk factors, which can lead to greater capacity for clonal evolution of death-resistant tumor cells contributing to aggressive, therapy-resistant disease. As the incidence is rising and targets for therapy are scant, IBC has the potential to become a major public health disparity concern.

Aggressive phenotypes and/or therapy failure seen in CRPC patients have been linked to the increased tumor cell metabolism and an androgen receptor (AR) splicing variant termed AR-V7, both of which are correlated with poorer prognosis in the clinic. However, the mechanisms underlying altered tumor metabolism and AR-V7- releated oncogenic programs in CRPC are far from clear. Our recent preliminary studies point to YY1, a zinc finger transcription factor showing significant overexpression during disease progression of CRPC. YY1 maintains high expression of both metabolic genes and the AR-V7-related gene targets. YY1 thus constitutes a completely new mechanism that might account for major malignant alterations in metabolism and androgen signaling seen in CRPC. The current proposal will explore this novel mechanism that underscores CRPC progression and therapeutic resistance.

Project Narrative Recent advances by the two major long-read sequencing companies, PacBio and Oxford Nanopore, have enabled complete sequencing of the human genome and as a result, many major genomic research programs and genetic testing companies are racing to implement long-read whole genome sequencing (WGS) as a standard of care for genetic testing in the near term, and for comprehensive precision medicine programs in the future. For such an effort to succeed, long read sequencing workflows must be adapted to use high- throughput automated liquid handling equipment to further reduce sequencing costs, to improve workflow reproducibility, and to eliminate sources of operator error. This grant proposal seeks to accelerate implementation of long-read sequencing in precision medicine (and genomic research broadly) by creating a high-throughput, flexible, cost-effective size-selection system for DNA sequencing library preparation that is easy to integrate with standard liquid handling robotics.",1922238 (contact),"BOLES, TRUETT C (contact)","NOVA, IAN CURTIS",2022-08-03,2026-06-30,Acceleration;Agar Gel Electrophoresis;All of Us Research Program;Applications Grants;Biological Assay;biological research;Buffers;Cells;clinical sequencing;cost;cost effective;design;Development;Diffusion;DNA;DNA Library;DNA sequencing;Electrodes;Electrophoresis;Elements;Equipment;fetal;flexibility;Future;Gel;Genetic Diseases;genetic disorder diagnosis;genetic testing;genome sequencing;Genomic medicine;Genomics;human genome sequencing;human pangenome;improved;instrumentation;Libraries;Link;liquid biopsy;Liquid substance;magnetic beads;Measurement;Methods;molecular sequence database;Molecular Weight;Monitor;nanopore;novel therapeutics;operation;Output;patient health information;Performance;Physiologic pulse;Plasma;platinum electrode;Positioning Attribute;Power Sources;Precipitation;precision medicine;Preparation;printed circuit board;programs;Property;Race;Reproducibility;Research;Robot;Robotics;Running;Sampling;Sepharose;sequencing platform;Services;Source;standard of care;System;Technology;Time;tumor;United States National Institutes of Health;voltage;waveguide;whole genome,High-throughput size-selection system for long-read sequencing library preparation,12531,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1 MCST-G (15)],NA,A1,2,936842,0,1002420,NA

Project Narrative . Cardiac arrest is a common and devastating cardiac and neurological emergency affecting almost 400,000 victims in the US every year, many of whom are successfully resuscitated but then die in the hospital or are left with severe disability from injury to the brain during the cardiac arrest. Immediate temperature control and cooling of comatose survivors of cardiac arrest is now commonly used to try to reduce the brain injury, but it remains uncertain whether it is truly effective, how long a survivor of cardiac arrest should be cooled, and which patients are more likely to benefit. This clinical trial proposes to first determine whether longer durations of cooling improve recovery better than shorter durations, and secondly to determine the best duration of cooling, in comatose patients resuscitated from either of two different types of cardiac arrest.",9122974;9363044 (contact);8225056,"GEOCADIN, ROMERGRYKO ;MEURER, WILLIAM JOSEPH (contact);SILBERGLEIT, ROBERT","SOPKO, GEORGE",2019-09-19,2025-08-31,Accident and Emergency department;Adult;Adverse event;Affect;Assessment tool;Brain;Brain Injuries;Cardiac;Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation;Categories;Cerebral Ischemia;Cessation of life;Clinical;clinical investigation;clinical practice;Clinical Trials;Coma;Data;Development;Devices;disability;Dose;Emergency Situation;Enrollment;Evaluation;Goals;Guidelines;Heart;Heart Arrest;Hospitals;improved;improved outcome;Infrastructure;Injury;innovation;Left;Link;Methods;natural hypothermia;Neurologic;Neurological emergencies;Neurological outcome;neurological recovery;Neuropsychology;out-of-hospital cardiac arrest;Outcome;Outcome Assessment;patient population;Patient Selection;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Performance;Population;pre-clinical;Quality of life;Randomized;Recommendation;Recovery;Reporting;Resources;response;Safety;Selection Criteria;Survivors;Talents;Temperature;Therapeutic;treatment effect;United States National Institutes of Health,1/2 ICECAP: Influence of Cooling duration on Efficacy in Cardiac Arrest Patients,145269,CLTR,Clinical Trials Review Study Section[CLTR(MA)],NA,NA,5,4259923,617863,1,NA

Approximately 10,000 children in the US are born every year with congenital heart defects that necessitate urgent open-heart surgery with CPB to correct the defect. However, while the patient is on CPB, the heart and other major organs are exposed to a lack of oxygen (hypoxia). The hypoxic environment drives a vicious cycle in which the heart tissue is damaged, negatively altering blood flow and reducing oxygen levels, and depriving all organ systems even further of oxygen. This cycle can result in a spectrum of post-operative complications, including reduced heart function, long-term neurological deficits, and kidney failure. This SBIR Phase IIB project will focus on testing OMX during bypass surgery in a clinically-relevant large animal model of congenital heart defect to validate OMX as a therapeutic to preserve heart and peripheral organ function in neonates requiring corrective heart surgery.",1903030;1885854;2314012 (contact),"FINEMAN, JEFFREY R;MALTEPE, EMIN ;WINGER, JONATHAN A (contact)","OCTOBER, TESSIE",2017-08-01,2026-08-31,Acute;Address;Advanced Development;analytical method;Animal Model;antagonist;Aorta;Asphyxia Neonatorum;Award;Biological Response Modifier Therapy;Blood flow;Body System;Bypass;California;cardiac repair;Cardiac Surgery procedures;Cardioplegic Solutions;Cardiopulmonary;Cardiopulmonary Bypass;Carrier Proteins;Carrying Capacities;Cerebrum;CHD1 gene;Child;Child health care;Childhood;Clinical;clinically relevant;Closure by clamp;congenital heart abnormality;Congenital Heart Defects;Contracts;Data;Defect;deprivation;design;Development;Disease;disease model;Dose;Endothelin;Environment;experience;Exposure to;Formulation;Free Radicals;Functional disorder;Good Manufacturing Process;Heart;heart defect;heart function;heart preservation;hemodynamics;Hemorrhagic Shock;Hepatic;Human;hypoperfusion;Hypoxia;hypoxic ischemic injury;improved;Induced Heart Arrest;Infant;inhaled nitric oxide;Ischemia;Kidney;Kidney Failure;lamb model;Lead;Left;Liver;Lung;manufacturing organization;manufacturing process;Medical;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;Myocardial;Myocardial Ischemia;Neonatal;neonatal care;neonatal patient;neonatal pulmonary hypertension;neonate;Neurologic Deficit;Newborn Infant;Nitric Oxide;novel;Operative Surgical Procedures;Organ;organ injury;Organ Preservation;Oxygen;Pamphlets;Pathology;Patients;pediatric patients;Performance;Perioperative;Peripheral;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Phase I Clinical Trials;Phase Ia/Ib Clinical Trial;Postoperative Complications;Postoperative Period;preclinical study;preservation;Process;Production;protective effect;Proteins;Regimen;Research Personnel;Safety;San Francisco;Shunt Device;Small Business Innovation Research Grant;stem;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;therapeutic candidate;Tissues;translational approach;Treatment Efficacy;Universities;Variant,Development of an oxygen delivery biotherapeutic for the preservation of myocardial function during pediatric cardiopulmonary bypass,94414,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-IVBH-V(10)B],NA,NA,6,806794,123666,995592,NA

In particular, there are few systematic methods to stabilize an individual PPI. For drug discovery, stabilization could be as important as inhibition; for chemical biology, stabilization offers much greater specificity, allowing us to study the role of a single PPI in a complex network. For example. 14-3-3 proteins alter the function of hundreds of proteins, regulating major signal-transduction pathways, transcription factors, and cell-cycle progression. In this project, we will develop protein-protein stabilization approaches that will allow us to prospectively target specific 14-3-3/client complexes with drug-like molecules.

Abnormal coupling between left ventricle and aorta contributes to pathogenesis of target organ damage particularly heart failure (HF). This is the first ever study to assess the vascular interaction with cardiac structure / function / mechanics in a population-based cohort of Hispanics, incorporating comprehensive pressure-flow vascular measurements to complement cardiac structure and function assessments including myocardial speckle tracking analyses. The proposed research leverages multiple existing NIH resources and is highly relevant to public health because of the elevated HF risk profile of Hispanics. Assessment of vascular function concomitant with cardiac parameters in Hispanics will add to the HF risk prediction model, improve the conceptual framework of HF risk and provide insight into future strategies to prevent or delay HF in this high-risk segment of the population by preventing or improving abnormal vascular function. Identification of Hispanics with abnormal vascular function will help to differentiate those with asymptomatic diastolic dysfunction who are at the highest risk for progression to HF and other adverse events. In addition, we propose the opportunity for a pooled cohort analysis of vascular function across African-Americans, Hispanic and Caucasians making our project highly relevant to NIH’s mission of Big Data to Knowledge research priority initiatives, establishing a large vascular data repository resource for future collaboration. Lastly, the proposed research also represents a novel approach to uncovering latent longitudinal patterns of changes in cardiac phenotypes to identify subpopulations with high-risk for progression to clinical HF. Investigation into these aforementioned important areas will be extremely promising in learning about Hispanic cardiovascular health and highly relevant to future public health planning.",7613007 (contact),"RODRIGUEZ, CARLOS JOSE (contact)","KUNZ, JOHN FREDERIC",2022-09-01,2026-08-31,"Acceleration;Acculturation;Address;Adverse event;Affect;African American;African American population;Age;aging brain;Ancillary Study;Aorta;Area;Big Data to Knowledge;biracial;Black Populations;Blood Vessels;brachial artery;Cardiac;Cardiac Output;cardiovascular health;Cardiovascular system;Carotid Arteries;Caucasians;Characteristics;Clinical;clinical risk;Clinical Trials;cohort;Cohort Analysis;Collaborations;Color;Communities;comorbidity;Complement;cost effective;Coupled;Coupling;Data;data repository;Data Set;design;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Dilatation - action;Disparity;Early identification;Echocardiography;electric impedance;Endothelium;ethnic difference;ethnic minority;femoral artery;Femur;follow-up;Framingham Heart Study;Functional disorder;Funding;Future;Goals;Health;health disparity;Health Planning;Heart;Heart Abnormalities;Heart failure;heart imaging;hemodynamics;high risk;Hispanic;Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos;Hispanic Populations;Hypertension;Impairment;improved;Incidence;Infrastructure;innovation;insight;Intervention;Investigation;Jackson Heart Study;Latino Population;Learning;Left;Left atrial structure;Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction;Left Ventricular Mass;Left ventricular structure;Link;Measurement;Measures;Mechanics;Mediating;Memory impairment;middle age;Mission;Monitor;mortality;Myocardial;Myocardial dysfunction;National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute;next generation;Not Hispanic or Latino;novel strategies;Obesity;Organ;Outcome;Parents;Participant;Pathogenesis;Patient Care;Patients;Pattern;Persons;Phenotype;Physiologic pulse;Population;population based;Predisposition;preservation;pressure;Prevalence;prevent;progression risk;psychosocial;Public Health;Publishing;pulmonary arterial pressure;Pulse Pressure;Pump;racial difference;racial minority;radial artery;Relaxation;Research;Research Priority;Resistance;Resources;Right ventricular structure;Risk;Risk Factors;risk prediction model;Role;screening;Signal Transduction;social culture;Social Discrimination;Social isolation;sociodemographics;Socioeconomic Status;Statistical Methods;Stroke Volume;Structure;Study of Latinos;System;Testing;Tissues;Underrepresented Populations;United States;United States National Institutes of Health;unnecessary treatment;vascular abnormality;Vascular Diseases;Vascular System;Ventricular;Vulnerable Populations;Work",Vascular Determinants of Stage B HF among Hispanics: the role of the Heart-Vascular Interaction,158156,CHSA,"Cancer, Heart, and Sleep Epidemiology A Study Section[CHSA]",NA,NA,3,1014147,180503,1194650,NA

Lung transplantation is a well-established surgical intervention in advanced stages of the disease. Despite improvements in surgical procedures and immunosuppressive therapeutics, the median survival rate of the transplanted lung continues to be approx. 6 years. Chronic rejection of the transplanted lung is the most important obstacle to its long-term survival. Current state of-the-art reference technique for detecting chronic rejection is histopathological grading of transbronchial biopsies (TBBs). However, this is a highly invasive technique with several limitations, such as bleeding, inconsistent outcomes, and detection at advanced stages of the disease. Therefore, molecular imaging agent capable of allowing non-invasive assessment of chronic rejection after transplantation is a highly desirable diagnostic tool in nuclear medicine yet continues to be an unmet need. To accomplish this objective, this project is focused upon advancing the lead PET tracer further from preclinical development phase to prepare data for regulatory approvals and simultaneously assess its potential to image chronic rejection of the transplanted lung in mouse models at earlier stages. Of note, this project builds on pilot promising data with the new probe in mouse lung transplant model and human specimens. It is anticipated that successful accomplishment of proposed aims could deliver data for translation of a new PET molecular imaging agent for assessment of acute lung injury through first human studies, and a versatile noninvasive tool for stratification of patients with a risk factor for developing chronic lung allograft dysfunction thus nudging lung transplantation landscape towards image-guided pulmonary medicine.",7835217;3129652 (contact),"GELMAN, ANDREW ERIC;SHARMA, VIJAY  (contact)","MONGODIN, EMMANUEL FRANCK",2023-09-01,2027-05-31,A549;Acute;Acute Lung Injury;Aging;Air;Allografting;alveolar epithelium;Alveolar Macrophages;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Apoptosis;Asthma;Atherosclerosis;Biochemical;Biodistribution;Biopsy;Blood Vessels;Bronchoalveolar Lavage;Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Fractionation;Cell Line;Cells;Characteristics;Chronic;Chronic Disease;Chronic lung disease;circulating biomarkers;cohort;Data;Detection;detection method;Development;Dexrazoxane;Diabetes Mellitus;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;diagnostic tool;Diameter;Discipline of Nuclear Medicine;Disease;DNA;Dose;dosimetry;drug efficacy;Drug Kinetics;Early Diagnosis;Epithelial Cells;Exhalation;Female;fibrotic lung disease;first-in-human;Flow Cytometry;Fluorescence;fluorescence imaging;Fluorescent Dyes;fluorodeoxyglucose;Free Radicals;Functional disorder;Generations;Genetic Transcription;Graft Rejection;Hemorrhage;Histologic;Histopathologic Grade;Homeostasis;Human;Hydrogen Peroxide;Image;image guided;imaging agent;imaging probe;Immunosuppression;improved;infection risk;Infiltration;Inflammation;Injections;Intervention;Lead;Left;Life;Lipids;Literature;Location;Longitudinal Studies;Lung;lung allograft;Lung Diseases;lung imaging;lung injury;Lung Transplantation;Macrophage Activation;male;Measures;Mediating;Membrane;Metabolism;Mitochondria;mitochondrial dysfunction;Modeling;Mole the mammal;Molecular;molecular imaging;Monitor;mouse model;Mus;muscle physiology;Names;nano;Non-Invasive Detection;Operative Surgical Procedures;Organ Transplantation;Outcome;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress;oxidized lipid;Oxygen;pathogen;Pathogenesis;Pathology;patient stratification;Patients;Performance;PET/CT scan;Phase;Physiological;Pilot Projects;Play;Positron-Emission Tomography;pre-clinical;Pre-Clinical Model;preclinical development;Procedures;Production;Proteins;Psoriasis;Pulmonary Fibrosis;Pulmonary Inflammation;Pulmonology;Radiometry;radiotracer;Reactive Oxygen Species;Reference Standards;Regimen;Reporter;Reporting;Resources;response;Rest;Rheumatoid Arthritis;Risk;Risk Factors;Rodent;Role;Running;Safety;Saline;Signal Transduction;Skeletal Muscle;Solid;Specificity;Specimen;Structure of parenchyma of lung;Structure-Activity Relationship;Superoxides;Survival Rate;System;Tail;Techniques;Therapeutic;Tissues;tool;Toxicology;Tracer;Translations;transplant model;Transplantation;Treatment Efficacy;uptake;Validation;Veins,PET Tracer for Imaging of Lung Inflammation,167277,IPCA,Imaging Probes and Contrast Agents Study Section[IPCA],NA,NA,2,433236,240446,673682,NA

Our approach is to genetically alter cells to produce proteins of interest, such as chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), fused to a small bacterial enzyme called E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (eDHFR). eDHFR binds very tightly to the clinically-used antibiotic trimethoprim (TMP) and eDHFR-expressing cells will take up and bind TMP. We have engineered two derivatives of TMP. The first is coupled to a radioactive isotope that allows quantitative imaging of eDHFR and eDHFR expressing cells in animals using positron- emission tomography. The second is the focus of this research project, a version of TMP that is tethered to another small molecule, pomalidomide (POM). These TMP-POM molecules guide eDHFR-fusion proteins to the protein degradation machinery (e.g. the proteosome) of the cell causing destruction of the fusion protein. We will apply these molecules to show their ability to regulate the expression of diverse fusion partner proteins, to show their mechanism of action, and to improve the therapeutic window of CAR T-cells.

The findings will have an impact on juvenile traffic courts’ practices and policies aimed to improve teen driving safety by reducing MVCs and MVC-related injuries and deaths, which aligns with NICHD’s ongoing research priority.",8608266 (contact),"YANG, JINGZHEN GINGER (contact)","DIXON, CINNAMON ANNE",2020-09-08,2025-08-31,"Address;Adolescent;Adopted;Adoption;Age;Agreement;Area;arm;Automobile Driving;Cause of Death;Cessation of life;Collaborations;Communication;Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research;contextual factors;Control Groups;Cost Analysis;cost effective;cost effective intervention;cost effectiveness;County;court;distracted driving;driving behavior;driving safety;effective intervention;effectiveness evaluation;Effectiveness of Interventions;effectiveness-implementation RCT;Enrollment;Evaluation;evidence base;Evidence based program;Failure;Feedback;Goals;group intervention;Hearing;high risk;high risk population;Hybrids;implementation intervention;implementation research;implementation science;improved;Injury;innovation;Intervention;intervention delivery;Interview;Laws;Legal Guardians;Letters;Licensing;Methods;multidisciplinary;National Institute of Child Health and Human Development;Ohio;Outcome;Outcome Study;parenting intervention;Parents;peer;Pilot Projects;Policies;Population;Process;Program Sustainability;programs;Protocols documentation;Randomized;Randomized, Controlled Trials;Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance;recidivism;recruit;Research;Research Priority;Risk;risky driving;Rural;rural setting;Safety;Seat Belts;skills;Specialist;Speed;Technology;teen drivers;teen driving;Teenagers;Testing;Training;Translating;United States;universal prevention;Urban Population;urban setting;Vehicle crash",Adoption and Implementation of an Evidence-based Safe Driving Program for High-Risk Teen Drivers,100420,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-DIRH-N(09)],NA,NA,5,421010,154773,575783,NA
