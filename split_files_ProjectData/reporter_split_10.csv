Is it possible that this mitochondrial transfer may represent a novel non-autonomous mechanism to supply energy and promote neuron-oligodendrocyte-vascular recovery after stroke? Here, we propose that post-translational modification by O-GlcNAc amplifies extracellular mitochondrial functionality and efficient mitochondrial transfer that can accelerate the blood-brain barrier repair, remyelination and improve neuroplasticity. Therefore, these mechanisms should boost sensorimotor recovery and ameliorate post-stroke dementia after focal ischemia.",10996106 (contact),"HAYAKAWA, KAZUHIDE  (contact)","BOSETTI, FRANCESCA",2022-02-15,2027-01-31,Acceleration;Aging;Allografting;angiogenesis;Animals;Astrocytes;behavioral outcome;Blood - brain barrier anatomy;Blood Vessels;brain endothelial cell;Cell Survival;Cells;Central Nervous System;Cerebral endothelium;Cerebral Ischemia;Cognitive;Cognitive deficits;cognitive function;cognitive recovery;cognitive testing;Collaborations;Confocal Microscopy;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cyclic ADP-Ribose;Data;Dementia;deprivation;Electrophysiology (science);Elements;Endothelial Cells;Endothelium;Energy Supply;Etiology;experimental study;extracellular;Female;functional improvement;gain of function;Glucose;glycation;Golgi Apparatus;gray matter;Homeostasis;Human;improved;In Vitro;in vivo;in vivo imaging;Infarction;inhibitor;Integrins;Ischemia;Knowledge;Label;loss of function;male;Mammalian Cell;Maps;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Mediating;Metabolism;Methods;Mitochondria;Mitochondrial Proteins;Modification;Molecular;Mus;neural growth;neurogenesis;Neurologic;neurological recovery;Neuronal Plasticity;Neurons;neuroprotection;neurovascular;neutralizing antibody;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutic intervention;oligodendrocyte progenitor;Oligodendroglia;Oligonucleotides;optical imaging;Outcome;Oxygen;PARK7 gene;Pathway interactions;Pattern;PECAM1 gene;pharmacologic;Plasmids;Play;post stroke;post stroke dementia;Post-Translational Protein Processing;potential biomarker;precursor cell;prevent;Process;Property;Proteins;Publishing;Rattus;Recombinants;Recovery;Recovery of Function;remyelination;repaired;response;Role;Sensorimotor functions;Signal Induction;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;single nucleus RNA-sequencing;Site-Directed Mutagenesis;Small Interfering RNA;spatiotemporal;Specific qualifier value;Stroke;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissues;tool;trafficking;transcriptome;Western Blotting;white matter,Extracellular Mitochondria Transfer in Gray and White Matter for Ameliorating Sensorimotor and Cognitive Deficits After Stroke,126280,BINP,Brain Injury and Neurovascular Pathologies Study Section[BINP],NA,NA,3,293676,194258,487934,NA

I propose to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the synergism between TDP-43 and tau by integrating C. elegans as an experimental model of combined proteotoxicity with human neuropathologic and gene expression data, and in doing so determine whether targeting pathways that underlie this relationship will more effectively rescue the disease phenotype than targeting either alone.",10427270 (contact),"LATIMER, CAITLIN SHANNON (contact)","HAAKENSON, CHELSEA MARIE",2020-01-15,2024-12-31,Adult;age related;Aging;Algorithms;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Alzheimer&apos;s disease therapeutic;Alzheimer&apos;s disease therapy;Area;Autopsy;Behavioral;Biological;Biological Models;Brain;Brain region;brain tissue;Caenorhabditis elegans;Calcineurin;Candidate Disease Gene;candidate validation;career;CDC7 gene;Classification;Clinical;cohort;Cohort Studies;Communities;Coupled;Data;Dementia;Development;digital imaging;Disease;disease phenotype;DNA-Binding Proteins;Experimental Models;follow-up;Foundations;Freezing;Functional disorder;Funding;Future;Gene Expression;Gene Modified;Generations;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Goals;hippocampal atrophy;Hippocampus;Homologous Gene;Human;Human Characteristics;human data;human disease;Human Genetics;Human Pathology;human RNA sequencing;human tissue;hyperphosphorylated tau;Image Analysis;Immunohistochemistry;Impaired cognition;in vivo;Instruction;Knowledge;Late Onset Alzheimer Disease;Life Cycle Stages;Link;loss of function;Measures;Mentors;Mentorship;Modeling;Molecular;multidisciplinary;mutant;Nerve Degeneration;neuropathology;neurotoxic;neurotoxicity;new therapeutic target;novel;older adult;Pathologic;Pathology;Pathway Analysis;Pathway interactions;Phenotype;Phosphorylation;Physicians;Population;progressive neurodegeneration;protective effect;protein aggregation;protein TDP-43;Proteins;proteotoxicity;recruit;Research;Research Personnel;Research Technics;response;Risk;Role;Sampling;Scanning;Scientist;skills;synergism;System;tau Proteins;Techniques;Testing;Tissue Sample;Tissues;Training;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomics;Transgenic Organisms;Validation;Work,Molecular Mechanisms of Synergistic TDP-43 and Tau Proteotoxicity in Alzheimer's Disease,65426,NIA,Basic Neuroscience of Aging Study Section[NIA-N],NA,NA,5,130964,10477,141441,NA

We hypothesize that (1) providing UBI of $500 per month for six months will result in increased healthcare utilization among chronically-ill, older and aging, low-income Black men; and (2) the effect of UBI will depend on whether an individual has a recent history of incarceration, such that no incarceration history combined with UBI will demonstrate the best study outcomes. Empirical research examining UBI among older Black men and its capacity to overturn structural racism are lacking in the extant literature—much of the health disparities research intended to inform health and economic policy originated from limited perspectives of older and aging Black men—Dr. W.E.B.

Prosthesis users are known to walk with distinct asymmetries, which may relate to prosthesis design and fitting procedures. Poor trunk posture and abnormal pelvic motions may be implicated in the development and persistence of low back pain in some unilateral, transfemoral prosthesis users. The purpose of this study is to investigate and compare the effects of two prosthetic socket designs on the trunk posture and pelvic motions of transfemoral prosthesis users to determine if current sockets and prosthetic fitting procedures may contribute to the risk of development of low back pain.

Our Specific Aims will assess and combine key factors affecting driver behavior and clinical status in aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's clinical syndrome (ACS) as markers and moderators of risk: SA 1) Extract key real-world driver behavior features over a 3-month continuous, baseline period that classify NIA-AA core clinical criteria of MCI and ACS in drivers who are normally aging (N = 60), MCI (N = 80), or ACS (N = 40); SA2) Determine the extent to which real-world driver sleep and mobility mediate the relationship between extracted driver behavior and clinical features; SA3) Develop models (statistical and supervised machine learning) that combine features of driver behavior (from SA 1) and driver sleep and mobility (from SA2) to detect early signs of MCI and AD and predict disease progression. By building on our extensive successes in the current phase, the project directly advances NIH and NIA goals lo detect early warnings signs of decline and incipient AD-with the goal of screening, identifying, and tracking individuals at risk for AD from passive-monitoring of real-world behavior to predict clinical status and progression-promoting early treatment of AD and the next stage of interventions to prevent the progression of AD even in its preclinical stages.",1872045 (contact),"RIZZO, MATTHEW  (contact)","HARRELL, ERIN",1999-09-01,2026-02-28,Achievement;Activities of Daily Living;Address;Affect;Age;Aging;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Alzheimer&apos;s disease risk;analytical method;analytical tool;Automobile Driving;Behavior;Biological;Biometry;Black Box;Caring;Classification;Clinical;clinical predictors;Cognitive;cognitive neuroscience;Communities;Computer Vision Systems;cost;Data;Data Set;Dementia;detection platform;Devices;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;diagnostic tool;digital;Disease;Disease Progression;Disparate;driving behavior;Early Diagnosis;Early identification;Early treatment;Engineering;Environment;Fingerprint;functional decline;Functional impairment;Goals;health care availability;High Performance Computing;Impairment;improved;indexing;Individual;innovation;Intervention;Light;Location;Machine Learning;Measures;Mediating;Mediator;Medicine;meetings;mild cognitive impairment;Modeling;Monitor;Motor;National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism;normal aging;novel;older driver;older patient;Patients;Pattern;Persons;Phase;Play;pre-clinical;prevent;Quality of life;Recording of previous events;Records;Research Project Grants;Risk;Role;Rural;rural setting;Safety;Sampling;screening;sensor;sensor technology;Severities;Signal Transduction;Sleep;statistical and machine learning;success;supervised learning;Syndrome;System;Taxonomy;Techniques;Testing;Time;Transportation;United States National Institutes of Health;urban setting;Visual;wearable data;wearable device;wearable sensor technology;Weather,Monitoring real-world driver behavior for classification and early prediction of Alzheimer’s disease,17177,CP,Cognition and Perception Study Section[CP],NA,NA,19,722289,238314,960603,NA

Almost all progress to higher grade including secondary GBM. Grade II/III astrocytomas are distinguished from other gliomas by their typical mutational background consisting of IDHmut/p53mut/ATRXloss and are understudied relative to glioblastoma. Immunotherapy offers great promise in other cancers but has not yet been effective against brain tumors including astrocytoma. This research will use pre-clinical models to identify immunosuppressive transcriptional mechanisms of astrocytoma and amplified by standard-of-care radiation therapy.

We have now discovered that Parkin, a molecule altered in early-onset Parkinson’s disease, functions as a unique dual mode tumor suppressor, inhibiting intrinsic tumor traits of cell motility and metabolism while also reprogramming an antitumor immune microenvironment. This pathway involves Parkin “priming” of immunogenic cell death, control of cytosolic and mitochondrial danger-sensing pathways and transcriptional activation of interferon gene expression.

Highly sensitized patients, those who have developed anti-donor antibody prior to organ transplantation via pregnancy, transfusion, or previous transplantation, remain challenging to transplant compared to their non-sensitized counterparts. As a result, sensitized patients stay longer on the waitlist and experience higher rates of mortality/morbidity. Xenotransplantation has long been proposed as a therapeutic strategy to address the ongoing organ shortage in transplantation and highly sensitized patients have been suggested to be potential first candidates. Xenotransplantation outcomes have improved over the last years due to progress in gene editing of the donor pig as well as improved immunosuppression. Despite this, antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) remains common and prevents long-term graft survival and clinical translation. Therefore, this project seeks to use a preclinical nonhuman primate model to test new therapeutic strategies targeting post-xenotransplantation humoral response, with the ultimate goals of minimizing graft rejection, preserving protective immunity, and maximizing patient health. The results of the study would directly inform the strategy for the first human xenotransplants and lower the risk of humans undergoing xenotransplantation.
