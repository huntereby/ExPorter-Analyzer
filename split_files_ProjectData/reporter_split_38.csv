We found in our research laboratory that administration of empagliflozin attenuates cardiac injury leading to better post-resuscitation cardiac function.

As the veteran population ages, diminished produc- tion of the primary sex hormone, estrogen, promote fat accumulation in menopausal women. We discovered a subpopulation of adipocytes in humans and mice termed bone marrow-derived adipocytes (BMDAs) that exhibit an inflammatory character. These unique adipocytes are more abundant in female than male mice, and are increased by loss of estrogen in female mice. These observations led us to hypothesize that BMDAs provide a link between sex hormone-related changes in adiposity and body-wide inflammation. This project will test this hypothesis in mice in which estrogen signaling is suppressed, and in which BMDAs and their progenitors are specifically ablated.

It is critical to understand the functional protein networks underlying T and Treg cell function. Our recent study revealed an unexpected critical role for innate senor AIM2 (Absent In Melanoma 2) in controlling Treg cell function to mitigate autoimmune EAE, by modulating Akt-mTOR signaling. Based on these exciting findings, we propose to study how the expression and function of AIM2 in Treg cells are controlled through mechanisms both distinct from and shared with those found in the innate cells, to uphold tolerance and restrain autoimmunity.

Identification of early pressure induced tissue damage among nursing home residents by nursing staff during routine skin assessment is critical because detection cues initiation of prevention actions and may allow viable tissue rescue, lessening morbidity and mortality. We propose use of sub-epidermal moisture (SEM) measures as the cue for initiating pressure injury prevention because it offers significant promise by: 1) providing early detection of PrI damage by as much as 5 to 10 days prior to any visual skin discoloration, which can trigger prompt, effective, individualized prevention, 2) eliminating the inherent structural bias in visual skin assessment for residents with dark skin tones, 3) demonstrating a model of care using technology innovation in poorly-resourced healthcare settings, and 4) providing bedside, real-time, point- of-care feedback that is immediately actionable by nursing staff, the daily care providers for frail, vulnerable elders.",8258043 (contact);11377676,"BATES-JENSEN, BARBARA M.

Existing studies of event-level risk processes among heterosexual women and SMWGD have provided mixed evidence for two risk processes for CU: positive reinforcement (e.g., using to increase positive emotions) and negative reinforcement (e.g., using to decrease negative emotions); however, our preliminary results and the multistage model of substance use provide a potential explanation for these mixed findings by suggesting that these two sets of risk factors may be relevant at different stages of CUD, with positive reinforcement most relevant when CUD symptoms are absent to mild and negative reinforcement becoming dominant when CUD symptoms become more severe. To address existing mixed evidence for event-level risk processes contributing to CU among SMWGD and heterosexual women and advance our understanding of risk factors for CU and CUD in these two populations, we aim to accomplish three specific aims using a measurement burst design (i.e., 5 semi-annual bursts of 14-days with 2 surveys per day) with a sample of SMWGD and heterosexual women: 1) identify changes in the effects of event-level risk factors on CU as CUD develops, 2) test for differences in effects of shared event-level risk factors on CU for SMWGD and heterosexual women, and 3) determine if differences in CU trajectories for SMWGD and heterosexual women contribute to disparities in the development of CUD.",12597074 (contact),"DYAR, CHRISTINA  (contact)","DUNSTON, SHEBA KING",2023-07-01,2028-04-30,Address;Affect;Age;assigned female at birth;Bisexual;coping;Data;design;Development;disorder risk;Disparity;Ecological momentary assessment;Education;Emotions;Event;experience;gender diverse;Growth;Heterosexuals;high risk;Individual;Intervention;Lesbian;marijuana use;marijuana use disorder;Measurement;minority stress;Modeling;National Institute of Drug Abuse;negative affect;Negative Reinforcements;nonbinary;Perception;Population;positive emotional state;Positive Reinforcements;Process;queer;recruit;Research;response;Risk;Risk Factors;risk sharing;Sampling;Severities;Sexual and Gender Minorities;sexual minority;sexual minority women;social;social stigma;Stress;substance use;Surveys;Symptoms;Testing;Theoretical model;theories;Time;Woman;young adult,"Testing a multistage model of risk factors for cannabis use utilizing a measurement burst design among sexual minority women, sexual minority gender diverse individuals, and heterosexual women",58642,SPIP,"Social Psychology, Personality and Interpersonal Processes Study Section[SPIP]",NA,NA,2,496953,202186,699139,NA

The proposed studies investigate the pathophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia by testing the hypothesis that spine deficits are due to increased phagocytosis of spines by microglia. We test this hypothesis by determining if microglia show molecular features that enable elevated spine phagocytosis and if molecular and morphological indicators of elevated spine phagocytosis in individual microglia are inversely related to neighboring spine density in schizophrenia.

However, the benefits are still limited to a subset of Veterans, and it is critical to understand how cancer cells are becoming resistant to immune attack in order to expand the benefits to many Veterans with advanced cancer. The current research proposal is designed to understand the mechanism of resistance, or immune evasion, by focusing on the role of a particular protein that modulates the structure of chromatin in the genome, the so-called ‘chromatin remodeler’. We observed that the tumor grew faster with immunotherapy if it is lacking ATRX, a chromatin remodeler and this phenotype mirrors the unwanted clinical outcome, called ‘hyperprogression’.

Treatment options for this disease are limited, and studies aimed at finding new therapeutic strategies are needed. MDS has a distinct population of stem cells that can give rise to the disease, and targeting this population could represent a powerful tool in the treatment of MDS with the potential to eradicate the disease.

We have established extinction learning as a model of exposure therapy in rats, showing beneficial effects in restoring stress-induced impairments in cognition and coping behavior that resemble aspects of PTSD and depression.

In this project, we will determine whether clozapine, when administered in real-world settings, decreases the risk for violent acts in individuals with schizophrenia at high risk for violence when compared to treatment with other antipsychotic medications, and investigate whether previously identified change mechanisms are operative in the effectiveness setting. Examining clozapine in this way will foster a better understanding of the effects of clozapine on violent acts in community settings and allow us to test a scalable intervention and service delivery approaches that can be broadly implemented using typically available resources, and as such has significant public health implications.",1887202 (contact),"GOFF, DONALD C.

In murine models of Hox-overexpressing AML, we found emergency granulopoiesis was enhanced and failed to resolve during the innate immune response; associated with accelerated leukemogenesis and shortened survival. We also found increased expression of proteins involved in the integrated stress response (ISR) during leukemogenesis in Hox-overexpressing murine models of AML. These results suggest the ISR may sustain EG and enhance accumulation of mutations leading to AML in the context of increased Hox expression.
