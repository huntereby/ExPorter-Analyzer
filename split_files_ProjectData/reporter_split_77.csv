Through our close collaboration with the Samoa Ministry of Health, the “Samoa Typhoid Fever Surveillance Initiative,” we propose a series of comparative genomic and geospatial analyses integrating whole genome sequence data of Salmonella Typhi isolates from Samoa with clinical and household epidemiologic data to determine the population structure, evolutionary origins, and local patterns of transmission including the relative role of asymptomatic chronic carriers of Salmonella Typhi. Where previous large scale phylogenetic studies of Salmonella Typhi have demonstrated the feasibility and public health utility of our experimental approaches, none have focused on Samoa nor been implemented as part of an accelerated and coordinated national typhoid control program; therefore, our results will not only contribute a Polynesian perspective to the field of Salmonella Typhi genomics, but also present new information on endemic typhoid fever to assist the Samoa Ministry of Health and our international collaborators in public health decisions.",16016942 (contact),"SIKORSKI, MICHAEL JOSEPH (contact)","ALEXANDER, WILLIAM A",2021-06-01,2025-05-31,Acceleration;Acute;Age;Age Years;Antibiotic Resistance;Bacteremia;Bacteria;bacterial genome sequencing;Bacterial Infections;Bile fluid;Biliary;Blood;Blood Circulation;Bone Marrow;chlorination;Cholelithiasis;Chronic;Cities;Clinical;Collaborations;Collection;Communicable Diseases;Comparative Genomic Analysis;comparative genomics;Consumption;contaminated water;Country;Data;Disease;disease model;Disease Outbreaks;Duodenum;Environment;Environmental Risk Factor;epidemiologic data;Epidemiology;Etiology;Evolution;Exhibits;extensive drug resistance;Family member;Female;Filtration;Flushing;food consumption;Food Contamination;Fostering;Founder Effect;Funding;Gallbladder;Gene Deletion;Genes;Genome;genome sequencing;genomic epidemiology;Genomic Segment;Genomics;Genotype;Geography;Goals;Health;Hepatobiliary;Household;Human;improved;Incidence;Incubated;Individual;Infection;International;Intestinal Mucosa;Intestines;Investigation;Island;Link;Liquid substance;Liver;lymphatic drainage;Macrophage;Methods;Modeling;Modernization;Molecular;Mononuclear;Obesity;Pacific Islands;Pattern;Persons;Phagocytes;Phylogenetic Analysis;Phylogeny;Policies;Polynesian;Population;Predisposition;Prevalence;programs;Public Health;Recording of previous events;Relapse;resistance factors;Resolution;Risk;Risk Factors;Role;Salmonella typhi;Samoa;Samoan;Sanitation;Seasons;Sepsis;septic;Series;Silicon Dioxide;Single Nucleotide Polymorphism;Source;spatiotemporal;Spleen;Structure;System;Systemic infection;Technology;Testing;Time;tool;Training;transmission process;Trees;Typhoid Fever;Variant;Virulence Factors;Water;water quality;Water Supply;waterborne;whole genome,Genomics of Salmonella Typhi in Samoa: Population structure and genomic epidemiology,156973,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-F13-Z(20)L],NA,S1,3,2500,0,2500,NA

Career Development and Mentorship Plan Career and Research Goals: Dr. Spear’s overall career goal is to become a leading investigator focused on clinical translational studies and drug development, including the integration of environmental contributions to health outcomes in the context of human genetic diversity. She plans to build leadership skills and hands on experience in topics of environmental health to support her career development, which has thus far been focused on genetics. Dr. Spear has extensive training in computational biology for which she has applied to understanding the genetic architecture of biomedical traits in underrepresented populations. However, moving forward her goal is to engage in community- based research that is more centered on environmental considerations, which is highly complementary to the specific aims of the parent award. Thus, Dr. Spear’s career development plan has been intentionally developed for her to obtain new experiences and skill sets to extend her knowledge of genomic data analyses into environmental aspects of human health, and to engage with bi-directional community-driven research. Specifically, she will investigate the contribution of environmental toxicants (diversity supplement) in the context of social stress (parent award) on the immune function and response to viral respiratory function of children with asthma. A diversity supplement will provide Dr. Spear with the necessary structure for her to become a leader in the field, and acquire mentorship and experiences that are relevant to this stage in her career. Mentorship Plan The Principal Investigators of the parent grant are deeply committed to mentoring and supporting the scientific and career development of Dr. Spear. Dr. Spear’s primary mentor will be Dr. Torgerson, who brings expertise as it relates to statistical considerations and methods for environmental and epidemiological studies in asthma, and responsible conduct in human subjects research. She also has longstanding experience in working with the community including outreach activities, and will provide mentorship on responsible conduct in research and career development programs at UCSF. Dr. Best is a physician scientist and will provide mentorship with regards to clinical and administrative considerations for community-based public health research involving American Indian individuals and communities. This includes special considerations for Human Subjects Research in a vulnerable, underserved community, given his knowledge and experience of longstanding collaborations with American Indian communities and health care systems. Dr. Erdei will provide mentorship with respect to studies of environmental toxicants, including aspects related to environmental justice, and has specific experience in studies of metal and PFAS exposure in American Indian communities including the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and Navajo. Together, we have assembled a complementary mentorship team to ensure that Dr. Spear will have input from diverse fields of expertise and perspectives, as she takes on an independent leadership role and acquires new experiences specific to human subjects research and environmental studies. Dr. Torgerson will meet individually with Dr. Spear every week to support her scientific and career development as she develops her independent research career in biomedical research. The agenda will generally include a 5-10 minute check-in, followed by discussion of specific scientific developments and progress/roadblocks as facilitated by Dr. Spear. The last 10 minutes will be devoted to jointly reviewing benchmarks and timelines for career development activities as outlined in this proposal. Dr. Spear will present quarterly in Dr. Torgerson’s all-member lab meetings, and attend as desired, and have the option to participate in a weekly Journal Club focused on select topics of interest. Dr. Spear will also join weekly research meetings devoted to the FIPA2 study, and including her additional mentors Dr. Best and Dr. Erdei, FIPA2 study coordinators, staff, and personnel involved in the planning and recruitment of participants. Should the diversity supplement be awarded, Drs. Best and Erdei will meet individually with Dr. Spear at least quarterly for individualized mentoring opportunities and check- ins for scientific and career support. Dr. Spear will also travel to MBIRI in Eagle Butte and Rapid City 2- 3 times annually to interact with the research team in person, and participate in study recruitment, work with study coordinators, interact with members of the community, present her research to the Community Advisory Board and Health Committees for feedback, and participate in community dissemination and outreach events. Career Development Plan Dr. Spear’s proposed research and career development plan will allow her to acquire training and first hand experiences from early stages of community based research, spanning study design to regulatory approvals, study recruitment and ongoing engagement with the community. She will develop more insight into environmental and human subjects research - from conception to recruitment to data generation, while receiving mentorship in areas of building community relationships in underserved communities, navigating the IRB process, budget management, sample processing and handling, and data coordination. She will travel to Rapid City and Eagle Butte to participate and observe in study recruitment and engage with the community both informally and through organized events including meetings with the existing Community Advisory Board to participate in bi-directional learning. She will participate in activities with the EaRTH Center at UCSF and obtain skills and intuition for integrating environmental measures into studies of human health. Continuing to refine her leadership abilities will be supported through practicing her written and oral communication skills at presentations at community events and scientific meetings, and the preparation of first author and collaborative manuscripts. Dr. Spear will also benefit from formal training opportunities in clinical research at UCSF that are relevant to her career stage. This includes courses and workshops offered through the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics to gain expertise in clinical research studies, including methods for community engagement (e.g. developing budgets for community engagement, paying community advisors, developing research and evaluation literacy for community agencies, and dissemination and media training for researchers), a summer clinical research workshop, a course in responsible conduct of research, and designing clinical research course at UCSF. In addition, Dr. Spear will acquire new skills and experiences through real world experiences and engaging with the community at our two study sites in Eagle Butte SD and Rapid City ND. This will include engaging with the Tribal Health Committee and Great Plains IRB, attending and participating in the organization of community outreach events (e.g. community events at MBIRI, school outreach activities, radio broadcasts, pamphlet development), and spending time assisting the recruitment of study participants through working with our clinical coordinators who are active at both sites. Lastly, she will lead the dissemination of her research through social media, peer-reviewed scientific publications, and presentations at scientific meetings including the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Pediatric Academic Societies (PAS).

Meek: New Organoboron-Based Methods and Strategies for Organic Synthesis; 5R35GM141558 Research Strategy: A. Summary:  The efficient and stereoselective preparation of chiral organic molecules is vitally important to the development of new therapeutic agents. Consequently, development of new transformations that provide synthetic chemists with strategic bond disconnections that facilitate de novo approaches to organic synthesis is imperative. Research under the aegis of this MIRA grant broadly seeks to develop and exploit new, practical, and efficient stereoselective technologies for organic synthesis of molecular scaffolds of biological importance that are otherwise difficult to access or inefficiently prepared via current processes. To this end, we are interested in developing transformations that leverage the broad chemical reactivity of multi-functional chemical synthons for complex molecule synthesis. These readily accessible platforms merge powerful bond forming reactivity with broad synthetic utility, to deliver versatile organic compounds of notable significance for fragment-based drug discovery. Building off our previous work, we are developing new catalytic C–C, C–N, and C–X bond forming methods for the synthesis of chiral amines, alcohols, and aromatic structures, with a particular focus on examples that contain quaternary carbon stereogenic centers. For example, chiral metal nucleophiles can be accessed by enantioselective transmetalation of readily accessible achiral multifunctional reagents. The resultant nucleophilic species can engage in a number of enantioselective reactions with various C=O, C=N, C–X electrophiles, to deliver non-racemic versatile organic compounds of notable significance. Moreover, we are targeting the generation and utility of novel functionalized synthons by metal-free Lewis base catalysis for reactions with electrophiles that are difficult to achieve via transition metal catalysis. Importantly, enantioselective variants of these unknown reactions are being explored. Stereoselective reactions currently under study are shown in Schemes 1 and 2. Scheme 1.

Treatment of catalytically generated enantioenriched copper-allyl with nitroso–arenes and diazene electrophiles furnishes tertiary alcohols and amines in high yield and enantioselectivity. Alkoxy–amine intermediates undergo rapid N– O cleavage with a second equivalent of nitroso-arene to yield alcohols 4 and 5 in high yield and enantioselectivity. Reactions are promoted by chiral phosphoramidite-copper complexes that lead to >98:2 a:g, >91:9 e.r. In addition, the N–O intermediates can be intercepted prior to N–O cleavage.  Stereoselective Defluoro-Allyl addition Methods and Reactions with Boryl-Enamines: We have harnessed the reactivity afforded by boron-stabilized carbanions to establish a method for the site- and stereoselective C– C couplings of aryl–CF3 and –CF2 groups with allylic nucleophiles (e.g., 10 and 12). Moreover, we have discovered a powerful method for the synthesis of borylated enamines (Scheme 2). These are versatile intermediates that are typically difficult to prepare for a range of amines but provide an avenue for amine incorporation through various coupling reactions. Examples of enantioselective transformations and reaction that generate stereocenters include, enantioselective conjugate addition (15), three-component of formamides into a-amino nitriles (16) (amino acid precursors), and efficient Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling followed by reduction to afford chiral trifluoromethyl alcohols (17). These C-C bond forming reactions are being optimized and their enantioselective variants will be evaluated. Scheme 2.

Justification of Need: Replacement for a broken SFC instrument and critical need for efficient chiral SFC analysis of difficult to separate enantiomers of alcohols, amines, and fluorine-containing stereocenters.  A critical aspect of catalytic stereoselective methods development is the need to rapidly determine the enantioselectivity of novel chiral compounds prepared for each single reaction. Such requirement relies almost exclusively on the use chiral separation methods for determining accurate enantiomeric ratios (e.r.) and gauging reaction effectiveness. This challenging feature is compounded by the fact that most of the compounds have never been synthesized before. Consequently, there is a crucial need for the ability to rapidly and accurately determine e.r.s for chiral compounds that result from reaction optimization (e.g., catalyst, chiral ligand, base, solvent, temp., etc.), especially those that contain >1 stereocenter. These data are essential for developing the most efficient and stereoselective transformations that allow synthetic chemists to prepare key biologically relevant compounds in high enantioselectivity (>95:5 e.r.). Supercritical fluid chromatography is a mainstay for such analyses. We previously had a working SFC instrument for chiral separation and e.r. determination. This instrument is 8 years old and is now broken beyond repair due to the large volume of use it received, and its aging components. It should be noted, the SFC in my laboratory was the only working SFC in the department of chemistry for the last two years, and was utilized by other organic groups (e.g., Profs Johnson, Alexanian, Nicewicz, and Aubé) whose instruments were not working or whom do not have a SFC but required its capabilities. At present we are limited to evaluating the enantiomeric ratio by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Chiral HPLC analysis is time consuming, wasteful, and problematic, particularly for amines (see Scheme 1) and diastereomeric mixtures (i.e., >1 stereocenter). The inability to swiftly analyze material can delay a project by weeks, or months, depending on the functional groups. Chiral SFC is critical to analyzing the chiral boron-containing alcohols and amines generated in this program: We have encountered many examples during our studies of catalytic enantioselective additions of allyl nucleophiles to electrophiles where enantiomer separation and e.r. determination is feasible and more efficient by chiral SFC. For example, as illustrated in Scheme 3 the enantiomers of tertiary Scheme 3. Example of Chiral SFC versus HPLC: alcohol 4 could not be successfully separated by HPLC with many Enantiomeric Ratio Determination Tertiary Alcohol 4  OH different columns and solvent combinations in order to obtain an Me2N N 10 mol% CuOtBu accurate e.r. In contrast, chiral SFC with a super critical CO2 mobile O 12 mol% L1 Me B(pin)  Me CD3OD (1.05 equiv) 4 phase proved successful for achieving clean peak separation. The [(pin)B]2HC 72% yield,  Bu THF, -60 °C, 16 h 91:9 e.r. necessity to procure chromatograms with baseline peak separation · Attempted unsuccessful e.r. analysis of 4 by HPLC: can cost days, if not weeks of time. Now that our SFC has recently broken and is unrepairable, analysis of reaction enantioselectivity takes longer and is often unreliable. Loss of such an important analysis method could not be predicted in advance, but we anticipate · Rapid e.r. analysis of alcohol 4 by SFC instrument the need to maintain such analysis for the duration of this MIRA grant. The requested funds will provide chiral SFC instrumentation that will allow us to reliably and rapidly develop new highly enantioselective reactions for the generation of stereochemically complex, single enantiomer pharmaceuticals important to improving human health. Instrument Usage & Anticipated Future Reoccurring Costs: Five graduates, and one undergraduate researcher working under the support of this MIRA grant, are all involved in stereoselective synthesis projects and require e.r. determination on a regular basis. Based on our 8 years of prior experience with chiral SFC instruments, reoccurring future costs associated with equipment maintenance and upkeep will be able to be sufficiently covered under the current grant funding to ensure instrument longevity of ³8 years.",10815451 (contact),"MEEK, SIMON JOHN (contact)","YANG, JIONG",2021-05-01,2026-03-31,3-Dimensional;8 year old;Acetone;Administrative Supplement;Aging;Alcohols;Amides;Amines;Amino Acids;base;Biological;Biomedical Research;Boron;carbanion;Carbon;Carbon Dioxide;Catalysis;catalyst;Chemicals;Chemistry;Complex;Consumption;Copper;cost;Coupling;Data;Development;diazene;drug discovery;Effectiveness;enantiomer;Ensure;Equipment;experience;Fluorine;formamide;functional group;Funding;Future;Generations;Goals;Grant;Health;High Pressure Liquid Chromatography;Human;improved;In Situ;instrument;instrumentation;Intercept;interest;Laboratories;Ligands;Longevity;Maintenance;Metals;method development;Methods;Molecular;National Institute of General Medical Sciences;new technology;Nitriles;novel;novel therapeutics;Organic Synthesis;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacologic Substance;Phase;phosphoramidite;Preparation;Process;programs;Reaction;Reagent;repaired;Research;Research Personnel;scaffold;Scheme;Site;Solvents;Structure;Supercritical Fluid Chromatography;System;Technology;Therapeutic Agents;Time;Transition Elements;undergraduate student;United States National Institutes of Health;Variant;Work,NIH Administrative Supplement to purchase an Agilent 1260 Infinity II SFC System,141558,NA,NA,NA,S1,4,103646,0,103646,NA

A linking of the many relevant biological scales and heterogeneous features of each is essential for understanding the complex biological activities of these macromolecules in the cellular environment and how they aﬀect gene expression, cancer progression, and viral infection. Such an improved understanding of the organization and transition mechanisms associated with the genetic material and its RNA cousin, together with establishment of systematic methods for the study of their heterogeneous conformational landscapes, has direct medical ramiﬁcations by suggesting speciﬁc molecular design and targeted therapies for the treatment of genetic syndromes, degenerative diseases, cancers associated with chromosomal or epigenetic abnormalities, and viral infections like Covid-19.  Speciﬁc Aims  Through this NIGMS Administrative Supplement, the PI seeks to obtain a dedicated 10-GPU (Graphics Processing Units) computing cluster for the Schlick lab to enhance, facilitate, and greatly accelerate the lab's computations and simulations of gene, RNA, and related systems to address fundamental biological challenges in new ways. The parent grant has speciﬁc aims related to elucidating structure/function relationships in genome and RNA systems by novel multiscale techniques. The currently available system at NYU is a large cluster with limited GPU access that is shared by four thousand researchers. While access was easier when the system was ﬁrst installed, large bottlenecks are now associated with thousands of eager users that result in large queue times and cancelled or interrupted jobs. Having the dedicated GPU system will enhance our productivity enormously and allow easy development and testing of new GPU-tailored algorithms for multiscale modeling of nucleic-acid systems of great importance to basic science and human medicine.  Because researcher salary was priority for the PI in the MIRA budget, very modest equipment budgets were requested in both the original MIRA and renewal MIRA proposals. This request represents the ﬁrst major instrumentation request for the Schlick lab for the NIGMS MIRA project.  Introduction to Application  RE: Administrative Supplement for Equipment Purchases for Select NIGMS-Funded Awards for 2R35GM122562-06: NOT-GM-24-021  I am requesting an Administrative Supplement to purchase a 10-GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) computer system from Nvidia to be connected to the Schlick Lab Computer Cluster. This powerful system will provide our researchers direct and rapid access to computations and data storage that are not possible through the large NYU High-Performance Cluster serving thousands of other researchers, all competing for the same queues, especially for GPUs. This 10-GPU system will greatly facilitate, accelerate, and enhance computation and storage for our essential molecular modeling and simulations of genome systems at multiscale resolutions, RNA systems at the all-atom and coarse-grained levels, and related DNA/protein complexes at atomic resolution. The requested system has 10 Nvidia RTX 6000 Ada Graphics Processing Units, 256 AMD CPU cores, 5TB of memory, and 340 TB disk space. The quote from THINKMATE is $249,758.88 for this conﬁguration was solicited.  This powerful GPU system will greatly enhance the productivity of our MIRA research projects and the group facilities. This system was not requested in the original submission because priority was placed on researcher salaries within the limited budget.  The system will be maintained by Mr. Shereef Elmetwaly, the Chemistry Department's Scientiﬁc Computing Manager, whose oﬃce is in our lab space.

Communication between hosts and pathogens is essential for host defense and pathogen virulence, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Previous studies in my lab discovered that some non-coding regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs) from fungal pathogens, such as Botrytis cinerea, which causes grey mold disease on more than 1000 plant species, can be transported into host plant cells and suppress host immunity genes, a mechanism called “Cross-Kingdom RNAi”. Recently, we discovered that such sRNA communication is bi-directional. Plant hosts have also developed the ability to deliver sRNAs, mainly using extracellular vesicles, to fungal cells and induce cross-kingdom RNAi of fungal virulence-related genes. Such sRNA communication was also observed between mammals and parasites. Despite more studies across diverse systems demonstrating that mobile sRNAs are key regulatory molecules in host and pathogen interactions, the field of cross-kingdom/cross-species RNA communication is still in its infancy. This proposal is designed for the use of the plant Arabidopsis and the fungal pathogen Botrytis as a model system to address the outstanding questions in this field. These questions include how host cells control sRNA transport upon infection, how specific classes of small RNAs are sorted into extracellular vesicles, how fungal cells deliver sRNAs into host cells, what are the mechanisms of RNA and vesicle uptake in the host cells and fungal cells, and whether other classes of RNAs such as mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs associate with extracellular vesicles and move between host and fungal cells as well as how they function in the counter party, etc.. A combination of genetics, genomics, biochemical and molecular biology approaches will be used. This project is expected to provide unprecedented insight into the underlying mechanisms of cross-kingdom/cross- species RNA communications, which will ultimately help develop innovative and eco- friendly disease control strategies such as RNA-based fungicides or antifungal drugs. 2) Scientific justification Request for a Blizzard NU-99828JG -86°C Ultralow Freezer The PI requests fund to purchase a Blizzard NU-99828JG -86°C Ultralow Freezer (with necessary racks) from NuAire, Inc., which will replace our 20-year-old broken -80C freezer. The old -80C freezer was unstable for the last two years, and the temperature could only go down to -50 to -40C. It was completely broken recently, which caused serious problems for the research in the lab. This instrument is essential for this project and for a molecular biology lab.

Their function has been associated with such basic cellular functions as the regulation of electrical activity, signal transduction and osmotic balance. K+ channels are members of the voltage-dependent channel superfamily, which include explicitly voltage-activated channels (Na+, Ca2+, and a large number of K+ channels), as well as voltage-independent channels (i.e., the inward rectifiers and the cyclic nucleotide activated channels). The sub-family of non-domain swapped K+ channels include a great deal of functional diversity, including depolarization activated (EAG, hERG), hyperpolarization-activated (KAT1, HCN), and dual voltage and Ca2+ activation (BK).

Cell migration plays an important role in many physiological and pathological processes such as wound healing, development and cancer invasion. Frequently migration is not simply random, but directed towards targets through recognition of aligned extracellular matrix fibers or gradients in stiffness, generating contact guidance and durotaxis, respectively. In many biological contexts these cues are presented simultaneously, forcing cells to integrate this information. For instance, gradients of stiffness and aligned collagen are generated within the wound bed to direct dermal fibroblast migration. Similar fiber structures and gradients stimulate cancer cell migration out of the tumor microenvironment and normal cells including stromal and immune cells towards the tumor microenvironment. While there is a firm understanding of how cells respond to individual directional cues, virtually nothing is known about how cells integrate multiple cues and make migrational decisions based on that integration. Furthermore, there is a hypothesis that contact guidance and durotaxis are overlapping directional cell migration mechanisms, but this has not been rigorously tested. Mechanistic understanding of multi-cue directional migration will require a refined understanding of how the F-actin and microtubule networks operates. Indeed, some evidence suggests that contact guidance and durotaxis may use slightly different F-actin network structures, since contact guidance is thought to be governed by F-actin fiber structures, but durotaxis is not. Engineering approaches will be taken to design in vitro environments that allow for independent tuning of contact guidance and durotaxis in both 2D and 3D environments. Furthermore, the effect of F-actin branching, bundling and contraction in allowing cells to prefer aligned fibers of collagen or gradients of stiffness will be tested. This will uncover shared or competing molecular pathways involved when these two directional migration cues are present in isolation and together. Understanding how cells migrate in response to multiple cues has broad impact on several biomedical fields including tissue engineering and disease therapeutics. Determining how cells respond to multiple cues in vitro will allow us to predict cell responses in wound healing, development, cancer invasion and immune response leading to drug candidates as in cancer or strategies to enhance wound healing and immune response. This goal of this supplement is to purchase a microscope system that will expand our capabilities for live-cell imaging of cell migration and cytoskeletal dynamics. We currently have two older Nikon microscopes that have some limitations. First, the microscope that allows for fluorescence imaging has several issues including a broken filter wheel turret and malfunctioning mirror that automatically flips from Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) mode to epifluorescence mode. This limits the live cell fluorescence imaging we can do. Second, our Photometrics HQ2 CCD that was on that microscope was damaged after a mercury arc lamp bulb rupture. We have since purchased a Photometrics Moment camera, which is a good camera for fixed images, but its sensitivity is much less than the HQ2, diminishing our ability to capture cytoskeletal dynamics in live cells. Third, we do not have ability to access multiple positions during one imaging experiment, because our stage is only a mechanical stage and is not motorized. This tremendously hampers our ability to collect data in a high throughput manner. Finally, while we have successfully used heated stages and closed chambers for imaging live cells, this approach limits the type of media you can use and the length of imaging time. We would like to purchase an environmental control chamber to regulate humidity, temperature and CO2 percentage to allow for control over these very important cell culture conditions and to give us flexibility to image cells over our current window of eight hours. In addition to migration, the multi-positional acquisition and environmental control will allow us to better screen clones of formin and other cytoskeletal CRISPR knock-outs that we are developing. These reasons coupled with the fact that both our microscopes are over twelve years result in relatively high cost for upgrading an old system. Our ability to image cell migration and cytoskeletal dynamics in a high throughput manner and in a more natural environment will support the successful completion of the project.",9821378 (contact),"SCHNEIDER, IAN CHRISTOPHER (contact)","AINSZTEIN, ALEXANDRA M",2021-09-01,2025-08-31,3-Dimensional;Biological;Bundling;cancer cell;Carbon Dioxide;Cell Culture Techniques;cell motility;Cells;cellular imaging;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Collagen;Collagen Fiber;cost;Coupled;Cues;Cytoskeleton;Data;Dermal;design;Development;directional cell;Disease;drug candidate;Engineering;Environment;experimental study;Extracellular Matrix;F-Actin;Fiber;Fibroblasts;flexibility;Fluorescence;fluorescence imaging;Goals;Hour;Humidity;Image;Immune;Immune response;In Vitro;Individual;Invaded;Knock-out;Length;live cell imaging;Malignant Neoplasms;Mechanics;Mercury;Microscope;Microtubules;migration;Molecular;Normal Cell;Pathologic Processes;Pathway interactions;Physiological Processes;Play;Positioning Attribute;response;Role;Rupture;Structure;System;Temperature;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Tissue Engineering;Tissues;tumor microenvironment;virtual;wound bed;wound healing,Cell Migration Control through Modulation of Multiple Directional Cues,143302,CMT,Cellular and Molecular Technologies Study Section[CMT],NA,S1,4,150000,0,150000,NA

It consists of overlapping spindle midzone microtubules which are coated with electron dense material called the midbody matrix. Long conceptualized as a structural remnant subject to degradation following cytokinesis, emerging data suggest that midbody remnants (MBsomes) play instructive post-mitotic roles in establishing cell fate, proliferation state, tissue polarity, cilia formation, neuron function, and oncogenesis. However, very little is known about the functional significance of the electron dense material. My lab has uncovered a surprising novel function for this electron dense material in that it is a site of RNA storage and is a novel actively translating RNP granule with a uniquely complex life cycle comprised of both membrane-less and membrane-bound phases, that we are calling the MB-granule (for Midbody-granule).

Further, there was no systemic toxicity or detectable exposure in blood. In the refractory setting, as a single treatment (no cycles or multiple treatments) the Chemoplaque treated refractory solid tumor, vitreous and subretinal seeds. We are unaware of other interventions that can robustly treat all three lesions—let alone as a single treatment in a refractory setting. We propose a Phase I-II study to expand toxicity and effectiveness data of Episcleral Topotecan (Chemoplaque). In this study, EUAs will be at 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks (see protocol in appendix) reducing the frequency to standard of care as efficacy and safety have been established. Assessment of retinoblastoma tumor burden is problematic. Unlike other cancers, both eyes of the child may have multiple tumors, with multiple primary treatment options and multiple subsequent treatments, challenging the difficulties of Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST).1 Rather than tumor size, retinoblastoma cancer activity is best evaluated by experts using many tools. We built for the first Topotecan Chemoplaque study, the SWIMMERRB display of all therapies to a study eye before and after the Topotecan Chemoplaque intervention, which visually shows Progression-free Survival and details the multiple treatments before the intervention and after for recurrences. We consider any cancer therapy to the study eye after removal of Topotecan Chemoplaque to be evidence of recurrence. Through consensus building conferences primarily with patients and those with lived experience in retinoblastoma, we will seek numerical values to represent invasiveness/lifelong impact of each therapy. Application of the values to the various Topotecan Chemoplaque study long term outcomes, may validate the SWIMMERRB as a unique RECIST tool1. Such a SWIMMERRB tool may enable retinoblastoma clinical trials to have a standardized, validated output and assist families in treatment choices. The Chemoplaque in refractory settings required single (one) placement with sustained 6-week treatment (without need for multiple cycles or multiple treatments) treating refractory solid tumor, subretinal, and vitreous seeds with potential to significantly reduce patient burden in this micro-orphan childhood retinoblastoma cancer. With its simple placement and absence of any systemic toxicity (or detectable exposure in blood), this may be especially relevant in developing countries. 1. Berry JL, Munier FL, Gallie BL, et al.

This project aims to apply new computational and neuroimaging methods to characterize the mechanism by which methylphenidate improves PTSD in Veterans. It will use these tools to quantitatively measure the effect of methylphenidate in enabling the brain to more flexibly adapt to different environments, thereby reducing the brain’s hyper-reactivity to sensory stimulation.

An early event in development of breast cancer is the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) when mammary cells lose their normal structure and function and gain migratory and invasive properties. Project 1 studies will investigate mitotic gene bookmarking—mitotic retention of transcription factors with target genes on chromosomes for transcriptional regulation in progeny cells—as an epigenetic mechanism to maintain normal mammary epithelial cell identity. We will determine whether compromised mitotic bookmarking by the RUNX1 transcription factor results in initiation of EMT and onset of breast cancer.

Osteoporosis is common in our male veterans. Despite those realities, men are rarely tested or treated for osteoporosis before fractures occur. Consequences of osteoporotic fractures are more severe in men than women. Hip fractures in men are particularly devastating. Mortality for a man with hip fracture is nearly 38% in the first year after that fracture. Although there are several drugs used to treat osteoporosis in women, far fewer therapies have been studied in men. We will test a new combination regimen that has potential to improve bone mass and structure in men. The regimen combines two drugs: one parathyroid hormone (1-34) and the other a drug that activates calcium-sensing receptors in bone cells. The overall goal is to stimulate bone formation and improve bone strength and ultimately to reduce fracture risk.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has recognized the link between PD and herbicides, such as Agent Orange, which many veterans have been exposed to. Consequently, treatment of PD is of major importance to the VA. An increase in impulsivity–and associated impulse control disorders–has been identified in recent years as a major potential complication of PD. The goal of the project is to investigate the patterns of neural oscillatory activity associated with impulse control in PD patients and how they are affected by the use of dopamine agonists. Subjects will be assessed using magnetoencephalography while they perform in tasks that probe two main dimensions of impulsivity– motor impulsivity and decision-making impulsivity. The outcome will provide new information about the pathophysiology of impulse control disorders in PD, which will help to advance treatment by medication.",1895736;6380859 (contact),"LEWIS, SCOTT M;PELLIZZER, GIUSEPPE  (contact)",NA,2019-07-01,2025-06-30,Affect;Age;agent orange;behavior test;Behavioral;behavioral outcome;Binge Eating;Biological Markers;Brain;care burden;Caregivers;Caring;Cephalic;Complication;Data;Decision Making;Deep Brain Stimulation;design;Deterioration;Development;Dimensions;Distress;Dopamine;Dopamine Agonists;dopamine replacement therapy;Effectiveness;Electrophysiology (science);Excision;experience;Exposure to;fall risk;Family;Functional disorder;Future;Gambling;Ganglia;General Population;Goals;Herbicides;improved;Impulse Control Disorders;Impulsive Behavior;Impulsivity;Individual;individualized medicine;Intervention;Iowa;Levodopa;Link;Magnetoencephalography;Measures;Methodology;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;Motor;motor symptom;neural;neural network;neural patterning;Neurodegenerative Disorders;neuromechanism;neurophysiology;neuroregulation;Outcome;Parkinson Disease;Pathologic;Pathological Gambling;Patient Care;Patients;Pattern;Performance;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Predisposition;prospective;Quality of life;Questionnaires;Recurrence;Research;Research Design;response;Risk;Sampling;Source;spatiotemporal;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;temporal measurement;treatment response;two-dimensional;United States;United States Department of Veterans Affairs;Veterans;Well in self,Biomarkers of Impulsivity in Parkinson's Disease,1773,ZRD1,ZRD1-NURE-C(01)1,NA,NA,6,NA,NA,NA,NA

We will utilize 100% linked National Death Index-Medicare claims data in CMS’s Virtual Data Research Warehouse (VRDC) to expand statistical power for evolving patterns of fatal drug overdose across racial-ethnic subgroups and the role of community/health system factors and disparate access to medications for opioid use (MOUD) in these fatalities. We will create 100% cohorts of Medicare disability beneficiaries treated for non-fatal overdose; implement event history analyses of MOUD treatment and overdose fatality risk in these cohorts; assess the role of treatment disparities on fatal overdose; and identify the most promising targets in the treatment cascade for intervention to reduce outcome disparities.",1873291 (contact),"CRYSTAL, STEPHEN  (contact)","HAEGERICH, TAMARA",2022-09-01,2027-06-30,access disparities;Address;beneficiary;Buprenorphine;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Clinical;Code;cohort;Communities;comorbidity;Data;data centers;Data Linkages;Development;Diagnostic;Dimensions;disability;Disparate;Disparity;disparity reduction;dosage;Drug Prescriptions;Equity;Ethnic Origin;Ethnic Population;Event;Event History Analysis;Fee-for-Service Plans;Fentanyl;fentanyl use;hazard;Health Services Accessibility;Health system;Heroin;high risk;improved;indexing;insight;Intervention;Link;Managed Care;Measures;Medical;Medicare;Medicare claim;Mental Health;Methadone;methadone treatment;minority communities;Minority Enrollment;Minority Groups;Modality;Modeling;mortality;mortality disparity;Naltrexone;Opioid;opioid epidemic;opioid overdose;opioid use;Outcome;Outcome Assessment;outcome disparities;Overdose;overdose death;overdose prevention;Overdose reduction;overdose risk;Pattern;Penetration;Performance;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Policies;polysubstance use;Population;prescription opioid;programs;psychosocial;Race;Recording of previous events;Research;Research Personnel;Risk;Risk Reduction;Role;rural disparities;Sampling;Secure;Shapes;social vulnerability;Subgroup;Survivors;Time;treatment disparity;treatment optimization;treatment pattern;trend;uptake;Variant;virtual,"Enhanced Assessment of Overdose Mortality, Other OUD-Related Outcomes, Treatment Access and Equity Among Medicare Beneficiaries with Disability, Across Racial/Ethnic Subgroups and Communities",57568,NA,NA,NA,S1,3,49999,28499,78498,NA
