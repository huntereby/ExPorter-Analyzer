Treatment of Veterans with schizophrenia in the VA health system accounts for a disproportionately large amount of the VA’s total health care budget (16-20%). Schizophrenia is the most expensive per patient psychiatric condition within the VA, with the majority of affected Veterans receiving some level of service connection. Pharmacological advances have helped to alleviate acute psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions. However, current interventions are not sufficient to improve recovery and adaptive functioning, particularly in the social domain.

Most of the care of chronic pain patients occurs during hurried primary care visits with pharmacological treatments (e.g. opioids and medications) despite mixed evidence of efficacy and increased risk of potentially dangerous side effects, including addiction and death. Even when these treatments are effective in reducing pain, they may not improve mental and functional status. The need for easy access to evidence-based non-pharmacological treatment options that include patient information and skill building would be helpful to chronic pain patients. To address this need for non-pharmacological approaches to treating chronic pain, we propose developing the GEMINI platform to facilitate the delivery of online Integrative Medical Group Visits (IMGV) via video conferencing with evidence-based home practice and self-management tools covering such topics as mindfulness, mind-body practices, self-management of chronic pain, stress reduction, sleep, and nutrition. We hypothesize that the use of the GEMINI intervention would result in reduced pain impact, better pain-related patient outcomes, improved self-efficacy in pain management, and reduced pain medication use.",9525324;9880273 (contact),"GARDINER, PAULA MARIE;HAAS, NIINA M.

Despite advances in therapeutic options, optimizing glycemic control still remains an elusive goal. Since excessive glucose production is the main source of increased glucose levels in T2D, understanding mechanisms that regulate glucose production would have important therapeutic implications. Our recent data suggest that the brain exerts important restraining effects on the liver’s glucose production, but that elevated fatty acid levels in T2D impair this regulation.

The VA has also recognized the importance of caregiver input through their Campaign for Inclusive Care. Since most military caregivers are family members, it is even more important for technology to optimize their caregiver role. A collaborative flexible ARM shared control system that allows the Veteran to dictate how its usage best meets their changing needs will increase Veteran’s ability to engage in self-care, allow for greater participation in the community, and allow for those who care for Veterans with disabilities to spend more time in the role of family member, further positively impacting quality of life.",78232044 (contact),"STYLER, BREELYN  (contact)",NA,2023-09-01,2025-08-31,Activities of Daily Living;Address;Agreement;algorithm development;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis;arm;arm function;arm movement;assistive robot;authority;Automobile Driving;Awareness;Back;Behavior;Benchmarking;career;Caregiver support;Caregivers;Caring;Clinical;Cognitive;cognitive ability;Communities;Complex;Computer software;Decision Making;design;Development;Diagnosis;disability;drinking;empowerment;Environment;Evaluation;Event;experience;Family;Family Caregiver;Family member;Feedback;Fill-It;flexibility;Future;Goals;Hand;Hand functions;Home environment;human subject;human-robot interaction;Impairment;improved;indexing;Individual;Industry;innovation;Interruption;Intuition;Investments;iterative design;Joystick;K-Series Research Career Programs;Left;Literature;Manuals;Measures;Methodology;microwave electromagnetic radiation;Military Personnel;military service;Modeling;Modification;Monitor;Movement;Multiple Sclerosis;Nature;operation;Performance;Persons;Phase;Population;Positioning Attribute;Powered wheelchair;predictive modeling;preference;Preparation;Principal Investigator;Process;Psyche structure;Quadriplegia;Quality of life;recruit;Reporting;Research Design;Robot;robot assistance;robot control;robot rehabilitation;robotic device;Robotics;Role;Rotation;Self Care;Self-Help Devices;service member;smart home;success;Surveys;System;Techniques;Technology;technology platform;Time;tool;Training;United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration;Upper Extremity;usability;Veterans;Vision;Voice;Water;Wheelchair user;Wheelchairs;Work;Workload;Wrist,Flexible Control Authority With a Robotic Arm: Facilitating Seamless Transitions Between User and Robot Control in Multi-Action Manipulation Tasks.,4259,RRD8,Career Development Program - Panel I[RRD8],NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA

Understanding of voltage-dependent K+ channel structure and function relates directly to health and disease. Their function has been associated with such basic cellular functions as the regulation of electrical activity, signal transduction and osmotic balance. K+ channels are members of the voltage-dependent channel superfamily, which include explicitly voltage-activated channels (Na+, Ca2+, and a large number of K+ channels), as well as voltage-independent channels (i.e., the inward rectifiers and the cyclic nucleotide activated channels). The sub-family of non-domain swapped K+ channels include a great deal of functional diversity, including depolarization activated (EAG, hERG), hyperpolarization-activated (KAT1, HCN), and dual voltage and Ca2+ activation (BK). In higher organisms, dysfunctions associated to these channels may lead to uncontrolled periods of electrical hyperexcitability, like epileptic episodes and cardiac arrhythmias.

This research will test the hypothesis that defects in NER sensitize cancer cells to DNA damaging drugs such as platinum agents by investigating the effect of mutations in, and developing inhibitors of, the critical scaffolding NER protein XPA. These studies will provide important new insights into the etiology of cancer therapy resistance and lay the foundation to explore the potential of inhibiting NER as a means to enhance anticancer therapies and contribute to the implementation of precision medicine in treating cancers.",1879138 (contact),"CHAZIN, WALTER J.

Similarly, non-sputum diagnostic biomarkers of active tuberculosis (TB) can facilitate the development of highly sensitive point-of-care diagnostics. However, access and utilization of data science methodologies has been limited in ethnically diverse HIV-infected pediatric communities in Africa. To promote the utility of highly sensitive predictive and diagnostic tools of MetS and TB, we propose a collaborative data science project that integrates temporal electronic health records with multi-omics data.

More effectively treating pain with non-opioid strategies is key, but low motivation and logistical barriers have interfered with many patients transitioning from long term opioid therapy to other evidence-based treatments.

The only cure for many patients with these diseases is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT). However, the new immune system from the transplant (graft) often launches a multisystem attack against the patient (host), termed chronic graft-versus-host-disease (cGVHD). Treatment options are inadequate, and cGVHD will kill most long- term HCT survivors who overcome their original cancer. Clinical trials of promising new treatments as well as the ability to make optimal patient care decisions are thwarted by the absence of assessments to determine whether patients are responding to treatment or progressing. The proposed research will study the ability to objectively and reliably measure cGVHD in skin by a combination of innovative handheld, noninvasive tools: 3D photography, artificial intelligence, and the Myoton device.

We will test whether OMPs identified in colorectal tissues can also be identified in whole blood samples using epigenome-wide data from >850K CpGs and analyze the association of OMP in CRC patients with known CRC molecular subtypes and with future clinical outcomes in controls; and study the association of genetic (single nucleotide polymorphisms including ancestry informative markers) and environmental (diet and social determinants of health) factors with OMPs.",12102563 (contact),"GHOSH, JAYASHRI  (contact)","YOUNG, MATTHEW R",2023-09-20,2028-08-31,adenoma;Affect;African;African American;African American population;Age;anti-cancer research;Applications Grants;Biopsy;Black race;Blood;Blood specimen;BRAF gene;Cancer Detection;cancer health disparity;Cancer Patient;cancer type;caucasian American;Caucasians;Clinical;Coin;Colon;colon cancer family registry;colon cancer patients;Colonoscopy;Colorectal;Colorectal Cancer;colorectal cancer prevention;colorectal cancer risk;colorectal cancer screening;Communities;comparative;CpG Island Methylator Phenotype;CpG Islands;Data;Death Rate;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Diet;dietary;DNA;DNA Markers;DNA Methylation;early detection biomarkers;Early identification;Endoscopy;Environmental Risk Factor;Epigenetic Process;epigenome;Fecal occult blood;follow-up;Frequencies;Future;Gastroenterology;Gene Expression;Genes;Genetic;genetic variant;Genotype;Germ Lines;Goals;Health;high risk population;Incidence;Individual;KRAS2 gene;Location;Malignant Neoplasms;Methylation;methylation biomarker;methylation pattern;methylome;MLH1 gene;molecular marker;molecular subtypes;mortality;Mucous Membrane;Mutation;Normal tissue morphology;Outcome;patient population;patient subsets;Patients;peripheral blood;Phenotype;Polyps;Prevention;Procedures;prognostic;prognostic tool;Questionnaires;Race;racial disparity;Recording of previous events;recruit;Research;research study;response;Risk;risk prediction;Sampling;screening;Screening for cancer;Screening procedure;sex;Single Nucleotide Polymorphism;social health determinants;Subgroup;Surrogate Markers;Testing;The Cancer Genome Atlas;Tissues;tool;Treatment Protocols;treatment response;tumor;Tumor Tissue;University Hospitals;Variant;Whole Blood,Development of blood-based methylation biomarkers for CRC risk prediction,281948,BMCD,Basic Mechanisms of Cancer Health Disparities Study Section[BMCD],NA,NA,2,331620,193998,525618,NA

To address these needs, we develop a nature-inspired and machine perfusion enabled, subzero solution to dramatically extend preservation times of human and porcine (xeno) kidneys to (168-216h) 7-9 days, with thevalidation towards clinical application being accomplished with renal orthotopic autotransplantation in a porcine model, without and with “anywhere in the world” shipping, and complementary randomized physiologic ex-vivo assessment trial of 7-9 days stored human kidneys.",14611964;1897660;11211676 (contact),"BRANDACHER, GERALD ;TAYLOR, MICHAEL JOHN;WEEGMAN, BRADLEY P (contact)","GOSSETT, DANIEL ROBERT",2019-08-05,2026-08-31,3-Dimensional;Achievement;Address;Animals;animation;authority;Autologous Transplantation;biomaterial compatibility;Clinical;clinical application;clinical practice;clinical translation;combinatorial;conditioning;cost;Country;Cryopreservation;design;Disease;Donor person;drug testing;efficacy testing;Equilibrium;Equity;experience;Family suidae;flexibility;gene therapy;Generations;Goals;graft function;Graft Rejection;Graft Survival;Healthcare Systems;high throughput screening;Human;Ice;Image;Imaging technology;Immune Tolerance;Immunosuppression;improved;Incidence;Inequity;Inferior;Kidney;kidney preservation;Kidney Transplantation;Lead;Letters;life span;Link;Liver;liver preservation;Living Donors;Logistics;Malignant Neoplasms;manufacture;Marketing;medication safety;Metabolic;metabolic depression;Modeling;National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases;Nature;new technology;novel strategies;Operative Surgical Procedures;Organ;organ allocation;Organ Donations;Organ Donor;Organ Preservation;Organ Transplantation;Organ Viability;Oryctolagus cuniculus;Outcome;Patients;Perfusion;PF4 Gene;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;phase change;Physiological;Play;porcine model;preconditioning;preservation;Protocols documentation;Randomized;Rattus;Recovery;Reperfusion Therapy;Research;Role;scale up;Schedule;screening;Shipping;Slice;stress tolerance;success;Surgeon;System;Techniques;Technology;Temperature;Thermodynamics;Time;Tissues;Toxic effect;transplant model;Transplant Recipients;Transplantation;Transportation;United Network for Organ Sharing;Validation;Waiting Lists;Xenograft procedure,New approaches to kidney banking through nature-inspired high sub-zero preservation strategies,117801,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-KUDS-R(11)],NA,NA,3,606587,232635,897968,NA
