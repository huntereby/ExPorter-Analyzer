Significance The significance is the same as in the original application. C. Approach C1. Specific Aim #1. To determine the optimal dose of NA-112 providing neuroprotection in two mouse models of epilepsy. C1.1. Rationale.  We have selected two mouse models to evaluate the role of calpain-2 activation as the triggering mechanism in the development of epilepsy. No model perfectly reproduces all the features of the human disease; however, models provide critical information regarding the underlying mechanisms that could be targeted in the human disease. Repeated injections of low doses of KA or pilocarpine in C57Bl/6 mice will be used as models of epilepsy because they both lead to the appearance of SRS, are amenable to animal implantation with EEG-recording equipment and have a high degree of animal survival (11-12). We have shown that NA-112 is neuroprotective in the repeated low doses of KA mouse model and that intranasal NA-112 administration in mice results in brain calpain inhibition. This aim will determine the optimal dose of intranasal NA-112 providing neuroprotection in both models of epilepsy. C1.2. Preliminary Results C1.2.1. Effects of NA-112 in the repeated low doses of KA epilepsy model.  We recently completed a series of experiments to determine the role of calpain-2 in the development of pathological manifestations of SE in mice. Our findings have been published in Neurobiology of Disease (9), and only a summary of the results is reported below. - KA model of epilepsy: All mice received three, consecutive, ip injections of kainic acid (5 mg/kg) every 20 min (10, 24) and were video-recorded for seizure analysis. - Mice: We used WT (C57BL/6J), calpain-2 conditional knockout (C2CKO, CamKII-Cre+/- CAPN2loxP/loxP) with deletion of calpain-2 in all excitatory neurons of the forebrain, and control (CAPN2loxP/loxP) mice. In addition, other groups of C57Bl/6J (WT) mice received daily ip injections of NA-112 (0.3 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (60 mg/kg/day of β-cyclodextrin) for 7 days starting 2 h after seizure initiation. - All mice exhibited SE and we did not observe any mortality with this protocol up to 7 days after KA-induced SE. There were no significant differences between any group for latency to first seizures, duration of first seizures and cumulative duration of stage 3-5 seizures. This is important, as it indicates that calpain-2 deletion or inhibition does not influence the initiation or duration of seizures, but rather the processes leading to neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. - Seven days after seizure onset, numerous degenerating neurons were observed in hippocampus of WT animals, especially in the hilus of the dentate gyrus, identified as mossy cells; C2CKO mice were almost completely devoid of degeneration in all hippocampal subfields. Similar neuroprotective results were found when WT mice were treated daily with ip injections of NA-112. - Calpain-2 activation was detected in mossy cells up to 7 days after KA injection, and this activation was absent in C2CKO mice or in mice treated with NA-112. There was a clear correlation between calpain-2 activation in mossy cells with mossy cell death in WT mice. - KA-induced seizures resulted in strong astroglial and microglial activation in WT mice 7 days after KA-induced SE. Daily ip injections of NA-112 eliminated both astroglial and microglial activation. Similar results were found in the C2CKO mice. The prolonged duration of calpain-2 activation suggests that the window for intervention with a selective calpain-2 inhibitor following SE will be quite broad, although this will need to be further assessed in the Phase II of this STTR. - Cognitive performance was assessed by determining context-and tone-dependent memory in fear conditioning (FC) 7 days after seizure activity. Hippocampal-dependent contextual and tone memory was significantly impaired in WT and CAPN2 loxP (control) mice but not in C2CKO mice after seizures. Likewise, there was no significant impairment in mice treated daily with ip injections of NA-112. These results strongly support the premise that a selective calpain-2 inhibitor could be beneficial to prevent many of the neuropathological consequences of SE. - Blood P13BP levels are elevated after KA-induced seizures. We analyzed plasma levels of P13BP 24 h after KA-induced seizures (Fig. 1). P13BP blood levels were greatly  elevated 24 h after KA-induced seizures in WT but not in C2CKO mice. Similar  results were found in WT mice treated with NA-112 administered ip 3 h after SE  (not shown). Figure 1: Plasma levels of P13BP 24 h after KA-induced seizures. Blood was collected 24 h after KA-induced seizures and aliquots of plasma processed for western blot analysis of PTPN13 (WES system). The fragment migrating at 150 kDa is referred to as P13BP and quantified. Results are means ± S.E.M. of 6 animals. *** p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001. One way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni test.  C1.2.2. Intranasal delivery of NA-112 inhibits brain calpain-2 activation.  We tested the effects of intranasal administration of various does of NA-112 on calpain-2 activity in anasal NA-112 prevents KA-induced hippocampal calpain  hippocampus 24 h after the administration (Fig. 2). Calpain-2 activation was completely prevented at the lowest  activation in mice  dose tested (0.1 mg/kg). Higher doses further decreased calpain-  * 2 activation to levels lower than those seen in control conditions  suggesting that NA-112 inhibits basal levels of calpain-2 activity.

Design and Experimental Approach. These are identical to those presented in the original application. Rigor in experimental design and statistical analysis.  All studies will be done in a blinded fashion, with the examiners analyzing the data blind to the experimental groups. Animal ID will be revealed after initial data analysis for group means and statistical analyses. All experiments will be performed with male and female mice. As mentioned above, there might be some differences for some of the outcome measures; in this case, data will be analyzed separately. When no obvious differences in outcome measures are observed, the data will be combined. The number of experiments we are proposing is based on our own as well as on previously published studies indicating it should be sufficient to detect significant differences between experimental groups. Statistical differences will be calculated with Student’s t-test when comparing 2 conditions. When comparing more than 2 conditions, ANOVA followed by Bonferroni tests will be used to determine statistical significance. Justification for the supplemental funding. This supplemental funding is requested to cover the additional cost to purchase the equipment needed to perform the proposed experiments, which is a combined video-EEG recording equipment from Biopac. As can be seen in the below email from Biopac, the original quote of $87,898 was missing some essential parts. These parts are essential for the completion of the experiments, and the fact they were not included in the initial quote was completely unexpected. At present, there is no fund in the current budget to cover this additional expense and we are already working with the minimum budget we need to complete the proposed experiments.

I just left you a voicemail, but give me a call when you have a moment so we can update your quote with current expiration dates, etc: 408-656-9287 The pricing is still the same as when we last connected, but I see a missing MP160 on the last version of the quote I sent in March (only 1 instead of 2). Did you submit the quote as it was or did you add in the second MP160 to your gran submission? Anyways, give me a call and we will sort it out. Looking forward to working with you on this!

Nationally, there are more than 350,000 VA patients who carry the diagnosis of heart failure. In the St. Louis VA system alone, over 3,000 patients have heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and an equal, if not greater, number of patients have heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Following hospitalization, VA heart failure patients have a 22% chance of being re-admitted for worsening heart failure and 9% chance of dying within 30 days. It is increasingly recognized that the paucity of electrophysiological studies on the human heart has been a persistent barrier to advances in heart failure diagnosis and treatment.

This hybrid type 1 study will assess the efficacy, mechanisms, as well as facilitators and barriers to implementing the MATTER intervention, a virtually delivered 5-session text- enhanced psychobehavioral intervention designed to facilitate viral suppression by addressing internalized stigma and shame as barriers to engagement in HIV care among MSM and gender minority individuals living with HIV and SUDs in two locations with different levels of HIV resources (i.e., the Boston, Massachusetts and Miami, Florida metro areas). MATTER aims to mitigate the negative behavioral consequences of internalized stigma and shame on viral suppression by a) developing behavioral self-care goal setting skills and related self-efficacy, b) increasing metacognitive awareness (i.e., non-judgmental awareness of emotions and cognitions), and c) teaching and reinforcing compassionate self-restructuring (i.e., self- compassion), in addition to providing access to phone-based resource navigation.

Barriers to adequate data collection and synthesis are numerous and cross all clinical stakeholders: patients, providers, and health systems. Significantly, they include the pervasive view that FHH is unimportant except in select cases and that it rarely contributes to clinical decision making. With this perspective, few providers have been willing to allocate precious time to collect detailed FHHs or to learn the complex algorithms required to synthesize FHH data into actionable care plans. However, in studies of systematic FHH-based risk assessments in unselected populations, 25% of patients meet risk criteria for (actionable) hereditary conditions. FHH-based risk assessment programs have emerged to address these barriers, but as designed do not meet the needs of low literacy, low resource populations. The goal of this proposal is to develop a scalable end-to-end solution for risk assessment and management that meets the needs of low resource settings. Our central hypothesis is that combining FHH- driven risk assessment, a literacy-enhanced interface using voice-to-text response capture (like ‘Siri’), family engagement (through social networking platforms for data gather and risk sharing), and a genetic testing delivery system, will create a solution that engages and increases the proportion of diverse patients who are identified as at increased risk, who undergo testing, and, when appropriate, who initiate cascade screening among relatives. In this proposal we will define and deploy this new care delivery model as the “Genomic medicine Risk Assessment Care for Everyone” (GRACE). To this end we will 1) develop and deploy the model using pre-implementation assessments at clinical sites with highly diverse patient populations to select the most appropriate integration options and pathways for both patients and providers; and 2) perform a randomized implementation-effectiveness pragmatic hybrid trial to assess implementation and effectiveness outcomes relevant to these diverse populations. Outcomes will include reach, uptake, clinical utility, accessibility, genetic testing frequency, genetic testing results, and cost-effectiveness. In addition we will convene an advisory panel of stakeholders from industry (laboratories, insurers), providers, patients, and health system to understand sustainability and address knowledge gaps that will promote access when the trial is over.",7588547 (contact),"ORLANDO, LORI ANN (contact)","VOLPI, SIMONA",2024-07-01,2025-06-30,Address;Adoption;Agreement;Algorithms;Beds;Caring;cascade genetic testing;Clinical;clinical care;clinical decision-making;clinical research site;cohort;Complex;cost;cost effectiveness;Counseling;COVID-19 pandemic;Data;Data Collection;data platform;design;Development;effectiveness outcome;effectiveness/implementation trial;Enrollment;evidence base;Family;Family health status;Family member;Frequencies;genetic testing;Genomic medicine;Goals;Guidelines;health disparity;Health system;hereditary risk;Hybrids;implementation evaluation;implementation framework;implementation outcomes;implementation science;implementation/effectiveness;improved;Individual;Industry;Inherited;Insurance Carriers;Intervention;Knowledge;Laboratories;Learning;Length;literacy;Measures;Modeling;multi-ethnic;National Human Genome Research Institute;Outcome;Paper;Pathway interactions;patient population;Patients;Population;Population Heterogeneity;power analysis;pragmatic implementation;Primary Care;Process;programs;Protocols documentation;Provider;Randomized;Recording of previous events;recruit;Resource-limited setting;Resources;response;Risk;Risk Assessment;Risk Management;risk sharing;secondary analysis;Service delivery model;Site;Social Network;System;Test Result;Testing;Text;Time;uptake;Voice,IGNITE Cost Extension- Year 7,10231,NA,NA,NA,S3,5,235982,109138,345120,NA

Transcription copies DNA into RNA, a key process that permits gene expression. On occasion, the nascent RNA can become entangled with the DNA, resulting in an alternative three-stranded nucleic acid structure called an R-loop. R-loops form universally under normal conditions and are thought to play physiological roles in cells, including human cells. Studies have suggested, however, that under conditions where transcription is perturbed, harmful R-loops are created, leading to DNA breaks and chromosome anomalies. What distinguishes “good” from “harmful” R-loops remains unknown. Similarly, how harmful R-loops arise as a result of perturbed transcription is unclear. Using innovative technologies developed by my group, we will characterize the formation of so-called harmful R- loops under conditions of perturbed transcription in human cells. We will also determine whether harmful R- loops, or perturbed transcription itself, are the cause of the DNA breaks. Finally, we will determine if an enzyme known to relieve the DNA break problem is acting by resolving harmful R-loops or remediating the altered transcription. This work will benefit our understanding of fundamental cellular processes acting in our genome and will provide insights into a range of human disorders linked to perturbed transcription.",8304160 (contact),"CHEDIN, FREDERIC LOUIS (contact)","KRASNEWICH, DONNA M",2021-01-01,2025-12-31,Address;Attention;Biochemical;Biogenesis;Cell model;Cell Physiology;Cells;Chromosome abnormality;Data;Defect;Disease;DNA;DNA Damage;DNA Structure;DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase;Enzymes;Functional disorder;Gene Expression;genetic information;Genetic Transcription;Genome;Genomic Instability;Genomics;Human;Inherited;innovative technologies;insight;Knowledge;Life;Light;Link;Maintenance;Mammalian Cell;Mammals;Measures;Metabolism;Monitor;Nuclear;nucleic acid structure;overexpression;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Phenotype;Physiological;Planet Earth;Play;Process;remediation;Resolution;ribonuclease H1;RNA;RNA Processing;RNA Splicing;Role;Structure;Time;Work;Yeasts,Understanding the mechanisms underlying R-loop biogenesis and resolution in mammals,139549,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-CB-E(55)R],NA,S1,4,37915,16605,54520,NA

Our work will enable us to measure time-varying exposure to the built environment with unprecedented precision in large prospective cohorts, to elucidate potential relationships between the built environment and CVD health behaviors, to better specify pathways to CVD incidence, and ultimately, to yield actionable insights to guide land use policy and urban planning strategies to design cities that optimize cardiovascular health.",9787385 (contact),"JAMES, PETER  (contact)","COADY, SEAN",2020-07-01,2025-06-30,"Address;Adult women;Air Pollution;Ancillary Study;built environment;Cardiovascular Diseases;cardiovascular health;Catalogs;Cellular Phone;Cessation of life;Cities;cohort;Computer Vision Systems;Coronary heart disease;Cross-Sectional Studies;Data;deep learning;deep learning algorithm;design;Environment;Environmental Hazards;Environmental Risk Factor;Exposure to;extreme temperature;follow-up;Follow-Up Studies;Global Positioning System;Green space;Health behavior;Health behavior change;Health Professional;Health Promotion;Health Technology;Image;Imagery;Incidence;Infrastructure;innovation;insight;Intervention;land use;Lived experience;Location;machine learning algorithm;Measures;men;Methods;mHealth;Myocardial Infarction;Noise;novel;Nurses&apos; Health Study;Outcome;Participant;Pathway interactions;Patient Self-Report;Pattern;Perception;petabyte;Physical activity;Physical environment;Planet Earth;Policies;Population;Process;Prospective cohort;Prospective, cohort study;Questionnaires;Recording of previous events;residence;Resolution;Safety;Shapes;spatiotemporal;Specific qualifier value;Stroke;Time;Trees;urban area;urban planning;wearable device;Weight;Weight Gain;Work",Built Environment Assessment through Computer visiON (BEACON): Applying Deep Learning to Street-Level and Satellite Images to Estimate Built Environment Effects on Cardiovascular Health,150119,CHSB,"Cancer, Heart, and Sleep Epidemiology B Study Section[CHSB]",NA,NA,5,620750,138354,759104,NA

The Current Status of DATICAN  Project implementation started immediately after receiving the award letter in September 2023. The following  is a summary of the progress so far  a. Recruitments of Trainees. We started by recruiting the trainees proposed for year 1 of the project. We  were able to recruit 36 participants, comprising 12 PhD students, 12 MSc students, 6 postdocs and 6  Faculties. We achieved 100% of the recruitment target for year 1.  b. Training of PG students, Postdocs and Faculty. This is ongoing, conducted by UChicago colleagues  c. Training of Secondary School Students. This is ongoing. Conducted by Nigerian trainers  d. Hackathon in Lagos. This was held in the first week of April 2024. It was very successful and the  feedbacks were very positive. 5. Justification for Supplemental Project  The focus of DATICAN is to produce a new generation of data scientists who will be able to use their skills  to improve healthcare delivery in SSA. There are 3 major requirements for achieving this, these are the  relevant skills set, local data peculiar to the SSA and computational resources.  1 a. Relevant skills set in Data Science and Medical Image Analysis. Our partner in the USA has  commenced training towards meeting the skills set requirement. The training started in  December 2023 as virtual classes. They visited Nigeria in the first week of April 2024 to conduct  practical physical and hands-on training. They will also be training the Nigerian trainers in  Chicago in the third week of April. The Nigerian trainers were visiting UChicago when this  supplementary grant application was submitted, to receive hands-on training through the  training-the-trainer programme organized by UChicago. These Nigerian trainers will take over  the training responsibilities from our USA partner in the second year of the project. This  approach was to allow Nigerians to take charge and own the training thereby making the project  sustainable. With the progress so far, we are optimistic that DATICAN already has the potential  to bridge the skill gap in data science with application in medical image analysis. b. Local Data and Repository. Irrespective of the skill sets of our trainees, it will be impossible for  those skills to give good products that could help to improve healthcare delivery without access  to local data. This is because data science and Artificial Intelligence technologies are data-  driven and African data is unique because of many factors, such as lifestyles and genetic  compositions. Through our partnership with some teaching hospitals in Nigeria, we have  identified some medical imaging data like Magnetic Resonance Images, Computed  Tomography, Mammograms, Ultrasound, X-Rays, etc. We have collected some of these  imaging data and stored them on our hard disk. We were excited to see that there are hundreds  of thousands of medical imaging data available in Nigeria. We planned to build a repository for  these images, but unfortunately, the data are unstructured, un-curated and some of them are  even unlabelled. This implies that the data are not in a useful form. We need data common to  collect and store de-identified data from our partnering hospitals. The data will be used for  training and for implementing the different projects to be executed by our trainees. We also  need a platform that is Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) - compliant  to avoid violation of the privacy and security of the data. Our number one priority in this  supplementary project is to extend DATICAN to include data curation and proper data  management, this is to make data sharing amongst the three institutions possible. The data  curation will contain the following stages  1) Data Collection and Data Integration. This will require visiting 5 teaching hospitals that  we currently partner with. University College Hospital Ibadan (UCH), Lagos State  University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital  (OAUTH), Afe Babalola University (ABUAD) and University of Lagos Teaching Hospital  (LUTH). The data were acquired for different purposes and using different protocols but  most of them are in dicom formats. We will arrange and integrate them based on the  clinical conditions, image modalities, anatomy and diagnosis  2) Data Cleaning. The datasets are unstructured and contain a mixture of modalities and  anatomy. We will need to separate them, remove dirty data and sort them into a usable form  3) Data Labelling. Most of the images do not have diagnosis information. We will work with  the medical experts to supply diagnosis information and then label the images appropriately  4) Data Anonymization. All the datasets contain patient’s information. We will need to  write computer programs to anonymize the data before use.  5) Data Storage. All cleaned, well sorted and anonymized data will be stored in a  dedicated server.  6) Local Repository development. The dataset will be used to build a repository. This will  be the first repository containing Nigerian medical images. We anticipate that the  repository will contain about 10,000 medical images of different modalities, anatomy and  from different sites within Nigeria. We will make efforts in the future to secure grants to  extend the repository to contain more images. c. Computational Resources. Application of Data Science and AI technologies in medical image  analysis requires access to compute infrastructure such as High-Performance Computing (HPC)  with Graphic Processing Units (GPUs). This is mainly because medical images are huge and 2 processing them on CPU alone is not feasible, most especially when training large volumes. Our original plan was to leverage the HPC of our USA partner, the University of Chicago (UChicago). We have submitted a request to UChicago for all our trainees to be given access to the HPC of UChicago. We got the approval in March 2024 and DATICAN-LAB has been created for us. All our trainees now have access to the HPC of UChicago. This is, obviously, a great achievement for us and we are grateful to UChicago and NIH for this unique opportunity given to Nigerians through DATICAN. The downside of this is the lack of sustainability and scalability. The lifespan of DATICAN is 3 years, so what happens to our trainees in terms of access to HPC after DATICAN? The only way forward is for us to have our own HPC. Additionally, the skills acquired by our trainees will be useless if they do not have access to computational resources similar to the ones that we are currently training them on. Our number two priority in this supplementary project is to acquire an HPC with a GPU that will be housed in a secured data center in LASUTH and accessible to all partnering institutions. A desktop system equipped with GPU will also be procured at the training location at LASUTH for faster data processing and visualization. 6. Science Drivers and Use Cases 6.1 Case Study DATICAN currently has 36 trainees, comprising of PhD students, MSc students, postdocs and early career Faculties from 3 Universities. An additional 36 participants will be recruited in years 2 and 3 of the project. Each of the current participants has a project focusing on using data science technology and medical image analysis skills to solve health-related problems in Africa. All the projects require access to African medical data and an HPC. Please see Table 1 for the list of project topics of the current 36 trainees. The topics cover patients with breast cancer, stroke, pulmonary tumour, cervical cancer, lung cancer, sickle cell anaemia, stroke, tooth problems, skin cancer, dementia, tuberculosis, prostate cancer and traumatic brain injury using diverse imaging modalities like MRI, ultrasound, mammogram, Computed Tomography and X-rays images. We have data available at 5 teaching hospitals that we currently partnering with us, these are University College Hospital (UCH), LASUTH, OAUTH, ABUAD and LUTH. These data were acquired after securing the Institutional Review Board (IRB). The data were acquired for different clinical conditions and using different protocols but most of them are in dicom formats. We have collected about 2000 of these datasets already. 6.2 Sample Use Cases We have 36 use cases but we will explain two here. First, one of our trainees is working on the detection of hyperacute and acute staged ischemic brain stroke and his focus is to use MRI images. We already have about 1000 images of brain MRI. To execute this project, the trainee will need to collect the brain MRI images from DATICAN. Then clean, anonymize, and use it to build his deep learning model. Then the raw data and processed data will be curated. The trainee will be supported by the data Curator and Radiologist to be hired as part of this project. The data curator will help with data cleaning, anonymization and curation while the radiologist will help with labelling. Another example is about a trainee working on the early detection of breast cancer using machine learning techniques. We have already collected about 1000 mammogram images. The trainee will collect the data from us. Then clean, anonymize, and use it to build his machine learning model. Then the raw data and processed data will be curated. The trainee will be supported by the data Curator and Radiologist to be hired as part of this project. The data curator will help with data cleaning, anonymization and curation while the radiologist will help with labelling. 6.3 Data Curation and Integration 3 The current dataset are not labelled, not anonymized and not curated. We will get the data labelled, cleaned, anonymized and curated. We will also integrate the data because they come from different succes and for different purposes. We will build a repository with a user interface to allow easy search and querries.

Conclusion  The NIH-funded capacity building project in Africa is a collaborative project between LASU and two Nigerian  universities (RUN and UI) and with UChicago. The project is funded for 3 years from 2023. Project  implementation started in September 2023 and we have achieved all the deliverables proposed for the first  2 quarters of the first year. While collecting data needed for the training and the use cases, we discovered  that the medical imaging data are unstructured and not in a usable form. We also discovered that there is an  urgent need for computational resources. We hereby request for funds for data curation and the purchase of  computational resources. We strongly believe that both the computational resources and repository will be  useful not only for the member institutions of DATICAN, but for all data scientists and clinicians interested in  using AI and data science technologies to improve healthcare delivery in Africa. 8",14529978;78877887 (contact);11753884;8362601,"ADENIJI-SOFOLUWE, ADENIKE TEMITAYO;ARIBISALA, BENJAMIN SEGUN (contact);HAPPI, CHRISTIAN T.;PEARSON, ALEXANDER THOMAS","LASH, TIFFANI BAILEY",2023-09-20,2026-08-31,Abdomen;Accreditation;Achievement;Acute;Africa;Africa South of the Sahara;African;African ancestry;African Women;Algorithms;American;Anatomy;antimicrobial;Applications Grants;Appointment;Artificial Intelligence;Award;Back;biomedical imaging;Biomedical Research;Board Certification;Body part;Brain;Brain hemorrhage;Brain imaging;Brain Ischemia;brain magnetic resonance imaging;Brain Mapping;Brain Neoplasms;Breast;Breast Cancer Early Detection;Breast Cancer Model;British;Budgets;Cancer Biology;cancer classification;Cancer Detection;Cancer Patient;career;Caring;Case Study;Chairperson;Charge;Chicago;Classification;Climate;Clinical;clinical imaging;Clinical Research;Collaborations;college;Communicable Diseases;Communication;computational platform;Computer Models;computer program;computer science;Computer Vision Systems;computerized data processing;computing resources;convolutional neural network;Country;Cowpox;Data;Data Analyses;data anonymization;data centers;data cleaning;Data Collection;data curation;data de-identification;Data Engineering;data integration;data management;data pipeline;data repository;Data Science;Data Scientist;Data Security;Data Set;data sharing;Data Storage and Retrieval;data visualization;Dedications;deep learning;deep learning model;deep neural network;Dementia;Dental;Dental caries;design;Detection;detection platform;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Digital biomarker;digital pathology;Disease;Doctor of Philosophy;doctoral student;Early Diagnosis;Early Intervention;Early treatment;early-career faculty;Education;Educational process of instructing;Educational workshop;Ethical Issues;Ethics;Evaluation;experience;Faculty;FAIR principles;Federal Government;Feedback;Fostering;Foundations;Funding;Future;Generations;generative adversarial network;Genetic;Genomics;global health;Grant;hackathon;Head and Neck Cancer;Health;health care delivery;health data;Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act;Healthcare;Hematologist;Hematology;High Performance Computing;high risk;High School Student;Hospitals;Human Genetics;Human Resources;Image;Image Analysis;image archival system;imaging approach;imaging modality;Imaging Techniques;improved;Individual;Information Technology;Infrastructure;Institution;Institutional Review Boards;instrument;interest;International;Interventional Imaging;Italy;Joints;Journals;Knowledge;Label;Laboratories;Leadership;Learning;lecturer;Legal;Letters;Libraries;Life Cycle Stages;life span;Life Style;Liver;Location;Lung;Machine Learning;machine learning model;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Malignant Breast Neoplasm;malignant mouth neoplasm;Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Malignant neoplasm of prostate;Mammography;Mathematics;Measurable;Medical;Medical Imaging;Medicine;meetings;member;Mental Health;Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Program;Mentors;Methods;Modality;Modeling;Molecular Biology;Monitor;multidisciplinary;Multimodal Imaging;Names;Nature;neuropsychiatry;Neuropsychology;next generation;Nigeria;Nigerian;Oncologist;Oncology;open data;Organ;Paper;parent project;Participant;pathology imaging;Patient Care;Patients;Peer Review;Persons;Physicians;Physics;Pneumonia;point of care;Policies;Positioning Attribute;Postdoctoral Fellow;precision oncology;predictive modeling;Prevention;Principal Investigator;Privacy;Process;professor;programs;Protocols documentation;Psychiatry;Publishing;Pythons;radiologist;Radiology Specialty;recruit;repository;Reproducibility;Research;Research Personnel;Residencies;Resolution;Resource-limited setting;Resources;Retrieval;Roentgen Rays;Running;Sampling;Science;Scientist;Secure;senior faculty;Services;Severities;shot learning;Sickle Cell Anemia;Site;skill acquisition;skills;Skin Cancer;Societies;software development;Sorting;statistics;Stroke;Structure;student training;Students;Supervision;System;Systems Biology;Teaching Hospitals;Teaching Materials;Techniques;Technology;TensorFlow;Therapeutic;Thoracic Radiography;Time;timeline;Tooth structure;Trainers Training;Training;Training Programs;transfer learning;Traumatic Brain Injury;Tuberculosis;tumor;Ultrasonography;ultrasound;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;unstructured data;usability;virtual;Visit;Woman;Work;Writing;X-Ray Computed Tomography;X-Ray Medical Imaging,Data Management and Compute Platform for Data Science Training - Supplementary Grant for DATICAN,35490,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1(70)-R],NA,S1,2,69073,2806,71879,NA

Patient with DLB have accelerated cognitive impairment and psychosis compared to patients with Parkinson’s disease, and at autopsy they frequently have features that are found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease, including amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, in addition to the hallmark Lewy bodies that are composed of the protein alpha- synuclein (aSyn). The factors that cause patients with DLB to develop dementia more rapidly than patients with Parkinson’s disease are not completely understood, but the APOE4 variant of the apolipoprotein E gene is strongly associated with risk of DLB, similar to its association with risk of Alzheimer’s disease. We recently reported that human forms of APOE specifically regulate pathological aggregation of aSyn when expressed in mice. We will investigate the relationship between APOE genotype and specific cell types that accumulate aSyn aggregates which are believed to contribute to neurodegeneration in DLB. Specifically, we will examine the impact of APOE genotype on the ability of astrocytes and microglia, two important types of glial cells in the brain, to take up and degrade harmful aSyn aggregates. By better understanding the genetic and cellular changes that link the APOE4 risk gene to pathological aSyn aggregation and neurodegeneration, we should be able to develop novel treatments to slow and prevent DLB, Alzheimer’s disease, and related dementia illnesses.",7816061 (contact),"DAVIS, ALBERT A (contact)","YAO, ALISON Q",2023-09-01,2026-08-31,Acceleration;alpha synuclein;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Alzheimer&apos;s disease model;Alzheimer&apos;s disease patient;Alzheimer&apos;s disease related dementia;Alzheimer&apos;s disease risk;Apolipoprotein E;apolipoprotein E-4;Astrocytes;Autopsy;Binding;Biological;Body Composition;Brain;brain dysfunction;Brain region;cell type;Cells;Cessation of life;Clinical;Cost aspects;Data;Dementia;dementia risk;Dementia with Lewy Bodies;Disease;E protein;Endosomes;experimental study;Gene Expression;Genes;Genetic;Genetic study;genetic variant;Genotype;Goals;Human;Impaired cognition;Impairment;Knowledge;Lewy Bodies;Lewy Body Disease;Link;Mediating;Microglia;mouse model;Mus;Nerve Degeneration;Neurofibrillary Tangles;Neuroglia;Neurons;novel;Parkinson Disease;particle;Pathologic;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pattern;prevent;Process;Proteins;Psychoses;receptor;Reporting;Risk;risk variant;Role;Senile Plaques;Symptoms;Testing;trafficking;Variant,Role of APOE in endosomal processing of alpha-synuclein,83753,NA,NA,NA,S1,1,128016,71048,199064,NA

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and mediodorsal (MD) thalamus play a  critical role in cognitive flexibility, disrupted PFC or MD activity or their temporal coordination may lead to  impaired flexibility in attentional control, working memory and decision making. Guided by the converging  evidence from the literature and our own preliminary data, we propose that temporal coordination between  the MD and PFC in the beta/gamma range enable optimal cognitive control, and that their perturbation  underlies some of the cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. We will develop experimental and computational  tools that further clarify this link along with a set of interventional tools that may ultimately be deployed in  human patients. Our central hypothesis is that temporal coordination of the MD and PFC neural activity  (spikes and local field potentials) provides a readout of animal's ""state-of-mind"" during working memory,  and that temporally patterned MD neurostimulation provides an effective strategy to enhance prefrontal  engagement in cognitive processing. Specifically, we will combine multidisciplinary techniques (genetic  mouse model, animal behaviors, multisite electrophysiology, optogenetics, closed-loop brain-machine  interface, machine learning and computational psychiatry) to understand temporal dynamics of  coordinated MD-PFC neural activity during flexible cognition tasks for both schizophrenic and wild-type  mouse models. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that MD-PFC oscillatory entrainment deficits co-vary  with task-switching impairments in a high-penetrance genetic model relevant to schizophrenia. In Aim 2,  we will develop closed-loop patterned stimulation strategies to modulate MD-PFC circuits for improving  cognition. In Aim 3, we will develop spiking recurrent neural network models as a general platform for  prototyping interventions in the MD-PFC loop for cognitive dysfunction. Accomplishment of these aims is  highly significant for gaining translational insight into a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders related to  cognitive dysfunction.",10250055 (contact);8711227,"CHEN, ZHE SAGE (contact);HALASSA, MICHAEL M","VAZIRI, SIAVASH",2024-09-05,2029-05-31,22q11;Animal Behavior;Animals;Attention;attentional control;Behavior;Behavioral;Biological;brain machine interface;cell type;Characteristics;Cognition;Cognitive;cognitive control;Cognitive deficits;cognitive function;Collaborations;computational neuroscience;Computer Models;computerized tools;Data;Data Analyses;Decision Making;Development;Disease;Disparate;Dissection;DNA Sequence Alteration;efficacy study;Electrophysiology (science);Environment;Equilibrium;Esthesia;executive function;experimental study;flexibility;Foundations;Frequencies;Functional disorder;Genetic;Genetic Models;Human;Impaired cognition;Impairment;improved;innovation;insight;Instruction;Interneurons;Intervention;Joints;Knowledge;Lead;Link;Literature;Machine Learning;Mental disorders;Mind;Modeling;Molecular;mouse model;multidisciplinary;Mus;neural;neural network;Neural Network Simulation;Neurons;neuropsychiatric disorder;neuroregulation;optogenetics;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pattern;Penetrance;Performance;Phase;Phenotype;Play;Prefrontal Cortex;Primates;prototype;Psyche structure;Psychiatry;public health relevance;Publications;Publishing;Recording of previous events;recurrent neural network;Rodent;Role;Schizophrenia;schizophrenia risk;Sensory;Short-Term Memory;Site;Solid;Structure;success;Symptoms;Techniques;Testing;Thalamic structure;therapeutic target;therapeutically effective;therapy development;Thinking;tool;treatment strategy;Wild Type Mouse;Work,CRCNS: Dissection and control of cognitive thalamocortical dynamics,139352,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1 BN-P (50)],NA,NA,1,331250,98073,429323,NA

The filarial worm Wuchereria bancrofti, the main causative pathogen of lymphatic filariasis (LF), has been the focus of the most ambitious mass drug administration (MDA) programs ever implemented by WHO. With 50 countries theoretically approaching disease elimination in the next 5 years, there is an urgent need for new and sensitive field-deployable diagnostics that will assist countries in conducting post-MDA surveillance until 2030, and beyond. The key requirements of the TPP are that the test should be able to detect early infection, have >85% clinical sensitivity and > 98.8% specificity, and be field-deployable and cost-effective. To date, the best markers of early infection are IgG4 antibodies the human host generates in response to Wb123, a protein expressed by the infective (L3) stage of W. bancrofti. The only existing IgG4/Wb123 portable Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT), marketed by Abbott, had a clinical sensitivity around ¼ that of the corresponding ELISA. In earlier work, we have developed a prototype LFA for the detection of Wb123-specific IgG4 characterized by an analytical sensitivity 16-32 greater than that of the Abbott RDT and equal to the commercial Wb123 ELISA. This test is poised to meet the > 85% clinical sensitivity criterion but might fall short of the minimal (>98.8%) or ideal (>99.8%) specificity criterion. We now propose a biplex test allowing to simultaneously detect antibodies against two antigens, of which one will be Wb123, and the other one chosen from a series of five novel antigens, termed WbAg1-5 or WbAgX. The purpose of the dual test is to achieve a superior specificity by imposing the condition that both test lines must be visible to count the test as positive. We have been awarded a grant from the Task Force for Global Health (TFGH) and USAID to develop a prototype version of such a biplex assay. We are now requesting additional funding from the NIH to: (1) optimize the biplex assays (2) establish a biorepository of 2000 clinical samples and ensure that one biplex meets the WHO TPP with greater than 95% statistical confidence and (3) progress the selected biplex to manufacturing and commercialization. By the end of this Phase 1/2 Fast-Track grant, a total of 100,000 assays will be available for testing by the TFGH, the CDC, and other stakeholders to generate the field data necessary to secure its international endorsement.",11294169 (contact),"BIAMONTE, MARCO ANTONIO (contact)","JOY, DEIRDRE A",2022-05-01,2026-06-30,Achievement;Address;Advisory Committees;Affect;Aftercare;Antibodies;antibody detection;Antigens;Award;Benchmarking;biobank;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.);Clinical;Clinical Sensitivity;Collaborations;combat;commercialization;Communities;cost;cost effective;Country;Data;design;Detection;detection assay;Devices;Diagnostic;Diagnostic tests;Disease;disease diagnostic;Early Diagnosis;Ensure;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Exposure to;Filaria bancrofti;Filarial Elephantiases;Filariasis;Freezing;Funding;global health;Grant;Human;IgG4;Immunoglobulin G;improved;Infection;interest;International;Investments;Larva;lateral flow assay;Life;London;Low Prevalence;manufacture;manufacturing process;Marketing;Medical Device;National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease;neglected tropical diseases;novel;novel diagnostics;Parasites;pathogen;Performance;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacologic Substance;Phase;portability;Procedures;programs;Proteins;prototype;Publishing;Rapid diagnostics;rapid test;Recommendation;Recrudescences;repository;Research;response;Sampling;Secure;Sensitivity and Specificity;Series;Specificity;Speed;Stress Tests;Surveys;test strip;Testing;Time;transmission process;Tropical Climate;United States National Institutes of Health;USAID;volunteer;Work;World Health Organization,"Ultrasensitive, High-Specificity Rapid Test to Support the End-Game of the Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis",170131,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-AIDC-V(13)],NA,NA,2,569218,227687,852688,NA

Consequently, a major goal of NIH is to understand the neural mechanisms that underlie adaptive and maladaptive threat processing. The hippocampus and locus coeruleus both contribute to fear and anxiety, but it is not known how they interact during these states to promote the encoding of aversive memories. This represents a major gap in our understanding of the neural systems that contribute to emotional disorders. Altered catecholamine release by the locus coeruleus accompanies schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and ADHD, which are often comorbid with fear and anxiety disorders. Alzheimer’s disease also produces severe atrophy of the locus coeruleus, which reduces catecholamine release throughout the brain and is thought to exacerbate amnesia. To determine how altered catecholamine levels impact these disorders, it is essential to establish the basic mechanisms by which neuromodulatory inputs to the hippocampus regulate the formation of aversive memories.",7689233 (contact),"WILTGEN, BRIAN J (contact)","BABCOCK, DEBRA J",2023-08-01,2027-07-31,Address;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;American;Amnesia;Animals;Anxiety;Anxiety Disorders;Association Learning;Atrophic;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;Auditory;aversive conditioning;Aversive Stimulus;Bipolar Disorder;Brain;Catecholamines;comorbidity;conditioned fear;Cues;Data;Disease;Dopamine;Dopamine Antagonists;Dopamine Receptor;Dorsal;Electrophysiology (science);Emotional disorder;emotional experience;Environment;Event;experience;experimental study;Extinction;follow-up;Food;Fright;Future;Genetic;Goals;Hippocampus;Hour;Human;Impairment;in vivo;Learning;Life;locus ceruleus structure;long term memory;member;Memory;memory consolidation;Memory impairment;memory process;Mental disorders;Monitor;neural;neuromechanism;Neuromodulator Receptors;Neurons;neuroregulation;Norepinephrine;novel;optogenetics;Play;prevent;Procedures;Process;psychologic;Rattus;rehearsal;response;Role;Schizophrenia;sensor;Shock;Stimulus;Synaptic plasticity;System;Testing;Time;tool;Training;United States;United States National Institutes of Health,The role of novelty and surprise in aversive conditioning,129217,BRLE,"Biobehavioral Regulation, Learning and Ethology Study Section[BRLE]",NA,S1,2,62002,28330,90332,NA

Currently, many Veterans with CKD have poor awareness of their condition. This leads to suboptimal care. We anticipate that our proposed comprehensive pre-end stage renal disease (ESRD) education (CPE) will enhance Veterans’ CKD knowledge and their confidence in making an informed selection of an appropriate dialysis modality, and lead to an increase in the use of home dialysis (HoD) – an evidence-based, yet underutilized dialysis modality.

In the parent award of this proposal, ultrasonic uncaging of ketamine will be applied to the anterior cingulate cortex of patients with chronic pain to treat the affective component of this disorder – to modulate how severe the patient experiences pain, less so modulating whether they experience pain in the first place. This same strategy could in principle be applied to other neuropsychiatric disorders that have a strong affective component. In particular opioid use disorder (OUD) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide with a strong affective component. Traditional treatments like buprenorphine or methadone often fail to address the mood disturbances associated with OUD, leading to high relapse rates. Specifically, the withdrawal/abstinence period of OUD is associated with a negative affective state, dubbed ‘hyperkatifeia,’ that predisposes to relapse later. Like in the chronic pain application, ketamine uncaging targeted to a critical brain region could treat the affective component of substance use disorders, including OUD, to break the cycle of binge, withdrawal, and relapse that defines the disorder. In this training period, the candidate will explore the use of ultrasonic ketamine uncaging to modulate affective behaviors in rodent models of chronic pain as well as of OUD. This activity will better define the protocols for ultrasonic ketamine uncaging to be used in the clinical trial phase of the parent award, guide interpretation of the clinical and physiologic data in that clinical trial phase, and generate data to suggest further applications of ketamine uncaging, and the use of ultrasonic uncaging more broadly to treat affective disorders and the affective component of neuropsychiatric disease. During the preclinical phase of the parent award, the candidate will gain training in in vivo application of therapeutic ultrasound, neurobehavioral assay development and implementation, quantitative video behavioral analysis, functional ultrasound imaging, and neuroscientific data analysis. For the clinical phase of the parent award it is anticipated that the candidate will stay with the investigatory group, with or without a successful extension of this funding, to gain training in the clinical use of therapeutic ultrasound and neuropsychological trial implementation.",8010598 (contact);10909121,"AIRAN, RAAG D (contact);WILLIAMS, NOLAN R.","HUDAK, ERIC MICHAEL",2019-09-30,2026-07-31,Abstinence;Address;Affective;affective disturbance;analog;Anterior;anxiety-like behavior;assay development;awake;Behavior;behavior measurement;Behavioral;Biological Assay;Brain region;Buprenorphine;chronic pain;chronic pain management;chronic pain patient;cingulate cortex;Clinical;clinical translation;Clinical Trials;comorbidity;Control Groups;Data;Data Analyses;Disease;Dose;effective therapy;Ethology;experience;field study;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Funding;Goals;Image;Imaging Device;in vivo;Infusion procedures;Ketamine;Machine Learning;Measures;Mediating;Mental Health;Methadone;Modeling;Mood Disorders;Morbidity - disease rate;morphine administration;Morphine Sulfate;mortality;negative affect;nerve injury;Nervous System Disorder;neural;neurobehavioral;Neurons;neuropsychiatric disorder;Neuropsychology;non-opioid analgesic;opioid use disorder;opioid withdrawal;Outcome;Pain;pain model;parent project;Patients;Phase;Physiological;placebo group;pre-clinical;Process;Protocols documentation;Rattus;Relapse;Resolution;response;Rodent;Rodent Model;spared nerve;spatiotemporal;Substance Use Disorder;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Uses;Training;Ultrasonics;Ultrasonography;ultrasound;Withdrawal;Withdrawal Symptom,Clinical Translation of Ultrasonic Ketamine Uncaging for Non-Opioid Therapy of Chronic Pain,115637,NA,NA,NA,S1,3,84395,45573,129968,NA

While the VA has currently mandated a multifaceted prevention approach, including suicide risk screening of all Veterans seen for mental health issues, the continued large numbers of Veterans who attempt or die of suicide points to the desperate need for improved prediction of suicide risk. Existing prediction methods are subject to high rates of false alarm, so that only about 10% of Veterans flagged as at-risk actually attempt suicide; this high false alarm rate potentially diffuses critical clinical resources away from those who need them most.

This in turn is essential to support animal well-being as well as any future expansion of the Center's Indian origin rhesus macaque colony. It is well-known that species-specific plans for housing and management should be developed in any NHP facility. Such plans should also include strategies for environmental enrichment. The CPRC is one of the most important national resources for any research program using indian- origin (IO) rhesus macaques with no history of admixture and with well-defined genetic and virological backgrounds. Since 1938, the Center has supplied the scientific community with Indian origin rhesus macaques with known backgrounds and of the same genetic pool for use in studies of basic biology and diseases. In the last three years (2020-2023), 1,234 animals have been allocated from the CPRC program in support of NIH-high priority HIV/AIDS-research, mainly R01, P01, U01- funded academic investigators and NIAID-DAIDS-SVEU programs in USA. The CPRC has vast experience in the establishment and maintenance of rhesus macaque breeding colonies. The animal care and use program of the CPRC is in compliance with the directives established by the Animal Welfare Act (AWA), PHS and other agencies. The Center is AAALAC fully- accredited. The population management program has been designed to optimize the health and well-being of the monkeys, enhance the value of the colony for research, and provide healthy animals to the scientific community for a variety of studies. The Center is in the urgent need of renovating the behavior /environmental enrichment infrastructure severely affected by Hurricane Maria. This renovation will support the CPRC's plan for future expansion as well as the parent grant's objective of producing and distribute valuable genetically and virologically characterized rhesus monkeys for the research community.",10889706;9809437 (contact);7904195,"BURGOS-RODRIGUEZ, ARMANDO GIL;MARTINEZ, MELWEEN I.

Moving or shifting at regular intervals in the wheelchair redistributes harmful pressure and reduce risk for skin breakdown, yet these movements are a challenge to perform consistently. The challenge exists due to lack of sensation to let the individual know they need to shift their weight. Pressure mapping provides a detailed visual representation of pressure distribution and can compensate for impaired sensation.

Existing rodent models of PTE have reproduced aspects of this progression, including a temporal lobe epilepsy model. However, due to the key role of network localization of hyperexcitability in epileptogenesis, we propose that a large animal model (pig) with a gyrencephalic brain and complex white matter pathways may be the only way to model injury phenotypes and epileptogenesis accurately.
