Many factors can compromise a good night's sleep, including medical reasons (obstructive sleep apnea, lower back pain), mental health issues (PTSD, depression), and societal factors (shift work, childcare, financial stress, etc.). One well-recognized aspect of health impacted by sleep is immune function as short sleepers typically have more infections and weaker immune responses to vaccines. In particular, veterans commonly report insomnia, poor sleep, and daytime sleepiness; specifically veterans with chronic sleep disruption are at higher risk of chronic inflammatory diseases. While addressing sleep is the most sensible approach, improving or restoring proper sleep is practically challenging. This study aims to explore how the immune system ""senses"" adequate sleep.

Deciphering the histone code and how diet can modify it, gives us the means to exploit it to our advantage, especially during pathological conditions. We are proposing that histone H3K9-butyryl, H3K9- crotonyl, and H3K9-b-hydroxybutyryl, are products of the b-oxidation intermediates, butyryl-CoA, crotonyl-CoA, and b-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, or the ketone body, b-hydroxybutyrate, that are produced in the nucleus. The genomic distribution of these modified histones, how they are modified by diet in the presence or absence of stress, and their functional relevance, particularly in the heart, have not been investigated. Our results show that a high-fat diet exacerbates pressure overload-induced gene expression in the heart, worsening the prognosis of the disease, as a result of modifying the histone code.

A critical step during germination is the degradation of the cortex, a thick layer of modified peptidoglycan that maintains metabolic dormancy. Digestion of this protective layer is mediated by cortex lytic enzymes that recognize the spore-specific peptidoglycan modification, muramic-∂-lactam. As a result, mutants lacking muramic-∂-lactam fail to degrade their cortex layer and exhibit severe defects in germination. Previous work in Bacillus subtilis has shown that muramic-∂-lactam is generated through the sequential action of the CwlD amidase and PdaA deacetylase, which are conserved in all spore-forming bacteria. While B. subtilis CwlD has intrinsic amidase activity, we recently determined that the CwlD amidase produced by the bacterial pathogen, Clostridioides difficile, requires the GerS lipoprotein to deamidate N-acetylmuramic acid residues. Notably, GerS is only conserved in members of the Peptostreptococcaceae family, and our preliminary data indicate that only CwlD homologs from the Peptostreptococcaceae family can complement a C. difficile ?cwlD mutant, while B. subtilis and C. perfringens CwlD homologs cannot. These observations suggest that the Peptostreptococceae family uses an alternative mechanism to mediate cortex modification during spore formation. Since our data also indicate that GerS and CwlD interact stoichiometrically, and we have recently crystallized this complex, the goal of this proposal is to determine the mechanism by which GerS regulates CwlD amidase function in C. difficile. We will test the hypothesis that GerS binding to CwlD allosterically activates CwlD function and distinguish between different models for why C. difficile CwlD function depends on GerS. These models include that GerS (i) functions as a co-factor to license CwlD’s amidase activity, recruits CwlD to the forespore, and/or (ii) facilitates CwlD’s recognition of C. difficile’s unique cortex structure. To accomplish these goals, we will use mutational analyses, heterologous expression systems, biochemical analyses, and cell biological techniques to determine the requirements for not only C. difficile CwlD amidase activity but also B. subtilis CwlD amidase function. These comparative analyses will provide mechanistic insight into the regulation of cortex modification in spore-forming bacteria. The proposed work may also expand our understanding of how bacterial amidases can be allosterically regulated by binding partners.",9949186 (contact),"SHEN, AIMEE  (contact)","BLATCH, SYDELLA ANNE",2021-02-01,2025-11-30,Acute;Affect;amidase;Anaerobic Bacteria;Attenuated;Bacillus subtilis;Bacteria;Bacterial Spores;Binding;Biochemical;Biological;Biological Assay;Cell Wall;Cells;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.);Chimeric Proteins;Clostridium difficile;Clostridium perfringens;cofactor;comparative;Complement;Complex;Crystallization;Data;Deacetylase;deamidation;Defect;Dependence;Development;Digestion;disease transmission;Enzymes;Escherichia coli;Exhibits;Family;Family member;Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer;Genome;Germination;Goals;Growth;Healthcare Systems;Homologous Gene;In Vitro;Individual;Infection;insight;Lactams;Licensing;Lipoprotein (a);Lipoproteins;Location;LytA enzyme;Measures;Mediating;member;Membrane;Metabolic;Modeling;Modification;mutant;Mutation;Mutation Analysis;N-acetylmuramic acid;pathogen;pathogenic bacteria;Pattern;Peptidoglycan;Physiology;Predisposition;prevent;Process;Proteins;Recording of previous events;recruit;Recurrence;Recurrent disease;Regulation;Reporter;Reproduction spores;Role;Structure;System;Techniques;Testing;Thick;Virulence;Work;Zinc,Regulation of spore peptidoglycan modification,140361,PCMB,Prokaryotic Cell and Molecular Biology Study Section[PCMB],NA,NA,4,241181,121811,362992,NA

We propose to expand on our prior work on machine learning models that continuously process complex data from disparate sources to design and deploy in real-time an intelligent decision support system at the bedside.

A major gap in knowledge is how genetic mutations alter endometrial cancer risk in obese women, and evidence points towards impaired protein quality control as an important causal mechanism. This proposal addresses the goals of the NCI Strategic Plan to identify and characterize risk factors for cancer, to study how cellular stress responses contribute to cancer development and progression and to develop and test new approaches for cancer prevention through studies that will determine if recurrent phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway mutations reshape protein quality control mechanisms in obese women at-risk for endometrial cancer.",2048300 (contact),"WILSON, MICHAEL R (contact)","KUMAR, AMIT",2021-04-01,2025-11-30,Address;American Cancer Society;anti-cancer research;Aromatase;Automobile Driving;Award;Bioinformatics;biological adaptation to stress;Body Weight;cancer cell;Cancer Patient;cancer prevention;cancer risk;career;career development;Cell Death;Cell Death Induction;Cell Survival;Cells;Cellular Stress;Data;Development;Disease;DNA Sequence Alteration;driver mutation;Endometrial;endometrial cancer prevention;Endometrial Carcinoma;Endometrium;Endoplasmic Reticulum;endoplasmic reticulum stress;Environment;Epithelium;Estrogens;expectation;experience;Faculty;Genetic;Genetically Engineered Mouse;genomic profiling;Goals;graduate school;Growth;Gynecologic Oncology;High Risk Woman;Home;Homeostasis;Impairment;improved;Incidence;insight;Institution;Invaded;Knowledge;Lead;Location;Malignant Neoplasms;Mentors;Metabolic;Metabolism;Michigan;mouse model;mutant;Mutation;Myometrial;Normal Cell;novel;novel strategies;Nucleotide Biosynthesis;nutrition;obese person;Obesity;pandemic disease;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Phenotype;Phosphatidylinositols;Phosphotransferases;Play;Positioning Attribute;Postdoctoral Fellow;Pregnancy loss;prevent;preventive intervention;Preventive measure;Preventive treatment;programs;protein folding;Proteins;proteostasis;Quality Control;Recurrence;Research;Research Institute;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;response;Risk;Risk Factors;Role;Sampling;Secure;Shapes;Signal Transduction;Somatic Mutation;Strategic Planning;Stress;Techniques;tenure track;Testing;Therapeutic;therapeutic target;Time;Training;Training and Education;transcription factor;tumor;tumor metabolism;tumorigenesis;uncontrolled cell growth;United States;Universities;Uterus;Woman;Women&apos;s mortality;XBP1 gene,Does obesity influence protein quality control in endometrial cancer?,252152,NCI,Transition to Independence Study Section (I)[NCI-I],NA,NA,4,161688,87312,249000,NA

Next, we will determine the effects and mechanism of FGF1 on hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis and intestinal cholesterol absorption.

Cartilage deterioration and OA can be debilitating, causing pain, discomfort, and reduced quality of life; Veterans are more than twice as likely to experience these issues due to trauma and wear-and-tear from service.

Moreover, in addition to the established role for transferrin, we have identified H-ferritin as a significant iron delivery protein to the brain. The gap in our knowledge addressed in this application is how brain iron uptake is regulated.

He has been involved in the development and characterization of a variety of mouse models of TBI, AD, PD and comorbid conditions, and performing molecular level analyses with novel omic technologies. He has been a key investigator on the original and current contracts with Dr. Crawford and along with Dr Benoit Mouzon and Andrew Pearson generated the preliminary data described in this proposal. Dr. Ojo will continue to work alongside Dr. Crawford in directing all aspects of this project and provide supervision and full oversight on the overall approach, mTBI animal modeling, histopathological and molecular analyses, and data interpretation for the experiments outlined in this application. He will also be responsible for overseeing all aspects of animal manipulation, injuries, and treatment, ensuring that the projects are executed in a timely fashion. He will also perform some of the histopathological and biochemical assessments in the animal models described in the proposal. Fiona Crawford, Ph.D. (co-Investigator, 0.6 calendar months effort per year at no cost) is a molecular geneticist and biologist with over 30 years of experience in researching neurological conditions including investigation of molecular and clinical aspects of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). Dr. Crawford is the President and CEO of the Roskamp Institute and she directs the TBI Research program and polyomics programs at the Roskamp Institute. She will provide supervision on the overall approach, mTBI animal modeling, pathological studies, and data interpretation. In particular, she will interact with all the team members listed on this application and work along with Dr Ojo in providing oversight as they implement the work proposed in this application, including regular communication with the expert consultants (Loane and Bioinformatics Team). Andrew Pearson M.S. (Research Associate, 6 calendar months in Years 1 and 2) is the Roskamp Institute TBI Research Team’s Research Associate. He is experienced in animal handling and surgical procedures, as well as histopathological characterization, molecular analyses, (such as western blotting and ELISA), glial isolation, ex vivo cultures and omic analyses. He will assist in all experimental injury procedures and treatment schedules and conduct histopathological/molecular analyses with the supervision of Dr. Ojo. OTHER EXTERNAL COLLABORATORS David Loane, Ph.D. (Consultant to the project, at $2500 in Year 2) leads a multi-disciplinary research team dedicated to studying the complexities of traumatic brain injury (TBI), neuroinflammation and tissue repair. His research investigates the activation status and functional role of resident microglia and infiltrating immune cells in the injured brain, and how they contribute to ongoing neurodegenerative processes that promote long-term neurological dysfunction after brain trauma. The primary focus of his recent work has focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms that regulate microglial/macrophage function with the goal of manipulating these cells to attenuate destructive pro-inflammatory responses, and promote protective pro-repair responses. Thus, his experience fits perfectly with the goals and direction of this proposed study.

According to previous reports, as much as one third of HAI cases can be attributed to environmental surfaces, namely “high touch” surfaces (e.g., bed rails, machine buttons, equipment), in hospitals. Self-sanitizing coatings, i.e., antimicrobial surfaces, are an ideal theoretical solution for eliminating persistent pathogens; however there has been no commercially available antimicrobial material which can achieve high biocidal efficacy against pathogens with other necessary attributes, such as easy to apply, broad material compatibility, no resistance development to pathogens, and cost-effective. HaloFilm™ is a breakthrough product. HaloFilm is a spray-on product that when dried leaves a thin transparent film on a surface. The film is a polymer composed of one repeating unit with a functional group that adheres to a surface, and another functional repeating unit that stabilizes the chlorine. HaloFilm turns the surface into a chlorine battery so when it is used with a chlorine-based disinfectants it will allow the surface to be covered with the same level of chlorine found in a pool. HaloFilm is the only product that can pass EPA testing protocols as the supplemental residual antimicrobial coatings and films against bacteria and an enveloped virus surrogate for SARS-CoV-2. In fact, the EPA tested 20 of commercial products and none of the spray-on products achieved the 3-log reduction against Phi6 that HaloFilm achieved. HaloFilm is Halomine Inc.’s first product and is protected by exclusively licensed patents from Auburn University and Cornell University and will be brought to market in 2023 in collaboration with Diversey, a $2.7 billion global hygiene and infection control company. In this Phase II we will continue development of our product category by deepening our understanding of its efficacy against pathogens that are problematic in healthcare environments, extend HaloFilm’s use by developing a wipe based HaloFilm product, and investigate potential for an optimum companion product that can maximize biocidal efficacy of the product in service.",79543953 (contact),"NKEMNGONG, CARINE  (contact)","XU, ZUOYU",2020-08-05,2025-05-31,2019-nCoV;Adhesions;Affect;analog;antimicrobial;Antimicrobial Resistance;Bacteria;Beds;Biocide;Categories;Cessation of life;Charge;Chemistry;Chlorine;Collaborations;commercialization;Companions;Consumption;Copper;cost;cost effective;Development;Disinfectants;Dopa;drug resistant bacteria;Dryness;Effectiveness;Environment;Equipment;evaporation;Film;functional group;fungus;Gram-Positive Bacteria;Hand;Health Care Costs;health care settings;Health Personnel;Healthcare;healthcare-associated infections;Hospitals;Hygiene;Infection;Infection Control;innovation;Intellectual Property;invention;Language;Legal patent;Licensing;Link;Marketing;meetings;Methods;microbial;migration;minimal risk;Mussels;Nosocomial Infections;Paint;pathogen;Patient Discharge;Patients;Perception;Performance;Phase;Polymers;Predisposition;Procedures;Process;Protocols documentation;Reporting;Residual state;Resistance development;Rubber;Sanitation;Services;Silver;Source;Stainless Steel;success;Surface;surface coating;System;Techniques;Testing;Thinness;tool;Touch sensation;Universities;Virus;Visual;Work,"HaloFilm: a spray-on, re-chargeable, re-applicable antimicrobial coating",155114,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-AIDC-V(13)B],NA,NA,3,496333,198533,743507,NA
