Background The burden of HIV disease worldwide remains disproportionally concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the only region with the majority of HIV infections occurring among women and a region with exceptionally high rates among young women aged 15-24. Control of the HIV epidemic globally, in SSA and in a country like Kenya in the top 10 high HIV burden countries requires increased attention to the condition of women and adolescent girls. In such countries effective implementation and expansion of HIV prevention and treatment interventions that have been proven to work are urgently needed. In addition, it is critical to understand the biological, psychological and structural factors, as well as unique co-morbidities, that women living with HIV (WLHIV) face, especially as they age. Building the in-country capacity to design and conduct implementation-focused research addressing the health of women affected by HIV is the primary goal of the parent Fogarty-funded program led by Drs. Elizabeth Bukusi (Kenya Medical Research Institute [KEMRI]) and Carey Farquhar (University of Washington [UW]), entitled, Women and HIV: Translation of Research into Practice (WHIV). From 2015 to the present, the WHIV Fogarty training program has supported 27 researchers as they have earned advanced degrees at the University of Washington and University of Nairobi (23 MPH, 4 PhD). One major challenge for these trainees has been bridging the gap between their advanced degree training and establishing an independent research career. Those who have successfully obtained a K43 or similar career development award have been able to launch their research careers. Those who have not been able to secure post-graduate funding have had a more challenging time achieving independence and instead have largely remained as co-investigators on others’ grants. Post-graduate funding is essential to ensure success of recent graduates conducting research to address important gaps in the health of women living with HIV and increase our understanding of the intersectionality of HIV infection and women’s health, and the long-term effects of HIV for women. Providing funding, mentorship and support for new investigators to successfully transition into initiating independent research on HIV and women’s health issues is the primary goal of this supplement. 2. Objective We propose to leverage the KEMRI/UW WHIV Fogarty D43 training program to increase capacity for research responsive to this request for applications by supporting two new investigators who recently graduated with an MPH from UW. They will conduct high-impact mentored research in Kenya focused on health of WLHIV across the lifecycle, leading to their independence as an investigator and a strong foundation for a research career. 3. Approach 3.1 Overview The supplement will support two new MPH graduates launch their research careers in Kenya by providing by providing them with tools, mentorship, and experience to bridge them to an independent career in HIV research focused on women living with HIV and women’s health at KEMRI and partner institutions. The one-year post- graduate fellowship award includes funding for a stipend and for the candidate’s own research project. It also includes mentorship from a team of highly qualified KEMRI and UW researchers, individual coaching, group meetings, seminars, and skills- building workshops to promote their career development. 3.2 Program leadership The proposed program will be directed by Dr. Elizabeth Bukusi at KEMRI with support from Dr. Carey Farquhar and the administrative team at UW. Both Drs. Farquhar and Bukusi have substantial experience with Fogarty training programs, as well as other training programs in Kenya. They have been successfully co-directing the Women and HIV: Translation of Research into Policy training program since it was funded 9 years ago and are excited to continue to work together and co-lead activities proposed in this supplement. Elizabeth Bukusi, MBChB, MMed, MPH, PhD, Program Director, is an obstetrician/gynecologist, epidemiologist and a Chief Research Officer at the Center for Microbiology Research, KEMRI. She earned an MPH in 2000 and PhD in Epidemiology at the UW in 2006. Dr. Bukusi was awarded a postgraduate diploma in research ethics (University of Cape Town) in 2010 and completed a master’s degree in Bioethics. Her research focuses on sexually transmitted infections, reproductive health and HIV prevention, care and treatment and she was one of the two co-founders of KEMRI’s Research Care and Treatment Program (RCTP). She was founding chair of KEMRI’s Program on Sexual, Reproductive, Adolescent and Child Health and currently serves as Core Faculty for the Fogarty-funded UCSF Glo-Cal Fellowship. She co-chaired the HPTN Women at Risk Committee and serves on the Kenya MOH National HIV Prevention Task Force. In the last 25 years she has mentored over 100 Kenyan and international scholars and is the PI/Co Director for a FIC Bioethics Training Program expanding Masters training in 2 Kenyan universities. She is also an accredited executive coach. Carey Farquhar, MD, MPH, Program Director, is a Professor jointly appointed in the Departments of Global Health, Medicine and Epidemiology at the University of Washington and Director of the UW IARTP since 2003. In May 2022, she was appointed the Interim Chair of the UW Department of Global Health. Her research has focused most recently on HIV testing and assisted partner notification services in Kenya, HIV and cardiovascular disease risk factors, and research with marginalized and unreached populations, such as persons who inject drugs. She has mentored more than 60 US and Kenyan trainees earning degrees at UW and published more than 260 papers on HIV-related topics, global health leadership and capacity building in under-resourced settings, ~25% of which have her trainees as first author. Several of her trainees have been successful obtaining NIH career development awards, such as the GRIP (1), K43 (3), K01 (1), K23 (2), as well as NIH Diversity supplements (2). 3.3 Selection process The KEMRI/UW WHIV program has issued a request for proposals from our alumni and networks and has identified 4 post-graduate researchers as finalists for this funding opportunity. These 4 will submit full-length proposals for review by the WHIV Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) which will recommend two finalists to receive research funding and support for the one-year fellowship. TAC members include Dr. Dorothy Mbori-Ngacha, Dr. Criag Cohen, Dr. Patty Garcia, Dr. Edwin Were and Dr. Joseph Zunt. All 5 have extensive experience with Fogarty training programs and have been WHIV TAC members since 2015. They are familiar with the training opportunities, mentors, and resources available in Kenya for graduates of the WHIV program and will be able to identify trainees with the highest potential for success, the strongest mentorship teams, as well as those projects that are high-impact and feasible in the available timeframe available. They will be provided with a rubric and asked to assess the applications using criteria for the candidate, proposed mentorship team and the research project. Candidates must have a track record of excellent performance and a clear goal statement, expressing their commitment to working in the field of women’s health and HIV; mentorship teams must include mentors at both KEMRI and UW who have expertise in the research area as well as in mentoring trainees at this level; research projects will be considered based on their responsiveness to the call for research on women living with HIV across the lifecycle and their potential for impact, innovation and feasibility. 3.4 Finalist candidates and proposed studies The 4 finalists for this post-graduate fellowship are listed below followed by brief biographies and overviews of the research projects they are proposing and their mentorship teams (Table 1). Biosketches for the finalists are also included as attachments to this proposal. Of these 4 finalists, 2 will be selected by the WHIV TAC for the post-graduate fellowship which will include funding project expenses, as well as a stipend to provide fellows with time to conduct the research. Shradha Doshi, MBChB, MMed, MPH: Cardiovascular health and risk stratification in women aging with HIV Dr. Shradha Doshi is a medical doctor from Kenya. She earned her Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery, and Master of Medicine degrees from the University of Nairobi, Kenya. She has 16 years of experience as a doctor, nine of which she has focused on HIV care and treatment. As a consultant physician, Dr. Doshi practices clinical medicine at The Aga Khan University Hospital in Nairobi, Kenya. She has also worked in HIV prevention research in Kenya with the Kenya Medical Research Institute. Her primary research interests were pulmonary hypertension and the use of cardiovascular biomarkers as diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive markers in heart failure. Dr. Doshi received her MPH in Global Health from the UW in 2023 and her thesis was entitled, “Association between mild chronic kidney disease and coronary artery disease in persons living with and without HIV in Uganda.” Dr. Doshi proposes to conduct a cross-sectional study involving 100 women over the age of 50 who are living with HIV. This study aims to evaluate cardiac abnormalities in older women living with HIV by utilizing 2D echocardiograms and NT-pro BNP levels and factors associated with this finding. Few studies have assessed comprehensive aging data with echocardiographic assessments and biomarker analysis. Dr. Doshi aims to fill the gap by enhancing understanding of the interplay between frailty, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular health in this population. The specific aims include 1) to determine the prevalence of cardiac abnormalities in older women living with HIV using 2D echocardiographic assessments. 2) To evaluate the levels of NT-pro BNP as a biomarker for cardiovascular risk and potential heart failure in older women living with HIV. 3) To correlate traditional cardiovascular risk factors and NT pro-BNP levels with echocardiographic findings. The study will leverage the supplement to the Fogarty-funded D43 award entitled, Women and HIV: Translation of Research into Policy (TW009783). The parent study investigates the prevalence and correlates of frailty and osteoporosis among women aged 50 and above with HIV. Dr. Doshi will utilize existing data from the parent study, including age, sex, duration of HIV, antiretroviral therapy (ART) usage and type, CD4 count and viral load, history of cardiovascular risk factors like smoking, diabetes, hypertension and body mass index (BMI), current HbA1c levels, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan parameters such as T-score and body composition and frailty scores. The study will additionally conduct blood draws to measure NT-pro BNP levels to screen for potential heart failure. She will also collect additional data on structural and functional cardiac status by performing 2D Echocardiography and NT pro-BNP on participants. Table 1.

Elizabeth  Harrington, Cyrus Mugo, Maricianah Onono, and Elizabeth Bukusi Stanley Ndwiga, MBChB, MPH: Exploring the Psychosocial Factors Influencing Viral Suppression among Adolescents and Young Adults Living with HIV: A Qualitative Follow-up Study Dr. Stanley Ndwiga is a medical doctor at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and most recently was a study coordinator, supervising teams of research clinicians. He also coordinated study regulatory matters, drafted SOPs and trained study staff on study protocol and study operational manuals. For the last three years, he has worked in HIV prevention research in Kenya with KEMRI. Dr. Ndwiga received his MPH in Global Health from the University of Washington in June 2024. Dr. Ndwiga’s study aims to provide deeper insights into the psychosocial challenges faced by Adolescents and Young Adults (AYA) living with HIV to inform the development of targeted interventions and improve adherence to ART and viral suppression. The findings will help healthcare providers tailor support services to better meet the needs of this population and contribute to the broader literature on HIV care and support, particularly in Kenya and similar resource-limited settings, highlighting the importance of addressing mental health, stigma, and social support in the management of HIV among AYA. The primary objective of this study is to explore the personal experiences and perspectives of adolescents and young adults living with HIV, focusing on how psychosocial factors affect their ability to achieve and maintain viral suppression. The secondary objectives include identifying barriers and facilitators to achieving viral suppression, understanding the role of primary care givers and other social support systems and stigma in adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), and exploring the coping mechanisms and interventions that AYA find most acceptable and effective. This study will employ a phenomenological qualitative design, utilizing in-depth interviews and focus group discussions to gather detailed information. The population of interest includes AYA aged 15-24 years living with HIV who participated in a previous quantitative study. The study will be conducted at the Thika Partners in Health Research and Development (PHRD) research clinic in Kiambu County, Kenya, and will also include participants from Murang’a and Nairobi Counties. Purposive sampling will be used to select participants who exhibit a range of experiences with viral suppression and psychosocial challenges. Data will be collected through the use semi-structured interview guides informed by the CFIR framework and conducted by trained qualitative researchers. Thematic analysis will be used to identify and interpret patterns and themes related to psychosocial factors and their impact on viral suppression. Marilyn Nyabuti, MBChB, MPH: Structured counseling and warm handover to promote successful linkage of WLHIV during the transition from MCH to CCC Dr. Marilyn Nyabuti is a medical doctor trained at the University of Nairobi, Kenya, and is a team lead/co- investigator in a NIH-funded clinical trial in Western Kenya. She received her MPH in Global Health from the University of Washington in August 2024. Dr. Nyabuti’s research interest lies in understanding the unique cyclic barriers adolescents and youth seeking HIV prevention and treatment contend with as they transition through the different life-stages. Dr. Nyabuti’s study aims to provide evidence demonstrating the need for guidelines to assist healthcare providers to ensure uniform services for women living with HIV during the transition period from MCH to CCC, and to reduce the incidence of treatment interruptions among these women. Dr. Nyabuti proposes an intervention to provide targeted psychosocial counseling three months in advance, followed by a warm handover to CCC staff for WLHIV at increased risk of HIV treatment interruption (women <25 years, screening positive for depression, and newly diagnosed with HIV during PMTCT follow-up). The specific aims of this intervention are: 1) To evaluate the correlation between structured psychosocial counselling and warm handover and successful linkage to CCC during transition from MCH to CCC. 2) To assess the impact of counselling and a warm handover during transition from MCH to CCC on one year retention in HIV care. 3) to estimate the incremental cost of offering targeted counselling and a warm handover to WLHIV during the transition from MCH to CCC. Dr. Nyabuti will use a cluster-randomized control study with randomization at clinic level to enroll at least 300 women living with HIV aged 15 years and above who have completed PMTCT follow up and are scheduled for transition to the CCC who screen positive for any form of depression or aged <25 years old or newly diagnosed with HIV during PMTCT follow up. Each participant will have 4 study visits as follows: 3 months prior to transition, on day of transition, within 2 weeks after CCC appointment date, and 1 year post transition. Additionally, she will collect micro-costing and time and motion data to compare the resources used to deliver the intervention to the resources used in standard of care. She postulates that the intervention will reduce the proportion of women who miss their initial visit at CCC after transition and facilitate sustained retention up to 1 year post transition thus improving their health outcomes and improving their quality of life. In addition, she hopes that her results will inform the development of clinical guidelines that will guide healthcare workers when transitioning women from PMTCT to CCC. Dismas Ouma Congo, MBChB, MPH: A pilot study to evaluate the integration of point of care for sexually transmitted infection screening into the routine care of women living with HIV aged 18 to 49 years Dr. Dismas Ouma Congo is a research scientist at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), Centre for Microbiology Research in Kisumu. In this role, he develops clinical standard operating procedures, executes them, ensures participant safety and general health, and submits safety reports to both sponsors and local ethics committees. Dr. Ouma Congo received his MPH in Global Health at the University of Washington in June 2024 and was awarded the Outstanding MPH Student award by the Department of Global Health. Dr. Ouma proposes a study to evaluate organizational readiness, as well as the feasibility and acceptability of the use of POCT for STI screening and management, using self-collected genital swabs in the Lumumba subcounty HIV care clinic in Kisumu County. His proposed study hinges on the central hypothesis that a POCT for STI testing that integrates self-collection by WLHIV and links them to treatment offers distinct advantages from a syndromic or provider-collected swab approach. According to UNAIDS 2022 report, approximately one million women aged between 15-49 years were living with HIV in Kenya, with the highest incidence of new HIV infections occurring among women aged 15-24 years. No studies in Kenya currently assess the use of POCT for STI testing among WLWH, the most affected group, and allowing for self-collection of samples. This study includes the following aims: 1) To determine factors influencing the acceptability and feasibility of POC STI testing for WLHIV, and characterize baseline readiness to implement POC STI testing. The study will administer surveys and conduct workshops with WLWH attending their routine care clinic and the healthcare providers to assess the acceptability and feasibility of POC STI testing. 2) To pilot POC STI testing for WLWH and determine early implementation outcomes, including acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness, and understand factors necessary for expanded use. The study will pilot the use of POC STI testing among 100 WLWH-attending their routine HIV care clinic using self-collected swabs. Dr. Ouma will use the laboratory at the Lumumba CIS building to conduct POC STI testing for CT, GC, and TV. This laboratory has staff with extensive experience in POCT for STIs. The estimated turnaround time is 2 hours. Those who test positive will be treated according to 2022 National STI treatment guidelines and offer intimate partner notification and testing for those who agree to notify their sexual partners. Dr. Ouma will also administer surveys to assess factors associated with STIs including socio-demographic variables, sex and relationships, and reproductive history. He will also conduct a focus group discussion with WLWH and key informant interviews with providers to assess factors necessary for expanded use of POC STI testing in HIV clinics using self-collected swabs. Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR): All the trainees identified as finalists for this fellowship have completed the RCR course at the University of Washington in Fall 2022 and have met NIH’s RCR training requirements. 3.5 Mentors Mentorship will be a critical component of this project.

We aim to clarify this ultrasound skeletal muscle abnormality which could serve as a clinically feasible, novel, easy, noninvasive, nonionizing, and inexpensive method to detect developing skeletal muscle insulin resistance and muscle dysfunction, as a precursor of developing type 2 diabetes, allowing earlier interventions and more aggressive treatments for metabolic and muscle dysfunction, prior to these complications accelerating.",78325673 (contact),"SOLIMAN, STEVEN B (contact)","LAUGHLIN, MAREN R",2024-08-15,2025-07-31,Abnormal Hemoglobins;Acceleration;Adult;adult obesity;Affect;Age;aggressive therapy;Beta Cell;Biopsy;Blood capillaries;Clinical;Clinical Markers;cohort;Communities;Cross-Sectional Studies;Defect;deltoid muscle;density;Deposition;Detection;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Diagnosis;Disease Progression;Early Diagnosis;Early identification;Early Intervention;Economic Burden;effective therapy;Evaluation;Expenditure;experimental study;Failure;Fiber;Fibrosis;Functional disorder;Glucose;Glycogen;Glycosylated hemoglobin A;Guidelines;Health;health care economics;Histologic;Histology;Hour;human subject;illness length;imaging modality;improved;indexing;Inflammatory;Insulin;Insulin Resistance;Life Style Modification;Lipids;Lower Extremity;Measurement;Measures;Metabolic;Metabolic dysfunction;Methods;mitochondrial dysfunction;mortality;mouse model;Muscle;musculoskeletal ultrasound;Non obese;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Non-Invasive Detection;novel;Obesity;OGTT;Organ;Outcome;Patients;Persons;Prediabetes syndrome;prevent;prospective;Publications;quadriceps muscle;Quality of life;quantitative ultrasound;reduced muscle strength;Research;Research Design;Risk;Risk Reduction;Sampling;Signal Pathway;Skeletal Muscle;socioeconomics;Testing;Time;treatment optimization;Ultrasonography;ultrasound;United States;United States Preventative Services Task Force;Update;Upper Extremity,Early Type 2 Diabetes Detection with AI-Analysis of Skeletal Muscle Ultrasound and Mechanistic Evaluations,133298,CTIS,Clinical Translational Imaging Science Study Section[CTIS],NA,A1,1,250000,139621,389621,NA

The EBR technology will be applied to accomplish three goals: i) Design a hybrid mRNA vaccine that combines attributes of mRNA and protein NP vaccines by encoding the self-assembling S-EBR NP construct to enhance vaccine potency against SARS-CoV-2 and VOCs; ii) Engineer S-EBR NPs to package and deliver mRNAs encoding S or S-EBR as an alternative to lipid NPs for efficient, targeted, and cost-effective mRNA vaccine delivery; iii) Design mosaic S-EBR NP-based universal CoV vaccine candidates that present S proteins from multiple CoV strains to elicit cross-reactive immune responses against a broad spectrum of CoVs and protect against future outbreaks.",78284933 (contact),"HOFFMANN, MAGNUS ADRIAN GERO (contact)","MILLER, BECKY",2024-06-22,2027-08-31,2019-nCoV;Acceleration;Amino Acid Sequence;Antibody Response;Antibody titer measurement;Applications Grants;Award;B-Cell Activation;betacoronavirus;Binding Proteins;Cell surface;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Research;Collaborations;Combined Vaccines;Complex;Coronavirus;coronavirus pandemic;Coronavirus spike protein;cost;cost effective;COVID-19 pandemic;cross reactivity;Cytoplasmic Tail;design;Development;Disease Outbreaks;Dose;Educational process of instructing;emergency preparedness;Encapsulated;Endosomes;Engineering;Ensure;Epitopes;Faculty;Financial Support;Funding;Future;future outbreak;future pandemic;Goals;graduate student;Health;HIV-1;Human;Hybrids;Immune;Immune response;Immunity;in vivo;Individual;industry partner;Infection;Injections;Institution;invention;Job Application;Laboratories;Length;lipid nanoparticle;Liquid substance;low income country;manufacture;member;Membrane;Membrane Proteins;Mentors;Messenger RNA;Monoclonal Antibodies;mosaic;mRNA delivery;Mus;nanoparticle;neutralizing antibody;novel vaccines;pandemic coronavirus;pandemic disease;Pathway interactions;Persons;Population;preclinical development;preclinical study;prevent;Prevention;Production;programs;Property;Protein Binding Domain;Proteins;Readiness;receptor binding;recruit;Research;Research Personnel;response;RNA vaccine;RNA-Protein Interaction;Robot;SARS-CoV-2 spike protein;SARS-CoV-2 variant;self assembly;Sorting;student mentoring;System;T-Cell Activation;Technology;technology platform;Therapeutic;Tissues;Translational Research;transmission process;universal coronavirus vaccine;Vaccinated;vaccine candidate;vaccine delivery;vaccine development;vaccine platform;vaccine response;vaccine strategy;vaccine-induced antibodies;Vaccines;variants of concern;Virus;Zoonoses,Self-Assembling Spike-EBR Nanoparticles as a Vaccine Platform Technology Against SARS-CoV-2 and Future Pandemic Coronaviruses,33362,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-PSE-H(70)R],NA,NA,3,250000,222500,472500,NA

The standard of care for advanced melanoma currently includes molecular-targeted therapies of BRAF and MEK inhibitors, as well as immunotherapies with checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD1. However, many melanoma patients either do not respond or relapse from the current treatments. Therefore, discovering new effective therapies for malignant melanoma is still a pressing issue in the VA patient care mission. The objective of this project is to discover the therapeutic potential of the new generation of clinical-trial-ready drugs targeting pro-survival proteins to treat melanoma by inducing apoptosis, especially for tumors from patients unresponsive to current treatments.

Vascular pathologies across all vasculature are linked to dementia of all causes, particularly the two major subtypes, Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD). The current application seeks to fill the scientific gaps by uncovering a novel function of smooth muscle cell (SMC)-expressed Runx2 in regulating cardio/cerebrovascular pathologies and VaD, and developing a novel paradigm underlying the Runx2-dependent signaling network in regulating SMC phenotypic switch. Results from these studies should also have important clinical implications in developing potential strategies for maintaining vascular integrity and improving cognitive function and quality of life.

I recently demonstrated that the balance of proliferation and differentiation in mouse early erythroid progenitors can be manipulated with glucocorticoid or TGFβ signaling, and results in increased (by glucocorticoids) or decreased (by TGFβ) proliferative capacity; however, the molecular mechanisms by which these proliferative capacity alterations occur are unknown and it is unclear if this developmental biology paradigm observed in mice will translate to humans. To begin developing this preliminary finding into novel therapeutic approaches for Diamond-Blackfan anemia, I propose to determine the mechanism for alteration of proliferative capacity of early erythroid progenitor cells by identifying direct gene targets of the transcription factors downstream of glucocorticoid and TGFβ signaling, and also determine if glucocorticoids and TGFβ elicit the same effect on proliferative capacity of erythroid progenitor cells from normal human donors and patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia.",8440580 (contact),"LI, HOJUN  (contact)","ROY, CINDY",2020-07-01,2025-06-30,Affect;American Society of Hematology;Anemia;Architecture;Automobile Driving;Award;Basic Science;BFU-E;Binding;Biology;Biomedical Research;Bone Marrow;Bone marrow failure;Boston;career development;Cell Count;Cell Cycle;Cell Differentiation process;Cell division;Cells;CFU-E;Child;Chromatin;Clinical;clinical efficacy;Collaborations;Development;Developmental Biology;Diamond-Blackfan anemia;differential expression;Differentiation Antigens;Disease;disease model;Ensure;Equilibrium;Erythrocytes;Erythroid;Erythroid Cells;erythroid differentiation;Erythroid Progenitor Cells;Erythropoiesis;Erythropoietin;Failure;follow-up;Fostering;Functional disorder;Gene Targeting;Generations;Genes;Glucocorticoid Receptor;Glucocorticoids;GYPA gene;Hematological Disease;Hematopoiesis;Hematopoietic stem cells;Human;improved;inhibitor;insight;Institution;International;MADH2 gene;Malignant Neoplasms;Maps;Marrow;Mediating;Mentors;Molecular;Mus;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutic intervention;novel therapeutics;Output;Patients;Pharmacotherapy;Physicians;Positioning Attribute;Postdoctoral Fellow;prevent;Principal Investigator;Production;progenitor;Proliferating;Receptor Activation;Receptor Signaling;Repression;Research;research and development;Research Personnel;Resistance;RNA;Science;Scientist;Signal Transduction;single-cell RNA sequencing;skill acquisition;Speed;stem cell differentiation;stem cells;success;Testing;TFRC gene;Therapeutic;Time;Tissues;Toxic effect;Training;Transcript;transcription factor;transcriptome;transcriptomic profiling;transcriptomics;Transducers;Transforming Growth Factor beta;Transforming Growth Factor beta Receptors;Translating;Translations;Work,Regulating proliferation and differentiation of erythroid progenitors,123414,DDK,"Kidney, Urologic and Hematologic Diseases D Study Section[DDK-D]",NA,NA,5,153000,12240,165240,NA

Growing evidence suggests that tumor cell clusters exhibit  deleterious advantages over signal tumor cells in terms of invasion, survival, drug resistance, and colonization,  and may be the dominant form of tumor cells that leads to metastases. Hence, understanding how tumor cell  clustering gives rise to these collective advantages is of critical importance in countering cancer. Altered  metabolism is a hallmark of cancer and holds great potential as a therapeutic target. Recent reports suggest that  tumor clusters exhibit a distinct metabolic profile when compared to single tumor cells and that cell-cell binding  can alter cellular ATP production. Hence, we hypothesize that cell clustering may provide tumor clusters with  collective advantages by altering their bioenergetics. We will leverage our expertise in tissue and extracellularmatrix  engineering, metabolic imaging, and computational modeling to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will  investigate how cell-cell interactions affect the bioenergetics of the tumor clusters. We will combine micropattern  and microfabrication to engineer tumor clusters of different sizes and shapes to precisely control the degree of  cell-cell adhesions and develop a physics model to combine the free energy of the cluster system with the active  cellular ATP energy. In Aim 2, we will investigate how cell-matrix interactions affect the bioenergetics of the  tumor cluster. We will engineer the mechanical properties, ligand types, ligand densities, and topography of the  matrix to study how these factors may affect the energy production of the cells in the cluster and the associated  metabolic signaling. In Aim 3, we will investigate how heterogeneous cell-cell interactions and metabolism affect  the bioenergetics and dynamics of the tumor clusters. We will leverage our expertise in sorting cells based on  metabolic or other phenotypes and control the degree of heterogeneous cell-cell interaction by controlling the  mixing ratio of the sorted cell subpopulations. We will further combine experiments and modeling to identify if  tumor clusters of a certain size, shape, and heterogeneity, and in a certain extracellular microenvironment will  become energetically unstable and thus more likely to invade or become less sensitive to perturbations thus  more likely to survive. Together, the proposed study will establish a systematic understanding of how different  aspects of cell clustering contribute to the bioenergetics of each cell in the cluster and the whole cluster, which  may then lead to their collective advantage. As therapeutics that are effective for single cells often fail for tumor  cell clusters, the successful completion of this project will lay the foundation for future studies that allow the  development of efficient cancer therapies to counter cancer as it relates to tumor cell clustering, micrometastases,  and metabolic adaptation.",15829247 (contact),"ZHANG, JIAN  (contact)","CUPIT, PAULINE",2024-07-01,2026-02-28,Affect;Arkansas;Binding;Bioenergetics;cancer therapy;Cell Communication;Cell Separation;Cell-Cell Adhesion;Cells;Cellular Metabolic Process;Computer Models;Development;Drug resistance;Engineering;Exhibits;experimental study;extracellular;Extracellular Matrix;Foundations;Free Energy;Future;Heterogeneity;Invaded;Ligands;Malignant Neoplasms;mechanical properties;Metabolic;metabolic imaging;metabolic profile;Metabolism;Microfabrication;Micrometastasis;Modeling;Neoplasm Circulating Cells;Neoplasm Metastasis;neoplastic cell;Pattern;Phenotype;Physics;Production;Reporting;Research;Shapes;Signal Transduction;System;Testing;therapeutic target;therapeutically effective;Tissues;tumor,Investigating the bioenergetics of tumor cell clustering and cell-cell interactions,139768,ZGM1,ZGM1-RCB-4(C1),6405,NA,4,96600,47981,NA,144581

However, there is still no clear answer to the question: “why do only some people develop allergy?”, underscoring the need to revisit our understanding of immune mechanisms of allergy. Using novel genomics unbiased tools, we discovered a new type of T cells, we called THIFNR cells, that may play an important role in preventing pathogenic inflammation in allergy and asthma. This grant aims to first complete the characterization those THIFNR cells. First, we will use animal models of respiratory allergy to understand how THIFNR cells function in vivo. Second, we will use single-cell genomics tools to dissect the molecular mechanisms responsible for the development and persistence of THIFNR cells.

Our results will elucidate mechanisms that could lead to the development of future interventions to: 1) improve coverage of cancer screening among PWH, 2) address barriers to cancer screening access and follow-up among PWH, and 3) optimize screening guidelines for PWH.",12095480;1941323 (contact),"ISLAM, JESSICA YASMINE;WRIGHT, KENNETH LYNN (contact)","SAN MIGUEL-MAJORS, SANDRA L",2012-09-24,2028-08-31,access disparities;Address;Adherence;Adult;Age;age group;age stratification;Aging;All of Us Research Program;Area;Behavior;Biological Factors;Breast;Breast Cancer Detection;Calendar;Cancer Detection;cancer diagnosis;Cancer Prevention Intervention;Caring;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Clinic Visits;Clinical;Code;cohort;Colorectal;Colorectal Cancer;colorectal cancer screening;comorbidity;Complex;Crime;Current Procedural Terminology Codes;Data;data resource;Data Sources;demographics;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Distant;economic disparity;Economics;Electronic Health Record;Ethnic Origin;Ethnic Population;Evaluation;experience;Face;Federally Qualified Health Center;Female breast;follow-up;Future;General Population;Goals;Guideline Adherence;Guidelines;Health;Health system;Healthcare;HIV;HIV diagnosis;HIV Seronegativity;Immunocompetent;improved;Individual;Inequity;Infrastructure;insight;Insurance Coverage;International Classification of Disease Codes;Intervention;Knowledge;Link;Lung;lung cancer screening;Malignant Breast Neoplasm;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Malignant Neoplasms;Medical;Modality;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality;Neighborhoods;novel;Outcome;Patient Recruitments;Patient Self-Report;Patients;Pattern;perceived discrimination;perceived stress;Persons;Population;Prevalence;Prevention;Procedures;Qualifying;Quality of life;Race;racial population;Recording of previous events;recruit;Research;Resources;Risk Factors;Sample Size;Sampling;screening;Screening for cancer;screening guidelines;Screening procedure;Screening Result;sex;SNOMED Clinical Terms;social;social factors;social health determinants;socioeconomics;study population;Surveys;Survival Rate;therapy development;Time;time interval;Time trend;Translating;trend;tv watching;United States Preventative Services Task Force;uptake;Visit;Vulnerable Populations;walkability;Work,Cancer screening behaviors among people with and without HIV in All of Us,163068,ZCA1,ZCA1(A1),NA,S1,12,118308,81041,199349,NA

CHER aims to increase the number of scientists from MSIs represented among National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded investigators because scientists from MSIs bring unique perspectives and experiences, which are required to successfully diversify the workforce and enhance health equity biomedical research, particularly in the areas of reaching underrepresented minority communities, building trust, healing historical injustices, and enhancing participation in research.",10828393 (contact),"D'ANNA, LAURA HOYT (contact)","BLATCH, SYDELLA ANNE",2024-09-01,2027-08-31,Achievement;Applications Grants;Area;Behavioral;Biomedical Research;biomedical scientist;California;Clinical;Communities;Community Developments;community engagement;comparison group;Data Collection;Databases;Development;early experience;early-career faculty;Education;education research;effectiveness evaluation;ethnic minority population;Evaluation;evidence base;experience;Faculty;faculty mentor;Female;Funding;Goals;Grant;healing;health equity;health equity promotion;Health equity research;Individual;Institution;interest;Manuscripts;member;Mentors;method development;Methods;Minority;minority communities;Minority Recruitment;minority scientist;Minority-Serving Institution;Modeling;National Institute of General Medical Sciences;online repository;Outcome;Outcome Assessment;Participant;Peer Review;Persons;Procedures;Productivity;Publications;racial minority population;Readiness;Research;Research Design;Research Institute;Research Personnel;Research Training;Resource Development;Sister;skill acquisition;skills;statistics;success;Teacher Professional Development;tenure track;Testing;theories;Training;Training and Education;Trust;Underrepresented Minority;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;virtual;webinar;wiki;Writing,Center for Health Equity Research Institute II: Community-engaged biomedical research training and mentored experiences for early career faculty,121266,ZGM1,ZGM1-TWD-8(IP),NA,NA,8,391605,29598,421203,NA

Approximately 90% of infected persons have latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), have protective immunity and remain well, but 10% develop primary tuberculosis (TB) soon after infection or reactivation TB many years later. TB is the leading cause of death in HIV-infected persons and more than half a million coinfected people die annually. Children are more susceptible to TB infection, due to an immature immune system. HIV infection in children markedly increases susceptibility to TB. To develop adequate prophylaxis or therapy, it is important to understand immune responses to Mtb. Identification of HIV+ children with LTBI who are at greatly increased risk for development of TB would allow treating only high-risk children, facilitating completion of therapy for LTBI and preventing future development of TB. To identify these children, it is important to pinpoint the nature of the defective immune responses that permit development of active TB in HIV+LTBI+ pediatric patients. This proposal will identify a novel memory-like NK cell subpopulation mediated mechanisms that regulate immune responses and pinpoint the nature of the defective responses that permit development of active TB in HIV-LTBI+ and HIV+LTBI+ children. These studies will lay the groundwork for strategies to develop novel anti-tuberculosis vaccines that stimulate strong NK cell mediated immunity in HIV+ and HIV- children with LTBI, and reduce development of TB.",7127627 (contact),"VANKAYALAPATI, RAMAKRISHNA  (contact)","LOMBO RODRIGUEZ, TANIA",2020-09-14,2025-01-31,adaptive immune response;Adult;Age;Antitubercular Agents;Blood specimen;Cause of Death;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;cell mediated immune response;Cells;Cellular Immunity;Cessation of life;chemokine;Child;cohort;cytokine;Defect;Development;Family;FOXP3 gene;Future;Genetic Polymorphism;Growth;Haplotypes;high risk;Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy;HIV;HIV Infections;HIV/TB;Household;Human;IL2RA gene;Immune;Immune response;Immune system;Immunity;Immunoglobulins;India;Individual;individual response;Infection;Innate Immune Response;interleukin-21;interleukin-21 receptor;Investments;Killer Cells;Macrophage;Measures;Mediating;Memory;monocyte;Mus;Mycobacterium tuberculosis;Natural Killer Cells;Nature;novel;Patients;pediatric patients;Persons;Phenotype;Play;Population;Predisposition;prevent;Production;progression risk;Prophylactic treatment;Publishing;receptor;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Resistance;response;Response Latencies;Risk;Role;Sampling;Series;Site;T cell response;Time;Tuberculosis;tuberculosis immunity;Tuberculosis Vaccines;Vaccines,Innate immune response of LTBI+HIV+ children,142672,HCAC,HIV Coinfections and HIV Associated Cancers Study Section[HCAC],NA,NA,5,504272,222017,726289,NA
