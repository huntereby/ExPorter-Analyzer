This gap in treatment options signifies a critical unmet medical need, as these mutations represent the most common genetic variants causing CF, yet remain largely unaddressed by existing therapies. To address this therapeutic void, we aim to develop a non-viral base-editing approach specifically designed to correct such mutations. Specific Aim 1: In Vitro Optimization and Characterization of RNA-Encoded ABE Systems This aim focuses on the refinement and characterization of RNA-encoded Adenine Base Editors (ABEs) for in vitro applications, targeting the G542X mutation in the CFTR gene associated with CF. Sub-aim 1.1 is devoted to the synthesis and optimization of chemically modified ABE mRNA to enhance its stability and cellular uptake. Sub-aim 1.2 aims to fine-tune guide RNA (gRNA) configurations to maximize base-editing efficacy while minimizing off-target risks. Sub-aim 1.3 explores the functional recovery of CFTR post-base editing. Utilizing the 16HBEge CFTR G542X cell line as our disease model, we will employ the second-generation PAM-less Cas9 variant, CE-8e-SpRY, which has shown superior performance in preliminary studies. Various methodologies, such as in vitro transcription, gel-based cleavage, and Ussing Chamber assays, will be implemented for comprehensive validation. Specific Aim 2: Development and Screening of LNPs for Pulmonary Delivery of ABE Systems The objective of this aim is to engineer optimized lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for efficient pulmonary delivery of ABEs. To address key challenges like mucus barrier penetration and endosomal escape, our approach incorporates a high-throughput combinatorial synthesis (HTCS) platform for formulating a novel library of ionizable lipids. A two-tiered screening process will initially be performed in 2D human bronchial cell cultures, followed by ex vivo validation in air-liquid interface (ALI) 3D cultures. The most promising LNP candidates will undergo in vivo testing in murine models, offering a robust, iterative optimization process. Specific Aim 3: Efficacy and Safety Assessment of ABE LNPs in CFTR G542X Mouse Models The overarching objective of this aim is to rigorously evaluate the efficacy and safety of LNP-encapsulated ABEs in a CFTR G542X mouse model, which faithfully replicates the cardinal features of CF. Leveraging the targeted lung delivery of LNPs, we expect to mitigate the risks of off-target effects compared to systemic delivery. Sub- aim 3.1 focuses on the re-optimization of gRNA sequences for mouse primary lung epithelial cells, evaluating both A>G editing efficiency and edit purity. Sub-aim 3.2 involves intratracheal administration of optimized ABE LNPs at variable dosages, assessing therapeutic impact through nasal potential difference (NPD) and genomic analyses. Sub-aim 3.3 will undertake exhaustive molecular scrutiny of potential off-target editing events, utilizing whole-genome sequencing for definitive verification. Anticipated outcomes include the restoration of functional CFTR protein in over 10% of treated mice with minimal off-target events. In the near term, our research endeavors to offer a transformative base-editing treatment for CF patients harboring the G542X mutation. In the long run, this strategy could extend its applicability to approximately 12% of all inherited diseases caused by NMs, many of which are currently without effective treatments. This would constitute a significant advance in gene therapy for CF, filling a critical gap in patient care while also pioneering techniques in RNA and genome editor delivery systems. Upon successful completion of this research, future work will involve the further optimization of LNP-carrying RNA-encoded ABEs for stability in nebulizers, enhancing the translatability of our approach and potentially catalyzing substantial advancements in American health sciences.",79005022 (contact),"LI, BOWEN  (contact)","LACHOWICZ-SCROGGINS, MARRAH ELIZABETH",2024-08-01,2029-04-30,Address;Adenine;Air;American;base editing;base editor;Biological Assay;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Line;cellular engineering;Chemicals;Clinical;combinatorial;Combinatorial Synthesis;Cystic Fibrosis;cystic fibrosis patients;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator;design;Development;Disease;disease model;dosage;effective therapy;efficacy evaluation;Encapsulated;Endosomes;Engineering;Epithelial Cells;Event;Formulation;Foundations;functional restoration;Future;Gel;gene therapy;Generations;Genes;Genetic Diseases;Genetic Transcription;genetic variant;genome editor;genome sequencing;Genomic medicine;Genomics;Guide RNA;Health Sciences;Hereditary Disease;Human;In Vitro;in vivo;in vivo evaluation;innovation;Libraries;Lipid Chemistry;lipid nanoparticle;Lipids;Liquid substance;Lung;Lung Diseases;Mediating;Medical;Messenger RNA;Methodology;Molecular;mouse model;Mucous body substance;Mus;Mutation;nanoparticle;Nebulizer;Nonsense Mutation;Nose;novel;Other Genetics;Outcome;Pancreas;Patient Care;Patients;Penetration;Performance;premature;Process;process optimization;protein expression;Proteins;Recovery of Function;Regulator Genes;Research;Risk;risk mitigation;RNA;RNA Sequences;Safety;safety assessment;screening;stem;System;Techniques;Technology;Terminator Codon;Therapeutic;therapeutically effective;three dimensional cell culture;Treatment Efficacy;Treatment Protocols;uptake;Validation;Variant;whole genome;Work,Combinatorial design of nonviral base editing systems for treating cystic fibrosis with nonsense mutations,174773,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1 BBBT-X (81)],NA,NA,1,250000,20000,270000,NA

Here, we propose to engineer the CAR vector so that blood stem cells stably carry the DNA (taking advantage of their ability to continuously re-populate all blood cell types and convey long-term anti- cancer immunity), while the mRNA, and thus the therapeutic protein, are only expressed in specific cancer- fighting immune cells, minimizing the risk of toxicity and enabling this therapeutic approach that can prevent relapse through long-lived anti-cancer immunity.",11888086 (contact),"SMITH, ERIC L (contact)","HARRIS, RAYMOND D",2024-08-01,2029-07-31,adaptive immunity;Address;Adoptive Cell Transfers;Adult;Adult Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia;Adult Lymphoma;anti-cancer;Antigen Targeting;Antigens;ATAC-seq;Autologous Transplantation;Automobile Driving;B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia;Biology;Blood Cells;blood treatment;CAR T cell therapy;CD94 Antigen;Cell Lineage;cell type;Cells;Cellular immunotherapy;chimeric antigen receptor;chimeric antigen receptor T cells;comparative;computational pipelines;cytokine;cytokine release syndrome;Data;daughter cell;design;Development;Disease;Disease remission;DNA;Dose;Effector Cell;Engineering;Exclusion;exhaustion;fighting;follow-up;Foundations;functional loss;Future;Gene Expression;Gene Modified;Generations;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Hematologic Neoplasms;Hematopoiesis;Hematopoietic;Hematopoietic Neoplasms;Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation;Hematopoietic stem cells;Human;Immune;Immune Targeting;Immunologic Memory;Immunologic Receptors;Immunologic Surveillance;improved;in vivo;in vivo Model;Killer Cells;Lead;lead candidate;leukemia/lymphoma;Libraries;Lymphoma;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Messenger RNA;MicroRNAs;Modeling;Modification;mouse model;Multiple Myeloma;Myeloid Cells;Natural Killer Cells;NK cell therapy;Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences;Patients;Phenotype;Plasma Cells;Policies;pre-clinical;premature;prevent;promoter;receptor expression;Refractory;Regulatory Element;Relapse;relapse patients;relapse prevention;Reproducibility;response;Risk;risk minimization;Safety;screening;Sorting;Specificity;stem cell genes;T-Lymphocyte;Therapeutic;therapeutic protein;Thymus Gland;Toxic effect;transcriptome sequencing;transgene expression;Transgenes;Translations;Transplantation;tumor;tumor growth;Tumor Immunity;tumorigenesis;vector;Work;Writing,Harnessing naturally occurring cell type-specific regulatory elements and normal HSC hematopoiesis to develop cell lineage-controlled CAR expression and continuously renewing CAR NK cells,293092,CIC,Cellular Immunotherapy of Cancer Study Section[CIC],NA,NA,1,289674,224185,513859,NA

Our studies of the normal circuitry between early visual cortical areas will provide greater insight into the causes and effects of central vision defects when these circuits are damaged by stroke or other neurological or developmental cause. In particular, our studies of feedback circuits between different visual cortical areas will help our understanding of how these pathways mediate the influence of stimulus context on neuronal responsivity, spatial integration, and changes in visual sensitivity associated with top-down attention. Moreover, understanding how these circuits operate in normal vision will provide a foundation for understanding the consequences of their dysfunction in neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as autism, schizophrenia and attention deficits disorders, which have been directly linked to abnormalities in inter-areal connectivity [e.g. Belmonte et al.

While the mucosa itself forms a critical barrier to infection, it is also the anatomic location where cells of the mucosal, innate and adaptive immune systems converge to orchestrate protective immediate and long-term responses. We have demonstrated that M. tuberculosis can migrate and enter the mucosa associated lymphoid tissue via a rare, specialized cell type called a microfold cell. Here we propose to better characterize features of the airway M cell, establish how it communicates with other epithelial and immune cells, determine the mechanism by which the bacteria traverse the cell and the immunologic consequences of early microfold cell contact with M. tuberculosis. This approach is novel because it represents the first broad characterization of the role of airway microfold cells to host defense against M. tuberculosis.",1892247 (contact),"SHILOH, MICHAEL  (contact)","MAHON III, ROBERT N",2024-06-10,2029-05-31,Accounting;adaptive immune response;Adaptive Immune System;adaptive immunity;Adenoidal structure;Aerosols;Alleles;Amino Acids;Anatomy;Animals;Antigen Presentation;Antigens;Applied Genetics;Atlases;B-Lymphocytes;Bacteria;Binding;Biochemical;Bioinformatics;CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes;Cell Communication;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Physiology;cell type;Cells;Cellular biology;Cervical Tuberculous Lymphadenitis;Chemicals;Communication;Data;Dedications;Dendritic Cells;Epithelial Cells;Epithelium;Event;Gene Expression Profile;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Polymorphism;Genetic Transcription;glycosylation;Goblet Cells;Homeostasis;Host Defense;Human;Human body;human morbidity;human mortality;Immune;immune function;Immune response;Immunity;Immunologics;Immunology;improved;In Vitro;in vivo;in vivo Model;Infection;Ingestion;Inhalation;innate immune function;Innate Immune Response;Innate Immune System;innovation;intercellular communication;Life Cycle Stages;Ligands;Location;Lymphoid Tissue;M cell;Macrophage;Mediastinal;Mediating;microbicide;migration;Modeling;Molecular;mortality;mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue;Mucosal Immune System;Mucosal Immunity;Mucous Membrane;Mus;mutant;Mycobacterium tuberculosis;Nasopharynx;Natural Immunity;Nose;novel;novel strategies;Oral;Oral mucous membrane structure;Organism;Oropharyngeal;Outcome;pathogen;Penetration;Process;programs;receptor;Receptor Cell;Research;Respiratory Mucosa;Respiratory Tract Infections;response;Role;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;single nucleus RNA-sequencing;Site;Specialized Epithelial Cell;SR-BI receptor;Structure;Structure-Activity Relationship;Surface;Systemic disease;T cell response;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;transcriptome;transcriptomics;transcytosis;Tuberculosis;tuberculosis immunity;Virulence Factors;Work,Interaction of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with upper airway mucosal cells,184584,ZAI1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZAI1 RCU-A (M1)],NA,NA,1,433987,273189,707176,NA
