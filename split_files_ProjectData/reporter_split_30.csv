The proposed project seeks to determine whether blood pressure patterns and blood vessel function can be used to evaluate vascular health in children with lupus, and to assess whether medications used to prevent heart disease in other conditions may be beneficial in adolescents and young adults with lupus.",14532790 (contact),"CHANG, JOYCE CHUN-LING (contact)","WEBB, STEPHANIE JOHNSON",2020-08-01,2025-06-30,"Acceleration;Accounting;Adolescent;Adolescent and Young Adult;Adult;Age;Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring;Anti-Hypertensive Agents;arterial tonometry;atheroprotective;Atherosclerosis;Attenuated;Blood Pressure;Blood Vessels;Cardiac;Cardiology;Cardiovascular Diseases;cardiovascular disorder prevention;cardiovascular disorder risk;cardiovascular health;cardiovascular risk factor;Cardiovascular system;carotid intima-media thickness;cerebrovascular;Cessation of life;Child;Childhood;Chronic;clinical epidemiology;cohort;comorbidity;Cox Models;Data;Databases;Development;Disease;disorder control;Early identification;Electronic Health Record;endothelial dysfunction;Endothelium;Etiology;Event;experience;Female Adolescents;Fostering;Future;Glucocorticoids;Goals;Grant;Health;health assessment;heart disease prevention;high risk;Hypertension;Immunosuppression;improved;Infection;Inflammation;Injury;interdisciplinary collaboration;Intervention;Intervention Studies;Knowledge;longitudinal, prospective study;Lupus;Master of Science;Measures;Mediating;Mentors;Methods;Modeling;Monitor;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality;multidisciplinary;Myocardial Infarction;Non-accidental;Obesity;Onset of illness;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Outcomes Research;patient oriented research;Patients;Pattern;Pediatric Hospitals;Pennsylvania;Peripheral;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacoepidemiology;pharmacologic;Philadelphia;Physiological;premature;premature atherosclerosis;prevent;Prevention;professor;prospective;Recommendation;recruit;Renin-Angiotensin System;Reproducibility;Research;Research Personnel;Resources;Rheumatism;Rheumatology;Risk;Risk Factors;Risk Marker;risk stratification;Role;screening;secondary outcome;sex;Stroke;Systemic Lupus Erythematosus;Testing;Time;Tissues;Training;treatment response;Universities;Work;young adult",Cardiovascular health assessment & outcomes of systemic lupus erythematosus: bridging pediatric and adult- onset disease,148539,MPOR,NHLBI Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Study Section[MPOR(MA)],NA,NA,5,155570,12446,168016,NA

Screening chemicals for their potential to cause mutation in a human- relevant assay offers an effective strategy for improving public health. The lack of a mutagenicity bioassay in human cells is a major data gap in the genetic toxicology test battery used by regulatory agencies for hazard identification and quantitative risk assessments. Current human cell mutagenicity bioassays are labor intensive and rely on 50-year-old clonal selection techniques. Error Corrected Next Generation Sequencing (EC-NGS) is a direct method for analytical assessment of mutagenicity with precise quantification of these very rare events in DNA. The focus of this Direct-to-Phase II SBIR application is to develop a New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) combining human cells and EC-NGS as an in vitro alternative to current regulatory mammalian cell mutagenicity assessment using rodent cell lines, and as an in vitro alternative to in vivo mutation assays. The development of human cell mutagenicity assays will be part of ScitoVation’s nonanimal Next-Generation genotoxicity assessment using NAMs and dosimetry to improve human safety assessments. We will accomplish this by defining experimental parameters to quantify the induction of mutations by EC-NGS in two distinct human cell lines: TK6 lymphoblastoid cells and metabolically competent human HepaRG™ cells. Although EC-NGS is highly innovative and a “game changer,” without integration into well-defined human cell-based systems and careful validation studies, its application in regulatory Genetic Toxicology is limited. Human TK6 cells are a well- established and validated cell line with worldwide acceptance for mutagenicity assessments. However, TK6 cells lack drug-metabolizing enzymes. Metabolically competent human liver HepaRG™ cells express Phase I and Phase II drug metabolizing enzymes and have been used to assess genotoxicity. However, the requirement for two rounds of cell cycling to fix DNA damage into mutations, the prolonged cell cycling time of 10-14 days, and lack of clonal selection techniques to quantify mutations in HepaRG™ cells have precluded the development of mutagenicity testing in HepaRG™ cells. In this SBIR, we aim to replace 50 yr. old clonal selection techniques to assess mutation in mammalian cells by using EC-NGS to quantify mutations in human TK6 and HepaRG™ cells. Specific Aim 1 – Define experimental parameters to assess mutagenicity by EC-NGS in human TK6 cells and validate TK6 EC-NGS as a replacement for current mammalian cell in vitro mutagenicity testing bioassays. Specific Aim 2 – Define experimental parameters to assess mutagenicity by EC-NGS in HepaRG cells and validate HepaRG™ EC-NGS as a replacement for in vivo mutagenicity assessment in rodents. Completion of this Phase II SBIR will produce two human cell-based mutation assays that can be used as a follow-up to bacterial mutation assays and as a NAM to reduce reliance on current in vivo gene mutation assays in rodents. These assays will be a cornerstone of ScitoVation’s NAMs-based vision on Next Generation genotoxicity assessment using human-relevant cell-based models and dosimetry for human safety and risk assessments.",1973339 (contact),"RECIO, LESLIE  (contact)","SHAUGHNESSY, DANIEL",2023-05-23,2025-04-30,Amendment;analytical method;Animal Testing;Animals;Biological Assay;carcinogenesis;Cell Cycle;Cell Line;Cells;Chemicals;Chromosome abnormality;Client;Congenital Abnormality;Cosmetics;cost;Data;daughter cell;Detection;Development;DNA;DNA Damage;dosimetry;drug candidate;environmental chemical;Enzymes;European Union;Event;experimental study;follow-up;Food Additives;Gene Mutation;Genetic;Genome;genotoxicity;Goals;Hazard Identification;Hepatocyte;Heritability;Human;Human Cell Line;Human Genome;improved;In Vitro;in vitro Assay;in vitro testing;in vivo;Induced Mutation;innovation;Liver;Mammalian Cell;Measures;Metabolic;Methodology;Methods;micronucleus;Modeling;Mutagenicity Tests;Mutagens;Mutation;mutation assay;Mutation Fixation;Nature;Nervous System Disorder;new technology;next generation;next generation sequencing;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;Pesticides;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacologic Substance;Phase;Poison;Public Health;rare variant;response;Risk Assessment;Rodent;safety assessment;Sales;Scheme;screening;Small Business Innovation Research Grant;success;System;Techniques;Test Result;Testing;Time;Toxic effect;Toxicity Tests;Toxicogenetics;Toxicology;Transgenic Organisms;transmission process;Validation;validation studies;Vision,Mutational profiling in human cells as an in vitro alternative to in vivo mutagenicity assessments,35336,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-DKUS-R(10)],NA,NA,2,629711,221067,910332,NA

This proposal will uniquely combine structural biology, stopped-flow kinetics, and electrophysiology to dissect the precise roles of the calmodulin interactions in excitable cells, and it will then explore if we can alter the kinetics of these interactions with a small molecule probe; which could give rise to a novel treatment strategy for certain types of sodium channelopathies.",11126962 (contact),"JOHNSON, CHRISTOPHER N.

Under normal conditions, consumption of this product does not induce disease, but if it is coupled to abnormal expression of the immune hormone IL-23 in mice, it can lead to development of intestinal inflammation that has many similarities with human IBD.

Finally, our focus on clinical metrics (glucose control, infection) that are in-line with patient priorities and US hospital quality initiatives will increase relevance to healthcare systems and enhance incentive to adopt Cyber GEMS.",14315881;8635828 (contact),"FORTMANN, ADELAIDE L;PHILIS-TSIMIKAS, ATHENA  (contact)","BURCH, HENRY B",2021-07-27,2026-05-31,"Adopted;Adoption;Adult;Advanced Practice Nurse;Algorithm Design;Algorithms;Ambulatory Monitoring;Blinded;Blood Glucose;blood glucose regulation;California;Cardiac;cardiometabolism;Clinical;clinical risk;Clinical Trials;cloud based;Communication;Computerized Medical Record;Continuous Glucose Monitor;Cost Analysis;cost effectiveness;Coupled;Dangerousness;dashboard;Data;design;Devices;diabetes control;Diabetes Mellitus;diabetes mellitus nursing;digital;digital monitoring;Effectiveness;effectiveness evaluation;Effectiveness of Interventions;Eligibility Determination;Environment;Evaluation;Event;experience;Glucose;glucose monitor;glycemic control;Goals;Hand;Health Care Costs;Health system;Healthcare Systems;high risk;high risk population;Hispanic;Hispanic Populations;hospital care;hospital readmission;Hospitalists;Hospitalization;Hospitals;Human Resources;Hyperglycemia;Hypoglycemia;improved;improved outcome;Incentives;Infection;Infection Control;infection rate;infection risk;Infrastructure;innovation;Insulin;International;Intervention;Length of Stay;Low income;Maintenance;Methods;Mexico;Monitor;mortality;Neurologic;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Nosocomial Infections;Not Hispanic or Latino;Notification;novel;Nursing Staff;Outcome;Outcomes Research;Patients;Phase;point of care;point of care testing;Population;Populations at Risk;prevent;Process;Protocols documentation;Randomized, Controlled Trials;Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance;Recommendation;remote monitoring;Research;Resources;safety net;Specialist;Standardization;Stratification;Stream;success;System;Telemetry;Testing;Time;transmission process;treatment as usual;treatment optimization;trend;wireless transmission;Work",Continuous Glucose Monitoring for High-Risk Type 2 Diabetes in the Hospital:  Cloud-Based Real-Time Glucose Evaluation and Management System (Cyber GEMS),124427,NRCS,Nursing and Related Clinical Sciences Study Section[NRCS],NA,NA,4,417357,175569,592926,NA

There is increased prevalence of HIV associated neurocognitive disorders or impairment (HAND, HIV-NCI) in people with HIV (PWH) greatly impacting their quality of life. A significant number of people with meth use disorder are PWH, with increased neurocognitive impairments reported in active meth using PWH. The mechanisms by which meth use disorder increases HIV-NCI in PWH on antiretroviral therapy are not completely characterized, impeding the development of interventional strategies to reduce/ eliminate HIV-NCI.in this population.

We will use our in vitro human BBB model to characterize the role of CXCR7 and/or CXCR4 in meth mediated effects on transmigration and on cells of the BBB.

These diseases result, at least in part, by the abnormal accumulation of toxic proteins in the brain and harnessing the power of our immune system has significant potential to enhance their removal, reducing, or even preventing, cognitive decline. Here we focus on a largely neglected population of immune cells situated in the borders surrounding the brain and explore how these cells communicate with other central nervous system clearance routes, particularly the meningeal lymphatics that drain the cerebrospinal fluid, to facilitate the removal of these toxic proteins, thus highlighting a novel therapeutic target for AD and CAA.",8499327 (contact),"KIPNIS, JONATHAN  (contact)","MARIC, MAJA",2022-08-01,2027-05-31,abeta accumulation;Address;Affect;age related;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Alzheimer&apos;s disease brain;Alzheimer&apos;s disease related dementia;Amyloid beta-Protein;Animal Model;Apolipoprotein E;Area;Basic Science;beta amyloid pathology;Bioinformatics;Biology;Blood - brain barrier anatomy;Blood Circulation;Blood Vessels;blood-brain barrier function;Brain;Brain Diseases;brain endothelial cell;Cell Communication;Cells;Central Nervous System;Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy;Cerebrospinal Fluid;Cerebrovascular system;Cholesterol Homeostasis;clinical translation;Collaborations;Collection;Complex;cost;cranium;Data;Dementia;Discipline;Disease;Disease Progression;Economic Burden;Engraftment;Event;Excision;fluid flow;Functional disorder;Future;healing;High Density Lipoproteins;Human;Image;imaging approach;Immune;Immune system;Immune Targeting;Immunologist;Immunotherapy;Impaired cognition;in vivo;Innate Immune Response;Innate Immune System;innovation;Intercellular Fluid;interdisciplinary approach;intravital imaging;Knowledge acquisition;Leptomeninges;Link;Lymphatic;lymphatic drainage;Macrophage;Meningeal lymphatic system;Microglia;misfolded protein;Mission;multidisciplinary;Myeloid Cells;National Institute on Aging;Natural Immunity;neglect;Nerve Degeneration;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neuroimmune;neuroimmunology;Neurons;Neurosciences;new therapeutic target;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;Operative Surgical Procedures;Pathologic;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Patients;Persons;Phagocytosis;Population;pre-clinical;prevent;Probability;programs;protein aggregation;Proteins;Publications;Research;Role;Route;Senile Plaques;Severity of illness;Signal Transduction;SYK gene;synergism;Technology;Therapeutic;therapeutic target;tool;Transgenic Mice;Transplantation;TREM2 gene;Vascular Diseases;wasting,Neuroimmunology of AD and CAA with focus on innate immunity and lymphatics,78106,ZAG1,ZAG1-ZIJ-8(M2),NA,NA,3,1976743,1086284,3063027,NA
