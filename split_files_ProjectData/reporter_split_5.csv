This project tests the hypothesis that increased tumor formation in response to chronic circadian disruption is caused by perturbation of normal daily cycles in signaling through the transcription factor heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), which leads to chronic activation of a molecular proteotoxic stress response pathway.",2094046 (contact),"LAMIA, KATJA A (contact)","LUO, RUIBAI",2022-12-15,2027-11-30,Address;Affect;Animals;anti-cancer research;Behavior;Biological;biological adaptation to stress;Breast Cancer Model;cancer risk;cancer type;Carcinogens;Cell Physiology;cell type;Cells;Chronic;circadian;Circadian Dysregulation;circadian pacemaker;Circadian Rhythms;Cytometry;Data;design;Detection;Development;digital;disorder risk;Epidemiology;Exhibits;experience;experimental study;Exposure to;Future;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profiling;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Genetically Engineered Mouse;genome-wide;Growth;Health;heat shock transcription factor;Heat Stress;heat-shock factor 1;Helicobacter pylori;Hour;in vivo;Incidence;insight;International Agencies;Investigation;Jet Lag Syndrome;K-ras mouse model;Kinetics;Knowledge;KRAS oncogenesis;KRAS2 gene;KRASG12D;Light;Lighting;Link;Location;Lung;Lung Adenocarcinoma;Lung Neoplasms;lung tumorigenesis;Malignant neoplasm of liver;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Malignant Neoplasms;malignant stomach neoplasm;Metabolic Diseases;Molecular;mouse model;Mus;mutant;Nervous System Disorder;Nuclear;Oncogenic;Outcome;Pathogenesis;Pathogenicity;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Periodicity;Peripheral;Persons;Physiological;Physiology;Play;Probability;proteostasis;proteotoxicity;Public Health;RAS driven cancer;Research;Resolution;response;Risk;Role;Schedule;shift work;Signal Transduction;Skin Cancer;Source;Stimulus;Stress;System;temporal measurement;Testing;Time;transcription factor;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomics;Travel;tumor;tumor barcoding and sequencing;Tumor Burden;tumor microenvironment;tumorigenesis;Vulnerable Populations;Work,Establishing a mechanistic basis for enhanced tumorigenesis under chronic circadian disruption,271500,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-CB-L(02)M],NA,NA,2,313259,242774,556033,NA

Panic disorder (PD) is a severe anxiety disorder characterized by recurrent panic attacks affecting about 2- 5% of the population and resulting in severe disability in about a third of those patients. Using our well established animal model, we identified that a specific set of brain cells called orexin (hypocretin) neurons are a key regulators of panic attacks, which are inhibited by a subset of midbrain serotonergic neurons. Therefore, we will determine how interactions between these two chemical pathways regulate normal panic and how they are impacted in PD pathology.

Furthermore, endothelial cells (ECs) of these mutant brains have decreased response to angiogenic factor EphB4. Successful completion of this project will identify novel molecular mechanisms of toxicity-induced brain angiogenesis and will test whether these mechanisms are impaired in AD.

Non-covalent interactions, including hydrogen bonds, are  acknowledged as the major forces that control microenvironmental effects, but it is still  unclear how they are able to influence metal-mediated processes.

Transcription copies DNA into RNA, a key process that permits gene expression. On occasion, the nascent RNA can become entangled with the DNA, resulting in an alternative three-stranded nucleic acid structure called an R-loop. R-loops form universally under normal conditions and are thought to play physiological roles in cells, including human cells. Studies have suggested, however, that under conditions where transcription is perturbed, harmful R-loops are created, leading to DNA breaks and chromosome anomalies. What distinguishes “good” from “harmful” R-loops remains unknown. Similarly, how harmful R-loops arise as a result of perturbed transcription is unclear. Using innovative technologies developed by my group, we will characterize the formation of so-called harmful R- loops under conditions of perturbed transcription in human cells. We will also determine whether harmful R- loops, or perturbed transcription itself, are the cause of the DNA breaks. Finally, we will determine if an enzyme known to relieve the DNA break problem is acting by resolving harmful R-loops or remediating the altered transcription. This work will benefit our understanding of fundamental cellular processes acting in our genome and will provide insights into a range of human disorders linked to perturbed transcription.",8304160 (contact),"CHEDIN, FREDERIC LOUIS (contact)","KRASNEWICH, DONNA M",2021-01-01,2025-12-31,Address;Attention;Biochemical;Biogenesis;Cell model;Cell Physiology;Cells;Chromosome abnormality;Data;Defect;Disease;DNA;DNA Damage;DNA Structure;DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase;Enzymes;Functional disorder;Gene Expression;genetic information;Genetic Transcription;Genome;Genomic Instability;Genomics;Human;Inherited;innovative technologies;insight;Knowledge;Life;Light;Link;Maintenance;Mammalian Cell;Mammals;Measures;Metabolism;Monitor;Nuclear;nucleic acid structure;overexpression;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Phenotype;Physiological;Planet Earth;Play;Process;remediation;Resolution;ribonuclease H1;RNA;RNA Processing;RNA Splicing;Role;Structure;Time;Work;Yeasts,Understanding the mechanisms underlying R-loop biogenesis and resolution in mammals,139549,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-CB-E(55)R],NA,NA,4,250000,132506,382506,NA

A critical period is a developmental epoch during which the nervous system is expressly sensitive to specific stimuli that are required for experience dependent learning, circuit organization, and synaptic plasticity. Critical periods have been described for both sensory (e.g. vision, touch) and social (e.g. language, imprinting) functions. While mechanistic insights into the establishment and reinstatement of sensory critical periods have transformed therapeutic practice (e.g. for treating deafness and blindness), to date, the molecular, synaptic, and circuit mechanisms underlying social critical periods are largely unknown. Our proposed studies will have significant implications for understanding the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by social impairments, such as autism and schizophrenia, as well as diseases like addiction and PTSD that respond to social influence or are aggravated by social injury. At the same time, these insights will provide the basis for new therapeutic strategies, improved mechanistic understanding of therapeutic interventions currently in clinical trials, and objective measures of social reward learning across maturation that are tractable for future translational studies.",7080942 (contact),"DOLEN, GUL  (contact)","MANN KOEPKE, KATHY M",2019-12-06,2025-11-30,Ablation;Achievement;Acute;addiction;Address;Adult;Anatomy;Animals;Area;Argipressin;argipressin receptor;autism spectrum disorder;Axon;Bathing;Behavioral;Blindness;Brain;Brain region;Clinical Trials;conditioned place preference;critical period;Data;deafness;design;Development;Disease;experience;FLP recombinase;Frequencies;functional genomics;Future;Globus Pallidus;Goals;Human;Hypothalamic structure;Impairment;imprint;improved;in vivo;Injury;insight;Knock-in Mouse;Knock-out;Knockout Mice;Language;Learning;Long-Term Depression;magnocellular;Maps;Measures;Mediating;Methods;Molecular;Mus;Nature;Nervous System;Neurodevelopmental Disorder;Neurons;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;novel therapeutics;Nucleus Accumbens;optogenetics;Oxytocin;paraventricular nucleus;parvocellular;patch clamp;Pathogenesis;Physiologic pulse;Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders;postnatal;postsynaptic;premature;presynaptic;receptor;Regulation;Rewards;Role;Schizophrenia;Sensory;Signal Transduction;Slice;social;Social Behavior;Social Conditions;Social Environment;social influence;Social Interaction;Source;Stimulus;Synapses;synaptic function;Synaptic plasticity;Testing;Therapeutic;therapeutic development;Therapeutic Intervention;Time;tool;Touch sensation;translational neuroscience;translational study;Up-Regulation;V1a vasopressin receptor;Vasopressins;viral gene delivery;Vision,Dissecting the role of vasopressin in regulating the critical period for social reward learning,98184,NMB,Neurobiology of Motivated Behavior Study Section[NMB],NA,NA,5,208593,132978,341571,NA

Most patients have abysmal outcomes, with five-year survival rates of less than 40%. Recently, single cell analysis of HNSCC tumors revealed a new transcriptional pathway dubbed the hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (HEM) program that is a critical driver of invasion and metastasis in this cancer. The importance of this pathway is highlighted by the fact that the presence of the HEM signature in tumors is more predictive of treatment outcome than any other commonly used pathologic or demographic factor. Can this pathway be targeted to improve treatment of patients with HNSCC? The main driver of HEM appears to be a transcription factor called Snail2. Since it is difficult to develop drugs to transcription factors, we propose to map the genes regulated by Snail2 and determine which of these drive the metastasis and invasion phenotypes observed in HEM cells. We also propose to learn which other transcription factors regulate HEM in concert with Snail2 and to map their target genes. Accomplishing these goals will identify opportunities for rational drug design and targeted therapeutics against HNSCC.",10433943 (contact),"PURAM, SIDHARTH VENKATA (contact)","CHEN, ZHONG",2023-03-01,2027-11-30,3-Dimensional;attributable mortality;Automobile Driving;Binding Sites;Biological Assay;Biological Process;Biotin;Cancer Etiology;Cancer Model;Carcinogens;Catalogs;Cell Fraction;Cell Line;Cells;Chimeric Proteins;ChIP-seq;Chromosome Mapping;Complement;CRISPR interference;Data;Demographic Factors;Development;Disease;Dissection;DNA;domain mapping;Drug Design;Drug Targeting;epithelial to mesenchymal transition;Epithelium;Etiology;experimental study;Family member;Gene Expression Profile;Gene Targeting;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Complementation Test;Genetic Epistasis;Genetic Transcription;Genome;Genomic approach;Genomics;Goals;Head and Neck Cancer;Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma;Heterogeneity;HPV negative;Hybrids;Immunoprecipitation;improved;In Vitro;in vivo;in vivo Model;Individual;interest;Invaded;knock-down;Knowledge;Label;lead candidate;Learning;Ligase;Literature;Long term disability;Malignant Neoplasms;Maps;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Mediating;Mesenchymal;Molecular Target;mortality;Nature;Neoplasm Metastasis;neoplastic cell;new therapeutic target;Oncogenes;Oncogenic;Organoids;Outcome;overexpression;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;patient derived xenograft model;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Play;Prediction of Response to Therapy;Process;programs;protein complex;protein protein interaction;Proteins;rational design;Repression;Resolution;Role;Scheme;single cell analysis;single cell ATAC-seq;small molecule;Smoking;Snails;Survival Rate;targeted treatment;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;therapeutic target;transcription factor;transcriptome sequencing;Treatment Failure;Treatment outcome;tumor;Tumor Cell Invasion;tumor progression;Tumor Promotion;Validation,Dissecting hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal states in head and neck cancer,32371,CG,Cancer Genetics Study Section[CG],NA,NA,2,245000,138834,383834,NA

Thus, it is proposed that when MnSOD-Ac exists outside of its normal physiological context, it disrupts cellular and mitochondrial metabolism and promotes lineage plasticity properties (or tumor cell stemness), leading to an oncogenic permissive and TamR phenotype, and is a potential target for new therapies.",7573491 (contact),"GIUS, DAVID  (contact)","WILLIS, KRISTINE AMALEE",2021-01-09,2025-12-31,Acetylation;Adjuvant Therapy;Biological Markers;Biology;Breast Cancer Cell;breast malignancies;cancer cell;Cell Physiology;Cells;Cellular Metabolic Process;Chemicals;ChIP-seq;Cisplatin;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Compensation;Data;Doxorubicin;Drug Metabolic Detoxication;Endocrine;Equilibrium;Estrogen receptor positive;Event;Exhibits;Exposure to;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Fulvestrant;Genes;high risk;hormone therapy;in vivo;knock-down;Knock-out;Lead;Link;Lysine;Malignant Breast Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;mammary;Mammary Neoplasms;MCF7 cell;Measurement;Measures;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolism;mimetics;Mitochondria;mitochondrial metabolism;Modeling;monomer;mouse model;mutant;Nature;neoplastic cell;new therapeutic target;novel;Oncogenic;Pathway interactions;patient derived xenograft model;permissiveness;Peroxidases;Phenotype;Physiological;Post-Translational Protein Processing;prevent;programs;Property;public database;Publications;Reactive Oxygen Species;Recurrence;Reporter;Resistance;response;Risk;Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators;Signal Transduction;Sirtuins;small hairpin RNA;SOD2 gene;Stains;stem;stem cell biomarkers;stem-like cell;stemness;Subgroup;Superoxides;Systemic Therapy;T47D;Tamoxifen;targeted treatment;Techniques;Testing;therapy resistant;Time;tissue culture;Tissue Microarray;transcriptome sequencing;tumor;Tumor Promoters;tumorigenesis;tumorigenic;Woman;Work;Xenograft Model,MnSOD-K68-Ac reprograms a lineage plasticity switch / stemness in ER+ breast malignancies,253678,MCT1,Mechanisms of Cancer Therapeutics - 1 Study Section[MCT1],NA,NA,4,225649,124106,349755,NA

Our studies use human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) as a power- ful model to investigate the complex cellular circuitry that properly regulates protein production. A comprehensive picture of how protein production is controlled could contribute to new strategies of treating many human diseases including those caused by HCMV, which despite being innocuous in most healthy individuals causes severe disease in those whose immune systems are not functioning properly (including transplant recipients along with AIDS patients) and is the leading viral cause of birth defects in newborns.",1882984 (contact),"MOHR, IAN J (contact)","REDDY, MICHAEL K",1999-05-01,2026-12-31,Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome;Attenuated;Binding;biological adaptation to stress;Biological Models;Biological Process;Biology;Bone Marrow;Bypass;cell growth;Cells;Chronic;Complex;Congenital Abnormality;Cytomegalovirus;Cytomegalovirus Infections;Data;design;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Disease;endoplasmic reticulum stress;Environment;Family member;Fostering;FRAP1 gene;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Gene Expression Regulation;Genes;Health;Herpesviridae;Human;human disease;Immune response;Immune system;Immunocompromised Host;Individual;Infection;insight;Investigation;Knowledge;Learning;Malignant Neoplasms;Memory;Messenger RNA;Modeling;Molecular;mRNA Translation;mutant;Newborn Infant;Normal Cell;opportunistic pathogen;organ transplant recipient;Organism;Patients;Peptide Initiation Factors;Phosphorylation;Physiological;Play;polyadenylated messenger RNA;Polyribosomes;Production;Protein Biosynthesis;Proteins;recruit;Regulation;Reproduction;response;Ribosomes;RNA Cap-Binding Proteins;Role;Shapes;Solid;Stress;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Translation Initiation;Translations;Transplant Recipients;vaccine development;vaccine strategy;Viral;Virus;Virus Diseases;Virus Replication,Control of Translation in Herpesvirus Infected Cells - Resubmission - 1,56927,VIRB,Virology - B Study Section[VIRB],NA,NA,19,257310,178830,436140,NA

These cells have the unique capacity to form essentially every type of cell in the body, including neurons and other brain cells. iPSCs can be generated from white blood cells obtained in a simple blood draw. When iPSCs are developed from individuals with ASD and ID, researchers can turn those cells into patient-specific neurons, a truly monumental scientific achievement. In addition to neurons, iPSCs can also be converted into small (several millimeters in diameter) 3-D structures called “cerebral organoids,” which, remarkably, resemble a first trimester fetal brain in their microscopic appearance and molecular functions. Cerebral organoids are being used as a model system to study the effect of ASD and ID-associated mutations on early brain development. In the current proposal, we are studying a condition called Jansen DeVries Syndrome (JdVS), which is caused by mutations in a gene called PPM1D. Children with JDVS suffer from a variety of physical and neuropsychiatric problems in addition to ID, including severe anxiety, feeding problems, and other gastrointestinal issues. We have developed iPSCs from patients with JdVS and have recreated PPM1D mutations in iPSCs derived from typically developing controls using a gene editing technique called CRISPR-Cas9. These iPSCs will be turned into neurons and analyzed with modern molecular tools to identify molecular differences caused by JdVS mutations in order to find novel therapies that will improve their quality of life.",1878603 (contact),"LACHMAN, HERBERT M (contact)","PANCHISION, DAVID M",2023-01-01,2025-12-31,Achievement;Address;Alleles;anti-cancer research;Appearance;Architecture;ATAC-seq;Attention;autism spectrum disorder;Autoimmune;Behavior;Biological;Biological Models;Blood;Brain;brain cell;C-terminal;Ca(2+)-Calmodulin Dependent Protein Kinase;cancer subtypes;Catalytic Domain;Cell Line;Cell Physiology;cell type;Cells;Cerebrum;Child;Childhood;Chromatin;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Code;Communities;CRISPR/Cas technology;delta protein;Development;Diameter;differential expression;Disease;DNA Repair Pathway;Doctor of Medicine;Drug Targeting;Eating;Engineering;Exons;experimental study;Family;feeding;fetal;First Pregnancy Trimester;Frameshift Mutation;gain of function;gastrointestinal;gene-editing approach;Genes;Genetic;Germ Lines;Glutamates;Impairment;improved;Individual;individuals with autism spectrum disorder;induced pluripotent stem cell;Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons;induced pluripotent stem cell technology;Inflammatory;inhibitor;Intellectual functioning disability;interest;Knock-out;Knowledge;Leukocytes;Literature;loss of function;loss of function mutation;Magnesium;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;member;Microscopic;millimeter;Modernization;Molecular;Molecular Analysis;molecular marker;molecular phenotype;multiple omics;mutant;Mutate;Mutation;Neurites;Neurons;neuropsychiatry;Nonsense Mutation;novel;novel therapeutics;null mutation;Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder;Organoids;Outcome;overexpression;Pain Threshold;Pathological anxiety;patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells;Patients;Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcus Infections;Pharmaceutical Preparations;pharmacologic;Phenotype;phenotypic biomarker;Phosphoproteins;phosphoproteomics;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases;Phosphorylation;Principal Investigator;programs;Protein phosphatase;Protein Serine/Threonine Phosphatase;Protein Truncation;Proteins;Proteomics;public health relevance;Quality of life;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Resistance;Resources;RNA;SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2;small molecule;Stem Cell Development;stem cell model;Symptoms;Syndrome;targeted treatment;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Effect;Therapeutic Intervention;three dimensional structure;tool;TP53 gene;Transcript;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomics;Tumor Suppressor Genes;Variant,Molecular analysis of glutamatergic neurons derived from iPSCs containing PPM1D truncating mutations found in Jansen de Vries Syndrome,131740,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-MDCN-P(57)R],NA,NA,2,150000,102000,252000,NA

This proposal will further investigate this observation using quantitative and multidimensional flow cytometry, microbiome modulation, short chain fatty acid supplementation and germ-free mice to study the mechanism for the gut dysbiosis and its functional role in the post-TBI aged brain.",11493560 (contact),"DAVIS IV, BOOKER T (contact)","AWWAD, HIBAH OMAR",2023-01-01,2024-12-31,"Acetates;Address;Adult;Advisory Committees;Age;age related;aged;Aging;aging brain;aging related;American;Anaerobic Bacteria;Anatomy;Animal Model;Animals;Attenuated;attenuation;Award;Bacteria;behavioral phenotyping;Biology;Brain;brain cell;Brain Injuries;Butyrates;Butyrivibrio;C57BL/6 Mouse;career;Cell Separation;Chronic;clinical application;Clinical Trials;cohort;Complex;controlled cortical impact;Data;dietary;Dietary Fatty Acid;Dietary Fiber;Dietary Intervention;Dietary Supplementation;Dimensions;Disease;Elderly;expectation;fatty acid supplementation;fecal microbiota;fecal transplantation;Fermentation;Flow Cytometry;functional outcomes;Gene Expression Profile;Genes;Germ-Free;glial activation;Goals;Grant;gut bacteria;gut dysbiosis;gut microbiome;gut microbiota;gut-brain axis;Histopathology;Immune;Immunology;improved;Incidence;Injury;insight;Intervention;knowledge base;Laboratories;Learning;Lesion;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;meetings;Mentors;metabolomics;microbial;microbiome;microbiome analysis;microbiota;Microglia;minority scientist;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Profiling;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality;mouse model;Mus;mutant;Nerve Degeneration;Neurocognitive;Neurocognitive Deficit;neuroinflammation;next generation;normal aging;novel;old mice;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Pathologic;Phase;Population;Process;Propionates;Publishing;reconstitution;Replacement Therapy;Reporting;Reproducibility;Research;response;RNA;RNA, Ribosomal, 16S;Role;rRNA Genes;Shapes;single-cell RNA sequencing;skill acquisition;skills;Structure;Symptoms;TBI Patients;TBI treatment;Techniques;therapeutic target;Training;Translating;translational potential;Traumatic Brain Injury;Universities;Volatile Fatty Acids;Water;Work;young adult",Fecal Microbiota Transfer Attenuates Aged Gut Dysbiosis and Functional Deficits after Traumatic Brain Injury,130277,ZNS1,ZNS1-SRB-L(10),NA,NA,2,107138,8571,115709,NA
