The PIâs ongoing clinical cognitive neuroscience research at the VA focuses on elucidating the neurobiology of suicidal behavior and Sz using neuroimaging and psychophysio- logical approaches. Suicide prevention and identification of promising new targets for intervention in Sz are critically important goals of the VA.

There are also many skin-resident immune cells that make direct contact with sensory neurons. We have previously shown that one subset of neurons that sense pain are necessary and sufficient for cutaneous innate Type-17 inflammation and host defense. We now propose to test the immunologic potential of other subsets of sensory neurons. The overall goal of this proposal is to understand the unique contribution of individual sensory neuron subsets in the modulation of skin immunity. Exploring this neuro-immune interaction will better define the cellular circuits driving inflammation and allow for the use of agonists/antagonists that target neuron subsets in order to modulate specific types of cutaneous immune responses without global immunosuppression.,1866211;1930431 (contact),"ALBERS, KATHRYN MARIE;KAPLAN, DANIEL H (contact)","KOCH, PETER",2020-07-15,2025-06-30,Ablation;Acute;afferent nerve;Afferent Neurons;Agonist;Allergic Disease;antagonist;Automobile Driving;Candida albicans;Cell Degranulation;Cell Physiology;Cells;Chronic;Classification;Communication;Contact hypersensitivity;Croton;Cutaneous;cutaneous sensory neurons;Data;Dendritic cell activation;Dendritic Cells;Dermal;Dermis;Development;Diphtheria Toxin;diphtheria toxin receptor;Epidermis;Event;extracellular;G-Protein-Coupled Receptors;gain of function;Genetic;Goals;Haptens;Host Defense;IL17 gene;Immune;immune function;Immune response;Immunity;Immunologic Tests;Immunosuppression;in vivo;Individual;Infection;Infectious Skin Diseases;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Innate Immune Response;Interruption;Irritants;Lasers;Link;loss of function;mast cell;Mechanoreceptors;Mediating;Modeling;Mus;Nerve;Neurogenic Inflammation;Neuroimmune;Neurons;Nociceptors;Oils;optogenetics;Organ;Pain;pain sensation;pathogen;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Phenotype;Primates;Production;Pruritus;Resistance;response;Sensory;single-cell RNA sequencing;Skin;Somatostatin;Staphylococcus aureus;Stimulus;Testing;Th2 Cells;Touch sensation;transcriptomics;TRPV1 gene;Work,Epidermal Nonpeptidergic Nerves Modulate Cutaneous Immunity,77341,ACTS,"Arthritis, Connective Tissue and Skin Study Section[ACTS]",NA,NA,5,354334,188464,542798,NA

To achieve this challenging goal, we pioneered coupling of these drugs to carrier blood cells, red blood cells and platelets.

The primary goal of the Medical Mentorship program is to help students learn more about medical careers and how to apply to and graduate from institutions of higher learning with a health sciences or biomedical research degree. Medical Mentorship will connect high school students with undergraduate and medical school mentors, including first and second year WWAMI Medical School students, who can help students prepare for careers in medicine and learn how to succeed in college while working toward a STEM degree. Some of the most powerful tools-- mentoring, role modeling, and career exposureâhave been shown to be effective in a variety of settings. Mentoring and support encourages engagement in science, math, and engineering careers. Given the vast distances between these high school students and those in a university setting, this near- peer mentoring program will take place primarily through peer-led group learning through collaborative learning technologies for students who are not co- located in a lab or work-based setting. . Hopa Mountain will develop innovative training and mentoring opportunities for low-income, first generation, and reservation-based Montana high school students to strengthen their STEM skills and prepare them for higher education and careers in health sciences. The overall project goal of Medical Mentorship is to support rural and tribal youthâs interest in and exposure to careers in the biomedical and health sciences while giving them the skills to play leadership roles in increasing healthy family practices in their homes and communities. Medical Mentorship will have meaningful impacts annually through three strategies: (1) Year-round mentoring and college preparation programs for 250 teens to explore health career options; (2) Medical Mentorship: Food as Health materials and programs for 2,000 children and families; and (3) Professional development for 200 educators, community members, and parents.",14139888 (contact),"SACHATELLO-SAWYER, BONNIE  (contact)","MOTEN, CARMEN",2024-06-03,2029-04-30,Biomedical Research;career;career preparation;Caregivers;Child;Collaborations;college;College Preparation;Communities;Development;Educational process of instructing;Educational workshop;Emotional;Engineering;Exposure to;Family;Family Practice;Food;food resource;Funding;Generations;Goals;Health;Health Professional;Health Resources;Health Sciences;high school;high school program;High School Student;higher education;Home;Hygiene;improved;innovation;Institution;interest;Leadership;Learning;Low income;Mathematics;Medical;medical schools;Medical Students;Medicine;member;Mentors;Mentorship;Montana;nutrition;Parents;Participant;Pathway interactions;peer;peer coaching;Physicians;Play;Preparation;programs;Recipe;reservation-based;Resources;Role;role model;Rural;Rural Community;Schools;Science;skills;social;Students;teacher;Technology;Teenagers;tool;Toothbrushing;Training;training opportunity;tribal community;Tribes;undergraduate student;underserved students;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Work;Youth,Medical Mentorship: Building Pathways to Health Careers,187777,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1 CDB-L (55)],NA,NA,1,225000,16800,241800,NA

Interestingly, these proteins normally participate in the function of the brain, and hence, we aim to study if specific disruptions in the natural patterns of neural cells performance and in the vascular maintenance for their activity may be the pathology that predisposes to mishandling of proteins in the cells.",9347551 (contact),"SITNIKOVA, TATIANA  (contact)","HSIAO, JOHN",2022-08-15,2027-07-31,Address;Affect;Aging;Alleles;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Alzheimer&apos;s disease pathology;Alzheimer&apos;s disease patient;Alzheimer&apos;s disease risk;Amyloid beta-42;Amyloid beta-Protein;Animal Model;Apolipoprotein E;Area;Attention;beta amyloid pathology;Biological Markers;Biological Process;Blood;blood oxygen level dependent;blood oxygenation level dependent response;Blood Vessels;Brain;brain cell;Brain region;Cells;Cerebrovascular Circulation;Clinical;Cognition;Cognitive;Cognitive deficits;cohort;Complex;cost effective;cost estimate;Coupling;Data;Dementia;density;Deposition;Disease;Dorsal;Early Intervention;effective therapy;Electroencephalography;Enrollment;Episodic memory;Event;executive function;Exhibits;follow-up;Functional disorder;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;functional magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography;Future;genetic risk factor;Hematological Disease;High Prevalence;Homeostasis;Human;Image;imaging modality;Imaging Techniques;Imaging technology;Impaired cognition;in vivo;Individual;interest;invention;Investigation;Link;Longitudinal cohort;Machine Learning;Maintenance;Measurement;Measures;Mediating;Memory;Metabolic;Metabolism;Methods;mild cognitive impairment;Multivariate Analysis;Nerve Degeneration;neural;neural network;neural patterning;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neurofibrillary Tangles;Neurons;neurophysiology;Neurophysiology - biologic function;neurovascular;neurovascular coupling;novel;older adult;Pathologic;Pathology;Patients;Performance;pharmacologic;Physiological;Population;Predisposition;prevent;Preventive therapy;Process;Property;Proteins;Public Health;Records;Recurrence;Regional Disease;Regulation;Reporting;response;Rest;Scanning;Senile Plaques;Signal Transduction;source localization;Structure;Symptoms;System;tau Proteins;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Time;Work,Simultaneous EEG/fMRI to disentangle neural and vascular mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease pathology,75753,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-BDCN-W(55)R],NA,NA,3,351903,234534,586437,NA

The studyâs scientific premises are that a) communication barriers between clinicians and patients are a social determinant of health that contribute to health inequities; b) the sources of inequities in hospital-based outcomes for LEP patients are all nurse-sensitive; c) hospital nurses and their practices in relation to bridging language barriers are the most under- studied area of practice despite having the highest volume of contact with LEP patients; and d) practice guidelines for nurses and their employers about âessentialâ times to use language services are vague and not well specified.

DS occurs in approximately 1 in 600-1000 live births and is estimated to affect more than 300,000 individuals in the USA. Neuropathological and clinical features of Alzheimerâs disease (AD) present early in life through the sixth decade, and include amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, NGF dysmetabolism and cholinergic basal forebrain degeneration, CNS inflammation, and cognitive decline leading to AD dementia. Despite the molecular and genetic similarities between AD and DS, there exists a paucity of information on the biological mechanisms underlying the onset of cognitive decline in adults with DS. Responding to the INCLUDE initiative, the overall goal of this proposal is to investigate pathophysiological mechanisms and novel biomarkers in different stages of AD in DS. The proposed studies use a multidisciplinary and complementary approach, which includes biochemical analysis of plasma, CSF, and extracellular vesicles (EVs), neuropathological assessments, trancriptomics, proteomics, in vitro cellular/molecular analyses, and a well-characterized cohort of DS individuals to uncover the molecular pathobiological progression of AD in DS. This powerful combination of neuropathological, cellular, and clinical studies using the same biomarkers will lead to a detailed characterization of AD stages that will enable a precision medicine approach that will inform future preventive trials and assist in the prediction of the onset and evolution of AD dementia and in the identification of novel therapeutic targets in this vulnerable population.",2405846 (contact);1959403;12552831;1866058,"BUSCIGLIO, JORGE A (contact);CUELLO, A CLAUDIO;FORTEA, JUAN ;WISNIEWSKI, THOMAS M","OPANASHUK, LISA A",2024-08-15,2029-07-31,Adult;Affect;Age;age acceleration;Alzheimer like pathology;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Alzheimer&apos;s disease pathology;Alzheimerâs disease biomarker;Amyloid beta-42;Amyloidosis;Astrocytes;Autopsy;basal forebrain;Biochemical;Biological;Biological Markers;Biological Models;biomarker identification;Body Fluids;Brain;Brain region;brain tissue;California;Canada;cholinergic;Chromosome 21;Clinical;Clinical Research;cohort;Collaborations;Data;Dementia;Development;developmental genetics;Down&apos;s Syndrome;entorhinal cortex;Event;Evolution;extracellular vesicles;frontal lobe;Functional disorder;Future;Genetic;Genetic Diseases;Genetic Models;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Hippocampus;Hospitals;Human;Human Chromosomes;Image;imaging biomarker;Immune;Impaired cognition;In Vitro;Individual;Inflammation;Life;Liquid substance;Live Birth;Metabolic dysfunction;Metabolism;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Analysis;molecular targeted therapies;multidisciplinary;multimodality;Nerve Degeneration;Nerve Growth Factors;Neurofibrillary Tangles;neuroinflammation;Neurons;neuropathology;new therapeutic target;New York;novel marker;novel strategies;Pathogenesis;Pathology;Pathway interactions;patient population;Patients;Persons;Plasma;precision medicine;Preventive;Preventive Clinical Trial;Proteins;Proteomics;Publishing;Research;Role;Senile Plaques;single-cell RNA sequencing;Spain;Study models;targeted biomarker;tau Proteins;Testing;Thick;transcriptomics;treatment response;Trisomy;Universities;Vulnerable Populations,The role of immune deregulation and NGF dysmetabolism in the development of Alzheimer disease in individuals with Down syndrome,87280,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1 IVBH-B (57)],NA,NA,1,957575,148200,1105775,NA

The major causes of death include infections due to the toxicity of immunosuppressant medications. Therefore, a significant unmet need exists for non-toxic medications in SLE. Our research has been directed to develop safe and effective treatments that are focused on the very causes of lupus pathogenesis, such as the depletion of a natural antioxidant, reduced glutathione (GSH), which underlies inflammation in SLE through activating a regulatory protein called the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). Along this line, we have initiated a clinical trial in SLE patients aimed at the replenishment of GSH with an amino acid precursor, N-acetylcysteine (NAC). As shown by our pilot study completed in 2011, NAC was tolerated by all patients at the 1.2 g/day and 2.4 g/day dosages, while 33% of those receiving 4.8 g/day had reversible nausea. Placebo and 1.2 g/day NAC did not influence disease activity. Although the 2.4 g/day and 4.8 g/day NAC dosages showed preliminary evidence for therapeutic efficacy, 4.8 g/day NAC achieved greater clinical improvements. NAC raised GSH, blocked mTOR, and expanded anti-inflammatory cells. Importantly, the safety of NAC has been widely confirmed and efficacy has been noted in follow-up case reports. While NAC is inexpensive compared to current therapies burdened with serious side-effects and widely accessible in health food stores, it is unavailable as an oral medication by prescription. Therefore, the proposed phase II trial will employ the SLE Responder Index (SRI), as a clinically meaningful primary outcome to evaluate the efficacy of NAC over 1 year. To minimize potential intolerance of NAC and subject withdrawal during the trial, the design includes an open-label dosage titration period. Patients who tolerate 2.4-4.8 g daily NAC for 3 months will be randomized or assigned 1:1 to continue treatment on their tolerated dosage of NAC or matching placebo for 9 additional months. Beyond the premise of validating clinical efficacy and durability of this therapy, the proposed studies will test the assumption that depletion of GSH and activation of mTOR predict clinical responsiveness to NAC in SLE. The proposed studies are expected to lead to the development of a novel, uniquely safe, and affordable medication with the potential to favorably alter the long-term outcomes of SLE.",8147385;1891355 (contact);11214709,"MCDERMOTT, MICHAEL P;PERL, ANDRAS  (contact);WALLACE, DANIEL J.","MANCINI, MARIE",2020-06-15,2026-05-31,Acetaminophen;Acetylcysteine;Address;Affect;Age;Amino Acids;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Antidotes;Antinuclear Antibodies;Antioxidants;Autoimmune Diseases;B-Cell Activation;Biological Markers;biomarker driven;Case Study;Cause of Death;CD3 Antigens;CD8B1 gene;Cell Lineage;Cell secretion;Cells;child bearing;Clinical;clinical efficacy;Clinical Management;clinical practice;clinical predictors;Clinical Trials;clinically relevant;Complex;Cyclic AMP;Cysteine;Death Rate;design;Development;disabling symptom;Disease;DNA;dosage;Double-Blind Method;Down-Regulation;Dropout;Drops;Drug Prescriptions;effective therapy;efficacy evaluation;Enrollment;Etiology;Fatigue;Feedback;follow-up;FOXP3 gene;FRAP1 gene;Functional disorder;Generations;genetic regulatory protein;Glutathione;Health Food;Human;IL17 gene;IL2RA gene;Immune;Immune System Diseases;Immunologics;Immunosuppressive Agents;improved;in vivo;indexing;Infection;Inflammation;Inflammatory;innovation;Interferons;Interleukin-4;Intervention;intravenous administration;Kidney Diseases;Knowledge;Kynurenine;Life;Liver Failure;Lupus;lupus prone mice;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolic Pathway;metabolome;Methylation;Mitochondria;mortality;Multicenter Trials;Mus;Nausea;Nephritis;novel;open label;Oral;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress;Participant;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte;Permeability;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;phase II trial;Pilot Projects;Placebo Control;placebo controlled study;Placebos;Plasmablast;predict clinical outcome;primary outcome;Production;promoter;Proteins;Randomized;Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials;reactive oxygen intermediate;Reduced Glutathione;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Research;Research Design;Role;Safety;Sample Size;sensor;side effect;Signal Transduction Pathway;Sirolimus;Specific qualifier value;System;Systemic Lupus Erythematosus;T-Cell Activation;T-Cell Development;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Time;Titrations;Toxic effect;Treatment Efficacy;treatment response;Withdrawal;Woman;Work,SLE Treatment with N-acetylcysteine,76092,ZAR1,ZAR1-KS(M2),NA,NA,4,1894681,313217,1437594,NA

It filters the blood coming from the digestive tract before it reaches the rest of the body, and secretes bile, a digestive aid, back into the intestine. This controlled traffic of molecules in and out of the liver is mediated by epithelia. Epithelial cells act as sophisticated gatekeepers that form polarized membrane domains to restrict the transporters and gated channels responsible for the trafficking of molecules across the cell membrane to either the blood facing or the bile facing surfaces. This ensures that molecule transport is directional. Hepatocytes, the main epithelial cell type in the liver, organize these polarized domains with an architecture that is different from that of all other epithelia in the body. When this unique architecture is lost, as in fibrotic liver diseases, hepatocyte function is compromised.

By examining two increasingly common risk-related environmental factors â namely asthma and wildfire particulate matter â we will challenge current paradigms and isolate mechanisms related to microglia that may contribute to pathophysiology of autism. This hypothesis-driven integrative study combines immune, complex real-world environmental exposures, and epigenetic approaches to address a major gap in autism research and will provide critical information on the consequences of environmental contributions to risk for autism, helping to translate epidemiological observation into a functional model that can be utilized for further investigations and identify possible paths for prevention.",9074347 (contact),"ASHWOOD, PAUL  (contact)","LAWLER, CINDY P",2024-05-01,2026-04-30,Acute;Address;Adult;Affect;Air Pollution;allergic airway disease;Asthma;asthma exacerbation;asthmatic;Autism Diagnosis;autism spectrum disorder;autistic children;Autopsy;Brain;Brain Diseases;brain tissue;California;Cell Nucleus;Cells;Child;climate change;Complex;critical period;cytokine;Data;Development;Disease;disorder risk;DNA Methylation;Droughts;effective therapy;Endothelium;Environmental Exposure;Environmental Pollutants;Environmental Risk Factor;Epidemiology;Epigenetic Process;epigenetic regulation;epigenome;epigenomics;Epithelium;Exhibits;experimental study;Exposure to;Extrinsic asthma;Face;Factor Analysis;fetal;Fetal Development;Fever;Fire - disasters;Functional disorder;gene discovery;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Regulation;gene network;Genes;Genetic;Genomics;glial activation;glial cell development;Goals;Grain;Heritability;Hospitalization;Human;Hypersensitivity;Immune;immune activation;immune function;Immune response;Immune system;Immunologics;immunoregulation;Impairment;In Situ;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Response;innovation;interest;Intervention;Investigation;Laboratories;Lead;Life;Link;Liquid substance;maternal immune system;Mediating;Methylation;Microglia;model of autism spectrum disorder;Modeling;Modification;Molecular;Morphology;multiple omics;Mus;Neurobiology;neurodevelopment;Neurodevelopmental Disorder;Neurons;Neurotransmitters;novel;Observational epidemiology;offspring;Particulate Matter;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Phagocytosis;pharmacologic;Pollution;Pre-Clinical Model;Predisposition;Pregnancy;pregnant;prenatal;prevent;Prevention;Prevention strategy;Process;Public Health;Regulatory Pathway;repetitive behavior;Reporting;Research;response;Risk;Sampling;Seasons;sex;Sex Differences;Social Interaction;Solid;Soot;Source;Synapses;Testing;Time;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing;Translating;United States;Wildfire;Woman,Combined environmental exposures and neurodevelopment disorders,35969,NAL,Neurotoxicology and Alcohol Study Section[NAL],NA,A1,1,150000,91250,241250,NA
