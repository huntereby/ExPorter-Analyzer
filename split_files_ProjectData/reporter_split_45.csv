The PI’s ongoing clinical cognitive neuroscience research at the VA focuses on elucidating the neurobiology of suicidal behavior and Sz using neuroimaging and psychophysio- logical approaches. Suicide prevention and identification of promising new targets for intervention in Sz are critically important goals of the VA. The PI’s track record of federal funding and peer-reviewed publications in these two areas has helped advance the field and her VA-funded grants may identify biomarkers which aid in prospectively identifying Veterans at greatest risk for suicide.

There are also many skin-resident immune cells that make direct contact with sensory neurons. We have previously shown that one subset of neurons that sense pain are necessary and sufficient for cutaneous innate Type-17 inflammation and host defense. We now propose to test the immunologic potential of other subsets of sensory neurons. The overall goal of this proposal is to understand the unique contribution of individual sensory neuron subsets in the modulation of skin immunity. Exploring this neuro-immune interaction will better define the cellular circuits driving inflammation and allow for the use of agonists/antagonists that target neuron subsets in order to modulate specific types of cutaneous immune responses without global immunosuppression.,1866211;1930431 (contact),"ALBERS, KATHRYN MARIE;KAPLAN, DANIEL H (contact)","KOCH, PETER",2020-07-15,2025-06-30,Ablation;Acute;afferent nerve;Afferent Neurons;Agonist;Allergic Disease;antagonist;Automobile Driving;Candida albicans;Cell Degranulation;Cell Physiology;Cells;Chronic;Classification;Communication;Contact hypersensitivity;Croton;Cutaneous;cutaneous sensory neurons;Data;Dendritic cell activation;Dendritic Cells;Dermal;Dermis;Development;Diphtheria Toxin;diphtheria toxin receptor;Epidermis;Event;extracellular;G-Protein-Coupled Receptors;gain of function;Genetic;Goals;Haptens;Host Defense;IL17 gene;Immune;immune function;Immune response;Immunity;Immunologic Tests;Immunosuppression;in vivo;Individual;Infection;Infectious Skin Diseases;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Innate Immune Response;Interruption;Irritants;Lasers;Link;loss of function;mast cell;Mechanoreceptors;Mediating;Modeling;Mus;Nerve;Neurogenic Inflammation;Neuroimmune;Neurons;Nociceptors;Oils;optogenetics;Organ;Pain;pain sensation;pathogen;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Phenotype;Primates;Production;Pruritus;Resistance;response;Sensory;single-cell RNA sequencing;Skin;Somatostatin;Staphylococcus aureus;Stimulus;Testing;Th2 Cells;Touch sensation;transcriptomics;TRPV1 gene;Work,Epidermal Nonpeptidergic Nerves Modulate Cutaneous Immunity,77341,ACTS,"Arthritis, Connective Tissue and Skin Study Section[ACTS]",NA,NA,5,354334,188464,542798,NA

Yet, no drug is safe and effective in conditions associated with combined acute high risk of thrombosis and bleeding. Treatment of thromboses in these patients, e.g., in the early post-surgery period, is an unmet medical need.

The primary goal of the Medical Mentorship program is to help students learn more about medical careers and how to apply to and graduate from institutions of higher learning with a health sciences or biomedical research degree. Medical Mentorship will connect high school students with undergraduate and medical school mentors, including first and second year WWAMI Medical School students, who can help students prepare for careers in medicine and learn how to succeed in college while working toward a STEM degree. Some of the most powerful tools-- mentoring, role modeling, and career exposure—have been shown to be effective in a variety of settings. Mentoring and support encourages engagement in science, math, and engineering careers. Given the vast distances between these high school students and those in a university setting, this near- peer mentoring program will take place primarily through peer-led group learning through collaborative learning technologies for students who are not co- located in a lab or work-based setting. . Hopa Mountain will develop innovative training and mentoring opportunities for low-income, first generation, and reservation-based Montana high school students to strengthen their STEM skills and prepare them for higher education and careers in health sciences. The overall project goal of Medical Mentorship is to support rural and tribal youth’s interest in and exposure to careers in the biomedical and health sciences while giving them the skills to play leadership roles in increasing healthy family practices in their homes and communities. Medical Mentorship will have meaningful impacts annually through three strategies: (1) Year-round mentoring and college preparation programs for 250 teens to explore health career options; (2) Medical Mentorship: Food as Health materials and programs for 2,000 children and families; and (3) Professional development for 200 educators, community members, and parents.",14139888 (contact),"SACHATELLO-SAWYER, BONNIE  (contact)","MOTEN, CARMEN",2024-06-03,2029-04-30,Biomedical Research;career;career preparation;Caregivers;Child;Collaborations;college;College Preparation;Communities;Development;Educational process of instructing;Educational workshop;Emotional;Engineering;Exposure to;Family;Family Practice;Food;food resource;Funding;Generations;Goals;Health;Health Professional;Health Resources;Health Sciences;high school;high school program;High School Student;higher education;Home;Hygiene;improved;innovation;Institution;interest;Leadership;Learning;Low income;Mathematics;Medical;medical schools;Medical Students;Medicine;member;Mentors;Mentorship;Montana;nutrition;Parents;Participant;Pathway interactions;peer;peer coaching;Physicians;Play;Preparation;programs;Recipe;reservation-based;Resources;Role;role model;Rural;Rural Community;Schools;Science;skills;social;Students;teacher;Technology;Teenagers;tool;Toothbrushing;Training;training opportunity;tribal community;Tribes;undergraduate student;underserved students;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Work;Youth,Medical Mentorship: Building Pathways to Health Careers,187777,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1 CDB-L (55)],NA,NA,1,225000,16800,241800,NA

This proposal thus aims to use deer mice to test the hypothesis that the expansion of specific corticospinal neuron populations results in changes in neural activity and dexterous behavior, thus fulfilling the seventh goal of the BRAIN Initiative by integrating across levels of understanding to contextualize cell types in circuit function, and circuit function in behavioral output.",12393332 (contact),"TYSSOWSKI, KELSEY MARIE (contact)","JOHNSON, KARI ANNE",2024-04-01,2026-03-31,Address;Advisory Committees;Affect;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis;Animals;Architecture;Area;autism spectrum disorder;Behavior;behavior prediction;Behavioral;Biological Models;Biology;BRAIN initiative;candidate identification;career;cell type;Cells;Cerebral cortex;Cervical spinal cord structure;Cognitive;cognitive capacity;cognitive enhancement;Communication;comparative;Computer Analysis;Corticospinal Tracts;Coupled;Data;Data Set;Deer Mouse;Development;dexterity;Disease;Distant;Evolution;experimental study;Forelimb;forest;Foundations;Genes;Genetic;genetic manipulation;Goals;Habitats;Hand;high dimensionality;Histology;Human;Impairment;improved;Individual;Lesion;Link;Measures;Mediating;Mentors;Mentorship;Modeling;Molecular;molecular marker;Motor;Motor Cortex;Motor Skills;Movement;Mus;Nervous System Disorder;neural;neural circuit;neural correlate;Neuroanatomy;neuron development;neuronal circuitry;Neurons;Neurosciences;North Carolina;Output;Pattern;Peromyscus;Phase;Physiological;Population;Population Sizes;Positioning Attribute;Primates;programs;Research;Rodent;Role;single cell sequencing;single nucleus RNA-sequencing;skills;Spinal Cord;Structure;System;Technology;Testing;Time;tool;Training;Universities;Variant;Viral;Work,A comparative approach to uncovering the cellular and circuit basis of the role of the corticospinal tract in motor skill,133031,ZMH1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZMH1 ERB-P (02)],NA,A1,1,121125,9690,130815,NA

This study will develop the first state-level microsimulation model to estimate the health and economic impact of intensive tobacco control policies, under scenarios with and without ENDS in the marketplace, in order to: 1) estimate the magnitude of the effect that ENDS presence has on a policy’s effect in reducing population harms of tobacco and 2) estimate the variation in population level harms attributable to ENDS over alternative policy contexts.",8304924 (contact),"MACIOSEK, MICHAEL V (contact)","MAYNE, RACHEL G",2022-07-01,2027-06-30,Adolescent;Adoption;Adult;Attenuated;Behavior;Binding;Biological Markers;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cigarette;combustible cigarette;cost effectiveness;Cost Savings;Country;Data Set;Disease;economic impact;economic outcome;Economics;Electronic cigarette;Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems;Engineering;evidence base;Expenditure;experience;experimental study;former smoker;Funding;Future;Goals;Harm Reduction;Health;health assessment;health economics;Health Status;Individual;Knowledge;Literature;Malignant Neoplasms;Manufacturer;Medical Care Costs;Mental Health;Modeling;models and simulation;Nicotine;nicotine use;Pattern;Policies;Policy Maker;Population;population health;premature;Prevalence;Probability;programs;Public Health;public policy on tobacco;Recommendation;Research Personnel;residence;Respiratory Disease;Risk;simulation;Smoker;Smoking;statistics;Taxes;Time;timeline;Tobacco;tobacco control;tobacco products;Tobacco use;tool;Toxic effect;United States Food and Drug Administration;uptake;vaping;Variant;young adult;Youth,The Interplay of ENDS and Tobacco Control Policy: Impact on the Population Harms of Tobacco,263542,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-RPHB-P(56)R],NA,NA,3,411560,169739,581299,NA

The major causes of death include infections due to the toxicity of immunosuppressant medications. Therefore, a significant unmet need exists for non-toxic medications in SLE. Our research has been directed to develop safe and effective treatments that are focused on the very causes of lupus pathogenesis, such as the depletion of a natural antioxidant, reduced glutathione (GSH), which underlies inflammation in SLE through activating a regulatory protein called the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). Along this line, we have initiated a clinical trial in SLE patients aimed at the replenishment of GSH with an amino acid precursor, N-acetylcysteine (NAC). As shown by our pilot study completed in 2011, NAC was tolerated by all patients at the 1.2 g/day and 2.4 g/day dosages, while 33% of those receiving 4.8 g/day had reversible nausea. Placebo and 1.2 g/day NAC did not influence disease activity. Although the 2.4 g/day and 4.8 g/day NAC dosages showed preliminary evidence for therapeutic efficacy, 4.8 g/day NAC achieved greater clinical improvements. NAC raised GSH, blocked mTOR, and expanded anti-inflammatory cells. Importantly, the safety of NAC has been widely confirmed and efficacy has been noted in follow-up case reports. While NAC is inexpensive compared to current therapies burdened with serious side-effects and widely accessible in health food stores, it is unavailable as an oral medication by prescription. Therefore, the proposed phase II trial will employ the SLE Responder Index (SRI), as a clinically meaningful primary outcome to evaluate the efficacy of NAC over 1 year. To minimize potential intolerance of NAC and subject withdrawal during the trial, the design includes an open-label dosage titration period. Patients who tolerate 2.4-4.8 g daily NAC for 3 months will be randomized or assigned 1:1 to continue treatment on their tolerated dosage of NAC or matching placebo for 9 additional months. Beyond the premise of validating clinical efficacy and durability of this therapy, the proposed studies will test the assumption that depletion of GSH and activation of mTOR predict clinical responsiveness to NAC in SLE. The proposed studies are expected to lead to the development of a novel, uniquely safe, and affordable medication with the potential to favorably alter the long-term outcomes of SLE.",8147385;1891355 (contact);11214709,"MCDERMOTT, MICHAEL P;PERL, ANDRAS  (contact);WALLACE, DANIEL J.","MANCINI, MARIE",2020-06-15,2026-05-31,Acetaminophen;Acetylcysteine;Address;Affect;Age;Amino Acids;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Antidotes;Antinuclear Antibodies;Antioxidants;Autoimmune Diseases;B-Cell Activation;Biological Markers;biomarker driven;Case Study;Cause of Death;CD3 Antigens;CD8B1 gene;Cell Lineage;Cell secretion;Cells;child bearing;Clinical;clinical efficacy;Clinical Management;clinical practice;clinical predictors;Clinical Trials;clinically relevant;Complex;Cyclic AMP;Cysteine;Death Rate;design;Development;disabling symptom;Disease;DNA;dosage;Double-Blind Method;Down-Regulation;Dropout;Drops;Drug Prescriptions;effective therapy;efficacy evaluation;Enrollment;Etiology;Fatigue;Feedback;follow-up;FOXP3 gene;FRAP1 gene;Functional disorder;Generations;genetic regulatory protein;Glutathione;Health Food;Human;IL17 gene;IL2RA gene;Immune;Immune System Diseases;Immunologics;Immunosuppressive Agents;improved;in vivo;indexing;Infection;Inflammation;Inflammatory;innovation;Interferons;Interleukin-4;Intervention;intravenous administration;Kidney Diseases;Knowledge;Kynurenine;Life;Liver Failure;Lupus;lupus prone mice;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolic Pathway;metabolome;Methylation;Mitochondria;mortality;Multicenter Trials;Mus;Nausea;Nephritis;novel;open label;Oral;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress;Participant;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte;Permeability;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;phase II trial;Pilot Projects;Placebo Control;placebo controlled study;Placebos;Plasmablast;predict clinical outcome;primary outcome;Production;promoter;Proteins;Randomized;Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials;reactive oxygen intermediate;Reduced Glutathione;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Research;Research Design;Role;Safety;Sample Size;sensor;side effect;Signal Transduction Pathway;Sirolimus;Specific qualifier value;System;Systemic Lupus Erythematosus;T-Cell Activation;T-Cell Development;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Time;Titrations;Toxic effect;Treatment Efficacy;treatment response;Withdrawal;Woman;Work,SLE Treatment with N-acetylcysteine,76092,ZAR1,ZAR1-KS(M2),NA,NA,4,1894681,313217,1437594,NA

It filters the blood coming from the digestive tract before it reaches the rest of the body, and secretes bile, a digestive aid, back into the intestine. This controlled traffic of molecules in and out of the liver is mediated by epithelia. Epithelial cells act as sophisticated gatekeepers that form polarized membrane domains to restrict the transporters and gated channels responsible for the trafficking of molecules across the cell membrane to either the blood facing or the bile facing surfaces. This ensures that molecule transport is directional. Hepatocytes, the main epithelial cell type in the liver, organize these polarized domains with an architecture that is different from that of all other epithelia in the body. When this unique architecture is lost, as in fibrotic liver diseases, hepatocyte function is compromised.

Current therapy for AMI focuses on rapidly restoring blood flow through an occluded coronary artery. However, reperfusion itself can cause myocardial damage, known as reperfusion injury. Use of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) has grown exponentially and is the subject of several clinical trials in AMI. We have now identified a novel paradigm whereby VA-ECMO worsens heart damage by depleting critical regulators of mitochondrial function and further shown that targeting these mechanisms may reduce heart damage in AMI. By employing highly translational models and clinically relevant interventional approaches, these studies introduce new mechanisms involving VA-ECMO and myocardial reperfusion injury, provide penetrating insight into cardioprotection and generate proof of concept data for the development of new therapeutic approaches to limit LV injury in AMI.",9383763 (contact),"KAPUR, NAVIN KUMAR (contact)","SCHWARTZ, LISA",2021-08-01,2025-07-31,Acute;Acute myocardial infarction;Address;Animal Model;Blood;Blood flow;Cardiac;cardiac magnetic resonance imaging;Cardiac Myocytes;Cardiolipins;Cardiology;cardioprotection;Cardiovascular system;Cicatrix;Clinical Trials;clinically relevant;Coronary;coronary artery occlusion;Data;Development;Devices;Drug Combinations;Drug Delivery Systems;Enzymes;Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation;Heart Arrest;heart damage;heart dimension/size;Heart failure;Heart Transplantation;hemodynamics;Hospital Mortality;Hospitalization;Impairment;implantation;improved;improved outcome;Infarction;Injury;insight;Intervention;Knowledge;Left;Left Ventricular Function;Left ventricular structure;mechanical circulatory support;Mechanics;Mediating;Medicine;Membrane;Metabolism;Mitochondria;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Biology;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality;Myocardial;myocardial damage;myocardial infarct sizing;myocardial injury;Myocardial Reperfusion;Myocardial Reperfusion Injury;new therapeutic target;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutic intervention;Outcome;Oxidative Stress;Oxygen;Patients;Penetration;Physiology;porcine model;preservation;prevent;Pump;Recovery;Reperfusion Injury;Reperfusion Therapy;Reporting;Respiratory Failure;Risk;Role;Self-Help Devices;Specialist;Stress;System;Systemic blood pressure;Testing;therapeutic evaluation;Time;translational model;translational study;Treatment Efficacy;United States;Venous;Ventricular;ventricular assist device,New Approaches to Mitigate Left Ventricular Injury with VA-ECMO in Acute Myocardial Infarction,159089,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-TDPS-R(01)],NA,NA,4,488826,363027,851853,NA
