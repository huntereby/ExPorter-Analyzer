By combing single-cell RNA- sequencing (scRNA-seq), regional whole exome sequencing (WES), spatial transcriptomics (ST) and MxIF to enumerate consensus cell states and to project tumor programs and microenvironmental features onto progression pseudotime, we have identified an immune-exclusion IEX score in MSS CRC that consists of DDR1, TGFBi and DPEP1, which are markedly upregulated in plasma-derived small extracellullar vesicles (sEVs) and supermeres of CRC patients compared to healthy controls, and for which inhibitors are developed or being developed.

To do this, it is important to better understand Veterans' transitions into homelessness, or from one unstable situation to the next, such as from cohabiting with family or a friend to living in a homeless shelter. The knowledge of these transitions, especially from the perspective of the individuals experiencing them – such as their in-the-moment emotions, behaviors, and geographic movements, could inform interventions that prevent Veterans' rapid deterioration in housing or in health.

In our analysis, we noted that telemedicine management of hypertension overall is more effective for blood pressure control than usual clinic-based care, but the benefit is significantly diminished in studies that enrolled more Black patients than studies that enrolled more White patients, likely due to a lack of tailoring of the telemedicine intervention to the needs and social context of Black patients. This study proposes to leverage the contextual needs of socially disadvantaged Black patients and the primary care clinics they attend in using the telemedicine intervention to make the intervention responsive to the needs of the patients and clinics and will eventually examine the feasibility of the refined intervention compared with usual clinic-based care in a pilot randomized controlled trial, thus paving a pathway for a future larger study to confirm the benefit of the telemedicine intervention and to advance equity in blood pressure control in socially disadvantaged Black patients.",14114487 (contact),"POKHAREL, YASHASHWI  (contact)","REDMOND, NICOLE",2024-09-01,2029-08-31,"Address;Age;Area;Award;Black American;black patient;Black race;Blood Pressure;blood pressure control;blood pressure reduction;Cardiovascular Diseases;cardiovascular disorder prevention;Cardiovascular system;career;career development;Career Mobility;Caring;caucasian American;Clinic;Clinic Visits;Clinical;Clinical effectiveness;clinical implementation;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Design;Committee Members;Communities;Community Health Aides;comparison intervention;Complement;contextual factors;Data;Death Rate;Dedications;design;diagnostic accuracy;Disparity;disparity reduction;Educational workshop;Enrollment;Environment;epidemiology study;Equity;Evaluation;experience;Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment;Faculty;Failure;Future;Goals;health equity;health inequalities;Health Personnel;Health system;Home;Home Blood Pressure Monitoring;human centered design;Hypertension;hypertension control;implementation framework;implementation research;implementation science;implementation strategy;improved;Inequity;innovation;Internal Medicine;Intervention;intervention refinement;Intervention Trial;Interview;Life;Measurement;Medical;medical schools;member;Mentors;Meta-Analysis;Methods;Modeling;mortality;multidisciplinary;National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute;Not Hispanic or Latino;Outcomes Research;Pathway interactions;patient oriented research;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacotherapy;Physicians;pilot trial;Population;Positioning Attribute;Prevention Research;primary care clinic;Process;programs;prototype;Provider;Random Allocation;Randomized, Controlled Trials;recruit;Research;Research Personnel;Risk Factors;Scientist;Self Care;Self Management;skill acquisition;skills;social;social disparities;Social Environment;social interventions;Social Workers;Standardization;Strategic vision;Surveys;System;Telemedicine;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Titrations;Training;trial enrollment;Universities;Vulnerable Populations",Tailoring a Telemedicine Hypertension Management Intervention for Black Patients,171954,MPOR,NHLBI Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Study Section[MPOR (MA)],NA,A1,1,144978,11598,156576,NA

It is characterized by extensive hypoxia-induced, mitochondria-dependent phenotypic changes such as a glycolytic respiration, decreased ability to undergo apoptosis and extensive invasiveness which are linked to GBM's resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. Mitochondrial LonP1 is an ATP-stimulated protease, directly up-regulated by HIF-1α. LonP1 is overexpressed in human malignant gliomas and its elevated expression levels are associated with high glioma tumor grade and poor patient survival. Therefore, regulation of mitochondrial function by inhibiting LonP1 protease could represent a novel approach for GBM and potentially other fast-growing malignancies which heavily depend on hypoxic adaptation. The proposed project is based on our preliminary results obtained from in vitro (cell-based) studies with our LonP1 inhibitor compound BT317 and in vivo LonP1-overexpression xenograft models studies.

This study uses quasi- experimental methods and longitudinal and spatial modeling to determine whether disasters have affected substance use outcomes, including through mechanisms such as psychological distress and treatment and drug market disruption, by combining data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, the FBI Uniform Crime Reports, and an underutilized dataset of all disaster declarations from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). By examining these mechanisms as well as analyses by key aggregate- and individual-level sociodemographic characteristics, this project has the potential to improve morbidity and mortality by informing how resources and individual- and community-level interventions may be deployed to intervene on drug-related problems in the face of future disasters.",11286625 (contact),"VUOLO, MICHAEL C (contact)","HARTSOCK, PETER",2024-08-15,2029-07-31,Abate;Adult;adverse outcome;Affect;anthropogenesis;Area;Back;Black Populations;Censuses;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.);Cessation of life;Characteristics;climate change;Communities;community intervention;County;Crime;Data;Data Set;Databases;demographics;Dependence;Diffuse;Dimensions;Disasters;Disease;Distress;Droughts;Drug Addiction;drug market;Drug usage;Earthquakes;Education;Emergency Situation;Equity;Ethnic Origin;Event;experience;Exposure to;extreme weather;Fentanyl;Floods;Frequencies;Future;Gender;Geography;Growth;Health;health disparity;heroin use;Human;Hurricane;improved;Individual;instrument;Latinx population;Life;Life Expectancy;Link;Literature;Low income;Marketing;Mental disorders;Mental Health;Meta-Analysis;misuse of prescription only drugs;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality;Nature;novel;Outcome;Overdose;overdose death;Pattern;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;physical conditioning;population health;Process;psychological distress;Public Health;public health research;Quasi-experiment;Race;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;research study;Resources;Role;rurality;Sampling;sex;Shock;social group;social health determinants;sociodemographics;socioeconomics;Stimulant;substance use;Suicide;Surveys;synthetic opioid;Testing;theories;treatment services;Urbanicity;vehicular accident;years of life lost,Direct and Indirect Effects of Disasters on Drug-Related Outcomes,59826,ZDA1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZDA1 LXF-E (M1)],NA,A1,1,280693,108164,388857,NA

Despite efforts to predict PTB risk and improve pregnancy outcomes, the establishment of etiological pathways has been constrained by the heterogeneity of PTB. Available evidence suggests that maternal exposure to adversities and chronic stress (i.e., maternal childhood trauma, adult abuse, and psychosocial stressors) are strong predictors of PTB. At the molecular level, DNA methylation (DNAm) variation is a well-studied epigenetic marker associated with maternal exposures occurring in pregnancy, some of which can have long-lasting effects on the offspring’s health. Emerging evidence shows that DNAm is related to gestational age at birth in newborns, reflective of fetal development processes. We propose a novel examination of the infant’s DNAm to elucidate the potential biological mechanisms contributing specifically to early PTB (ePTB) (< 34 weeks’ gestation) and related neonatal outcomes in a high-risk population. We will establish whether newborn DNAm mediates the association between maternal risk factors and poorer neonatal outcomes in this group. We will also identify if increased epigenetic age acceleration mediates the relationship between maternal stressors and poorer neonatal outcomes. New knowledge of biological mechanisms influencing ePTB and neonatal outcomes will facilitate the development of timely interventions to prevent ePTB's immediate and long-term consequences, particularly in high-risk populations, and to identify newborns at higher risk of adverse health outcomes. Specifically, this study will: Aim 1. Characterize the DNA methylation profile of infants born early preterm versus those born at term. Aim 2. Examine the extent to which newborn salivary DNA methylation mediates the association between maternal psychopathology and lifetime stressors, with neonatal outcomes linked to ePTB. Aim 3. (a) Estimate the extent to which newborn salivary DNAm predicts clinical gestational age, and (b) use causal mediation analysis to examine if gestational age acceleration mediates the relationship between maternal psychopathology and lifetime stressors with neonatal outcomes. A clear understanding of the role of DNAm and other biological mechanisms associated with ePTB and gestational age may facilitate the development of early interventions related to prematurity, especially in high- risk populations.",15978777 (contact),"JUVINAO-QUINTERO, DIANA L.

While each population is known to carry a discrete protease phenotype, the degree to which these populations differentially contribute to tissue inflammation is poorly understood. We have developed a novel cell culture system allowing the differentiation of both phenotypes from human peripheral blood progenitors, allowing direct comparison of the effector function of these two phenotypes. Using these systems, we have discrete cytokine and pro-inflammatory eicosanoid production profiles from the two phenotypes in response to activation and find that they both differentially respond to stimulus with type 2 inflammation-associated cytokines, all of which reflect the in vivo transcriptomic phenotype of intraepithelial versus parenchymal mast cells within human nasal polyps.

Our PNAs will accomplish this by targeting specific RNA components of BMCs and either making them fluorescent for visual detection in a microscope or blocking their incorporation into BMCs to study the effect on the cell.",1921361 (contact);12346091,"ARMITAGE, BRUCE A.

Naloxone HCl Injection, USP (Naloxone) is a non-addictive opioid antagonist that can be given to any person to rapidly reverses overdose symptoms (i.e., respiratory, and central nervous system depression). Naloxone is readily available across all 50 states, often without a prescription, at relatively low cost, even subsidized in many cases through various non-profit and government entities. Community Need: The community (including those susceptible to overdose, family members, first responders, and passersby) are desperately looking for a solution that increases availability, is simple and intuitive to use, and has the needed effectiveness to save a life. I-Corp will allow for a meaningful interaction between Pirouette and that community (AIM I). Availability: When used, Naloxone reverses 93.5% of opioid overdoses. [2] However, Naloxone is not always on-hand when it is needed. Community saturation through widespread distribution and adoption could avert 21% of opioid overdose deaths.[3] The clear choice in increasing adoption of Naloxone is an auto-injector, but unfortunately, there are currently no OTC Naloxone auto-injectors (NAI) available and the single prescription NAI is only available to first responders (AIM III). Usability: A NIDA study illustrated that Naloxone is often administered by untrained bystanders under extreme stress - which studies show leads to accidents, missed doses and tragic consequences.[3] Existing solutions have usability drawbacks (e.g., failure to deliver full dose, needle stick injuries, etc.) that can lead to a general fear and anxiety around using the devices. Effectiveness: The emergence of synthetic opioids (e.g., fentanyl and carfentanyl), which comprise most of the non-regulated drug market, requires improved efficacy.[5]–[7] Intramuscular (IM) administration shows a marked improvement in efficacy (2X) over intranasal due to the absorption rate and half-life in the patient's system. IM administration also requires less frequent follow-up doses (which may also help with availability). The superiority of IM administration makes it ideal for more rural settings where the opioid epidemic is most prolific.[4] Pirouette’s Solution: Pirouette Medical is developing a novel, low-profile, disc shaped auto-injector that can be used to deliver Naloxone HCl Injection, USP intramuscularly safely and intuitively. Pirouette’s NAI, REZQGO, focuses on affordability, portability, and usability. The intuitive design allows individuals with limited or no training to easily administer an injection to themselves or others. REZQGO has controlled steps to administer a dose rapidly, while minimizing the risk of accidental injections, lacerations, and needle sticks. Pirouette’s NAI aims to reduce the stress and anxiety surrounding injections through a better device, at an affordable price. As part of the Phase I SBIR parent award, Pirouette is rigorously verifying the design and usability of non-GMP prototypes of REZQGO. Based on preliminary research, interview feedback, and FDA guidance, Pirouette is initially pursuing two dose strengths: 2mg/0.4mL and 10mg/0.4mL. The 2mg dose was chosen specifically for a Direct to OTC pathway per the FDA's Overdose Prevention Framework (Docket No. FDA-2022-N-2673). The 10mg dose was selected based on the relevant FDA Product Specific Guidance (PSG# 215457). I-Corp Benefits: Pirouette’s parent award originally proposed a 5mg dose, and we still believe there is an opportunity for a third dose strength in between the currently proposed 2mg (OTC) and 10mg (Rx) doses. Conversations with several Emergency Medical Service (EMS) personnel have confirmed this need for a more potent IM initial dose in the 4-5mg range. Pirouette intends to research product-market fit as part of the I Corps program for this subsequent user need and resulting product (AIM II). To that end, Pirouette selected a diverse team of professionals with experience in project management, emergency management, regulatory, new product introduction, and commercialization. Pirouette has submitted two Pre-IND meeting requests to the FDA, one for the 2mg dose (IND#169211), and one for the 10mg dose (IND# 169426). Pirouette anticipates the meetings to be completed by mid-January 2024. The feedback directly from the FDA will also help inform Pirouette’s research in the I-Corps program to select a third dose in the product lineup, giving users another option in their fight to save lives in the Opioid Public Health Emergency. I-Corps will assist Pirouette in market research, regulatory planning, pricing / reimbursement strategy, usability, and the commercialization / GMP implementation of the REZQGO product lineup.",78989411 (contact),"CULLINANE, CONOR R (contact)","KOSTOV, YORDAN VALTCHOV",2024-02-01,2024-07-31,absorption;Accidents;Adoption;American;Anxiety;carfentanil;Central Nervous System;commercialization;Communication;Communities;Contracts;cost;Data;design;design verification;Devices;Dose;drug market;Effectiveness;Emergency medical service;Emergency Situation;Ensure;experience;Failure;Family member;Feedback;Fentanyl;fighting;first responder;follow-up;Fright;Funding;Future;Government;Half-Life;Hand;Harm Reduction;Health Personnel;Health Professional;Hospitalization;Human Resources;improved;Individual;Injections;Innovation Corps;insight;interest;Interview;Intramuscular;Intranasal Administration;Intuition;Journals;Laceration;Life;manufacturing cost;Market Research;Marketing;Measures;Medical;Medicare/Medicaid;meetings;Mental Depression;Mentorship;Naloxone;naloxone dosing;National Institute of Drug Abuse;Needlestick Injuries;novel;Opiate Addiction;Opioid;opioid abuse;Opioid Antagonist;opioid epidemic;opioid mortality;opioid overdose;Overdose;overdose prevention;Overdose reversal;parent project;Parents;Pathway interactions;Patients;Persons;Phase;portability;pre-Investigational New Drug meeting;Predisposition;Price;Privatization;programs;prototype;public health emergency;Research;respiratory;risk minimization;rural setting;Sample Size;Shapes;Small Business Innovation Research Grant;Stress;stress reduction;Surveys;Symptoms;synthetic opioid;System;Training;usability,"A Rugged, Reliable, Portable, Safe, and Simple Naloxone HCl Auto-Injector forLife-Saving Treatment of Opioid Overdose",59474,NA,NA,NA,S1,1,55000,0,55000,NA
