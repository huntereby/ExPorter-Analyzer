One aim of this continuing program of research is to provide the first rigorous test of our hypothesis that maltreated and non-maltreated individuals with substance used disorders have distinctly different neurobiological signatures, and that maltreatment and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder represent two distinctly different pathways to substance use, with far reaching implications for prevention, treatment and discovery.

In partnership with five community-based organizations that focus on mental health, legal, education, and youth issues with Latinx immigrants and African refugees, we will also be able to examine the effects of people’s involvement with community-based organizations and local and state policy changes on their mental health, economic stability, stressors, and social support. This is important not only for Latinx and Black populations and the large number of immigrants and refugees in the United States and worldwide, but also because the intervention model and what we learn from this study have the potential to alleviate mental health disparities experienced by other marginalized populations who face unequal access to social and material resources, disproportionate exposure to trauma and stress, and worse consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.",6431785 (contact),"GOODKIND, JESSICA R (contact)","ROONEY, MARY",2021-08-16,2026-07-31,Address;adverse outcome;Advocacy;Affect;African;Awareness;barrier to care;behavioral economics;Black Populations;Black race;Collaborations;Communities;community based participatory research;community engagement;community organizations;comparison group;comparison intervention;Complex;Control Groups;COVID-19;COVID-19 incidence;COVID-19 pandemic effects;COVID-19 prognosis;cultural health;Data;design;Disasters;Discrimination;Disparate;Disparity;disparity reduction;economic impact;Economics;Education;Effectiveness of Interventions;effectiveness testing;Enrollment;Essential worker;experience;Exposure to;Family;Financial Hardship;food insecurity;Goals;Grief reaction;Health;health care availability;health disparity;health economics;Health Insurance;health service use;Housing;Immigrant;Immigration;improved;Individual;Inequity;innovation;Insurance Coverage;Intervention;intervention effect;Interview;Language;Latinx;Latinx population;Learning;Legal;Low income;marginalized population;Mediating;Mental Health;Mental Health Services;Methods;Modeling;mutual learning;Occupations;outcome disparities;pandemic disease;pandemic impact;Participant;Pathway interactions;peer;Personal Satisfaction;Persons;physical conditioning;Policies;primary outcome;Probability Samples;protective factors;psychological distress;Randomized;recruit;Refugees;Research;Research Design;research study;Resources;response;Sampling;Science;secondary outcome;Site;social;Social Change;social determinants;Social support;socioeconomics;Stress;stressor;System;Testing;Time;trauma exposure;treatment as usual;United States;university student;Waiting Lists;Work;Youth,Multilevel Community-Based Mental Health Intervention to Address Structural Inequities and Adverse Disparate Consequences of COVID-19 Pandemic on Latinx Immigrants and African Refugees,127733,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-HDM-H(58)R],NA,NA,4,803703,337411,1141114,NA

The findings of these investigations may lead to a new approach in treating a subset (~30%) of the essential hypertension population (Black LSD1 risk allele hypertensives) and have the potential to reduce Black- White disparities in health outcomes secondary to poor blood pressure control.,15104338 (contact),"HAAS, ANDREA  (contact)","WEBB, STEPHANIE JOHNSON",2021-09-01,2026-09-14,Address;Advisory Committees;Affect;Albumins;Albuminuria;Alleles;Amlodipine;antagonist;Anti-Hypertensive Agents;Basic Science;Biological Assay;Black Populations;Black race;black/white disparity;Blood Pressure;blood pressure control;blood pressure elevation;blood pressure reduction;blood pressure regulation;Calcium Channel;cardiovascular effects;Cardiovascular system;career;Chronic Kidney Failure;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Trials Design;cohort;Collection;comorbidity;Creatinine;Cross-Sectional Studies;Data;Databases;Dedications;Development;Diet;Disease;Doctor of Philosophy;Double-Blind Method;drug efficacy;Endocrinology;Enrollment;Epigenetic Process;eplerenone;Essential Hypertension;Exhibits;Functional disorder;Future;Genes;Genetic Carriers;Genetic Markers;Genetic Polymorphism;Genetic Transcription;Goals;health disparity;Heart Diseases;High Prevalence;Human;Hypertension;hypertension control;hypertensive;hypertensives;improved;Individual;Injury to Kidney;International;Investigation;KDM1A gene;Kidney;Knowledge;Learning;Longitudinal Studies;Mediating;Mentors;Mentorship;Methodology;Mineralocorticoid Receptor;Mus;novel strategies;Outcome;Outpatients;Participant;patient oriented;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physicians;Physiological;Physiology;Population;pre-clinical;precision medicine;Prevalence;primary outcome;Public Health Schools;Randomized;rat KIM-1 protein;Regulator Genes;renal damage;Research;Research Personnel;Research Proposals;Risk;risk variant;Role;Running;salt sensitive;Sampling;secondary outcome;Secondary to;side effect;skills;Sodium;Statistical Data Interpretation;statistics;Stroke;Techniques;Testing;tool;Training;Translational Research;treatment program;Tubular formation;United States;urinary;Urine;Variant;Visit;Wild Type Mouse;Work,Role of LSD1 in Hypertension and Renal Injury in Blacks,155076,MPOR,NHLBI Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Study Section[MPOR(MA)],NA,NA,4,178670,13962,192632,NA

We identified metabolic hubs that are selectively up-regulated in both treatment naïve and chemoresistant SCLC and showed that combined pharmacological inhibition or genetic loss of MCT lactate transporters and the PFKFB3 glycolytic enzyme provokes SCLC metabolic collapse, growth arrest and cell death. Using new and established mouse models of SCLC, patient-derived SCLC tumors and circulating tumor cells from SCLC patients, Project #3 will assess the roles of MCT transporters and PFKFB3 in controlling the metabolism, development and maintenance of SCLC, will test if co-targeting MCT and PFKFB3 delays or eliminates emergence of resistant disease, alone or when combined with standard-of-care chemotherapy, and will identify additional metabolic vulnerabilities of SCLC.",1877243 (contact),"CLEVELAND, JOHN L.

Epigenetic regulation of the CCK receptor will be studied and cross-talk with chemokine receptors. Several murine models of liver injury and a transgenic CCK-BR-knockout mouse model will be used to investigate whether stem cells or liver progenitor cells express the CCK-BR and if a CCK-receptor antagonist can decrease the risk of HCC.,15181457 (contact),"GAY, MARTHA  (contact)","VAHEDI, SHAHROOZ",2021-09-01,2026-08-31,Address;antagonist;Applications Grants;Biochemical;Biology;Body Weight decreased;Budgets;cancer cell;cancer risk;carcinogenesis;career;career development;CCKBR gene;Cells;chemokine receptor;Cholecystokinin;Cholecystokinin B Receptor;Cholecystokinin Receptor;Choline Deficiency;Cirrhosis;Collagen;CRISPR/Cas technology;cytokine;Development;Development Plans;Diet;dietary;Dietary Fats;effective therapy;Engineering;Epidemic;Epigenetic Process;epigenetic regulation;epigenomics;Ethionine;experience;Fibroblasts;Fibrosis;Functional disorder;G-Protein-Coupled Receptors;Gastrins;gastrointestinal;Gastrointestinal tract structure;Goals;graduate student;Growth;Hepatic;Hepatic Stellate Cell;Hepatocarcinogenesis;Hepatology;Histologic;Histology;Human;human tissue;Immunologist;Immunology;In Vitro;in vitro testing;in vivo;Inflammation;Inflammatory;innovation;Knock-out;Knockout Mice;Ligands;Liver;Liver Fibrosis;liver inflammation;liver injury;Liver Stem Cell;Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract;Malignant neoplasm of liver;Malignant Neoplasms;Manuscripts;Mediating;Mediator;Mentors;Methodology;MicroRNAs;Modeling;mouse model;Mus;Neoplasm Metastasis;non-alcoholic fatty liver disease;nonalcoholic steatohepatitis;novel;nutrition;Organoids;overexpression;Pathway interactions;Patients;Penetration;Peptic Ulcer;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physiological;Preparation;prevent;Prevention;Primary carcinoma of the liver cells;Proglumide;Proliferating;protein expression;Proteins;Publications;receptor;Receptor Activation;receptor expression;Research;Research Personnel;response;Risk;RNA;Role;saturated fat;Scientist;stellate cell;stem cell population;stem cells;subcutaneous;symposium;System;Testing;Therapeutic Agents;timeline;Tissue Microarray;Tissues;Training;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing;Transgenic Mice;Transgenic Organisms;tumor;tumor growth;undergraduate student;United States;Vitamin E;Work,Role of cholecystokinin receptor in hepatocellular cancer,255572,NCI,Career Development Study Section (J)[NCI-J],NA,NA,4,150897,12072,162969,NA

The shifts in medical use of prescription drugs have important implications for the etiology of nonmedical prescription drug misuse and associated consequences; however, there has been relatively little consideration of the developmental relationships between the initiation and discontinuation of medical use of prescription medications and subsequent substance-related adverse consequences (eg, drug overdose deaths, all-cause mortality, substance use disorder symptoms) within the same individuals.

In recent years, great progress has been made in understanding how cancer develops and progresses. Ever more sophisticated and elegant models of human cancer have been developed for most types of cancer, and we understand in great detail the molecular and cellular changes that promote disease development. Collectively, these advances are improving both the quality of life and overall survival of cancer patients. Yet despite these advances, huge challenges remain. While “targeted” therapies can result in dramatic clinical response, these are typically transient, necessitating that we understand resistance to develop rational drug combinations. Immune-based therapies have led to remarkable responses-including cures—in select patients, but the side effects of these therapies can be substantial and most cancers remain refractory to current agents. To stimulate innovation and cross- disciplinary interactions in this rapidly advancing field, we propose to convene a group of outstanding basic and clinical researchers studying the development and progression of cancer in a variety of model systems, in an international meeting entitled Mechanisms and Models of Cancer at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in August 2024.",7039607 (contact),"STEWART, DAVID J.

One hallmark of PDAC is the dense stroma consisting of activated cancer fibroblasts that surround each tumor, however, the role of these l cells in supporting tumor growth and cancer cachexia is controversial, and major gaps in knowledge exist regarding their contribution to cancer progression and cachexia.

The momentum created by this strategy would provide significant incentive for junior investigators at these sites to take advantage of pilot research funding opportunities while consolidating efforts to pursue career development within a supportive environment with highly experienced mentors, ensuring their long-term success as independent researchers that will meet the critical need for transdisciplinary, multi-institutional, and international partnerships to understand and potentially mitigate the rapidly growing cancer burden in Africa, where the prevalence of HIV infection remains high.",10996569 (contact),"BOROK, MARGARET ZIONA (contact)",NA,2023-08-03,2028-07-31,Africa;African;AIDS related cancer;anti-cancer research;Area;Award;Cancer Burden;cancer education;career;career development;Country;course development;design;Development;Discipline;Education;education research;education resources;Educational workshop;Ensure;experience;Fostering;Funding;Funding Opportunities;Germany;Goals;Grant;HIV;HIV Infections;Immune;improved;Incentives;infection related cancer;innovation;Institution;interest;International;international partnership;Journals;Knowledge;Lead;lectures;low and middle-income countries;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;meetings;Mentors;Oncology;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Peer Review;Persons;Prevalence;Prevention;Process;Process Measure;programs;protocol development;Public Health;Publications;Questionnaires;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Scientist;Senior Scientist;Site;skills;South Africa;success;supportive environment;Training;Training Activity;Training and Education;United States;Viral;virtual platform;Zimbabwe,Developmental & Career Enhancement Core,277834,ZCA1,ZCA1-TCRB-D,7329,NA,2,105110,72000,NA,177110

Timely administration of appropriate antimicrobials is critical for successfully patient outcomes. However, current diagnostics for identifying and characterizing the infection, necessary for selection of the appropriate antimicrobial, rely on blood culture and require several days to provide results. As a consequence, physicians have to rely on empirical treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics, which may be ineffective to the patient’s infection, exposes patients to the risk of complications, and exemplifies poor antibiotic stewardship. The efforts described in this proposed Phase II program will advance the maturity of a novel, fully automated test capable of characterizing clinically important resistance mechanisms in bloodstream infections in only a few hours and without cultures.

This is particularly relevant to individuals with amblyopia whose depth perception is compromised because of an impaired ability to combine information from the two eyes. This proposal examines the basis for impaired depth and vision in the central visual field and examines the ability of the peripheral visual field to mediate depth information in amblyopia. These studies have implications for clinical tests that assess depth perception as well as training techniques to improve depth perception in amblyopia.,2092563 (contact),"VERGHESE, PREETI  (contact)","ARAJ, HOUMAM H",2022-09-01,2026-06-30,Affect;Amblyopia;Anisometropia;Area;Behavioral;Blindness;central visual field;Classification;Clinic;Clinical;Contrast Sensitivity;Cues;Data;density;Depth Perception;Development;Disparity;Electroencephalography;Electrophysiology (science);Environment;experience;extrastriate;Eye;eye hand coordination;Eye Movements;fovea centralis;Frequencies;Heterogeneity;Image;Impairment;improved;Individual;Lazy Eyes;Life;Location;Maps;Measurable;Measures;Mediating;Methods;Monitor;Monkeys;monocular;Movement;neural;neurodevelopment;novel;Participant;Perimetry;Peripheral;Physiological;Population;Procedures;Protocols documentation;Psychophysics;public health relevance;receptive field;recruit;Refractive Errors;Residual state;Resolution;response;Retina;sample fixation;Sampling;Signal Transduction;Source;source localization;Stimulus;Strabismus;Testing;Training;Training Technics;V1 neuron;Vision;Visual;Visual Acuity;Visual Cortex Disorder;Visual evoked cortical potential;Visual Fields,Stereopsis and Suppression in Strabismus and Amblyopia,34370,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-IFCN-S(02)M],NA,NA,3,295880,109808,405688,NA

The combination of novel multilevel RD and resiliency measures and robust phenotypic PrEP biomarker data, in addition to the study population and location, represents a significant advancement in HIV prevention and has the potential to increase the number of Black SMM who initiate and adhere to PrEP and ultimately reduce HIV incidence, which aligns with the federal plan to End the HIV Epidemic by 2030, the National HIV/AIDS Strategy and funding priorities of the NIH.",8834782 (contact),"HICKSON, DEMARC A (contact)","STIRRATT, MICHAEL J",2022-09-08,2027-06-30,Adherence;AIDS prevention;Awareness;Biological;Biological Markers;black men;black men who have sex with men;Black race;Blood;Buffers;cardiovascular health;Caring;Cities;Cohort Studies;Collection;Communities;community academic partnership;Conscious;Data;Deep South;Development;Diagnosis;Discrimination;Economic Factors;Environmental Risk Factor;Epidemic;Epidemiology;experience;Failure;Focus Groups;follow-up;Funding;Future;Geography;Health;health care settings;health inequalities;Health system;Healthcare;HIV;HIV diagnosis;HIV disparities;HIV Seronegativity;HIV/AIDS;Homophobia;Homosexuality;Human immunodeficiency virus test;Hydrocortisone;Incidence;Individual;Inequity;innovation;insight;interest;Intervention;Knowledge;Life;Link;Location;male health;Maps;Measurement;Measures;Medical;men who have sex with men;men&apos;s group;Methodology;Methods;Minority;minority stress;minority stressor;Modeling;multidisciplinary;multilevel analysis;National Institute of Mental Health;National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities;Neighborhoods;novel;Outcome;Participant;Pathway interactions;Patient Self-Report;perceived discrimination;Perception;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Phenotype;Political Factor;Population;pre-exposure prophylaxis;prevention service;Prevention strategy;prospective;Public Health;Race;racism;recruit;Religiosity;Research;resilience;resilience factor;Risk Behaviors;Role;Sampling;self esteem;Sexual Health;sexual minority community;sexual minority men;sexual minority status;Sexually Transmitted Diseases;Site;social;Social Adjustment;social factors;social stigma;social structure;Social support;Southeastern United States;Spirituality;Stress;Stressful Event;stressor;Structural Racism;study population;success;Surveys;Techniques;Testing;theories;Time;trait;trend;United States;United States National Institutes of Health;uptake;Washington,Multilevel Racism & Discrimination and PrEP Outcomes Among Black SMM in the Southeastern U.S.,130166,ZMD1,ZMD1-KNL(J1),NA,NA,3,505786,95408,601194,NA
