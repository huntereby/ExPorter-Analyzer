Discovering more effective treatments is difficult due to our limited understanding of the brain. DART (Drug Acutely Restricted by Tethering) has shown potential in addressing this issue by enabling targeted drug delivery to specific brain cells in behaving animals. The DART.2 evolution has further bolstered this potential, offering an unprecedented thousandfold cellular specificity (Shields, et. al., 2022). With the development of DART.3, we aim to make another leap forward, potentially transforming how we approach treatments for these illnesses.

However, like other natural products, cannabis is not a single chemical entity, but rather contains over 100 phytocannabinoids as well as over 500 other identified chemicals, including the terpenoids that give cannabis its distinctive flavoring and aroma. Recently, we have secured access to purified minor cannabinoids synthesized via a patented biosynthetic process in quantities that allow for preclinical in vivo testing. The goal of the proposed project is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of these compounds alone, and in planned combinations, to determine their potential efficacy as analgesics.

There is currently an unmet clinical need for developing companion diagnostic solutions using routine clinical MRIs that can reliably (a) identify Veteran GBM patients who will or will not respond to conventional chemoradiation, and (b) differentiate benign treatment changes from tumor recurrence. We propose to develop Neuro-image risk classifier (NeuRisC), which when successfully deployed will pave the way for improving quality- of-life in Veteran GBM patients by (a) decreasing financial and therapeutic toxicity associated with chemotherapy, while (b) alleviating anxiety and unnecessary biopsies in patients with benign treatment changes.",11266688 (contact),"TIWARI, PALLAVI  (contact)",NA,2023-07-01,2028-03-31,Adjuvant;Adjuvant Chemotherapy;Adoption;Aftercare;Anatomy;Anxiety;Appearance;Artificial Intelligence;Award;Benign;Biological;Biophysics;Biopsy;Brain;brain magnetic resonance imaging;Brain Neoplasms;brain parenchyma;Cells;Characteristics;chemoradiation;chemotherapy;Clinical;Clinical assessments;Clinical Trials;clinically actionable;cohort;Combination Drug Therapy;Combined Modality Therapy;comorbidity;companion diagnostics;conventional therapy;cost;Coupled;Data;deep learning;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;diagnostic tool;Discrimination;Disease;Disease Progression;Entropy;Excision;Exposure to;financial toxicity;follow-up;Gadolinium;Genomics;Glioblastoma;Glioma;Gulf War veteran;Healthcare Systems;Heterogeneity;high risk;Histologic;Histology;Human;Image;imaging biomarker;improved;innovation;Institution;Intervention;Ionizing radiation;Iraq;Lesion;Link;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Malignant neoplasm of brain;Malignant Neoplasms;Maps;Measurement;Medical center;Methylation;MGMT gene;Molecular;Morbidity - disease rate;Morphology;mortality;MRI Scans;nerve agent;Nervous System Disorder;neuroimaging;Neurologic;Ohio;Oncologist;Operative Surgical Procedures;Pathway interactions;Patient Selection;Patients;Pattern;Perfusion;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacotherapy;Phenotype;Play;Population;predictive marker;prognostic;promoter;Quality of life;Radiation;radiation effect;Radiation therapy;radiologist;radiomics;Reader;Reading;Recurrent tumor;Refractory;Resistance;Resort;responders and non-responders;response biomarker;Risk;Role;Scanning;segregation;Shapes;side effect;Site;standard of care;success;Surface;Survival Rate;Tennessee;Texture;Time Management;Tissues;treatment effect;treatment response;Treatment-related toxicity;tumor;Tumor Biology;tumor microenvironment;Unnecessary Surgery;Validation;Vasodilation;Veterans;Visual;War;Work,Artificial Intelligence-based decision support for chemotherapy-response assessment in Brain Tumors,5842,ZRD1,ZRD1-ONCB-A(01)1,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA

Thus, the prognosis for this stage of ALD is worse than many common types of cancer, such as breast, prostate and colon. Unfortunately, there is no FDA-approved therapy for any stage of ALD, and this makes the need for this proposed research even more compelling. The proposed studies will help to better understand the molecular mechanisms of alcohol-induced liver and intestinal injury, including alcohol-diet interactions, which may lead to identification of new therapeutic targets and potential dietary interventions for treating ALD, as well as help to explain why only some heavy drinkers develop clinically important ALD.",1902075 (contact),"MCCLAIN, CRAIG J.

The ADRC is led by 3 principal investigators: Chui, Zlokovic, and Toga and comprised of 6 required cores, the required Research Education Component (REC), and 1 optional imaging core. The Administration Core provides administrative and scientific oversight across the ADRC, including fostering development projects and supporting ADRC-affiliated studies. The Clinical Core performs standardized evaluations and diagnoses using a standardized database, enrolls and follows participants in the Vascular Cohort Study (VCS) and Brain Research Study (BRS). The Data Management and Statistical Core provides study- and core-specific databases and curates our large imaging data sets as a local and national resource. The Neuropathology Core performs standardized neuropathological examinations, stores and distributes biological tissues to research investigators. The Outreach, Recruitment, and Engagement Core works closely with the Clinical Core to recruit and retain participants in VCS and BRS, especially those from under-represented minority groups, and the development of a participant-caregiver dyad database. The Biomarker Core uses state of the art methods to determine cell-and system-specific biomarkers related to the neurovascular unit, as well as to measure standard AD biomarkers. The Imaging Core provides high field (3T and 7T) MR imaging, as well as amyloid/tau PET scans. The Research Education Component is dedicated to mentoring post-doctoral students committed to the study of under- represented minority issues in Alzheimer disease and related disorders.

We plan to prospectively assess the use of a novel cardiac pacing method with a lead placed in the left bundle branch area (LBBAP) in Veterans with HFrEF whom have been identified as CRT non-responders, and to measure cardiac function using CMR in addition to traditional echocardiography. We expect that LBBAP will result in significant improvement in cardiac function versus continued CRT, and that CMR will be an accurate and feasible method to assess cardiac function in these patients with cardiac devices.

The COVID-19 pandemic also broadly impacted HAI prevention, and increases in some HAI rates have been observed during the pandemic. There is now an urgent need to assess how the implementation of HAI prevention practices was impacted in order to 1) develop strategies to support the resumption of effective practices and 2) identify practices needing future analysis to develop implementation strategies that will maximize effectiveness while minimizing provider burden.

Testosterone (T) plays a significant role in brain health and ANS reflex function in non-neurologically impaired men. However, little is known about the relationships between T, nerve function, and ANS dysfunction after SCI. Interestingly, up to 60% of men with SCI exhibit persistently low T concentrations, which may worsen nerve and ANS dysfunction. In uninjured eugonadal people, a single pharmacologic dose of intranasal T has been shown to quickly improve nerve function, but no study has evaluated if T administration alters nerve and ANS function in men with SCI. Herein, we will conduct the first study to assess the relationships between circulating T and motor and ANS function in male Veterans with SCI. We will also conduct a pilot study in a subset of men with SCI and low T, to test how a single dose of intranasal T impacts motor and ANS function in this population.",78635683 (contact),"GOLDSMITH, JACOB ALLEN (contact)",NA,2024-04-01,2026-03-31,Acute;Affect;Albumins;Androgen Receptor;Androgens;Animal Experimentation;Animal Model;Autonomic nervous system;Binding;Biological;Biological Availability;Blood Pressure;Body Composition;Book Chapters;Brain;brain health;cardiometabolism;cardiovascular disorder risk;cardiovascular health;Cardiovascular Physiology;Cardiovascular system;career;career development;Central Nervous System;Cervical;Chronic;Circulation;Clinical Research;cohort;Data;design;Development;Dissociation;Dose;effective therapy;efficacy evaluation;Electric Stimulation;Electromyography;Energy Metabolism;Exhibits;Face;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Feasibility Studies;Fellowship;Fertility;Formulation;Fostering;Functional disorder;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Hand;hands on research;Health;Heart;Heart Rate;High Prevalence;Hour;Human;Hypogonadism;Impaired health;Impairment;improved;Injury;Learning;Literature;Maintenance;male;Measures;Medical center;men;Mentors;Mentorship;Methods;Modification;Motor;motor control;Movement;Muscle;Muscle Weakness;Myelin;Natural regeneration;Nerve;Nervous System Physiology;neural;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neuronal Plasticity;neurophysiology;Neurophysiology - biologic function;neuroprotection;neuroregulation;Neurostimulation procedures of spinal cord tissue;neurotrophic factor;non-genomic;novel;Output;Persons;pharmacologic;Phase;Physiologic pulse;Physiological;Pilot Projects;Placebos;Play;Population;Postdoctoral Fellow;premature;Publications;Publishing;Quality of life;receptor;recruit;Reflex action;Research;Research Training;response;Risk;Role;Safety;Scientist;Sensorimotor functions;Severities;Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin;Signal Transduction;skills;Spinal Cord;Spinal cord injury;symposium;Symptoms;systemic inflammatory response;Testing;Testosterone;testosterone replacement therapy;Therapeutic;Thinness;Tissues;tool;Transcranial magnetic stimulation;Veterans;Virginia;welfare;Work,The Role of Androgens in Neurophysiological and Autonomic Function in Male Veterans with Spinal Cord Injury,5028,RRD8,Career Development Program - Panel I[RRD8],NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is the second leading cause of cancer death in American male Veterans, and the number one cause of cancer-specific death amongst non-smoker Veterans. In addition to death, the treatments for prostate cancer have frequent and predictable detrimental impacts on Veterans’ quality of life.

More than half of the 6.5 million Americans currently living with ADRD are undiagnosed. Lack of a diagnosis can result in delayed access to treatment, poor care management, unnecessary hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits, difficulty managing other chronic conditions, inability to participate in planning for future care, risky behaviors such as driving, and delayed access to caregiver support. Studies also have shown that healthcare costs for people with ADRD are three times higher than those without ADRD. For this reason, health plans are reimbursed by Medicare at a higher rate for patients diagnosed with ADRD. Multiple principal investigator (PI) Dr. Deborah Barnes and colleagues have developed and validated a novel algorithm called eRADAR (electronic health record [EHR] Risk of Alzheimer’s and Dementia Assessment Rule) that uses EHR data to identify patients at risk of having undiagnosed dementia with high accuracy. They have externally validated eRADAR in two healthcare systems, including confirming that the algorithm works well over time and in different race and ethnic groups. A limitation of eRADAR, however, is that it was designed as a static tool, and it does not learn from or adapt to new data streams. Many organizations that are interested in improving dementia detection, such as Medicare Advantage plans, have access to insurance claims data rather than EHR data. As part of Phase I proof-of-concept work for this grant, we created RADAR (Risk of Alzheimer’s and Dementia AlgoRithm), which uses Medicare claims data rather than EHR data to calculate a risk score for undiagnosed dementia that is similar to eRADAR. The primary goals of this SBIR Direct Phase II are to: 1) Retrospectively assess the accuracy of RADAR to detect undiagnosed dementia using historical Medicare claims data; 2) Develop an adaptive process using machine learning techniques to identify optimal RADAR predictor sets based on data inputs; and 3) Determine the optimal strategy for sharing RADAR’s output with clients interested in improving dementia detection and diagnosis. Together Senior Health’s mission is to serve people living with memory loss, cognitive decline and ADRD by providing evidence-based, online programming. Our current products include Moving TogetherTM–a mind-body group movement program for people with mild ADRD and care partners—and Brain Health Together, which combines Moving Together with brain health coaching to address modifiable risk factors. Our current clients include Medicare Advantage plans, home health agencies, and ADRD care centers. Adding RADAR to our product line will enable us to better support our business clients while also expanding access to our services and improving quality of life for people living with ADRD and those who care for them.",6155776;11185308 (contact),"BARNES, DEBORAH E.;BENJAMIN, CYNTHIA LOUISE (contact)","HARRELL, ERIN",2023-06-15,2025-02-28,absorption;Address;Algorithms;Alzheimer&apos;s disease diagnosis;Alzheimer&apos;s disease related dementia;Alzheimer&apos;s disease risk;American;Appointment;Area Under Curve;Automobile Driving;brain health;Businesses;care costs;Caregiver support;Caring;Chronic;Client;cohort;commercialization;comorbidity;cost;Data;Data Set;Data Sources;data streams;Dementia;dementia care;dementia risk;design;Detection;Diagnosis;Disease;Early identification;eHealth;electronic health data;Electronic Health Record;Emergency department visit;Ethnic Population;evidence base;Face;flexibility;follow-up;Future;Goals;Grant;Health;Health Care Costs;Health Insurance;health plan;Health Policy;Health Services Accessibility;Healthcare;Healthcare Systems;high risk;Home Health Agency;Hospitalization;human centered design;Impaired cognition;improved;insurance claims;interest;Learning;Machine Learning;Managed Care;Marketing;Medicare;Medicare claim;member;Memory Loss;Methods;mind/body;Mission;Modeling;modifiable risk;Movement;novel;Output;Patient Care;Patient risk;patient stratification;Patients;Persons;Phase;prediction algorithm;Predictive Value;Preparation;primary care patient;Principal Investigator;Process;prognostic algorithm;programs;prototype;Provider;Publishing;Quality of Care;Quality of life;racial population;Research Technics;response;Risk;Risk Behaviors;Risk Factors;risk sharing;risk stratification;Sampling;Services;Small Business Innovation Research Grant;Specificity;Techniques;Testing;Time;tool;Update;Work,A Novel Algorithm to Identify People with Undiagnosed Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias,82605,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-HSS-J(10)B],NA,NA,2,676939,211348,948690,NA

Our recent studies have shown that in IPF lungs, a unique type of protein oxidation occurs which involves attachment of glutathione to proteins (termed glutathionylation). We also showed that treatment of fibrotic mouse lung with the protein oxidation repair enzyme, glutaredoxin, reversed existing pulmonary fibrosis. Most recently we discovered that collagen, which makes up scar tissue, can be glutathionylated and this not only makes it resistant to normal degradation processes but also activates myofibroblasts, which are collagen- producing cells, thereby creating a potentially fibrosis-progressive scenario. In this project we examine how collagen glutathionylation occurs and how it activates myofibroblasts. We will study whether this process is disturbed in aged lung and if this is reversible by glutaredoxin. Given that we have developed pure glutaredoxin preparations, completion of the studies may have potential impact for the treatment of persistent fibrosis in aged lungs.",1867322 (contact),"JANSSEN-HEININGER, YVONNE M.

The gustatory cortex has been extensively studied for its involvement in taste perception and expectation, and for its role in mediating taste- related behaviors, decisions and learning. Recent data show that cortical responses to taste, anticipatory cues and spontaneous activity are affected by hunger and thirst. Yet, the nature and the function of these interoceptive homeostatic signals in the cortex is poorly understood. Here we propose to address this gap, focusing on a population of gustatory cortical neurons expressing gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), a feeding-suppressing peptide. Neurons containing GRP are ideal candidates to integrate gustatory perception, expectation and interoception, and drive behavior through release of GRP.  We will combine anatomical and electrophysiological analyses, cellular imaging and manipulations of neural activity to unveil the organization and function of GRP in the circuit involving the gustatory cortex and the basolateral amygdala. The results of this research will advance our understanding of the neural basis of taste- based consumption and help us revise existing models of the function of the gustatory cortex.

Here we test the previously unstudied role of oxidized phospholipids (oxPLs) and oxylipins in mediating mechanisms of atrophy induced by loss of innervation to increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying muscle loss and weakness that is critical for identifying therapeutic targets with maximum effectiveness.",2097336 (contact),"VAN REMMEN, HOLLY  (contact)","BOYCE, AMANDA T",2022-09-30,2027-05-31,Affect;Age;age related;age-related muscle loss;Aging;Arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase;Arachidonic Acids;Atrophic;Autophagocytosis;Cell Death;Cells;Data;Degradation Pathway;Denervation;design;Development;Diameter;Drug Metabolic Detoxication;effective intervention;Effectiveness;Elderly;Enzymes;experimental study;falls;frailty;Generations;Goals;healthspan;improved;In Vitro;in vivo;Individual;inhibitor;insight;Intervention;intervention effect;Knockout Mice;Link;lipid mediator;Lipid Peroxides;Measures;Mediating;Mediator;Membrane;Mitochondria;Mobility decline;Modeling;Mus;Muscle;Muscle Cells;Muscle Fibers;muscle form;Muscle function;muscle metabolism;Muscle Mitochondria;Muscle Weakness;Muscular Atrophy;nerve supply;novel;oxidation;oxidative damage;oxidized lipid;Pathway interactions;Pattern;pharmacologic;Phospholipase A2;Phospholipids;Population;prevent;Production;protective effect;protein degradation;proteostasis;Public Health;Publishing;Quality of life;response;Risk;Role;sarcopenia;successful intervention;Testing;therapeutic target;Wild Type Mouse;Work,A novel role for oxidized lipid mediators as effectors of muscle atrophy and weakness in aging,77812,SMEP,Skeletal Muscle and Exercise Physiology Study Section[SMEP],NA,NA,3,330117,216808,546925,NA
