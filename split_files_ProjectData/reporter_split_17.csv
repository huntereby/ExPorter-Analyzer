These recalls have occurred too late, spurred only by adverse event reports after patients suffered consequences such as inappropriate shocks and even death. There is no surveillance system to identify failing CIED leads. Through this research, population-level analyses will be conducted to identify CIED lead models with the lowest failure risk; these data will inform an intervention to support VA physicians in implanting the safest leads in Veterans. This research will also create a system to predict which lead(s) currently implanted in individual Veterans are at risk for early failure, thereby informing strategies to mitigate risk.

The PRAMS survey provides a unique source of data on the behaviors and experiences of women before, during and just after delivery that is not available from any other source at the state level. This purpose of this proposal is to continue the PRAMs survey in Washington State. Approximately 2,000 Washington resident mothers per year are drawn from birth certificate data using a stratified random selection based on race/ethnicity. With a response rate of 55%, we are expecting that 1,100 women will participate in the survey. The data collection method for Washington PRAMS will involves a statewide mailing of the questionnaire with either a telephone or web-based survey as follow-up for non-responders. Completed surveys are cleaned by CDC, linked to the annual birth certificate file and weighted for non-response, an analytic file is sent to Washington PRAMS. Once Washington State receives the final analytic file from CDC we will analyze, interpret, and disseminate PRAMS data.

We recently found that some tumors cells are in an unusual transcriptional state called the “hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal” (hybrid-EM) state, and these hybrid-EM cells are primarily responsible for invasion and metastasis in HNSCC. Our initial forays investigating how this state is regulated revealed that the genes involved in producing cholesterol also play a role in HNSCC invasion, and we therefore propose to 1) test drugs targeting cholesterol pathways in sophisticated models, 2) find other cholesterol genes that could be targeted to treat HNSCC, and 3) apply the same strategy that we used to identify the cholesterol pathway to find other pathways important in invasion.",7908310;10433943 (contact),"MITRA, ROBI D;PURAM, SIDHARTH VENKATA (contact)","CHEN, ZHONG",2023-03-15,2027-12-31,adverse outcome;Anabolism;attributable mortality;Binding;Bromodomains and extra-terminal domain inhibitor;Cancer Etiology;candidate selection;Cell Line;Cells;chemotherapy;Cholesterol;cholesterol biosynthesis;Cholesterol Homeostasis;Cisplatin;Clinical Trials;CRISPR interference;Data;Disease;drug development;Drug Kinetics;Drug Targeting;drug testing;Enhancers;Epigenetic Process;Epithelium;experimental study;extend lifespan;Fatty Acids;FDA approved;Gene Expression;gene network;gene synthesis;Gene Targeting;Genes;Genetic Transcription;genome-wide analysis;Goals;Head and Neck Cancer;Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma;Human;Hybrids;improved;In Vitro;in vivo;in vivo Model;inhibitor;insight;Invaded;knock-down;Lead;Learning;Length;lymph nodes;Malignant Neoplasms;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Mesenchymal;Metabolic Pathway;Metabolism;metabolomics;mevalonate;Modeling;Molecular;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality;Neoplasm Metastasis;neoplastic cell;Oncology;Operative Surgical Procedures;Organoids;Outcome;oxidation;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Pre-Clinical Model;prevent;Process;Prognosis;protein biomarkers;Proteins;Radiation;Radiation therapy;Recurrence;response;Role;single cell analysis;single cell sequencing;small molecule;small molecule inhibitor;Smoking History;targeted treatment;Technology;Testing;therapeutic target;transcriptome sequencing;Treatment Failure;treatment response;tumor;tumor heterogeneity;tumor xenograft,Deciphering epigenetically-regulated pathways to improve targeted therapy for invasion and metastasis in head and neck cancer,32865,MCTA,Mechanisms of Cancer Therapeutics A Study Section[MCTA],NA,NA,2,381941,211977,593918,NA

APOE4 is also a risk factor for heart disease, and is known to cause fatty plaque build-up in blood vessels, as well as impair blood flow. We propose that impaired blood flow and blood vessel movement caused by APOE4 can affect sleep and interfere with the clearance of waste products from the brain, promoting the brain cell death that causes Alzheimer’s disease. To test this idea, we will measure changes in brain blood vessel size, monitor sleep stages and quality, and assess levels of brain inflammation and cellular waste in a mouse carrying the human APOE4 gene. This study will also test the effects of exercise on these processes, and determine whether exercise can correct the overall changes caused by APOE4.",10746454;7037912;10196090 (contact),"DREW, PATRICK JAMES;GLUCKMAN, BRUCE J;PROCTOR, ELIZABETH A (contact)","NEWMAN, ELIZABETH",2022-07-15,2027-03-31,abeta accumulation;Acceleration;actigraphy;Affect;Age;Aging;Alleles;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Alzheimer&apos;s disease pathology;Alzheimer&apos;s disease risk;Amyloid beta-Protein;Animals;Apolipoprotein E;apolipoprotein E-3;Appearance;Area;Arteries;Atherosclerosis;awake;Behavioral;Binding;Biological Assay;Blood - brain barrier anatomy;Blood brain barrier dysfunction;Blood flow;Blood Vessels;Brain;brain cell;brain tissue;Cause of Death;cerebral artery;cerebrospinal fluid flow;Cerebrovascular Circulation;cerebrovascular health;Cerebrovascular system;cholesterol transporters;Chronic;Cortical vasculature;Custom;cytokine;Darkness;Development;Diameter;Disease;driving force;Electroencephalography;Encephalitis;Event;Exercise;experience;Feedback;Functional disorder;Gene Frequency;Genes;genetic risk factor;Genotype;glymphatic clearance;Heart Diseases;Human;Image;Immune;immune clearance;immunoreactivity;Impairment;improvement on sleep;Individual;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Knock-in Mouse;Late Onset Alzheimer Disease;Light;lipid metabolism;Lipids;Machine Learning;mathematical model;Measures;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolic dysfunction;Metabolic Pathway;metabolomics;Molecular;Molecular Profiling;Monitor;Movement;Mus;neural;Neurobiology;neuroinflammation;neurotoxic;neurovascular;neurovascular coupling;Nitric Oxide;Pathologic;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Pattern;pharmacologic;Phase;Physiological;Physiology;Polysomnography;Population;Preventive therapy;Process;Production;protein aggregation;receptor;Research;response;Risk;Risk Factors;Running;sedentary;Signal Transduction;Sleep;Sleep disturbances;sleep pattern;sleep quality;Sleep Stages;Societies;Staging;Stimulus;Stroke;tau aggregation;tau Proteins;Technical Expertise;Testing;Time;timeline;two-photon;Variant;Vascular Diseases;Vasodilation;Vasodilator Agents;vigilance;Waste Products;wasting;Work,"Impaired Vasoreactivity, Sleep Degradation, and Impaired Clearance in the APOE4 Brain",72513,CDIN,Chronic Dysfunction and Integrative Neurodegeneration Study Section[CDIN],NA,NA,3,488386,289526,777912,NA

The novel forms of media measurement used in this project – including mobile sampling and coding of interactive design affordances – will allow study results to reflect the complex ways in which modern media are used within families’ everyday lives.",11205793 (contact),"RADESKY, JENNY S (contact)","GALLEN, COURTNEY LEIGH",2021-04-19,2026-03-31,2 year old;8 year old;Address;Adoption;Age;Algorithms;American;Articulation;Attention;attentional control;Behavior;Behavior Therapy;Cellular Phone;Child;Child Behavior;Child Development;Child Health;Child Rearing;Code;cognitive process;community advisory board;Complex;computer human interaction;Computers;design;Development;Devices;digital;digital media;Disadvantaged;early childhood;Education;Educational workshop;Emotional;Equation;evidence base;executive function;experience;Family;Frequencies;Guidelines;Habits;handheld mobile device;Home visitation;Hour;Household;Income;Individual;Informal Social Control;Interruption;Interview;Knowledge;Language;Learning;Life;Longitudinal cohort study;lower income families;Measurement;Measures;media use;Mediation;Modeling;Modernization;National Institute of Child Health and Human Development;novel;Nursery Schools;Outcome;Parent-Child Relations;Parents;Pathway interactions;Pediatric Research;Play;Policies;Population;Problem Solving;Psyche structure;Psychosocial Stress;psychosocial stressors;Recommendation;Regulation;Research;Resources;Rewards;Sampling;sex;Shapes;social media;Standardization;Stress;Structure;Surveys;Tablets;Technology;Television;Testing;Time;Toddler;touchscreen;tv watching;Video Recording;virtual,Technology Use and Emerging Executive Functioning in Early Childhood,102370,SPIP,"Social Psychology, Personality and Interpersonal Processes Study Section[SPIP]",NA,NA,4,380283,205586,585869,NA

The data helps us to understand mothers' experiences and behaviors that affect their health and the health of their infants. The long-term goal of the Arkansas Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) survey is to reduce infant mortality and morbidity. The specific objectives of the Arkansas PRAMS program in meeting these goals are the following: 1) Collect population-based data of high scientific quality on topics related to pregnancy and early infancy, 2) Promote the use and increase the visibility of the PRAMS data to encourage translation of the data into programs, policies, or strategies to improve maternal and child health, 3) Analyze and disseminate PRAMS data to inform the healthcare community about behaviors and experiences that affect infant and maternal health, and 4) Provide data and technical assistance to organizations or programs interested in using PRAMS data. Arkansas PRAMS has met these objectives by: 1) Providing non-CDC funding and in-kind personnel to carry out the day-to-day PRAMS operations, including funding to pay contractors for both the telephone surveys and mail survey data entry, 2) Improving mail operations to encourage mothers to complete the survey and increase response rates through various strategies such as increasing incentives, launching a media campaign, and adding a third mail out, 3) Developing and disseminating PRAMS reports (e.g., chart books, surveillance reports) to the health community, 4) Collaborating with internal (e.g., Maternal and Child Health Branch/Arkansas Department of Health) and external programs (e.g., Arkansas March of Dimes, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences) to analyze the PRAMS data for programmatic purposes, and 5) Responding to data requests from and providing technical assistance to a variety of internal and external programs that have a mission related to maternal and child health.",15755353 (contact),"DE GRAFT-JOHNSON, LETITIA  (contact)",NA,2021-05-01,2026-04-30,NA,RFA-DP-21-001 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) Grant,6615,ZDP1,ZDP1-KVA(01),NA,NA,4,NA,NA,150000,NA

The primary hypothesis we will explore is that IA during ART is driven by virus producing cells and/or cells expressing viral antigens that is caused by intracellular concentrations (IC) of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs in LT that do not completely inhibit virus replication which creates a barrier to cure and complete immune reconstitution.,1892439 (contact),"SCHACKER, TIMOTHY W (contact)","LAWRENCE, DIANE M",2020-04-03,2025-03-31,Address;Age;Anatomy;Anti-Retroviral Agents;antibody test;Antigens;antiretroviral therapy;B-Lymphocytes;Biological Assay;C-reactive protein;cardiovascular disorder risk;CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes;cell envelope;Cells;Circulation;Coagulation Process;Collection;comorbidity;Cytomegalovirus;Data;Detection;detection limit;Development;endothelial dysfunction;experience;Fibrin fragment D;Foundations;Frequencies;Future;Gene Expression Profile;Genes;genetic signature;Genetic Transcription;Health;Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte;Herpesviridae;Herpesviridae Infections;high throughput screening;HIV;HIV envelope protein;HIV Infections;HIV Seronegativity;Human Herpesvirus 4;Image Analysis;Immune;immune activation;immune reconstitution;Immune response;Immunologic Stimulation;improved;In Situ Hybridization;Individual;Infection;Interleukin-6;Interruption;Interstitial Nephritis;Investigation;Link;Lymphoid Tissue;Measurement;Measures;Metabolic;Methods;microbial;Mononuclear;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality;neutralizing antibody;Outcome;Pathology;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Plasma;Production;Proliferating;Pulmonary Hypertension;quantitative imaging;Research;Rest;RNA;Serum Markers;Simplexvirus;Site;Source;Strategic Planning;T-Lymphocyte;T-Lymphocyte Subsets;Technology;Testing;Tissues;TNF gene;transcriptomics;translational approach;United States National Institutes of Health;Viral;Viral Antigens;viral detection;Viral Load result;Viral reservoir;Virion;Virus;Virus Replication;Work,Investigation of persistent HIV immune stimulation in lymphoid tissues during therapy as a cause of sustained immune activation,147912,HIVD,HIV Immunopathogenesis and Vaccine Development Study Section[HIVD],NA,NA,5,608871,126281,735152,NA

Elucidating how Ab interferes with synaptic function is an important first step for understanding the mechanisms underlying cognitive impairments associated with AD and could result in the identification of novel drug targets and therapies. However, very little research to date has shed any light on the mechanisms by which Ab engages and interacts with specific, local synaptic signaling pathways to cause neuronal dysfunction and cognitive impairment. Here, with the use of assortment of innovative cellular and molecular imaging methods and genetic manipulations, we will test the novel idea that Ab activates signaling that impairs synaptic and cognitive function through a type of postsynaptic receptor called a Calcium-permeable AMPA receptor (CP-AMPAR) that is in turn regulated by a protein called Protein Kinase A (PKA) that is specifically anchored at synapses by a protein called AKAP150. Importantly, these studies will investigate whether targeted disruption of AKAP150-anchored PKA signaling regulation of CP-AMPARs and/or interfering with additional upstream regulators and downstream targets could be worth exploring as viable therapies for preventing synaptic and cognitive dysfunction in AD.",1879703 (contact);10814407,"DELL'ACQUA, MARK L (contact);KENNEDY, MATTHEW J","MCGAVERN, LINDA",2018-09-30,2029-08-31,A kinase anchoring protein;abeta accumulation;abeta oligomer;Abeta synthesis;Acute;Adrenergic Agents;Aging;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Alzheimer&apos;s disease model;AMPA Receptors;Amyloid beta-Protein;Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor;Anatomy;Behavioral;Binding;Biochemical;Biological Assay;Biosensor;Brain;Calcineurin;Calcium;calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II;cellular imaging;Chronic;cognitive function;Coupled;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases;Data;Defect;Dementia;Dendritic Spines;Dose;Electrophysiology (science);Excision;Excitatory Synapse;Exclusion;familial Alzheimer disease;Functional disorder;Funding;G-Protein-Coupled Receptors;Genetic;genetic manipulation;genome editing;Glutamate Receptor;GTP-Binding Proteins;Hippocampus;Human;Image;imaging modality;Impaired cognition;Impairment;in vivo;Individual;innovation;Learning;Link;Long-Term Depression;Long-Term Potentiation;Mediating;Memory;Mental Depression;Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors;Molecular Genetics;molecular imaging;mouse model;Mus;Mutation;neurobehavioral;Neuronal Dysfunction;new therapeutic target;novel;Optics;Permeability;pharmacologic;Pharmacotherapy;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases;Phosphotransferases;Physiological;Play;postsynaptic;prevent;Protein Fragment;Proteins;receptor;Receptor Signaling;recruit;Regulation;Research;Role;Scaffolding Protein;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Slice;superresolution imaging;Synapses;synaptic function;Synaptic Receptors;Testing;trafficking;Vertebral column,Postsynaptic kinase/phosphatase networks in amyloid beta-induced synaptic dysfunction,110383,NDPR,"Neurodifferentiation, Plasticity, Regeneration and Rhythmicity Study Section[NDPR]",NA,NA,6,499586,276408,775994,NA

People with CKD have a high risk of cardiovascular (CV) diseases, such as heart attacks, heart failure, and strokes.

It is unknown if volume overload develops in the earliest stages of CKD, when treating it with common, inexpensive medicines called diuretics may improve long-term CV outcomes. The first study will lay important groundwork to answer this question in Veterans with early CKD by comparing two ways to measure volume overload and studying the change in common symptoms like fatigue and short-term CV function after treatment with diuretic medicines. The second study will look at past medical records to determine if lowering blood pressure with diuretic medicines was associated with less CV disease in Veterans with CKD, which could affect choices of blood pressure medicine in patients with CKD.",14552040 (contact),"GREGG, LUCILE PARKER (contact)",NA,2022-01-01,2026-12-31,Active Learning;Address;Adult;Affect;Aftercare;American;Angiotensin Receptor;Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors;Animal Disease Models;Animals;Anti-Hypertensive Agents;Aspirin;Blood Pressure;blood pressure elevation;blood pressure medication;Body Weight;Brain natriuretic peptide;burden of illness;Cardiac;Cardiac Output;Cardiovascular Diseases;cardiovascular disorder risk;Cardiovascular Physiology;cardiovascular risk factor;Cardiovascular system;career;career development;Chest;Chronic Kidney Failure;Clinical;Clinical Trials;common symptom;coronary fibrosis;Data;Data Set;data warehouse;Databases;Dedications;design;Diabetes Mellitus;Dialysis procedure;Disease;Disease Outcome;Disease Progression;Diuretics;Dose;Echocardiography;Effectiveness;End stage renal failure;Ensure;Environmental Wind;Equipment;Event;extracellular;Fatigue;Functional disorder;Goals;Heart failure;hemodynamics;high risk;Human;Hypertension;improved;indexing;Individual;Informatics;Information Systems;Infrastructure;innovation;Intervention;Kidney;kidney fibrosis;Knowledge;Left Ventricular Mass;Link;Liquid substance;Measurement;Measures;Medical center;Medical Records;Medicare/Medicaid;Medicine;Mental Depression;Mentors;Mentorship;Modeling;Monitor;Myocardial Infarction;Natriuretic Peptides;novel;Outcome;Outpatients;Painless;Participant;patient oriented;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Peripheral Resistance;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physical Examination;Physiology;Plasma;Population;population based;prevent;preventive intervention;pro-brain natriuretic peptide (1-76);Pulse Pressure;Quality of life;Questionnaires;Reporting;Research Design;Research Personnel;Retrospective cohort study;Risk;Risk Factors;Safety;Scientific Advances and Accomplishments;secondary analysis;Spectrum Analysis;standard of care;Stroke;symposium;Symptom Burden;Symptoms;targeted treatment;thiazide;tool;Training;translational model;Translational Research;United States;United States Department of Veterans Affairs;Veterans;Visit,"Association of diuretics with change in extracellular volume, natriuretic peptides, symptoms, and cardiovascular outcomes in CKD",2368,ZRD1,ZRD1-NEPH-N(01)1,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA
