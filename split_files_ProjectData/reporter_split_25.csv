The approach also activates anti-tumor T cell responses potently. The data suggest that these therapies work in concert with existing (checkpoint) therapies to provide better tumor control. Our plan is to dissect the mechanisms that underlie the effectiveness of the therapy. Furthermore, we will systematically investigate these approaches in mouse models of cancer as preliminary evidence for testing in human patients.

Analysis of the changing metabolome during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a developmental program hijacked by cancer cells to acquire metastatic and drug resistance properties, has led to the novel discovery that methylmalonic acid (MMA), a by- product of propionate metabolism, is rapidly produced and secreted by tumor cells, driving increased invasiveness and chemoresistance in both autocrine and paracrine manners. We propose to: (i) define how MMA production is regulated in cancer, (ii) determine how secreted MMA activates cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and (iii) characterize how CAFs in turn secrete factors that further promote tumor metastasis with the ultimate goal of defining a new cancer regulatory process, new biomarkers and new potential targets for drug discovery that are needed for personalized therapeutic interventions in metastatic cancer.

One such viral immune evasion strategy is the inhibition of host cell death. We have identified a viral inhibitor that targets a specific mammalian cell death pathway. We propose that this viral inhibitor not only inhibit host cell death, but also interferes with anti-viral inflammation. In this proposal, we will examine the molecular mechanism by which this viral inhibitor targets the host cell death machinery. Using mouse infection as model, we will also examine the effect of this viral inhibitor on anti-viral immune responses.

However, adoption of ECoG for basic neuroscience, and realizing its full potentials in humans, is impeded by a lack of understanding of the precise biophysical processes generating cortical surface electrical potentials (CSEPs). We propose to use direct electrophysiological monitoring and optogenetic perturbations in rats and mice, combined with biophysically detailed simulations, to reveal the origins of distinct frequency components of ECoG- recorded CSEPs. We hypothesize that distinct CSEP components represent distinct cell types and laminar sources within a cortical column, and thus report different types of information in the local cortical network associated with these sources.

With infrastructure, trained personnel, and primary equipment in place, we can now proceed to discover, diagnose, and characterize vector-borne and zoonotic pathogens; strategically conduct surveillance to establish the role of these pathogens in presentations of acute febrile illness (AFI); and investigate the transmission dynamics of vector-borne and zoonotic disease agents. By the end of Year 5 of this new cooperative agreement, we anticipate having significantly increased and broadened Indonesia’s capacity for molecular diagnosis of emerging vector-borne diseases. Specifically, we plan to have the ability to routinely carry out deep sequencing of selected AFI specimens, institute metagenomic testing, and establish routine testing for Rickettsia and arboviruses found in neighboring countries. We anticipate testing 1000-1500 samples per year collected from all regions of the country. Additionally, we plan to incorporate testing for several pathogens that cause symptoms similar to vector-borne agents and would be included in any differential diagnosis, including leptospirosis and hantavirus.

By applying a multi-level analysis approach to phenotype specific lapse behaviors clustered within individuals over time, this project will: a) support the development of sophisticated theoretical models of adherence behaviors, b) inform precision tools that improve dietary adherence in behavioral treatments for obesity, and c) establish novel phenotyping methods that can be used to understand and intervene upon non- adherence across a myriad of other chronic health conditions (e.g., diabetes, renal disease).",14923481 (contact),"GOLDSTEIN, STEPHANIE PAIGE (contact)","EVANS, MARY",2022-05-01,2027-04-30,adaptive intervention;Adherence;Adult;Assessment tool;Behavior;Behavior assessment;behavior influence;Behavior Therapy;Behavioral;behavioral phenotyping;Body Weight Changes;Body Weight decreased;Calories;Cellular Phone;Characteristics;Chronic;Clinic Visits;Clinical;clinically significant;Complex;compliance behavior;contextual factors;Data;Data Analyses;Development;Devices;Diabetes Mellitus;Diet;dietary;dietary adherence;Dietary Assessment;disorder risk;Disparate;Eating;Eating Behavior;Ecological momentary assessment;Energy Intake;Environmental Risk Factor;Factor Analysis;Food;Future;Goals;Health;Health behavior;Hour;Hyperphagia;improved;Individual;individual variation;innovation;Intervention;Kidney Diseases;Knowledge;Maintenance;Measurement;Measures;Methods;multilevel analysis;multimodality;novel;Obesity;obesity treatment;Outcome;Overweight;Participant;Patient Self-Report;Patients;Pattern;personalized intervention;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;precision medicine;Predisposition;prevent;Psychological Factors;psychosocial;Psychosocial Factor;Recommendation;Research;Science;Secondary to;Severities;Smoking;Surveys;Techniques;telephone based;Testing;Theoretical model;Time;tool;Treatment Failure;Treatment outcome;Weight;Weight maintenance regimen;Work;Wrist,Using Multimodal Real-Time Assessment to Phenotype Dietary Non-Adherence Behaviors that Contribute to Poor Outcomes in Behavioral Obesity Treatment,132210,BMHO,Biobehavioral Medicine and Health Outcomes Study Section[BMHO],NA,NA,3,415425,171005,586430,NA

Altogether, this proposal will shed light on the enigmatic actin-regulatory functions of the class of the tandem Coronins in vitro, and in cells.",10476676 (contact),"JANSEN, SILVIA  (contact)","MASKERI, BAISHALI",2021-05-01,2026-04-30,Actin-Binding Protein;Actins;Address;Adhesions;Affect;Automobile Driving;Autophagocytosis;Autophagosome;Binding;Biochemical;Biological Assay;Biological Process;Biophysics;cell motility;Cell Physiology;Cell Shape;Cells;Cellular biology;Complex;coronin protein;Crystallization;Crystallography;Cytoskeleton;Data;Distant;Family;Fluorescence;Genetic;genetic regulatory protein;Glia Maturation Factor;Image;Imaging Techniques;immunological synapse formation;In Vitro;Individual;insight;interdisciplinary approach;Intracellular Membranes;Learning;Length;live cell imaging;Lysosomes;Mediating;Membrane;Microfilaments;misfolded protein;Modeling;Molecular;Natural Immunity;Neurons;neurotransmission;Nutrient;Organelles;overexpression;Phagocytosis;Play;Process;Protein Biochemistry;Proteins;Pyrenes;reconstruction;Recovery;Regulation;Resolution;Role;Series;single molecule;spatiotemporal;Specificity;Speed;Surface;synergism;System;Tail;Techniques;Testing;Time;Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent;trafficking;Transmembrane Transport;Vesicle;Work;wound healing,Regulation of membrane trafficking by Coronins,138448,NCSD,Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Structure/Function and Dynamics Study Section[NCSD],NA,NA,4,210000,120750,330750,NA

This disease often responds to chemotherapy, but in many patients the available treatments fail --a deadly outcome. We identified how a cancer- causing fused gene called PAX3:FOXO1 leads to treatment failure. We have recently published that, remarkably, PAX3:FOXO1 can be silenced by entinostat, a drug recently granted FDA breakthrough designation for breast cancer. We find entinostat dramatically improves response to frontline chemotherapy in human tumors implanted in mice – which has led directly to a Children's Oncology Group Phase I clinical safety trial (now complete) and a phase II clinical trial concept for rhabdomyosarcoma patients. In considering the more expansive Phase II clinical trial, we ask: can we get insight into sensitivity or resistance by knowing more precisely how entinostat works, and can a chemotherapy effectively be combined with entinostat?

The public health significance of this project is to understand the impact of influenza and other respiratory virus on the psychomotor, cognitive, and behavioral development of small children in a large cohort. Outbreak investigation will be deployed if necessary. The in-depth understanding of respiratory illness and influenza in pediatrics population offer tremendous public health implications with repercussions at international levels. The proposed project will help generate surveillance and research protocols and public policies.

We anticipate that frequent and severe cases of influenza and other respiratory viral infections, during pregnancy and early life affect neurocognitive, psychomotor, and behavioral development in infants, this will assist clinicians and researchers in the following manner:  a. Prevention of influenza would be more proactive.  b. The innovative study will provide results that can be used and replicated globally.  c. Influenza vaccination during pregnancy will be promoted more actively. Another important contribution of the study is the analysis of demographic, social, and cultural factors that impact the onset of respiratory illnesses during pregnancy. As well as the use of the Bayley's III Test to evaluate the impact of cognitive, psychomotor, and language development. And, finally the innovative inclusion of behavioral analysis in the participants' follow-up will contribute immensely to universal knowledge and applied to public health policies and interventions. The study will provide enormous contributions to public health. The results will generate the tools and necessary information to promote influenza vaccination among pregnant women. This is a segment of the population, where vaccination was been low in many countries.

This translational work seeks to address this major deficiency: by evaluating effects of individual differences and targeted treatment on edema subtypes in a key pathway of TBI edema (Sur1-Trpm4), it aims to provide clinicians and researchers with a sophisticated toolkit to identify and stratify patients at risk, target the intervention, prognosticate, and optimize clinical trial design, thus directly advancing precision medicine-based care and the NINDS mission to reduce the burden of neurological disease.",12334441 (contact),"JHA, RUCHIRA MENKA (contact)","UMOH, NSINI ALEASE",2021-05-05,2026-04-30,Address;Affect;Brain;Brain Edema;Brain Injuries;Brain region;Caring;Cations;causal variant;Cause of Death;cell type;Cells;Cerebral Edema;Cerebral Edema Management;Cerebrum;Clinical;clinical care;clinical translation;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Design;clinically relevant;cohort;Collaborations;Complex;controlled cortical impact;Contusions;cost;Data;Dedications;design;Diffuse;disability;Disease;early phase clinical trial;Edema;effective therapy;endophenotype;Evaluation;fluid percussion injury;Foundations;Future;Generations;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genetic Risk;Genetic Variation;Glyburide;Goals;Growth;Guidelines;Heterogeneity;high risk;Human;Hypotension;Ideal 1;Image;improved;improved outcome;in vivo evaluation;Individual;Individual Differences;individual variation;Injury;innovation;International;Intervention;Intracranial Pressure;Knock-in Mouse;Knock-out;Knowledge;Link;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Maps;Measurable;Measures;Methodology;Mission;Modeling;Molecular;molecular targeted therapies;mouse model;Mus;National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke;Nervous System Disorder;novel;operation;Outcome;Pathway Analysis;Pathway interactions;Patient risk;Patient Selection;patient stratification;Patients;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;phase II trial;Phenotype;Physiological;potential biomarker;pre-clinical;precision medicine;preclinical study;prevent;Preventive;Probability;Process;Prognosis;prognostication;Property;protein expression;Proteins;Protocols documentation;radiological imaging;receptor;Research;Research Personnel;Resources;response;Risk;risk stratification;Single Nucleotide Polymorphism;SNP genotyping;Sodium;sulfonylurea receptor;targeted treatment;Testing;therapeutic target;Time;tool;Transgenic Mice;Transgenic Organisms;Translating;Traumatic Brain Injury;treatment optimization;treatment response;trial design;Validation;Variant;Water;Work,A Translational Evaluation of Sur1-Trpm4 Imaging Endophenotypes and Genetics to Direct Precision Medicine for Cerebral Edema After Traumatic Brain Injury,115815,BINP,Brain Injury and Neurovascular Pathologies Study Section[BINP],NA,NA,4,444230,101522,545752,NA

Many stroke survivors are living with chronic upper limb disability which results in decreased function, increased reliance on caregiver support and poor quality of life. New methods are needed to improve outcome. Currently, motor learning-based therapy has been found to be most effective but its application for those with severe upper limb impairment is challenging due to the individual’s limited ability to move the weakened limb. We propose to evaluate use of MyoPro device to help in motor learning therapy for those with severe upper limb impairment. The MyoPro is a powered upper limb brace that assists movement of the upper limb by using an electrical signal generated by the individual’s muscle to activate motors in the brace. In addition to treatment effect, we will study neuroplastic mechanisms underlying this treatment.

An age-associated vascular dysfunction leading to muscle de-conditioning, particularly in the lower extremities, has been described as a “vicious loop” as inactivity and muscle atrophy result in weakness and low power production which leads to reduced mobility and an even greater restriction of activity leading to even more pronounced vascular and muscle deterioration. The central goal of Dr. Richardson’s research is to attenuate the process of vascular aging such that fatigue resistance and impaired mobility are achieved and vascular aging continues to be attenuated.
