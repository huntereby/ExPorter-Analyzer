Walking is a safe and effective way to get the recommended amount of physical activity. Unfortunately, more than 1 in 3 Veterans over age 45 meet the definition of physically inactive. Behavioral economics suggests that our inability to start and stick to an exercise routine may be the result of “present bias,” which is a tendency to value the immediate reward of remaining sedentary over large rewards of long-run physical activity. Patient incentives may overcome present bias by moving the rewards for healthy behaviors forward in time. In the proposed study we will determine the optimal design for an incentive program that gives Veterans tangible, timely rewards for walking a target average number of steps per day.

We propose to design and evaluate novel Natural Language Processing methods that provide focussed extractive summaries of the text within patient EHR to aid radiologists performing imaging diagnosis and counteract the cognitive biases of radiologists (while our focus is on radiology, the proposed approach will generalize to other specialties, providing a potentially novel and impactful means for domain experts to better harness EHR to improve care).

Findings will inform ongoing debates over drug policy and the role of law enforcement in harm reduction, as well as identify barriers and avenues for widespread and enduring police reform that facilitates police enforcement practices that are in alignment with, not antithetical to, public health.",77939287 (contact),"SILBERZAHN, BRADLEY EDWARD (contact)","ROMBERG, ALEXA RUTH",2023-09-01,2025-08-31,Acceleration;Adopted;Appearance;Area;Attention;Attitude;authority;Baltimore;Belief;Cessation of life;Cities;Collaborations;Communities;Criminal Justice;Data Collection;Development;Disease;Diversion Program;Drug usage;Drug user;Environment;Epidemic;Evaluation;Event;evidence base;Exclusion;experience;Faculty;Fellowship;first responder;Fright;Harm Reduction;Health;health care service;Health system;HIV/STD;illicit drug use;insight;Institution;Intervention;Interview;Investigation;Justice;Law Enforcement;Lead;Leadership;Legal;Legitimacy;maltreatment;marginalized population;Maryland;Measures;Mediation;Naloxone;New York;Organizational Change;Outcome;Overdose;overdose risk;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Play;Police;Police officer;Policies;Prevention;Principal Investigator;Procedures;Program Evaluation;programs;Public Health;Public Health Schools;Race;racial disparity;Recording of previous events;Research;Research Personnel;response;Risk;Role;Safety;Schools;service providers;Services;Shapes;sociodemographics;Sociology;Stress;structural health determinants;Substance abuse problem;substance use;success;Syringes;System;Texas;theories;Transcript;Translating;Universities;Violence,Harm Reduction Policing?

Unfortunately, however, the cryopreservation process results in a substantial loss of cell viability and function due to the activation of complex molecular based cell stress response to the freeze/thaw process. Further, today the far majority, if not all, cryopreservation processes rely on DMSO (a toxic and mutagenetic agent) as the primary cryoprotective agent. This Phase I project is designed to develop a unique cryoprotective agent cocktail for NK cells that doesn’t contain toxic compounds such as DMSO. Additionally, we will develop a unique post-thaw cell stress molecular modulation reagent designed to increase recovery of NK cells post-thaw regardless of the cryopreservation media utilized. A unique hypothesis to be tested is whether the delayed onset cell death that occurs following thawing is due (in part or whole) to accelerated stress-based cell aging triggered by the cryopreservation process.

To address this need, we established extinction learning as a valid model of exposure therapy in rats, then developed a partial, sub-effective extinction procedure to investigate potential adjunct treatments that may enhance the efficacy of exposure therapy. Using this model, the primary purpose of this proposal is to test transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive neuromodulatory treatment, as a potential adjunct approach to enhance the efficacy of extinction.

However, a subset of people with obesity are metabolically healthy (MHO) and protected from the adverse metabolic effects of excess adiposity. The mechanisms that determine the differences in metabolic health between people with MUO and MHO are not unclear. This project will examine the effects of plasma and adipose tissue small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) on multi-organ insulin action. We will isolate sEVs from subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue biopsies and blood samples obtained from human participants with MHO, MUO or who are metabolically healthy and lean (MHL) and examine the effects of these sEVs on insulin resistance in muscle, liver and fat cells in culture and on insulin multi-organ insulin sensitivity in lean and obese mice. We will also identify differences in the potential bioactive molecules, namely miRNA and bioactive lipids, that are carried by sEVs. The results from this study will help determine whether plasma or adipose tissue sEVs in people who are MHL, MHO, or MUO are involved in regulating liver, muscle and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity.

The overarching goals of the ARTI Center are: 1) to bridge the basic science mechanism of a novel type of iron-dependent cell death called ferroptosis in acquired resistance to radiation therapy with translational research in preclinical models and human patient samples; 2) to identify cohorts of patients who are at greatest risk to develop acquired radiation therapy resistance; and 3) to investigate the ability of novel therapeutic agents to re-sensitize cancer cells to radiation by inducing ferroptosis. The long-term outcomes from the ARTI Center will foster collaborations with other centers in the Acquired Resistance to Therapy Network (ARTNet), build upon and iteratively feedback into research projects focused on drug resistance and sensitivities, and ultimately lead to cancer treatment strategies tailored to the individual patient.",9939858 (contact);1939997,"GAN, BOYI  (contact);KOONG, ALBERT","KAI, MIHOKO",2022-09-20,2027-08-31,Achievement;activating transcription factor 4;Advisory Committees;Basic Science;bioluminescence imaging;cancer cell;Cancer cell line;Cancer Center;cancer imaging;Cancer Patient;cancer therapy;cancer type;Cell Death;Cell Death Induction;Cells;chemoradiation;Clinical;Clinical Trials;clinically significant;Cloning;cohort;Collaborations;Communication;Cystine;Data;determinants of treatment resistance;Development;Drug resistance;drug sensitivity;effective therapy;Esophageal Adenocarcinoma;Failure;Family;Feedback;Fostering;Foundations;Future;Genes;Genomics;Goals;Grant;Guidelines;hormone therapy;Human;Hypoxia;Hypoxia Inducible Factor;Image;Imaging Device;imaging program;Immune;Immunologics;Immunotherapy;improved;individual patient;Infrastructure;Iron;Malignant neoplasm of esophagus;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Malignant neoplasm of thorax;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Medical;member;Modality;Modeling;molecular imaging;Monitor;multidisciplinary;Mus;National Cancer Institute;Nature;Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;novel therapeutics;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Oxidation-Reduction;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Play;Policies;Positron-Emission Tomography;pre-clinical;Pre-Clinical Model;Production;Prognostic Marker;programs;Radiation;Radiation Oncology;radiation resistance;Radiation therapy;Radiation-Sensitizing Agents;radioresistant;Reagent;Recurrence;Recurrent disease;Reporter Genes;Research;Research Project Grants;Resistance;Resource Sharing;Resources;Risk;Role;Sampling;single cell sequencing;solute;stable cell line;synergism;targeted treatment;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Agents;therapy resistant;Tracer;Transfection;Transgenic Organisms;Translating;Translational Research;treatment strategy;tumor;tumor growth;tumor hypoxia;tumor microenvironment;Tumor Suppression;University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center;Xenograft Model,Acquired Resistance to Therapy and Iron (ARTI) Center,274220,ZCA1,ZCA1-SRB-E(M1),NA,NA,3,795762,493372,1289134,NA

Current medical approaches for treating diabetic bone infection (osteomyelitis) are limited by (a) biofilm formation, (b) development of bacterial resistance, and (c) use of nondegradable antibiotic-delivering bone cements, which require additional removal surgery and show potential toxicity. To solve this important problem, we aim to develop an innovative drug-device combination based on rational engineering of the next-generation antibiotic that can retard resistance and an injectable nanostructured bone cement that can effectively deliver antibiotics, gradually degrade, and regenerate bone tissue.",14310044;8527705 (contact),"JANG, HAE ;SENGUPTA, SHILADITYA  (contact)","CHEN, JERMONT",2023-09-01,2027-08-31,Address;American;Amputation;angiogenesis;Anti-Bacterial Agents;antibiotic design;Antibiotics;Area;Bacteria;Bacterial DNA;bacterial resistance;bactericide;Binding;Binding Sites;Biochemistry;biomaterial compatibility;Biomedical Engineering;bone;Bone Cements;bone loss;Bone Regeneration;Bone Tissue;Cementation;Chemicals;Chronic;chronic infection;Clinical;Computer-Aided Design;Data;Debridement;Defect;Derivation procedure;Development;Devices;Diabetes Mellitus;diabetic;Diabetic Foot;diabetic patient;diabetic rat;Disease;Divalent Cations;DNA Gyrase;drug release profile;Drug resistance;Effectiveness;efficacy testing;Electrons;Engineering;Evolution;Excision;Experimental Designs;Formulation;Goals;Health;Heel;Hospitals;Human;Hydroxyapatites;Impairment;Implant;improved;in silico;In Vitro;in vivo;in vivo Model;Incidence;Infection;Injectable;innovation;Local Therapy;Maintenance;mechanical properties;Medical;Methods;Microbial Biofilms;Minerals;Modeling;monomer;Mutate;nanoparticle;Nanostructures;Natural regeneration;Nature;Necrosis;next generation;novel;Operative Surgical Procedures;Orthopedic Surgery;Orthopedics;Osteogenesis;Osteomyelitis;Outcome;Pain;Patient Admission;Patients;Penetration;Pharmaceutical Preparations;pharmacophore;Polymethyl Methacrylate;Population;Predisposition;Prevalence;Process;Quality of life;Quinolones;rational design;Recording of previous events;Recovery;regenerative;Regenerative capacity;Research;Resistance;Resistance development;resistant strain;Risk;screening;Site;Skeleton;Surface;synergism;System;systemic toxicity;Testing;Toxic effect;Toxicology;Treatment Efficacy;Vertebral column,Nanostructured degradable bone cement for delivering novel antibiotics,35485,INN,Innovations in Nanosystems and Nanotechnology Study Section [INN],NA,NA,2,391845,291720,683565,NA

Highly trained microscopists can detect about 3 parasites per microliter of blood. A large number of molecular diagnostics are in use and in development with varying degrees of sensitivity and quality control. PCR‐based methods can be more sensitive but require the use of relatively expensive reagents and equipment. The ability to detected low levels of parasitemia (below 3 per l) and identify the species of parasite is key to early treatment and surveillance efforts. There is a great need for inexpensive and instrument‐free diagnostics that can detect low level parasitemia. In previous studies, we have developed a multi‐chambered FAST diagnostic device that is pre‐loaded with lysis, amplification, and CRISPR/Cas12a reagents for the detection of several pathogens. The diagnostic does not require electricity, instruments, or highly trained personnel and is designed for point‐of‐care or field diagnostics.

The importance of predicting and managing immunotherapy-related adverse events has already been identified as a critical gap in knowledge and clinical practice.

This may provide novel insights into the underlying neurobiology and delineate future therapeutic possibilities, and therefore we aim to systematically study the phenomenology, characteristics, and electrocortical biomarkers of PL in dementia and create a measurement scale.",11448610 (contact),"PARNIA, SAM  (contact)","ELDADAH, BASIL A",2020-09-30,2026-05-31,"Adherence;advanced dementia;Adverse event;Biological;Biological Markers;Brain;Caregivers;Cerebral Ischemia;Cerebrum;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Cognitive;cognitive function;Conscious;Consent;cost;Data;Dementia;design;diaries;Elderly;Electroencephalography;end of life;Epidemiology;Event;Factor Analysis;Family;Focus Groups;Frequencies;Future;Heart Arrest;hospice environment;Impaired cognition;Incidence;insight;Intervention;Life Expectancy;Location;Measurement;Methods;Monitor;multidisciplinary;Nature;Near-Death Experience;Neurobiology;Neurologic;New York;novel;Nursing Homes;Nursing Services;Palliative Care;Patients;Persons;Phase;phenomenological models;Preparation;prevent;primary outcome;Prospective Studies;Prospective, cohort study;Questionnaires;Records;recruit;Reporting;Research;Resources;safety and feasibility;safety outcomes;secondary outcome;Services;Site;Study Subject;Surveys;Symptoms;Testing;theories;Therapeutic;Time;tool;Visiting Nurse",Paradoxical lucidity in severe end stage dementia: a mixed methods prospective study,69850,ZAG1,ZAG1-ZIJ-D(A3),NA,NA,3,490614,340977,831591,NA
