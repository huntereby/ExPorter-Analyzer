There is currently no reliable clinical, histologic or molecular marker to determine individual risk in patients within the same cancer stage.

We use the REASON score to identify early stage OSCC patients at high risk for mortality, and determine the survival benefit of different adjuvant treatments. Furthermore, we determine the clinical utility of using brush swabs rather than tissues to perform methylation analysis, with the intent of establishing a workflow using noninvasive brush biopsy and the REASON score to predict mortality risk at the time of diagnosis.",10997938 (contact),"VIET, CHI T.

Accomplishing this requires a dual synchronized approach: (i) replacing lost podocytes from neighboring stem cells to increase their number, and (ii) limiting/reversing damage to the remaining podocytes, however, major knowledge gaps to achieve this goal exist, including our limited knowledge on the molecular factors stimulating PEC self-renewal and podocyte regeneration/repair, as well as options to deliver such factors to specific kidney cell types in vivo. By establishing a pipeline through which we couple cutting-edge cell delivery molecules called nanobodies to recently-discovered factors that protect damaged podocytes and promote the replacement of lost ones, we will create a new family of therapeutic entities that prevent disease in both mouse and human kidney tissue, by harnessing the body's natural abilities to regenerate this vulnerable kidney compartment.",1966375 (contact),"SHANKLAND, STUART JAMES (contact)","GOSSETT, DANIEL ROBERT",2020-09-01,2025-05-31,Affect;Age;Albuminuria;Animal Model;blood filter;causal variant;cell injury;cell type;Cells;Cessation of life;Cicatrix;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Trials;Deterioration;Disease;efficacy evaluation;Epithelial Cells;epithelial stem cell;Experimental Designs;Family;Focal and Segmental Glomerulosclerosis;Genes;glomerular function;Goals;Human;human data;in vivo;in vivo regeneration;injured;innovation;Innovative Therapy;Kidney;kidney biopsy;kidney cell;Kidney Diseases;Knowledge;Lead;Libraries;Methods;migration;Molecular;Morphology;Mus;nanobodies;Natural regeneration;novel;novel therapeutics;organoid transplantation;Organoids;Parietal;Patients;Peptides;Physiological;podocyte;preclinical development;prevent;Process;Productivity;progenitor;Proliferating;Recombinants;regeneration potential;Renal function;Renal glomerular disease;repaired;Reporter;Research;Research Personnel;Safety;self-renewal;small molecule;stem cells;stemness;targeted delivery;targeted treatment;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;therapeutic candidate;therapeutic development;Tissues;tool;Transplantation;Urine;Work,Cell specific delivery of novel therapies to enhance glomerular regeneration and repair,126006,ZDK1,ZDK1-GRB-M(M1)S,NA,NA,5,611855,139006,750861,NA

Advanced age is an independent risk factor for mortality after burn injury, even in patients with relatively small burns, in part, because elderly burn patients are unable to combat infectious challenges, like pneumonia, a common complication seen after traumatic injury. By identifying mechanisms responsible for early damage to the gut barrier after injury and tracking dysbiosis and eventual restoration of the fecal microbiome in both our murine model of burn injury and in older burn patients, we hope to reduce the impact of this post-burn pathophysiology in patients who are at risk of developing lung infections and respiratory failure",1862316 (contact),"KOVACS, ELIZABETH J.

The basis of our approach is to identify how infection of microglial cells leads to alterations in the fronto-striatal circuitry following SUD and HIV-1 infection, focusing on mechanisms of dendritic spine loss - a key neuropathology of neuroHIV in the current cART era.",1858933 (contact),"BOOZE, ROSEMARIE M (contact)","MCCLURE-BEGLEY, TRISTAN DAVID",2023-06-01,2028-03-31,Acceleration;Acute;Address;Affect;Animals;antiretroviral therapy;Architecture;Assessment tool;Behavior;biological sex;Brain;brain cell;Cell Culture Techniques;Choice Behavior;Chronic;Clinical;clinically significant;Cocaine;Cocaine Abuse;cocaine exposure;cocaine self-administration;comorbidity;Consequences of HIV;Cytoskeleton;Dendritic Spines;density;design;Dopamine;dopamine system;dopamine transporter;Drug abuse;Drug Addiction;Drug Exposure;Drug usage;Dysmorphology;Excision;Executive Dysfunction;executive function;Exhibits;Exposure to;F-Actin;Female;frontal lobe;Functional disorder;Future;Genes;Goals;Growth;hippocampal pyramidal neuron;HIV;HIV Infections;HIV-1;HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder;improved;In Vitro;in vivo;in vivo evaluation;Individual;Infection;Knowledge;male;Measures;Medial;Mediating;Microglia;Microtubule-Associated Proteins;Modeling;Motivation;Natural regeneration;neuroAIDS;Neurocognitive;Neurocognitive Deficit;Neurologic;neuromechanism;Neurons;neuropathology;novel therapeutic intervention;Nucleus Accumbens;Outcome;Pathologic;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Play;Prefrontal Cortex;programs;psychostimulant;Recording of previous events;Reporting;Resistance;Role;Scanning;Self Administration;sex;Signal Pathway;Specific qualifier value;Stimulant;stimulant abuse;Substance of Abuse;substance use;Substance Use Disorder;success;Synapses;synaptic function;Synaptic plasticity;System;targeted treatment;Techniques;Testing;therapeutic target;Up-Regulation;Ventral Tegmental Area;Vertebral column;Virus,Microglial modulation of neurocircuits in HIV/cocaine comorbidity,59310,HCCS,HIV Comorbidities and Clinical Studies Study Section[HCCS],NA,NA,2,438686,214956,653642,NA

This study comprises three steps: 1) screening anti-Ro positive mothers for high-titer antibodies which are thought to confer greater risk of fetal AVB; 2) teaching mothers with high titer anti- Ro to monitor the fetal heart rate and rhythm at home and arrange immediate feedback on perceived abnormalities; 3) treating fetuses whose mothers detect abnormal monitoring confirmed to be incomplete AVB by echocardiogram. The purpose of our study is to find out whether the level of anti-Ro/SSA can predict fetuses at greatest risk, if mothers can themselves identify reversible fetal cardiac injury by home monitoring, whether expeditious treatment of fetal incomplete AVB can restore normal rhythm, and finally if weekly echocardiographic testing is necessary to surveil for AVB.",1877754 (contact);9230051,"BUYON, JILL P (contact);CUNEO, BETTINA FRANCESCA","PILEGGI, ANTONELLO",2020-09-01,2025-06-30,Address;Agreement;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Antibody titer measurement;arm;Atrioventricular Block;Autoantibodies;Biological Process;Birth;Bradycardia;cardiac pacing;Clinical;Colorado;congenital anomaly;Data;Detection;Dexamethasone;Disease;Early treatment;Echocardiography;Educational process of instructing;effusion;Electrocardiogram;empowerment;Endocardial Fibroelastosis;Ensure;Equipoise;Event;evidence base;Extranodal;Feedback;fetal;Fetal Heart Rate;Fetal Monitoring;Fetus;Fibrosis;Frequencies;Guidelines;Health Benefit;Healthcare;Heart;Heart Diseases;Heart Injuries;heart rhythm;Home;Hour;IgG Receptors;Incidence;Inflammation;Inflammatory;interdisciplinary collaboration;Intravenous Immunoglobulins;Lifelong disability;Mediating;medical schools;Medicine;millisecond;Monitor;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality;Mothers;Multicenter Trials;Myocardial dysfunction;National Institute of Child Health and Human Development;Natural History;network models;novel;Outcome;Participant;Pathogenesis;Perinatal mortality demographics;Phase;Placebos;Placenta;Pregnancy;prenatal;prenatal testing;prevent;primary outcome;programs;prospective;Public Health;recruit;Registries;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;rheumatologist;Risk;Sample Size;screening;Second Pregnancy Trimester;side effect;Site;standard of care;support network;Survivors;System;Techniques;Testing;time interval;Universities;Woman,Surveillance and Treatment to Prevent Fetal Atrioventricular Block Likely to Occur Quickly (STOP BLOQ),100929,NRCS,Nursing and Related Clinical Sciences Study Section[NRCS],NA,NA,5,462159,170766,632925,NA

Nevertheless, the quality of life and ‘healthy aging’ (i.e., freedom from chronic diseases and good functioning at individual and group levels) may be as, if not more important, than the number of years added to our lifespan, for both individuals and society. This makes it essential to understand the mechanism and identify factors contributing towards healthy aging. Here we will examine the role of abnormal time of eating (a common lifestyle factor that affects circadian rhythm) in accelerating aging by modulating intestinal barrier damage, microbiota dysbiosis, gut leakiness and pancreas damage. Microbial signaling networks and their interaction with host biological rhythms as targetable mechanisms involved in aging will be studied. Findings from these experiments will identify intervenable mechanisms to prevent organ damage by age.",11204459 (contact),"BISHEHSARI, FARAZ  (contact)","FLORES, ROBERTO L",2024-08-01,2029-04-30,Address;Affect;Age;age acceleration;age group;age-related disease;Aging;aging mechanism;aging population;aging process;aging related;aging related disease;Animals;anti aging;Bacterial Translocation;Biological;Biological Rhythm;carcinogenesis;Chronic;Chronic Disease;circadian;Circadian Dysregulation;Circadian Rhythms;cohort;Collection;Cues;Data;Deposition;Diabetes Mellitus;Diet;dysbiosis;Eating;Elderly;epidemiology study;Epithelium;Etiology;experience;experimental study;Exposure to;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Food;Freedom;Functional disorder;Future;Genetic;gut inflammation;gut microbiome;gut microbiota;healthy aging;Homeostasis;host microbiome;Human;Impairment;Individual;Infiltration;Inflammaging;Inflammation;Injury;insight;Insulin Resistance;insulin secretion;Intervention;intestinal barrier;intestinal injury;Intestines;Knowledge;Leaky Gut;life span;Life Style;lifestyle factors;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Microbe;microbial;microbiome;microbiota;Modernization;multiorgan injury;Mus;novel;Older Population;Organ;organ injury;Organoids;Pancreas;Pancreatic Injury;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Peripheral;Phenotype;Physiology;prevent;prophylactic;Proxy;Quality of life;resilience;resilience in aging;response;Risk;Role;Signal Transduction;Societies;Surface;System;systemic inflammatory response;Time;Work,Impact of Circadian-Microbiome Interaction on the Gut-Pancreas Axis in Aging,86145,ZAG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZAG1 ZIJ-P (J2)],NA,NA,1,474040,197882,671922,NA

Emerging evidence from basic affective neuroscience research has indicated effective SF is contingent on intact emotion awareness. Consistent with these findings, individuals with SMI at risk of suicide display SF difficulties along with poor emotion awareness (i.e., alexithymia). Employing a proof-of-concept design, the aim of the present study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of a novel, blended psychoeducation and digital mHealth intervention with smartphones designed to target alexithymia and poor SF to reduce suicide risk in veterans with SMI.",7890684 (contact),"KIMHY, DAVID  (contact)",NA,2023-06-01,2025-05-31,"acceptability and feasibility;Address;Affect;Affective;affective neuroscience;Aggressive behavior;Alexithymias;Awareness;behavioral health;Bipolar Disorder;Cellular Phone;Chronic;Clinical;clinical diagnostics;Clinical Trials;Data;design;Development;digital;Dose;efficacy testing;Emotional;emotional experience;Emotions;experience;feasibility testing;Feeling;Feeling suicidal;functional outcomes;Goals;Hospitals;improved;indexing;Individual;informant;innovation;Intervention;Interview;Link;Mental Depression;Mental Health;Meta-Analysis;Methods;mHealth;mhealth interventions;Neurosciences Research;novel;novel strategies;Numbness;Outcome;Participant;Patients;pharmacologic;Pilot Projects;Play;Population;Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders;Prevalence;prevention service;preventive intervention;programs;psychoeducation;psychosis risk;Psychotherapy;Public Health;Quality of life;randomized, clinical trials;Recording of previous events;recruit;reducing suicide;rehabilitation research;Rehabilitation therapy;Reporting;research and development;response;Risk;Sampling;Schizophrenia;service utilization;Services;severe mental illness;Signal Transduction;skills training;social;Social Functioning;social situation;Societies;Structure;Substance Use Disorder;suicidal;suicidal behavior;suicidal risk;Suicide;Suicide attempt;suicide hotline;Suicide prevention;suicide rate;Symptoms;Syndrome;systematic review;Technology;therapy design;therapy development;Treatment Efficacy;Treatment outcome;treatment response;Veterans;Violence",Alexithymia Intervention for Suicide (ALEXIS),4089,RRDS,Rehabilitation Research and Development SPiRE Program[RRDS],NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA

The outcome of this project will lead to a more precise understanding of the skeletal/pulmonary compromise and defining clinical endpoints in this disease for future clinical trials of current or developing therapies. 1",9773180 (contact),"TOMATSU, SHUNJI  (contact)","PARISI, MELISSA",2021-05-01,2026-04-30,Acetylgalactosamine;Activities of Daily Living;Age;Angiography;autosome;Awareness;Binding;Biochemical;Biochemical Markers;Biological Markers;Birth;bone;Bone Density;Bone Diseases;Cardiopulmonary;Cartilage;Cervical;Characteristics;Child;Chondroitin Sulfate C;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical assessments;clinical candidate;clinical efficacy;clinical practice;clinical research site;Clinical Treatment;Clinical Trials;clinically relevant;Collaborations;Communities;Consumption;Data;Databases;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Disease Progression;Distal;Dwarfism;Dysplasia;Effectiveness;Enrollment;enzyme replacement therapy;Enzymes;Equipment;Evaluation;exhaust;experience;Femur;Foundations;functional status;Future;Gait;gait examination;gene therapy;Glycosaminoglycan Degradation Pathway;Glycosaminoglycans;Goals;Growth;Health;Hearing;Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation;Hematopoietic stem cells;Hip region structure;Home;innovation;Institution;Interdisciplinary Study;interest;Intervention;Joint Laxity;Joints;Keratan Sulfate;Kyphosis deformity of spine;Lateral;Lead;Lesion;Life;Lung;Lung Capacity;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measurement;Measures;Medical;medical attention;Methods;Monitor;Motivation;Mucopolysaccharidoses;Mucopolysaccharidosis IV A;Natural History;Obstruction;Operative Surgical Procedures;Orthopedic Surgery;Osteotomy;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Pathogenesis;Patient Care;Patient Compliance;patient mobility;patient population;Patients;Pattern;Pharmacologic Substance;Phenotype;Physical assessment;physically handicapped;Physicians;Physiologic calcification;Physiologic Ossification;Placebo Effect;Postoperative Period;potential biomarker;predictive marker;Productivity;prognostic;Prognostic Marker;programs;Publications;pulmonary function;Pulmonary function tests;Questionnaires;reconstruction;Recording of previous events;Records;Registries;Research;research clinical testing;Research Personnel;Research Proposals;Respiratory Function Tests;response;risk stratification;Science;Severities;Severity of illness;Site;skeletal;skeletal abnormality;skeletal disorder;skeletal dysplasia;skeletal muscle weakness;Specialist;Specimen;stem cell therapy;Stenosis;Sulfatases;Sulfate;Surrogate Markers;System;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;therapy development;Time;Trachea;Training;Treatment Efficacy;Treatment outcome;treatment response;Visit;Walking;Wheelchairs,Non-invasive functional assessment and pathogenesis of Morquio A,102545,TAG,Therapeutic Approaches to Genetic Diseases Study Section[TAG],NA,NA,4,409585,167113,576698,NA

OA is often painful, and leads to poor quality of life, making it hard to lead a fully functional life, and when it progresses, can be debilitating. Drugs prescribed to alleviate joint pain and joint replacement are the only effective treatments. However, joint replacement surgeries are expensive and even after surgery and rehabilitation, many Veterans still do not regain significant improvements in quality of life, have difficulties performing regular daily activities, need additional care and are more likely to be hospitalized. OA has a genetic component. Therefore, there is a potential to provide insight to why some Veterans develop OA and why some progress to end-stage disease with limited recovery to joint replacement surgery.

The potentials are elicited via the mirror effect, i.e., stimulating the intact limb while viewing it in a mirror, to evoke a sensation in the phantom limb. We expect that directly training these evoked potentials will help restore effective sensory organization for the missing limb and reduce PLP, beyond the extent now possible. Future studies will explore this approach in other chronic pain conditions.",78154659 (contact),"BRANGACCIO, JODI ANN (contact)",NA,2023-07-01,2025-06-30,Affect;American;Amputation;Analgesics;Animals;Area;arm;arm function;Attention;Back Pain;Blinded;Brain;brain machine interface;Central Nervous System Diseases;central pain;Chronic;chronic painful condition;Clonus;Cognition;Complement;conditioning;Contralateral;Control Groups;Data;Deep Brain Stimulation;Dependence;Development;Dimensions;Discrimination;Disease;Drug Addiction;Electroencephalography;Equipment and supply inventories;Esthesia;Evoked Potentials;expectation;Extensor;Feedback;follow-up;Foot-drop;Future;grasp;H-Reflex;hand dysfunction;Home;Human;Impairment;improved;innovation;interest;Intervention;Job loss;Leg;limb amputation;limb loss;Limb structure;Locomotion;Measures;method development;Motor Cortex;Motor Evoked Potentials;Movement;Nervous System;Neuronal Plasticity;Nonpharmacologic Therapy;novel;novel therapeutics;Operant Conditioning;Outcome;Pain;Pain Measurement;pain reduction;Pain Research;pain sensation;Painless;Peripheral;Persons;Phantom Limb;Phantom Limb Pain;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physiology;Protocols documentation;Psychological reinforcement;Quality of life;Randomized;Recovery of Function;Research;response;restoration;Scalp structure;Sensory;sensory cortex;Sensory Physiology;Signal Transduction;Site;social;Soleus Muscle;somatosensory;Somatosensory Cortex;Somatosensory Evoked Potentials;Spinal cord injury;Stimulus;Stroke;success;System;Tactile;tactile stimulation;Telemedicine;Testing;Training;Transcranial magnetic stimulation;Treatment Efficacy;Veterans;visual feedback;Walking;West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory;Work,Operant conditioning of sensory evoked potentials to reduce phantom limb pain,4410,RRDS,Rehabilitation Research and Development SPiRE Program[RRDS],NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA

The level of pain reported by children who experience headache is immense and likely poorly estimated based on lowered ability of children to articulate symptoms, potential malingering or underreporting of pain symptoms, and extensive variability in physical growth and brain development. Headache is a frequently reported and poorly understood primary and secondary disorder in pediatric subjects. The diverse presentation of headache underscores the potential for distinct mechanisms of headache presentation, thus placing emphasis on tailored treatment options. In the proposed research program, we investigate four phenotypically distinct forms of headache in youth to understand the physiological mechanisms that govern their phenotypic presentation. Taking advantage of a highly diverse and specialized research team in headache research and clinical care, findings will greatly inform the diagnosis and treatment of childhood headache and reduce future pain-related dependencies on healthcare resources.",15908417 (contact);11299535,"HOLMES, SCOTT  (contact);LEBEL, ALYSSA A","OSHINSKY, MICHAEL L",2022-08-18,2027-05-31,Absence of pain sensation;Adolescent;Adult;Age;Articulation;Behavioral;biobehavior;biopsychosocial;Brain;Brain Concussion;Brain region;Central Nervous System;central pain;Characteristics;Child;Childhood;Chronic;Chronic Daily Headaches;Chronic Headaches;chronic pain;chronic painful condition;Classification;Clinical;clinical care;clinically relevant;cohort;Complex;COVID-19;Data;Data Set;deep learning;Dependence;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Drug Addiction;Elements;Etiology;experience;Female;Frequencies;Future;Genetic;Growth;Headache;Headache Disorders;Health system;Healthcare;individualized medicine;Intervention;Investigation;Learning;Long COVID;Machine Learning;machine learning classifier;male;Malingering;Measures;medical specialties;Mental Health;midbrain central gray substance;Migraine;morphogens;Muslim religion;neuroimaging;Pain;Pain Disorder;Pain management;pain processing;pain rehabilitation;pain symptom;Participant;Patients;Phenotype;Physiological;Physiology;Post-Traumatic Headaches;Predisposing Factor;Prevalence;Problem behavior;programs;PubMed;Refractory;Rehabilitation Centers;Reporting;Research;Resistance;Resolution;Resources;response;Severities;sex;Source;Specificity;suicidal behavior;Symptoms;System;Techniques;Testing;text searching;therapy resistant;Time;treatment optimization;treatment services;Work;Youth,Pediatric Chronic Headache and COVID-19: Use of Machine Learning and Biobehavioral Analysis to Classify Headache Mechanism and Optimize Treatment Course.,125265,NPI,Neurobiology of Pain and Itch Study Section [NPI],NA,NA,3,295714,227700,523414,NA

Users at the shared resource are unable to operate these semi-automated platforms to execute high-valued arrayed library screening and resolve critical questions raised in current NIH- funded research. Fortunately, the proposed high-throughput automation model, Beckman Coulter Biomek i7, will be able to streamline the entire screening process, including assay development, arrayed library preparation and screening, and target validation in cellular disease models. The acquisition of the Beckman Coulter Biomek i7 will help propel the discovery of novel targets and their underlying mechanisms, advancing our understanding of a wide spectrum of human diseases. The disease indications being studied at SBP that will benefit from this automation include COVID-19, childhood diseases, including leukemia, brain cancer, and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, as well as adult diseases such as breast cancer, aging-specific chronic inflammation, Alzheimer’s disease, and its related dementia.

The purpose of this proposed investigation is to perform and compare biomechanical evaluations of the Power Knee and Ossur Rheo XC, a passive MPK, during walking and other activities by prosthesis users. Furthermore, we will compare mobility between male and female subjects to determine if there are differences in prosthetic knee usage on the basis of sex.
