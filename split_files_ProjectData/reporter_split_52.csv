However, antimicrobial resistance caused by excessive or incorrect use of antibiotics has become one of the major public health issues. Foodborne pathogens can also develop resistance to certain antibiotics via the exposure of antimicrobials agents primarily from inappropriate use within agricultural practices, leading to circulation within our current food production system. These pathogens can also serve as reservoirs for antimicrobial mobile genetic elements that may transfer to other pathogens. As a result, the growing trend of antibiotic resistance of foodborne pathogens continues to elevate concerns of food safety within the United States. The main goal of the FDA NARMS cooperative agreement project with Maryland Department of Health is to isolate and characterize foodborne pathogens including Salmonella, Campylobacter sp., E. coli, Enterococcus sp., Vibrio sp., Aeromonas sp. from several retail food products purchased from stores across Maryland. After the pathogens have been isolated, they are subjected to downstream phenotypic and genotypic characterizations as well as whole genome sequencing. The isolates and data are submitted to the FDA monthly. The Maryland Department of Health, Laboratories Administration has the capability and capacity to implement the current project and future pilot projects using advanced technologies to further characterize these isolates including speciation, serotyping, and whole genome sequencing.",16363086 (contact),"URBAN, SINISA  (contact)","KABERA, CLAUDINE",2020-09-01,2025-08-31,NA,NARMS Cooperative Agreement Program to Strengthen Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance in Retail Food Specimens,7137,ZFD1,ZFD1-CVM-R(03)1,NA,NA,5,158972,21028,180000,NA

The SC-DHEC PHL will follow all protocols provided by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Bacteria isolated from retail meat and seafood samples will be characterized where appropriate by serology, whole genome sequencing (WGS), and sent to the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine (FDA-CVM) for antibiotic sensitivities. Results will be shared with the Center for Disease Control (CDC), the FDA, and DHEC Foodborne Epidemiologists. Data will be used to drive identification of foodborne disease outbreaks. Antibiotic resistance data collected, as a result of the surveillance activities, will be analyzed and monitored for trends.

This assay will detect proteins on extracellular vesicle (EV) secreted by Mtb-infected phagocytes and by immune cells to evaluate Mtb burden and its containment by the immune system, and thus provide critical information about pathogen-host interactions required improve pediatric TB diagnosis and to allow rapid assessment of the effectiveness of TB treatment.",10898749 (contact);16589538;7684621,"HU, TONY Y.

This research will lead to one of the first youth tailored interventions for HIV prevention among YPWID in India and contribute to urgent efforts to address the high HIV incidence in this vulnerable population.",11694924 (contact),"GANAPATHI, LAKSHMI  (contact)","LEE-WINN, ANGELA EUNJI",2023-08-15,2028-07-31,"acceptability and feasibility;addiction;Address;Age Years;AIDS prevention;antiretroviral therapy;Automobile Driving;Award;Behavior Therapy;Behavioral Medicine;career development;Caring;Cellular Phone;Childhood;Cities;Clinical;Collection;Communicable Diseases;condoms;Counseling;Data;Development;disorder prevention;Drops;Effectiveness;effectiveness trial;Epidemic;Evaluation;Evidence based intervention;experience;Fellowship;flexibility;Focus Groups;Future;Goals;Government;Heroin;high risk;high risk behavior;HIV;HIV Infections;HIV risk;HIV Seropositivity;Human immunodeficiency virus test;Hybrids;implementation intervention;implementation science;improved;Incidence;India;Individual;Injecting drug user;Injections;innovation;integrated care;Intervention;Intervention Studies;Lead;Life;medical schools;medication for opioid use disorder;Medicine;Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award;Mentors;Modeling;Modification;multidisciplinary;National Institute of Drug Abuse;Needle-Exchange Programs;Needles;Nongovernmental Organizations;novel;opioid injection;opioid use disorder;Outcome;outreach;Participant;patient oriented research;Patients;peer;Peer Pressure;peer support;person centered;Persons;Physicians;Policies;pre-exposure prophylaxis;preference;prescription opioid;Prevalence;prevention service;preventive intervention;primary outcome;Problem Solving;Provider;psychosocial;Public Health;public health priorities;Randomized;Randomized, Controlled Trials;reduced substance use;Research;Research Infrastructure;Research Personnel;Retrospective cohort;Risk Behaviors;risk perception;scale up;secondary analysis;secondary outcome;Services;Signal Transduction;skills;sociodemographics;Specific qualifier value;Statistical Methods;Statistical Study;Subgroup;substance use;substance use treatment;Testing;testing uptake;therapy adherence;therapy design;therapy development;Time;Training;Transportation;treatment as usual;United States National Institutes of Health;uptake;Vulnerable Populations;Work;Youth",Yuva Sath: A peer-led intervention to support substance use treatment and HIV prevention among young people who inject drugs in India,57151,HIBI,HIV/AIDS Intra- and Inter-personal Determinants and Behavioral Interventions Study Section[HIBI],NA,NA,2,181458,12304,193762,NA

Perturbations in p53 signaling are required for development of most cancers. In contrast to other tumor suppressors, the vast majority of p53 alterations are missense mutations in the DNA-binding domain (‘mutp53’), leading to conformationally aberrant highly stabilized mutp53 proteins. Mouse models and clinical data from germline and sporadic cancers firmly established that missense mutp53 proteins not only lose their tumor suppressor function, but often acquire new oncogenic gain-of-function activities mutp53GOF. As major translational advance, our preliminary data established a strong exploitable dependency on continued high expression of mutp53 for tumor growth, maintenance and metastasis in autochthonous models of lymphoma and colorectal carcinoma. Our research program aims to evaluate the therapeutic potential of this concept in liver and pancreatic cancer, elucidate the mechanisms behind mutp53GO-driven tumorigenesis, with the ultimate goal to identify novel therapeutic targets for mutp53 cancers.",11595400 (contact),"NEMAJEROVA, ALICE  (contact)","LUO, RUIBAI",2020-09-11,2025-08-31,Ablation;Acceleration;Address;Alleles;Area;Biological;Cancer Patient;cancer therapy;cancer type;Carcinoma;Chemoresistance;ChIP-seq;Clinical;Clinical Data;Collaborations;Colorectal Cancer;cytotoxicity;Data;Death Rate;Dependence;design;Development;DNA Binding Domain;Frequencies;gain of function;Genes;Genetic;Germ Lines;Germ-Line Mutation;Goals;graduate student;Human;in vivo;Infrastructure;inhibitor;Invaded;Knock-in Mouse;Laboratories;Large Intestine Carcinoma;Lead;liver cancer model;Lymphoma;Maintenance;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant neoplasm of liver;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Malignant Neoplasms;Metabolism;Missense Mutation;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Conformation;mortality;mouse model;Mouse Strains;Mus;mutant;Mutation;Neoplasm Metastasis;new therapeutic target;Oncogenic;Patients;pharmacologic;Phenotype;Population;Postdoctoral Fellow;pre-clinical;programs;Proliferating;Proteins;Proteome;Research;Research Personnel;Signal Transduction;single-cell RNA sequencing;technology development;Testing;The Cancer Genome Atlas;Therapeutic;time use;TP53 gene;Training;Translating;translational progress;tumor;tumor growth;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;tumorigenesis;undergraduate student;Work,Mutant p53 gain-of-function as an actionable target in cancer therapy,251836,ZCA1,ZCA1-SRB-1(M2)S,NA,NA,5,126608,75332,201940,NA

Epigenetics of the autoantibody response in systemic lupus Epigenetic marks “interact” with genetic programs to regulate B cell functions, such as immunoglobulin (antibody) gene class switch DNA recombination (CSR), somatic hypermutation (SHM) and plasma cell differentiation, thereby informing the antibody response. Dysregulation of epigenetic mechanisms in B lymphocytes can result in aberrant autoantibody responses and would compound genetic susceptibility to mediate autoimmunity, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), in which heavily mutated and class-switched (mainly IgG) autoantibodies produce widespread tissue and organ injury. This proposal addresses antibody and autoantibody responses in SLE and underlying mechanisms, with a focus on how Tet2, an important epigenetic factor, upregulates the expression of AID, which is essential for CSR/SHM, and Blimp-1, which is essential for plasma cell differentiation. It will also address how the expression and activity of Tet2 is regulated at different differentiation stages of human and mouse B cells, by estrogen, which underpins the female bias for systemic autoantibody-mediated autoimmunity, such as in SLE. In additional to this hormonal stimulus, this proposal will address the role nutritional and metabolic elements in Tet2 induction/activation, thereby providing the basis for the development of Tet2 inhibitors as therapeutics in autoimmune diseases.

We will also leverage statistical machine learning approaches to improve the quality of the constructed optimal individualized treatment strategy while providing valid statistical inference.",12053407;8147385;10302009 (contact),"ERTEFAIE, ASHKAN ;MCDERMOTT, MICHAEL P;VENUTO, CHARLES STANLEY (contact)","SWANSON-FISCHER, CHRISTINE R",2020-09-30,2025-08-31,Adoption;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;analytical method;Behavior;Benefits and Risks;care providers;Caring;Characteristics;Clinic Visits;Clinical;clinical care;Clinical Data;clinical decision-making;clinical phenotype;Clinical Research;clinical research site;Clinical Trials;Code;comparative;comparative effectiveness study;Comparative Study;Complex;Computer software;Coupled;Data;Data Analyses;Data Collection;data curation;data harmonization;data integration;data management;Data Set;Decision Making;Decision Trees;demographics;Disease;dosage;England;flexibility;follow-up;Future;Goals;Guidelines;Health;Heterogeneity;improved;Individual;individualized medicine;Journals;Language;Learning;longitudinal dataset;Longterm Follow-up;machine learning method;Measurement;Measures;Medical;Medicine;Methodology;Methods;Modeling;Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson&apos;s Disease Rating Scale;Multi-site clinical study;Nature;Nervous System Disorder;Observational Study;open source;Outcome;Output;Parkinson Disease;Participant;patient response;Patients;Pattern;permissiveness;personalized approach;personalized medicine;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacotherapy;Phase;Phenotype;Population;Procedures;Process;progression marker;Protocols documentation;Publications;Quality of life;Randomized;Recommendation;Recording of previous events;Relaxation;repository;Research;Research Personnel;response;Sample Size;Sampling;software development;Software Tools;Source;statistical and machine learning;Syndrome;Target Populations;Techniques;Therapeutic;Time;tool;treatment planning;treatment response;treatment strategy,Advancing Personalized Medicine in PD Using Harmonized Multi-Site Clinical Data,120240,ZNS1,ZNS1-SRB-H(13),NA,NA,5,306616,165573,472189,NA

Evidence suggests that the gut microbiome (GM; i.e., the collective genomes of microbes living in the gut) plays an important role in the development and persistence of psychological distress and, further, that the GM is modifiable through interventions targeting social determinants of health (SDoH) like stress, lifestyle behaviors, dietary patterns, environmental/sociocultural conditions, and sociodemographic characteristics. The present study will investigate associations between psychological distress, the GM, and post-migration SDoH in recent Haitian immigrants to the US as a critical step in developing culturally responsive, personalized interventions to mitigate psychological distress, improve long-term health outcomes, reduce health disparities, and increase health equity in this underserved population.",14819415 (contact),"FANFAN, DANY  (contact)","TYUS, NADRA",2022-08-15,2025-07-31,Acculturation;Achievement;Address;Adopted;Anxiety;Area;Asian population;Behavior;Behavior Therapy;biobehavior;Bioinformatics;Biological Process;Characteristics;Cohort Studies;Country;Cultural Characteristics;culturally appropriate intervention;Development;Diet Habits;Dietary Practices;disability;Disabling;Economic Burden;Education;Employment;ethnic minority;experience;Exposure to;Fatigue;Foundations;Functional impairment;Future;Genomics;Goals;gut microbiome;gut-brain axis;Haitian;Health;health disparity;health equity;Health Promotion;Healthy Eating;holistic approach;Home;Household;Immigrant;Immigration;improved;Income;Intervention;Knowledge;Latina Population;Latino Population;Length;Life Style;Link;Mental Depression;Mentors;microbial;microbial genome;microbiome composition;microbiota;migration;Nursing Research;Outcome;Pain;perceived stress;Personal Satisfaction;personalized intervention;Persons;Phylogenetic Analysis;Physical activity;Play;Policies;Population;Psyche structure;psychological distress;psychosocial;Quality of life;Reduce health disparities;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;residence;Ribosomal RNA;Risk;Role;Science;Senior Scientist;Services;social culture;Social Environment;social health determinants;sociodemographic factors;sociodemographics;stool sample;Stress;stressor;Subgroup;symptom science;Symptoms;Time;tool;Training;Translating;translational research program;Underserved Population;United States;Work,Examining the Gut Microbiome in Haitians Post-Migration to the United States,20222,NRRC,Nursing Science Review Committee[NRRC(83)],NA,NA,3,126198,10010,136208,NA
