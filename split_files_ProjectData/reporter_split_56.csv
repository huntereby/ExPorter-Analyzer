Indeed, the approval of temozolomide chemotherapy dates back to 2005, and bevacizumab will improve quality of life of some patients, however failed to prolong survival. Reasons for failures are tumor heterogeneity, the exquisitely immunosuppressive microenvironment of glioblastoma, the blood-brain barrier preventing sufficient drug concentrations in the brain, investigations of single agents to an unselected patient population rather than combinatorial approaches and biomarker-based treatments of enriched populations. Our U19 proposal unites renowned translational and clinical investigators from two top and NIH-funded institutions with a strength and dedicated research in brain tumors, evaluating and comparing different approaches of optimized immunotherapy against glioblastoma. We leverage collaboration and pipeline(s) of innovative biotechnology companies who will support our proposal with drugs, devices, but also with access to their expertise and experts, platforms and laboratory investigations, as needed. Thus, this U-19 grant will enable and facilitate a powerful new consortium that will synergize and is able to efficiently translate preclinical findings to meaningful early clinical trials and treatments for patients suffering from glioblastoma.",9011483 (contact);15210852,"BUTOWSKI, NICHOLAS A (contact);STUPP, ROGER","HUBBARD, LEAH",2021-09-10,2026-08-31,Acceleration;Address;Adult;anti-PD-1;anti-PD1 therapy;Antibodies;Antigens;Back;base;bevacizumab;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biotechnology;Blood - brain barrier anatomy;blood-brain barrier disruption;Brain;Brain Neoplasms;brain tissue;Cell Therapy;Cells;Characteristics;checkpoint therapy;chemotherapy;chimeric antigen receptor;chimeric antigen receptor T cells;Clinic;Clinical;clinical development;clinical investigation;Clinical Investigator;clinical translation;Clinical Treatment;Clinical Trials;cohort;Collaborations;Combination immunotherapy;combinatorial;Comprehensive Cancer Center;Cytotoxic Chemotherapy;Dedications;design;Development;Devices;Dose;Doxorubicin;Drug Kinetics;early phase clinical trial;electric field;epidermal growth factor receptor VIII;exhaustion;experience;Failure;Family;first-in-human;Fostering;Funding;Genetic;Glioblastoma;Goals;Grant;Hematologic Neoplasms;Heterogeneity;Homing;Immune;immune checkpoint blockade;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immune response;immunogenic;Immunologic Monitoring;immunoregulation;Immunotherapy;immunotherapy clinical trials;improved;in vivo;in vivo evaluation;Industry;innovation;Institution;International;Investigation;Knowledge;Laboratories;Lead;Malignant Neoplasms;manufacture;MAP Kinase Gene;Mediating;Modeling;Mus;Neoadjuvant Therapy;neoplasm immunotherapy;neoplastic cell;neuro-oncology;notch protein;novel;Operative Surgical Procedures;Organ;patient population;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Peripheral;personalized medicine;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacotherapy;Pilot Projects;Population;pre-clinical;Pre-Clinical Model;predictive marker;prevent;Primary Brain Neoplasms;Prior Therapy;Prognostic Marker;programs;prospective;Quality of life;Radiation;Recurrence;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Resected;Resources;response;Role;Safety;Scientist;Site;Solid Neoplasm;Sonication;Structure;synergism;System;T-Lymphocyte;targeted treatment;Technology;temozolomide;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissues;Toxic effect;Translating;Translational Research;translational scientist;Treatment Efficacy;tumor;tumor heterogeneity;Tumor Tissue;tumor-immune system interactions;ultrasound;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities,Advancing treatment and understanding of immunotherapy in glioblastoma,264338,ZCA1,ZCA1-TCRB-D(A1),NA,NA,4,625044,171827,796871,NA

We will assess choices Veterans made about their care after Medicaid expansion. We will focus on a group particularly vulnerable to fragmented care–patients with complex health care needs from advanced chronic kidney disease.

Importantly, T2D is widespread in the Veteran population, and the VA administration spends $1.5 billion annually in diabetes care. This epidemic of T2D also contributes to the staggering rates of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular mortality. Lifestyle modifications, including increased physical activity, are recommended as first-line therapy for the management of T2D. Unfortunately, patients with T2D exhibit diminished vascular adaptations to exercise. The proposed project will test the overall hypothesis that degradation of the endothelial glycocalyx, a characteristic feature of T2D, precludes shear stress mechanotransduction and consequent exercise-induced vascular adaptations. As such, we pose that restoration of the endothelial glycocalyx via dietary supplementation of glycocalyx precursors will potentiate vascular adaptations to exercise in Veterans with T2D.",12388309 (contact);11319557,"MANRIQUE ACEVEDO, CAMILA MARGARITA  (contact);PADILLA, JAUME",NA,2022-04-01,2024-09-30,Adjuvant;Adult;Arteries;Biochemical;Blood flow;Blood Vessels;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cardiovascular system;Caring;Cause of Death;Characteristics;Charge;Chronic;Clinical Trials;db/db mouse;design;Diabetes Mellitus;diabetic;Diagnosis;Dietary Supplementation;Double-Blind Method;Endothelium;Epidemic;Exercise;exercise training;Exhibits;Exposure to;fucoidan;Glucosamine Sulfate;Glycocalyx;Glycoproteins;hemodynamics;Hyaluronan;Impairment;improved;Individual;Inflammation;Left;Life Style Modification;lifestyle intervention;mechanical force;mechanotransduction;Mediating;Methodology;military veteran;Molecular Weight;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality;mouse model;Mus;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;novel;Patients;permissiveness;Phase;Physical activity;Placebos;Population;Prevalence;prevent;prospective;Proteoglycan;Randomized;randomized placebo controlled trial;Recommendation;Research;restoration;Role;shear stress;Side;Signal Transduction;Stimulus;Structure;Superoxide Dismutase;Supplementation;Testing;Therapeutic;Thick;Veterans,Targeting the Endothelial Glycocalyx to Enhance Vascular Function and Exercise-Induced Vascular Adaptations in Type 2 Diabetes,2399,ZRD1,ZRD1-CARB-R(01)1,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is important to be able to reliably predict which individuals might be more susceptible to developing an OUD or overdose to improve intervention and treatment of high-risk individuals. Post-9/11 Veterans, who were deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, and other regions in this era of conflicts, have unique risk factors that may predispose them to OUD and overdose related to their history of repeated deployments and deployment- related trauma, including posttraumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury and depression.

The majority of adult cigarette smokers want to quit and more than half make an attempt but fewer than 1 in 10 smokers successfully quit at the end of 1 year. Rates of cigarette smoking are higher and cessation rates are lower in the veteran population in the United States compared to the nonveteran population. Using noninvasive techniques to change the function of brain areas that are involved in TUD is one approach to developing treatments for TUD. A small area of the brain called the insula is involved in the urge to smoke. This study tests a new noninvasive technique called low intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) as a way to inhibit the insula and determine whether this causes smokers to have less of an urge to smoke when they see cues that remind them of smoking and whether activity in the insula is decreased after LIFU. Results from this study could provide important information on how the brain becomes addicted to smoking.,78014358 (contact),"LEE, MARY  (contact)",NA,2022-04-01,2026-03-31,addiction;Adult;Affect;Anatomy;Animal Model;Anterior;Area;Behavior;Behavioral;blood oxygen level dependent;Brain;Brain region;cigarette craving;Cigarette Smoker;cigarette smoking;Clinical;Clinical assessments;cost;cranium;craving;Cues;Data;Dorsal;effective therapy;Emotional;experience;Exposure to;Focused Ultrasound;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Hour;Human;Individual;Insula of Reil;Lateral;Left;Lesion;Link;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measures;Methods;military veteran;millimeter;multimodal data;neural;Neurologic;neuroregulation;Neurosurgical Procedures;nicotine craving;Nicotine Dependence;noninvasive brain stimulation;Patient Self-Report;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physiological;Population;preventable death;Relapse;Resolution;response;Rest;Role;Safety;safety assessment;Severities;Site;Smoke;Smoker;Smoking;Smoking Behavior;smoking cessation;smoking cue;Somatosensory Cortex;Specificity;Spottings;stem;Stimulus;Structure;Substance Use Disorder;Techniques;Temporal Lobe;Testing;Therapeutic;Tobacco Use Disorder;Transcranial magnetic stimulation;United States;United States Food and Drug Administration,Low Intensity Focused Ultrasound for Tobacco Use Disorder:  High Resolution Targeting of the Human Insula,2427,ZRD1,ZRD1-NURA-J(01),NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA

Humans cannot synthesize vitamin B1, and thus, must obtain it from exogenous sources ( i. e, diet and the gut microbiota) via absorption along the intestinal tract. Deficiency of vitamin B1 occurs in conditions like inflammatory bowel diseases, sepsis and chronic alcoholism, which affect significant number of our Veterans and the general population. It is therefore of physiological, nutritional and pathophysiological importance to understand how the different forms of vitamin B1 are absorbed in the gut and how conditions/factors that the intestine is exposed to under certain disease states affect these absorptive processes.

We would like to develop orexin-based anti-obesity therapies for humans, but orexin itself does not cross the blood-brain barrier, which is needed to achieve the anti-obesity affects. To this end, we have developed two novel compounds (orexin agonists) that mimic the effects of orexin, but which can cross the blood-brain barrier, making them promising candidates for use in human obesity. In this application we will test these two novel small molecular weight orexin agonists in mice, to determine their effectiveness as anti-obesity agents and in improving sleep/wake patterns.

My goal is to provide an understanding of how AKI happens and to develop clinical tests that can predict risk of AKI. Based on the data generated from the CDA2 award, I intend to apply for an independent research grant from the VA.

There are 7.9 million bone fractures sustained annually in the U.S. alone. Bone healing is impaired in 10% of fractures with seriously delayed union or nonunion, causing morbidity for patients and enormous healthcare costs. Thus, there is a compelling need to find novel effective therapies that promote fracture healing. In this project, we will use 3D printed fibrin gel/β-tricalcium phosphate (βTCP) scaffolds to test the therapeutic effects of the smoothened agonist, SAG21k, to activate hedgehog signaling in a burst manner and a prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD)2 protein inhibitor, IOX2, to activate hypoxia signaling in a sustained manner in a clinically relevant femoral segment defect model for nonunions. Our successful completion of the proposed work could lead to the development of novel SAG21k-IOX2-based therapeutics which accelerate bony bridging and, thereby, minimize the chance of developing a nonunion fracture.

As the proportion of Veterans reaching old age is increasing, understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning the role of aging in these diseases is critical for effective treatment. Furthermore, environmental exposure to various toxic chemicals has been linked to higher incidence of both MDS and AML, likely putting Veterans at an increased risk for both diseases. Unfortunately, treatments for MDS and AML are largely ineffective, as evidenced by a 5-year survival rate of less than 25% for AML patients.

This aim is achieved through the altruism of voluntary unpaid and family replacement blood donors. The World Health Organization estimates that blood donation by 1% of the population is generally the minimum needed to meet a nation's most basic requirements for blood. Blood donors are healthy subjects usually between the ages of 17 to 60 although the upper and lower limit vary from country to country who donate their whole blood or blood components. The lower limit is to take account of the national legal requirements for consent, the increased risk of vasovagal reactions in younger donors, and the increased iron requirements of adolescents and young menstruating females, and upper age limit is so set because of increase in various medical conditions with age especially cardiovascular diseases making donations more hazardous. The voluntary unpaid blood donor is the blood donor who gives blood or blood products of their own free will and will not receive money or any form of payment while the regular voluntary blood donor has donated at least 3 times and continues to donate at least once a year. A stringent screening and selection process aimed at assessing the suitability of prospective donors is therefore essential in ensuring the safety and sufficiency of the blood supply; safeguarding the health of the recipients of transfusion as well as that of the donors; and at the same time ensuring that suitable donors are not unnecessarily deferred. Frequent and unnecessary temporary deferral of blood donors lead to loss of potential blood donors some of whom may be reluctant to return for future donations. It is apparent that a lot of attention is given to ensure the safety of the blood and blood products to the recipient but less attention is accorded the blood donors who donate the essential and scarce raw material. With continuous depletion of iron stores from repeat donations and inadequate replacement, the body adapts to reduced concentrations of iron or develops iron deficiency and anaemia. Greater frequency of blood donation is accompanied by lower iron status. Inadequate and irregular blood supply play a cardinal role in the high mortality rates in obstetric haemorrhage and other causes of severe anaemia in Ghana. Though significant efforts were made to achieve the 5th millennium development goal (MDG5), the targets were missed due to the impact of major direct causes of maternal death such as haemorrhage, hypertensive diseases and abortion complications. Comparing the maternal mortality trends across Ghana, haemorrhage as a cause of maternal death has dropped to second place in most urban centers and teaching hospitals where haemorrhage is now second leading cause of maternal death. Maternal mortality surveys in district hospitals and other community health facilities show very high rates and are predominantly due to haemorrhage. Our long-term goal is to provide adequate safe blood in Ghana by establishing a new paradigm of blood collection in the country focused on a community-based volunteer system and nutritional donor enrichment.",15991989;14311523 (contact),"ASAMOAH-AKUOKO, LUCY ;DEI-ADOMAKOH, YVONNE  (contact)","ZOU, SHIMIAN",2020-07-01,2026-06-30,abortion;Acute;Adolescent;Africa South of the Sahara;Age;Altruism;Anemia;animation;Attention;Awareness;Back;base;Behavioral;Blood;Blood Donations;Blood donor;blood product;Blood Transfusion;Cardiovascular Diseases;Caring;Chronic;Clinical;Clinical Management;Collection;commune;Communication;Communities;community based evaluation;Community Health;Community Hospitals;community organizations;Consent;Country;Death Rate;design;Development;Discipline of obstetrics;District Hospitals;Drama;Drops;Education;efficacy evaluation;Emergency Situation;Ensure;Family;Female;Free Will;Frequencies;Fright;Future;Ghana;Goals;Health;Health care facility;Hematologist;Hemorrhage;Hospitals;Hypertension;improved;Individual;Intervention;Iron;iron deficiency;Iron deficiency anemia;iron supplementation;Knowledge;Lead;Leadership;Legal;Maternal Mortality;Medical;Menstruation;Methods;Modeling;Motivation;multidisciplinary;nutrition;Nutritional;nutritional supplementation;Outcome Measure;Patients;payment;Play;Policies;Population;primary outcome;Process;prospective;Public Health;Reaction;Recommendation;recruit;Recurrence;response;Risk;Role;Safety;screening;Secure;Services;Sickle Cell Anemia;sociologist;Source;Specialist;Supplementation;Surveys;System;Teaching Hospitals;Testing;Time;Transfusion;trend;Vascular blood supply;Vasovagal;volunteer;Whole Blood;World Health Organization,Development and evaluation of community-based approaches and donor care intervention models for improving availability and safety of blood for the management of severe anemia in Ghana,151599,ZHL1,ZHL1-CSR-B(F1),NA,NA,5,594689,18387,613076,NA

Our Project addresses all of these aspects by testing targeted therapy induced replication stress (RS) as a potential SCLC therapeutic vulnerability which also would increase innate immune responses against SCLC, and lead to improved responses against immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy.

The chronic infections result in characteristic painful swelling of the limbs (elephantiasis) and later lymphedema of the genitals. The associated irreversible physical disability and profound disfiguring cause substantial economic, social, and psychological damage. Mass drug treatment with anthelmintic medicines is recommended to interrupt the transmission cycle of filarial infection. Chemotherapy effectively clears microfilariae from the host and suppresses their reappearance, but they have limited adulticidal activity. Inhibitory GABA-gated chloride channels present at the neuromuscular junction of nematodes are a vital mediator of locomotion. They serve as a target for only one nematocidal compound, piperazine, and have not been explored in filarial nematodes. unc-49 encodes for a GABA receptor in nematodes that mediates contralateral body muscle inhibition during locomotion. UNC-49 GABA channel has been characterized from Caenorhabditis elegans and Haemonchus contortus. These receptors are pharmacologically distinct from vertebrate channels and display species-based diversity. We will explore the biological significance and potential of Bma-UNC-49 channels as a novel drug target. This project will characterize the filarial UNC-49 receptors providing a better understanding of its pharmacology and the molecular basis of the activity of selective GABA channels.

Because of under-reporting and symptomatic treatment, the real incidence is believed to be much greater. Worldwide incidence is now estimated at greater than 87 million new cases per annum. Untreated gonorrhea in women can lead to upper genital tract infection and pelvic inflammatory disease, with tubal scarring, infertility, and risk for ectopic pregnancy. It also increases the risk of acquisition and transmission of HIV up to 5-fold, for reasons that remain unclear. Because no vaccine is available, control and treatment depend upon antibiotics, but N. gonorrhoeae has steadily developed resistance to each class of antibiotics deployed against it, including fluoroquinolones and most recently even cephalosporins. Importantly, gonorrhea can be acquired repeatedly with no development of protective immunity, compounding the danger of emerging antibiotic resistance. This CRP proposal seeks to further the development of an intravaginally administered formulation of the key inflammatory cytokine interleukin-12 (GneX12) as a novel therapeutic vaccine against gonorrhea, to be used in conjunction with standard-of-care antibiotics, and as a failsafe therapeutic treatment against emerging super-resistant strains.",12263184 (contact);1861190,"AUCI, DOMINICK  (contact);RUSSELL, MICHAEL W","CONNOLLY, KRISTIE LEE",2013-02-01,2026-07-31,Acceleration;acute toxicity;Agreement;analytical method;Antibiotic Therapy;Antibiotics;Antibodies;Antibody Response;Antimicrobial Resistance;Attenuated Vaccines;Award;Biological;Biological Sciences;Biotechnology;Cephalosporins;Cicatrix;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;Communicable Diseases;Communication;comparative;Consultations;cost effective;cross immunity;Cyclic GMP;cytokine;Dedications;design;Development;Dose;Drug Compounding;Drug Kinetics;drug-resistant gonorrhea;Ectopic Pregnancy;emerging antibiotic resistance;Encapsulated;Fluoroquinolones;Formulation;Funding;Future;Goals;Gonorrhea;HIV;Human;Immunity;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;Incidence;Infection;Infertility;Inflammatory;Interleukin-12;Intravaginal Administration;Investigational Drugs;Legal patent;Macaca fascicularis;manufacture;manufacturing process;manufacturing scale-up;Marketing;Mediating;meetings;Methods;Monkeys;mouse model;Mucous Membrane;Multi-Drug Resistance;Mus;Neisseria gonorrhoeae;nonhuman primate;novel;novel therapeutics;particle;Pelvic Inflammatory Disease;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacologic Substance;Phase;Phase I/II Clinical Trial;Phase I/II Trial;Pichia;Preparation;Primates;product development;Production;Prophylactic treatment;Public Health;public health relevance;Qualifying;Rattus;Readiness;Recombinants;Recommendation;Regimen;Reporting;reproductive;reproductive toxicity;reproductive tract;Resistance development;resistant strain;response;Risk;Rodent;Role;scale up;Secure;Small Business Innovation Research Grant;Source;Specific qualifier value;standard of care;symptom treatment;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Therapeutic;therapeutic vaccine;Toxic effect;Toxicology;transmission process;treatment optimization;Treatment Protocols;Universities;Vaccines;Woman;Work,Therapy and Prophylaxis for Genital Tract Infection,104067,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-MCST-K(19)B],NA,NA,8,825758,108821,1000000,NA

The obtained knowledge will be instrumental for optimizing drug dozing regimes in alcohol consumers, and the drugs used in treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder and Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome in particular. Besides providing new insights on the effects of alcohol on drug metabolism, this study will result in fundamental conceptual advancements in our understanding of complex cases of drug-drug and drug-alcohol interactions, adverse drug effects, and other alcohol-induced disorders with P450-dependent pathogenesis. Elaboration of the concept of function and regulation of the human drug-metabolizing ensemble as an integral multi-enzyme system, which is the long-term goal of our studies, is a matter of critical importance for in-depth understanding of the changes in human drug metabolism under influence of alcohol exposure and establishing a rational approach for optimal drug use under chronic alcohol exposure.",10756772 (contact);11581716,"DAVYDOV, DMITRI R (contact);PRASAD, BHAGWAT","MURRAY, GARY",2022-09-13,2026-08-31,Adverse drug effect;Adverse effects;Affect;alcohol abuse therapy;Alcohol consumption;Alcohol dependence;alcohol effect;alcohol exposure;alcohol use disorder;Alcohol withdrawal syndrome;Alcohol-Induced Disorders;Alcohols;AODR mortality;Biological Assay;carcinogenesis;Chemicals;Chronic;Clinical;Cocaine;Collection;Complex;crosslink;CYP1A2 gene;CYP2C19 gene;CYP2C9 gene;CYP2D6 gene;CYP2E1 gene;CYP3A4 gene;Cytochrome P450;Diazepam;Drug Interactions;Drug Kinetics;drug metabolism;Drug Metabolism Induction;drug of abuse;Drug Prescriptions;Drug usage;Eicosanoids;Endoplasmic Reticulum;Enzyme Induction;Enzymes;Foundations;Genotype;Goals;Health;Hepatocyte;high throughput screening;Human;Hypertension;Individual;insight;intermolecular interaction;interspecies communication;Knowledge;Knowledge acquisition;Life;Liver;Liver Microsomes;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Mediating;Medical;Membrane;Metabolic;Metabolism;Minor;Opioid;Pathogenesis;Pharmaceutical Preparations;pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics;pharmacologic;Phenytoin;Physiological;Play;Preparation;Prevention;Property;protein expression;protein protein interaction;Proteins;Proteomics;Public Health;Recording of previous events;Regulation;Research;Role;Route;Series;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Substrate Specificity;System;Systems Integration;Therapeutic;Tissues;Tolbutamide;Tretinoin;Warfarin,Inter-Enzyme Crosstalk in the Cytochrome P450 Ensemble: Implications for the Effects of Alcohol on Drug Metabolism and Alcohol-Drug Interactions,30155,XNDA,Xenobiotic and Nutrient Disposition and Action Study Section[XNDA],NA,NA,3,320135,169672,489807,NA

One under explored areas in obesity-related pathophysiology changes is the defects in mucosal innate immunity as we have previously shown, using Paneth cells as a proof-of-concept. Identifying the causes of how obesogenic diet reduces Paneth cell function will provide insight into the development of intervention strategies for diseases of which Paneth cells play a critical role, such as inflammatory bowel disease, graft versus host disease, and gut infection. Our preliminary data suggests that diet-induced obesity (due to western diet [WD] consumption) leads to Paneth cell dysfunction in both humans and mice by activating FXR signaling in the intestinal epithelium and myeloid cells. Upon conclusion, we will establish how dietary fructose (a key ingredient in WD) triggers Paneth cell defects, and determine the mechanisms by which Paneth cells themselves and intestinal stem cells repair defective Paneth cells in the context of long-term WD/HFrD consumption.
