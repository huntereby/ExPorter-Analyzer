Attention has focused on understanding the problems with glucose or lipid metabolism separately but the mechanistic links between these pathways are poorly understood. We recently discovered a new class of lipids that have beneficial metabolic and anti-inflammatory effects. The levels of these lipids are low in people who are at risk for, or have, type 2 diabetes.

The statistical analysis along with further reviews may lead to changes in budgeting allocations and even suspension for providers with extremely poor outcomes. Existing profiling approaches typically assume that the risk adjustment is perfect, and the between-provider variation is entirely due to the quality of care, which, however, is often invalid. In addition, analyzing large-scale databases introduces computational difficulties, particularly when the event of interest is recurrent, and the numbers of sample size and the dimension of parameters are large. How to integrate streaming recurrent event data adds another level of difficulty. In view of these difficulties. Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed how healthcare care is delivered. It is crucial that the profiling methods account for temporal and geospatial variation and accurately evaluate providers’ performance during the pandemic.

Action of these antibodies release this predominant otopathogen from its protected residence within the biofilm into a highly vulnerable ‘newly released’ (NRel) state, a recently discovered phenotype which is the most sensitive to killing by traditional antibiotics, and extends our understanding beyond the heretofore believed duality that bacteria responsible for chronic and recurrent diseases exist only in either a ‘planktonic’ or ‘biofilm-resident’ state. In consideration of a recent paradigm shift, wherein thought leaders have challenged us to consider new ways to combine the power of induced immunity with the more considered use of antibiotics as our “last hope against multi-drug resistant bacteria and persistent disease” as a means to achieve the strongest possible therapeutic outcome, herein we have designed studies that will expand upon compelling preliminary data to use specifically targeted antibodies to force recalcitrant biofilm-resident NTHI into the highly vulnerable NRel state so they can now be readily eliminated, and thereby leverage our new understanding to more effectively combat NTHI-induced OM and multiple other diseases caused by this high priority, antibiotic-resistant pathogen.",1955293 (contact),"BAKALETZ, LAUREN O (contact)","WATSON, BRACIE",1999-09-30,2026-03-31,3-Dimensional;Acute;Affect;Aggressive course;Anatomy;Antibiotic Resistance;Antibiotics;Antibodies;antimicrobial;Bacteria;Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance;Biology;Black race;burden of illness;Characteristics;Child;Chronic;Chronic Disease;chronic infection;Clinical;combat;combinatorial;Complex;cost;Data;design;Development;Diarrhea;Disease;Dose;drug resistant pathogen;effective therapy;Equilibrium;Exanthema;follow-up;Future;Gene Expression;genetic risk factor;Goals;gut microbiome;Haemophilus influenza virulence;Human;human disease;Immune;Immune system;Immunity;Immunologics;Immunology;In Vitro;in vitro Assay;in vivo;Incidence;Individual;Intervention;Kinetics;Life;Mediating;Microbial Biofilms;Microbiology;middle ear;Moraxella catarrhalis;Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance;Nature;neonate;Nontypable Haemophilus influenza;novel;novel drug class;novel strategies;Oral;Otitis;Otitis Media;Otorrhea;pathogen;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Phenotype;Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine;polymicrobial biofilm;Population;Preclinical Testing;prevent;Prevention;Process;Proteins;Published Comment;Recurrence;Recurrent disease;recurrent infection;Research Design;residence;Resistance;response;Serum;socioeconomics;Streptococcus pneumoniae;structural biology;success;Suppurative Otitis Media;Systems Development;therapeutically effective;therapy outcome;Time;Translating;Tube;Tympanostomy;vaccine development;Vaccines;Vulnerable Populations;Writing,Determinants of H. influenzae Virulence in Otitis Media,3915,HIBP,Host Interactions with Bacterial Pathogens Study Section[HIBP],NA,NA,24,409102,220915,630017,NA

Based on its novel mechanism of action and pre-clinical demonstrations of stand-alone therapeutic efficacy and synergy with other oncologic therapeutics, our goal is to advance 64B into clinical trials for use in humans in combination with another oncologic therapeutic drug to improve quality of life and longevity in patients with high risk and metastatic UM.",16096449 (contact),"OFFERMANN, MARGARET KENNY (contact)","ZHAO, MING",2020-09-17,2025-03-31,acute toxicity;Adult;Alabama;amorphous solid;Antitumor Response;BAY 54-9085;Behavioral;bHLH-PAS factor HLF;Body Weight decreased;Bolus Infusion;cancer cell;Canis familiaris;catalyst;Cell Line;Cell Survival;cell type;Cells;Chemistry;Chromatography;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;cofactor;Combined Modality Therapy;Complement;Coupled;CRISPR/Cas technology;Development;Dose;efficacy study;EP300 gene;Excipients;Eye;Formulation;Funding;Genetic Transcription;Goals;high risk;Human;Hypoxia Inducible Factor;hypoxia inducible factor 1;Implant;improved;in vivo;inhibitor;innovation;insight;Laboratories;Liver;Longevity;malignant neoplasm of eye;Malignant Neoplasms;manufacture;manufacturing process;Maximum Tolerated Dose;Melanoma Cell;Metabolic;Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver;Methods;Microscopic;microwave electromagnetic radiation;Modeling;mouse model;Mus;Neoplasm Metastasis;neoplastic cell;novel;Operative Surgical Procedures;Oral;Oral Administration;Organ;Palladium;parenteral administration;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;phase 2 study;Plasma;pre-clinical;Pre-Clinical Model;preclinical study;prevent;Primary Neoplasm;Process;Production;Protocols documentation;Publishing;Quality of life;Radiation;Rattus;recruit;research clinical testing;response;Role;Secure;Small Business Innovation Research Grant;small molecule therapeutics;Solubility;synergism;Testing;Therapeutic;Toxic effect;Toxicology;transcription factor;Treatment Efficacy;tumor;tumor behavior;tumor growth;Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor;Uvea;Uveal Melanoma;Work,Arylsulfonamides for the Treatment of Primary and Metastatic Uveal Melanoma,254756,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-CTH-T(10)B],NA,NA,3,714839,244637,1025001,NA

Success of ML techniques for medical image interpretation may reduce the burden on radiologists, reducing errors arising from fatigue or interruption, while simultaneously reducing costs and increasing speed and accuracy for patients. The cost and difficulty of generating expert quality labelled image data is the primary limitation preventing faster progress and deployment in more domains. We propose to address this problem by creating innovative algorithms that will construct reference quality labelled data with little input from domain experts, thus dramatically reducing the cost of labelling. These fundamental advances in informatics algorithms will reduce the cost and increase the rate of obtaining quality labels, which will in turn facilitate the widespread adoption and deployment of machine learning algorithms for image interpretation.

We recently reported the structural features of exon 20 mutations that cause steric hindrance and prevent FDA-approved drugs from inhibiting the receptor effectively, and identified poziotinib as a drug with activity in exon 20 mutant patients (43% objective response rate) but with several limitations including lower potency for mutations in the “far loop” region of exon 20 and toxicity due to inhibition of wild-type EGFR.

Despite that these mutations are thought to be functionally expressed throughout an organism’s lifetime, the disease can be “concealed,” and specifically, patients do not always exhibit a diagnostic ECG, which suggests that mechanisms for treating the disease are in fact tied to the mechanisms that conceal the disease.

By characterizing the contribution of gabapentinoids to the abuse-related and toxic effects of opioids, these studies will help guide regulatory agencies and practitioners confront this unexplored and underappreciated misuse of FDA-approved medications that is contributing to the opioid crisis. 1",15584700 (contact),"HIRANITA, TAKATO  (contact)","VEMURI, KIRAN R V",2023-04-01,2028-01-31,Accounting;Address;Adverse effects;Advocacy;American;Area;Attention;Attenuated;Autopsy;Behavior;Biological Assay;Breathing;Buprenorphine;Cessation of life;Classification;Clinical;Clinical Trials;clinically relevant;Cocaine;cocaine self-administration;Convulsions;COVID-19 pandemic;Data;Dependence;Development;drug discrimination;Drug usage;epidemiologic data;experience;FDA approved;Female;Fentanyl;fentanyl seeking;fentanyl self-administration;gabapentin;General Population;Health;Heroin;Individual;Life Expectancy;Literature;male;medication-assisted treatment;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality;mu opioid receptors;Naloxone;naloxone dosing;non-opioid analgesic;off-label use;Opiate Addiction;Opioid;Opioid agonist;opioid epidemic;opioid exposure;opioid misuse;opioid mortality;opioid overdose;opioid use;opioid withdrawal;Overdose;overdose death;pandemic disease;Parents;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physical Dependence;Pilot Projects;Policies;Predisposition;pregabalin;prescription opioid;pressure;Procedures;Public Health;Rattus;Recording of previous events;Relaxation;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;respiratory;response;Risk;Risk Assessment;Risk Factors;Schedule;Seizures;Self Administration;sex;Stimulus;Substance Use Disorder;Testing;Time;Toxic effect;Toxicology;United States National Institutes of Health;Ventilatory Depression;Withdrawal,Gabapentinoid/opioid mixtures: abuse and toxicity,58018,BRLE,"Biobehavioral Regulation, Learning and Ethology Study Section[BRLE]",NA,NA,2,255959,140777,396736,NA

The overall goal of this project is to determine whether a new form of family-based treatment for repetitive behaviors, delivered using videoconferencing technology, can counter any negative effects of repetitive behavior, but also improve positive outcomes for young children with ASD.",9084864 (contact),"BOYD, BRIAN ANTONIO (contact)","KAU, ALICE S",2021-04-10,2026-03-31,"Acute;Aftercare;Anxiety;anxiety symptoms;autism spectrum disorder;autism symptoms;autistic children;Behavior;Behavior Therapy;Behavioral;behavioral study;Caregivers;Caring;Categories;Cellular Phone;Child;Child Behavior;child services;Clinical Treatment;communication behavior;comorbidity;comparison group;COVID-19;COVID-19 pandemic;Cues;design;Distal;Education;Educational process of instructing;effective therapy;Effectiveness;Environment;Ethnic Origin;experience;falls;Family;Feeling;flexibility;follow-up;Functional impairment;Goals;implementation intervention;improved;interest;Intervention;Intervention Studies;Knowledge;Learning;Link;lower income families;Marital Status;Mediating;Modeling;neglect;neurobehavioral;novel;Outcome;pandemic disease;Parenting Education;Parents;personalized intervention;Persons;Pilot Projects;pilot test;Play;Probability;psychiatric comorbidity;Race;Randomized, Controlled Trials;reduce symptoms;remote delivery;remote intervention;repetitive behavior;Reporting;Research;Rewards;Role;Sample Size;Secure;Services;skills;social communication;Stress;Surveys;Symptoms;Technology;technology intervention;telehealth;Therapeutic;Time;Translational Research;treatment effect;treatment research;treatment response;trial comparing;uptake;Videoconferencing",Parent implemented treatment for repetitive behaviors in children with ASD: Using a novel telehealth approach to increase service access,105036,CPDD,Child Psychopathology and Developmental Disabilities Study Section[CPDD],NA,NA,4,382006,91011,473017,NA

Recently a group of viruses, the Matryoshka RNA viruses (MaRNAV), has been identified that is associated with the human pathogen Plasmodium vivax, and also the distantly related avian pathogen Leucocytozoon. Thus, it is clear that these viruses are ancient in their origin, but nearly nothing is known about their affects on malaria- infected hosts. We will test the hypothesis that the Matryoshka RNA viruses have a deep evolutionary history, and can affect the pathogenicity of malaria parasites. Using a bioinformatics approach, we will compare the transcriptomes of avian malaria pathogens and identify the prevalence and diversity of these viruses. We will also seek to understand how malaria infections affect specific components of the avian immune response. The proposed research is timely and significant in that it will advance the field of malaria research by providing important information about the evolution of the immune response to this common parasite. This work is innovative because birds provide the only model system where the MaRNAV viruses can be easily studied in natural populations infected by a diverse group of haemosporidian parasites. The long-term and cross-disciplinary goal of this research agenda is to elucidate the evolution of malaria pathogenicity and identify conserved viruses and immune responses that may be overlooked using mammalian model systems. The aims of the proposal are to: 1. Sequence the complete transcriptomes of select birds to determine the prevalence and diversity of malaria-associated viruses. 2. Characterize differences in immune responses between malaria- infected and non-infected avian hosts. 3. Determine whether malaria-associated viruses alter the host immune response to parasite infection. The project will support the education of future scientists through an integrative approach to research and education. It will train students in cutting edge technologies associated with infectious disease research, and provide valuable experiences for graduate and undergraduate students at an urban university serving large numbers of students traditionally underrepresented in the sciences. The developmental objectives of the PI will be met by working with outstanding collaborators, which will further his training in the molecular genetics of malaria.",9344383 (contact),"SEHGAL, RAVINDER NATH MARIUS (contact)","KRASNEWICH, DONNA M",2022-05-01,2026-03-31,Admission activity;Affect;Avian Malaria;Bioinformatics;Biological Models;Biomedical Research;Birds;Blood;career;Collaborations;Culicidae;Development;Disease;Distant;Doctor of Philosophy;Education;Epidemiology;Evolution;expectation;experience;fitness;Future;Gene Expression;Goals;graduate student;Health;High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing;Human;human pathogen;Immune response;Immune Response Genes;infected vector rodent;Infection;Infectious Diseases Research;innovation;Insecta;Laboratories;Malaria;malaria infection;Methods;Modeling;Molecular Genetics;next generation sequencing;Parasitemia;Parasites;Parasitic infection;pathogen;Pathogenicity;Persons;Phylogeny;Plasmodium;Plasmodium gallinaceum;Plasmodium vivax;Population;Prevalence;programs;Publishing;Recording of previous events;Research;response;RNA Viruses;Satellite Viruses;Science;Scientist;Sporozoites;student training;Students;System;Technology;Testing;Training;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing;undergraduate student;underrepresented minority student;Universities;Virus;wild bird;Work,Molecular Genetics of Avian Malaria Viruses,144187,ZGM1,ZGM1-RCB-7(CM),NA,NA,3,75000,41250,116250,NA

As such, primary prevention of breast cancer in women at increased risk with an agent that is safe and well tolerated is highly desirable. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, demonstrate anti-cancer activity in breast cancer models, with observational evidence that supports lower odds of breast cancer among regular users. We have found that the NSAID sulindac, after one year of use, significantly reduces breast density, an established risk factor for breast cancer, and changes the structure of collagen in breast tissue in women taking aromatase inhibitors for the treatment of their breast cancer when compared to a control group. We propose a clinical trial using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and tissue biopsy to test the effect of sulindac on breast density and breast tissue in women at increased risk of breast cancer and we will compare its activity on breast density and breast tissue to aspirin and a control group. Ours is the first evidence of an effect of an NSAID on breast density, an established risk factor for breast cancer. Furthering our understanding of this activity is important to advancing the beneficial actions of NSAIDs observed in epidemiologic and animal studies to primary breast cancer chemoprevention in patients at increased risk of developing breast cancer.",1889798;7903130 (contact),"STOPECK, ALISON T.;THOMPSON, PATRICIA ANN (contact)","SAUTER, EDWARD RICHARD",2019-09-20,2025-02-28,"Adipose tissue;Animal Model;Animals;anti-cancer;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;anticancer activity;antitumor effect;arm;Aromatase;Aromatase Inhibition;Aromatase Inhibitors;Arthritis;Aspirin;Biological Markers;Biopsy;Breast;Breast biopsy;Breast Cancer Model;Breast Cancer Prevention;Breast Cancer Prevention Trial;Breast Cancer Risk Factor;breast density;breast imaging;cancer care;cancer chemoprevention;Cancer Etiology;cancer recurrence;Carcinoma;Cd68;Cell model;Cessation of life;Chemopreventive Agent;Clinical Trials;Collagen;comparison control;Contralateral Breast;Control Groups;Core Biopsy;cyclooxygenase 2;Data;Dinoprostone;Disease;Dose;Drug usage;Early Diagnosis;Early treatment;epidemiologic data;Epidemiology;Estradiol;Estrogen receptor positive;Familial Adenomatous Polyposis Syndrome;Funding;Generations;Grant;group intervention;High Risk Woman;Image;Individual;inhibitor therapy;innovation;interest;Intervention;Investigation;Iron;Lasers;Macrophage;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Malignant Breast Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammary Gland Parenchyma;Mammography;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Measures;Mediating;Medical Care Costs;Methods;Microscopy;Minor;Morbidity - disease rate;Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents;novel;open label;Pain;Patient Agents;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Postmenopause;pre-clinical;Pre-Clinical Model;prevent;Prevention;primary endpoint;Primary Prevention;Prodrugs;Prostaglandin Inhibition;Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase;psychosocial;Quality of life;Randomized;Research Priority;Risk;second harmonic;side effect;Slide;Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization;Structure;Sulindac;Survivors;Testing;three-arm study;three-arm trial;Tissues;treatment arm;trial comparing;tumor;Woman;Women&apos;s mortality","Three-Arm randomized trial comparing the effect of aspirin, sulindac or no treatment control on breast density in patients with elevated breast cancer risk",235720,CPSS,Cancer Prevention Study Section[CPSS],NA,NA,5,413914,183145,597059,NA
