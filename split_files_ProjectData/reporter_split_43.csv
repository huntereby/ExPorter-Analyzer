Recurrent disease is thought to be powered by a process known as dormancy, which is when disseminated cancer cells from primary tumors temporarily inactivate and later re-awaken in a metastatic form; despite known to occur for over 60 years, our understanding of the molecular circuits that regulate this process is very limited, which has hindered the development of efficacious therapeutics that target disease relapse and prevent patient mortality. Here, we aim to gain a deep understanding of the cell-intrinsic pathways that drive dormancy and allow breast cancer cells to retain vitality in this state as well as how these cell-intrinsic pathways are fine-tuned by the environment at secondary organs with the overarching goal of unveiling new therapeutic targets for inactive breast cancer cells and thereby lead to the development of targeted therapies that can effectively prevent recurrent metastatic disease in breast cancer patients.",12261871 (contact),"DA SILVA GOMES, ANA  (contact)","AULT, GRACE S",2024-07-03,2029-06-30,Adjuvant Therapy;Affect;Biology;Breast;Breast Cancer Cell;breast cancer metastasis;Breast Cancer Patient;breast cancer progression;cancer cell;Cell Cycle;Cell Cycle Progression;Cell Reprogramming;Cells;Characteristics;Chromatin;chromatin remodeling;Clinical;Complex;CXCL5 gene;Data;Deposition;Development;Disease;Disease remission;Down-Regulation;Environment;Environmental Risk Factor;Epigenetic Process;Event;Fibroblasts;Foundations;Future;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Histone H3;Histone H3.3;Histones;Homeostasis;Hypoxia;intravital imaging;Knowledge;Lead;Lung;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Breast Neoplasm;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolic Pathway;Metabolic stress;Metastatic breast cancer;Metastatic/Recurrent;Molecular;Molecular Chaperones;mortality;Nature;Neoplasm Metastasis;new therapeutic target;Operative Surgical Procedures;Organ;Oxidation-Reduction;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Patient Care;Patients;Physiological;Positioning Attribute;prevent;Primary Neoplasm;Process;programs;Proliferating;Promoter Regions;Publishing;Pulmonary Fibrosis;Recurrence;Recurrent disease;Regulation;Resistance;response;Role;Site;standard of care;System;targeted treatment;Testing;Therapeutic;therapeutic target;therapy resistant;Time;tumorigenesis;tumorigenic;Variant;Woman;Work,Epigenetic and metabolic bottlenecks of tumorigenesis,279023,TEHM,"Tumor Evolution, Heterogeneity and Metastasis Study Section[TEHM]",NA,A1,1,405741,234049,639790,NA

Although crucial for current cancer therapy, the conventional anticancer drugs used to kill tumor cells and damage healthy cells, wreaking havoc on the rest of the body, decreasing treatment efficacy, and favoring de novo carcinogenesis. Especially in hard-to-treat cancers such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the limitation of the current treatments leads patients to believe, at present, that surgical resection is the only potential cure. Regrettably, only 15-20% of the cases are resectable, the recurrence rate is still high, and the unavoidable rates of long-term survival are dismal.

We propose that new findings emerging from this project may lead to new therapeutic opportunities for effectively treating those cancers that harbor PI3K pathway lesions.,1862396 (contact),"TOKER, ALEX  (contact)","XU, WANPING",2020-09-01,2027-08-31,addiction;AKT inhibition;AKT Signaling Pathway;Area;carbohydrate metabolism;cell growth;cell motility;Cell Proliferation;Cell Reprogramming;Cellular Metabolic Process;Chemicals;CRISPR screen;Cytostatics;cytotoxic;Development;Endoplasmic Reticulum;endoplasmic reticulum stress;Enzymes;experience;FRAP1 gene;Gene Combinations;Gene Targeting;Genetic;genetic approach;glycosylation;Goals;Growth Factor;Hematologic Neoplasms;Human;inhibitor;insight;Interruption;Laboratories;Lesion;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Mediating;Metabolic Pathway;mouse model;novel;novel therapeutics;Oncogenes;Oncogenic;Pathway interactions;Phenotype;Phosphatidylinositols;Phosphotransferases;PIK3CG gene;protein folding;Protein Glycosylation;Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt;Regulation;response;Signal Transduction;small molecule inhibitor;Solid;targeted treatment;treatment response;tumor initiation;tumor progression;tumorigenesis;Validation;virtual;Vision;Work,"Discovery, Regulation and Function of the PI 3-Kinase and AKT Pathway in Cancer",253097,ZCA1,ZCA1-GRB-S(M1),NA,NA,5,570001,427500,997501,NA

Of major concern, the incidence of symptomatic atherosclerosis in younger individuals is rising at an alarming rate primarily due to the global epidemic of obesity and early onset type 2 (insulin resistant) diabetes (T2D) and the associated metabolic disease (MetD) characterized by insulin resistance and increases in blood glucose, insulin, triglycerides, and cholesterol levels. Indeed, numerous high quality studies provide evidence that each of these factors may contribute to accelerated atherosclerosis development, progression, and end stage disease pathogenesis including rupture of the protective fibrous cap overlying advanced atherosclerotic lesions resulting in a heart attack or stroke. However, a major unresolved question is which if any of the T2D/MetD associated changes impair the ability of smooth muscle cells (SMC) or other cell types to form and maintain the protective fibrous cap. The goals of studies in this proposal are to address this question, and to identify novel therapeutic approaches to enhance the ability of these cells to form and maintain a thick and mechanically robust fibrous cap (i.e. analogous to a stronger patch on a tire) even in the context of T2D/MetD.",6398572 (contact),"OWENS, GARY K (contact)","CHEN, JUE",2023-07-15,2027-06-30,Acceleration;Address;aerobic glycolysis;Antibodies;Aorta;Arterial Fatty Streak;Atherosclerosis;Black race;Blood Glucose;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cardiovascular system;Carotid Endarterectomy;Cause of Death;Cd68;Cell Differentiation process;Cell Lineage;cell type;Cells;Characteristics;Cholesterol;Collagen;cytokine;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;diabetic;diabetic patient;Dose;Down-Regulation;early onset;end stage disease;Endothelial Cells;Event;Female;femoral artery;Foam Cells;Genes;Genomics;Glucose;glucose uptake;Goals;Grant;Hemorrhage;High Prevalence;Histologic;Human;human female;Hyperglycemia;Hyperlipidemia;Immune;Impairment;Incidence;indexing;Individual;Inflammatory;Injury;Insulin;Insulin Receptor;insulin receptor substrate 1 protein;Insulin Resistance;insulin secretion;Insulin-Like Growth Factor I;Insulin-Like-Growth Factor I Receptor;interest;Interleukin-1 beta;Investments;IRS2 gene;Knock-out;Knockout Mice;LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins;Lesion;Lesion by Stage;Life Style Modification;Lipids;Macrophage;Maintenance;Mechanics;Metabolic;Metabolic Diseases;Metabolic dysfunction;Metabolic syndrome;mortality;multiplexed imaging;Mus;Myocardial Infarction;Myofibroblast;Nature;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;Obesity Epidemic;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Phenotype;Proteins;PTPN6 gene;Receptor Signaling;Resistance;Role;Rupture;Sampling;Scaffolding Protein;sex;Signal Transduction;single-cell RNA sequencing;Smooth Muscle Myocytes;Stains;Streptozocin;Stroke;Sudan;Testing;Thick;Thinness;Triglycerides;validation studies;women versus men,Role of Smooth Muscle Cell Insulin Resistance and Systemic Metabolic Dysfunction in Atherosclerosis Development and Late Stage Lesion Pathogenesis,166161,AVI,Atherosclerosis and Vascular Inflammation Study Section[AVI],NA,NA,2,489609,296114,785723,NA

Precise conversion between neuron subtypes can be induced within the developing brain, but not in mature neurons.

There is currently no effective treatment for age-associated dementia and no therapies for Alzheimer’s disease. Our long-standing interest in the meninges and its role in brain function has led us to characterize meningeal lymphatic vessels and to observe many intriguing changes in meningeal immunity with age, and accordingly to raise the questions: are meningeal immune and lymphatic alterations relevant to age-related cognitive decline? If so, could meningeal lymphatic vessels or meningeal immune cells be therapeutically targeted to alleviate age-related dementia and/or Alzheimer’s disease? Here, we will elucidate the role of meningeal vasculature and immunity in age-associated cognitive decline, dementia and mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease using state-of-the-art imaging, surgical and pharmacological techniques in mice, as well as a validation of select findings in human dura specimens from fresh autopsies.

Therefore, multi-drug resistant A. baumannii infections present an enormous ongoing challenge and the development of novel approaches to treat these pathogens is an area of acute medical need.",1878440 (contact),"MELANDER, CHRISTIAN COREY (contact)","XU, ZUOYU",2022-09-20,2027-07-31,Acinetobacter baumannii;Acute;Address;Adjuvant;Adjuvant Study;alternative treatment;Anabolism;analog;Animals;anti-microbial drug;Antibiotic Resistance;antibiotic resistant infections;Antibiotics;Area;Bacteria;Bacterial Infections;Baltimore;beta-Lactams;Binding Proteins;Biogenesis;Biological Assay;carbapenem resistance;Carbapenems;Clarithromycin;Clinical;clinically relevant;Colistin;colistin resistance;combat;Consensus;Coupled;Data;Death Rate;design;Development;Dose;Drug Interactions;Drug Kinetics;Evaluation;Goals;Gram-Negative Bacteria;Health care facility;In Vitro;in vitro activity;in vivo;Infection;Intensive Care Units;Lead;lead optimization;Life;Lipid A;lipooligosaccharide;Lung;Macrolides;Maryland;Measures;Medical;member;Membrane;Membrane Proteins;Metabolic;Metabolism;Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement;Modeling;Molecular Target;mouse model;Multi-Drug Resistance;Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter;Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;O Antigens;optimal treatments;Outcome;outcome prediction;pathogen;pathogenic bacteria;Permeability;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Plasma;Plasma Proteins;Predisposition;Production;programs;Proteins;Protocols documentation;Public Health;Reporting;Research;Research Institute;Resistance;resistance frequency;resistance gene;resistance mechanism;Scourge;side effect;small molecule;Structure;Structure-Activity Relationship;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissues;Toxic effect;treatment choice;Universities;Vancomycin;Virulence;Work,Repurposing Gram-positive Antibiotics for Gram-Negative Bacteria using Antibiotic Adjuvants,167284,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-DDR-C(01)],NA,NA,3,591158,143196,734354,NA

Our findings indicate that stem cell pathways involving cell metabolism, DNA regulation, and cell-cell communication may underlie defective wound healing. Our research proposal is designed to explore this hypothesis with the overarching goal of developing new approaches that will pave the way for stem cell-directed combined therapies that will accelerate wound healing and potentially even repair and restore age-damaged skin.",8148663;1861046 (contact),"FRANK, MARKUS H.;MURPHY, GEORGE F (contact)","KATIYAR, PRAGATI",2022-09-30,2027-05-31,Acceleration;Address;Affect;Age;age effect;age related;age related changes;aged;Aging;Animals;Appearance;Atrophic;authority;Bioinformatics;Biology;biomarker discovery;Cell Communication;Cells;Cellular Metabolic Process;Chronic;chronic ulcer;Clinical;cofactor;combinatorial;Combined Modality Therapy;comorbidity;COVID-19;Cutaneous;Data;decubitus ulcer;Defect;Dermal;design;Detection;Development;DNA;editorial;Elderly;Epidemic;epidermal stem cell;Epigenetic Process;epigenomics;Evaluation;Evolution;Functional disorder;Generations;Genomics;Goals;healing;Health;health care service utilization;Human;Human Resources;in vivo;Individual;Institution;Left;Maintenance;Maps;Membrane Transport Proteins;Metabolic;metabolomics;Methods;middle age;mouse model;multidisciplinary;Natural regeneration;neglect;Normal tissue morphology;novel;novel strategies;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Phenotype;Physiological;pluripotency;Population;Premature aging syndrome;Prevention;Productivity;psychosocial;receptor;Receptor Cell;Records;regeneration potential;regenerative;regenerative cell;Regenerative response;Regulation;repaired;Research;Research Personnel;Research Proposals;Resources;response;restoration;Role;Severities;Skin;skin damage;Skin injury;skin ulcer;Societies;Source;stem cell biology;stem cell fate;stem cell function;Stem cell pluripotency;stem cells;success;synergism;targeted treatment;Technology;Therapeutic;Therapeutically Targetable;Thinness;tissue injury;tissue repair;United States;wound;wound healing;wound treatment;Youth,Multicomponent Therapy for Age-related Skin Stem Cell Deficiency,71463,ZAG1,ZAG1-ZIJ-G(M2),NA,NA,3,1963014,268800,2231814,NA

The UM Pepper Center will emphasize its theme by conducting research that will improve understanding of how metabolic factors and inflammation interact with age-related diseases and comorbidities to determine key health outcomes related to mobility and functional status. OAIC Research Education Core (REC) training activities will help OAIC junior faculty participants apply basic findings to clinical investigation, explore mechanisms underlying clinical and epidemiological findings, and translate basic and clinical findings to a broader older adult community. The Pilot and Exploratory Studies Core (PESC) will generate high quality innovative pilot research related to the OAIC theme. The OAIC Biomechanics Core (BC) will assist and train investigators in the conduct of new and expanded research on how metabolic disease and inflammation interact with age-related disease to determine key health outcomes related to mobility and functional status, the biomechanics of aging. The Biomechanics Core will also contribute to the training of geriatricians and other clinicians in the biomechanics relevant to impaired mobility, falls and fall-related injuries, urinary incontinence and prolapse in older people. The OAIC Core Facility for Aged Rodents (CFAR) will develop new varieties of mice that provide insight into the causes and possible treatments of late-life human diseases to help improve clinical care of older people and suggest ways to prevent illness in this population. The OAIC Human Subjects and Assessment Core (HSAC) will provide the infrastructure and ‘know how’ to accelerate development and translation of basic research to prevent, delay, and treat age-related disabilities and diseases relevant to the theme of the OAIC. The HSAC will be a critical resource for junior investigators engaging in clinical aging research, and provide laboratory researchers new to clinical studies the support they need to engage in human work.

We will employ remote, unsupervised, web-based cognitive testing to quantify individualized multi-day learning curves (MDLC) on memory and processing speed tests, repeated daily for 10 minutes/day over one week to determine whether MDLC, in contrast with standard cognitive assessments, are associated with AD biomarkers, predictive of prospective cognitive decline and clinical progression, and more sensitive indicators of change when captured semi-annually; we will assess this first leveraging well-characterized older adults with molecular neuroimaging AD biomarkers spanning the AD continuum from cognitively unimpaired (CU) to subjective cognitive decline (SCD) to Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) (n=250) and subsequently determine if findings are generalizable to a larger (n=400) more diverse (>24% URG) community cohort of CU older adults with novel plasma AD biomarkers. Ultimately, we seek to provide a rapidly obtainable, repeatable, high-resolution snapshot of clinically relevant memory decrements across the very early AD continuum to facilitate early detection of worrisome memory decrements in the general population and to provide a more sensitive method to monitor cognitive change.",11753318 (contact),"PAPP, KATHRYN VICTORIA (contact)","WAGSTER, MOLLY V",2024-07-01,2029-03-31,Acceleration;Acquaintances;Alzheimer disease detection;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Alzheimer&apos;s disease pathology;Alzheimer’s disease biomarker;Amyloid beta-42;Amyloid beta-Protein;Area;Area Under Curve;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Blood;Boston;Clinic;Clinical;clinically relevant;Cognitive;cognitive change;cognitive testing;cohort;Communities;Data;Deposition;Detection;Devices;digital;Disease;Early Diagnosis;Early identification;Early treatment;Evaluation;experience;Face;formycin triphosphate;Future;General Population;Gold;Growth;Health;Image;Impaired cognition;improved;Individual;Learning;Life;Measures;Memory;memory consolidation;Memory Loss;Methods;mild cognitive impairment;Molecular;Monitor;Names;Neurocognitive;neuroimaging;novel;older adult;Online Systems;Outcome;Paper;Participant;Pattern;Performance;Plasma;Positron-Emission Tomography;pre-clinical;Prevention;processing speed;prospective;Reaction Time;recruit;remote assessment;Research Personnel;Resolution;response;Risk;screening;standard measure;Stimulus;Symptoms;tau Proteins;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;Time;time interval;treatment response;Underrepresented Populations;web platform;Work;β-amyloid burden,Ahead of the Curve: Early detection and monitoring of learning decrements in Alzheimers disease,84017,CNN,Clinical Neuroscience and Neurodegeneration Study Section[CNN],NA,A1,1,497432,369675,867107,NA

Specifically, the CEC will implement a ‘community-centered’ multi-level and multi-domain participant-centric strategy to engage AA and Hispanic communities a) in the development of culturally appropriate interventions for genomic education; b) to promote their recruitment and retention in genomics research; and c) facilitate the translations and dissemination of study results. Advances in genomics have increased our understanding of the unique interplay between genetics, environment, behavior, and disease, which has led to the advancement of clinical-trial matching and precision health (medicine and prevention). However, these scientific advances are hampered by the inadequate representation of AA and Hispanic populations in genomic research studies; thus, it is paramount to identify effective engagement strategies to increase genomic knowledge and research participation among AA and Hispanic populations. The inclusion of these populations will help us understand the genomic contributions to certain diseases, increase representation of these groups in genomic research, thereby reducing health disparities and advancing health equity. We will train an existing cadre of lay community navigators as genomic navigators (GNs) to deliver relevant education and provide navigation services, to two populations historically underrepresented in genomic research. We seek to standardize the genomic education provided to AA and Hispanic participants by equipping each GN with evidence-based educational resources on genomics and research participation developed by the National Human Genome Institute (NHGRI). Based on previous work, we will culturally adapt the educational materials to multiple media content (audio and video) delivered via mobile tablet technology. It is expected the GNs will provide education and logistical support to AAs and Hispanics interested in participating in genomic research in rural and urban areas. Of note, the GNs will also address AA and Hispanic beliefs, values, attitudes, and preferences related to participation in research. The CEC will deploy evidence-based strategies and tactics for engaging all elements of our defined community. Historically, we have had success in enrolling and retaining AA and Hispanic members of our community by ensuring that they can trust our processes to protect their privacy and return value for their participation. Value in this instance goes beyond a transactional return of value to a more sustained return of value based on a deep understanding of community needs. The engagement framework incorporates the right people (roles), processes and platforms to ensure reproducible results. The Specific Aims guiding the Core activities are: Aim 1: Enhance sustainable partnerships with statewide community- and faith-based organizations through a Community Advisory Board to facilitate a series of structured educational sessions (townhalls) to address bioethics concerns and issues of trust relative to AA and Hispanics participation in genomic research. Aim 2: Implement multi-level engagement strategies, Genomic Navigators, to promote genomics research education and awareness, recruitment, and retention of study participants, and address social determinants of health. Aim 3: Evaluation of Core activities and dissemination of information to diverse stakeholders including Community members, Partner organizations, and relevant Service organizations or Policymakers, as well as the scientific community. Significance. The activities outlined in this proposal are congruent with the strategies in the Diversity Centers for Genome Research RFA listed for the Community Engagement Core: Applicants should describe strategies for recruiting and maintaining long-term relationships with communities to enhance genomic knowledge, integration with Center research projects, promotion of participation in genomics research and recruitment and retention of study participants and dissemination of information and data generated by the Center. Despite NIH mandates for adequate representation of all populations in research, AA and Hispanic populations remain largely under-represented, particularly in genomic research and clinical trials. Having a community advisory board (CAB) guided multi-level approach will lead to increased awareness, opportunity, and participation in genomic research among a diverse population of AAs and Hispanics.",8861394 (contact),"RIVERS, BRIAN M.

While remarkable progress has been made in identifying genetic factors responsible for cyst pathogenesis, there remain large gaps in our knowledge as well as controversies regarding the function of the affected proteins and which of the associated pathways are at the etiological heart of these diseases. The mission of the UAB Childhood Cystic Kidney Disease Core Center (UAB-CCKDCC) is to work with the PKD Consortium and the Central Coordinating Site to develop and share cilia-related bioassay and reporter systems, relevant genetic models and biomaterials, and clinical data for CCKDs that will allow the research base to overcome significant obstacles and drive the translation of basic science discoveries into effective treatments.",2287767 (contact),"YODER, BRADLEY K.
