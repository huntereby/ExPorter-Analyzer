A recently developed model of the human intestine called enteroids allows the formation of human mini-intestines that can mimic important aspects of disease due to these organisms and can be co-cultured with innate immune cells to more closely resemble normal intestine. Three universities with long histories of contributions in studying diarrheal diseases will collaborate in utilizing this novel model to study basic mechanisms of disease, characterize attenuated vaccine strains, and elucidate interactions with the immune system.

While Aβ forms plaques extracellularly, tau has been thought to form tangles within the cytoplasm of neurons. However, increasing evidence shows that tau physiologically exists in the extracellular fluid. In fact, vascular deposition of oligomeric tau (o-tau) was observed in brains of AD patients and Tg2576 mice. In turn, o-tau has been reported to be the most toxic form of tau. These recent findings lead to a new hypothesis that vascular deposition of o-tau is involved in driving the vasculopathy in AD. To test this hypothesis, we examine the roles of NADPH oxidase, cytosolic phospholipase A2, and NFκB in the effects of o-tau on oxidative stress, inflammation, expressions of adhesion molecules, and membrane tether adhesion mechanics in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs), and transmigration of THP-1 cells across the HBMEC layer. The retina, as a part of the brain, opens a window for high-resolution study of neurovascular defect. We also employ the non-invasive optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) (i.e. OCT/OCTA) to study microvascular characteristics and neurodegeneration, as quantified by the ganglion layer thickness (GLT), and their relations to oligomeric Aβ (oAβ), and o-tau contents in retinas of Tg AD mouse models for studying the influences of human tau and amyloid pathology including APPswe/PSEN1dE9 and 3xTg AD mice. This project will fill the research gap between extracellular o-tau and neurovascular abnormalities in AD by providing information regarding adhesion mechanical responses to o-tau in HBMECs, and changes in retinal vessel network characteristics and GLT in relations to Aβ and o-tau, and ultimately provide insights into therapeutic strategies for AD treatment by regulating tau's effects.",6923016 (contact),"LEE, JAMES C (contact)","YANG, AUSTIN JYAN-YU",2014-05-01,2025-05-31,3xTg-AD mouse;abeta oligomer;Actins;Adhesions;Affect;Age;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Alzheimer&apos;s disease brain;Alzheimer&apos;s disease diagnosis;Alzheimer&apos;s disease patient;Amyloid beta-Protein;amyloid pathology;Angiography;Atomic Force Microscopy;Automobile Driving;Biochemical;Biophotonics;Blood - brain barrier anatomy;Blood Vessels;Brain;brain endothelial cell;Caliber;Cell Adhesion Molecules;Cell Physiology;Cell surface;Cells;Characteristics;Clinical;Cytoplasm;Cytoskeletal Modeling;Cytosolic Phospholipase A2;Defect;density;Deposition;E-Selectin;early detection biomarkers;Endothelium;extracellular;Extracellular Fluid;Fluorescence Microscopy;Ganglia;Gender;Hemorrhage;Human;ICAM2 gene;indexing;Inflammation;Inflammatory;innovation;insight;Intercellular adhesion molecule 1;interdisciplinary approach;Lead;Leucocytic infiltrate;Measures;mechanical force;Mechanics;Mediating;Membrane;meter;Methods;migration;monocyte;mouse model;Mus;NADPH Oxidase;Nerve Degeneration;Neurofibrillary Tangles;Neurons;neuroprotection;neurovascular;Optical Coherence Tomography;Oxidants;Oxidative Stress;Oxidative Stress Induction;P-Selectin;p65;Pathology;Pathway interactions;peripheral blood;Phosphorylation;Physiological;polymerization;Polymers;Probability;protein expression;Reporting;Research;Resolution;response;Retina;retina blood vessel structure;Role;Selectins;Side;statistics;Study models;tau aggregation;tau Proteins;Testing;Tg2576;Therapeutic;Thick;Thinness;Transgenic Mice;Up-Regulation;Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1;Vascular Diseases,Roles of Tau Oligomers in Alzheimer's Vasculopathy,44404,NOMD,Neural Oxidative Metabolism and Death Study Section[NOMD],NA,NA,11,250000,138262,388262,NA

It is well recognized that immune cells, such as macrophages, accumulate in obese fat tissue and liver and these cells have traditionally been implicated in promoting metabolic disease. We have found that macrophages also have a potentially important beneficial effect in these tissues, due to their ability to ingest and degrade excess lipids in adipose tissue and liver. Therefore, we hypothesize that genetically reprogramming macrophages to augment their lipid degradation machinery is a strategy to prevent and/or treat certain obesity- associated metabolic diseases.

The proposed experiments will characterize probiotic- modulated immune cells migrating from mother to infant; and we will then assess the transfer of probiotic- modulated immunity from mother to infant in the setting of an established model of autoimmune disease.,10688943 (contact),"LIU, YUYING  (contact)","PRABHUDAS, MERCY R",2024-03-01,2026-01-31,Adaptive Immune System;Adoptive Transfer;Animal Model;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Antiinflammatory Effect;Autoimmune Diseases;Autoimmunity;B-Lymphocytes;Bacteria;Breast Feeding;cell motility;Cell Physiology;Cells;Childhood;commensal bacteria;congenic;Dendritic Cells;Development;Differentiation Antigens;disease model;Education;Engineered Probiotics;Epithelium;experimental study;Exposure to;fecal microbiome;Feces;feeding;Fostering;FOXP3 gene;gut microbiota;Heterogeneity;Heterozygote;Human;Human Milk;Immune;immune function;Immune response;Immune system;Immune Tolerance;Immunity;Immunodysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked syndrome;Immunologic Factors;immunoregulation;improved;Infant;Infant Development;Infiltration;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Ingestion;intestinal barrier;Knowledge;Laboratories;Lactation;Leukocytes;Life;Lymphocyte;Lymphoid Cell;Macrophage;mammary;Mammary gland;Mediating;mesenteric lymph node;metabolomics;metagenome;Metagenomics;Microbe;microbial;microbial host;microbiota;microorganism;migration;Milk;Modeling;monocyte;Mothers;mouse model;Multiple Sclerosis;Mus;Myeloid Cells;Natural Killer Cells;Necrotizing Enterocolitis;Neonatal;neonatal immune system;neutrophil;Newborn Infant;Nutrient;Oral;Pathway interactions;Permeability;Placenta;Plasma;Population;Pregnancy;pregnant;Pregnant Women;Probability;Probiotics;pup;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Severity of illness;Shapes;single cell sequencing;stem;Surface Antigens;Symbiosis;Syndrome;T-Lymphocyte;Thy-1 Antigens;Thymus Gland,Maternal-infant transfer of microbial modified immunity,182934,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1 MCST-M (81)],NA,NA,1,150000,84000,234000,NA

To treat long-gap nerve injury, donor autografts are isolated from elsewhere in the patient. Autograft isolation leads to donor site morbidity, and some Veterans are unable to donate autografts due to other complications (i.e. diabetes). As alternatives to the autograft, allografts or biomaterial conduits are being developed and used clinically. However, with allografts, extensive decelluarization procedures are required, and biomaterial conduits lack sufficient extracellular matrix (ECM) to promote extension regeneration. Our approach will develop biomaterial conduits releasing mRNA for neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). As a result, we believe the enhanced production of NT-3 by cells at the injury site will lead to extensive regeneration, leading to a new approach to treat neural injury in the Veteran population.",8506367 (contact),"GILBERT, RYAN J.

In this project I will investigate the effects of platelet transfusions in models of neonatal infection and lung disease and the mechanisms through which platelet transfusions increase neonatal mortality and lung injury, with the hope of improving the outcomes of these most vulnerable patients.",15622118 (contact),"DAVENPORT, PATRICIA ELLEN (contact)","HILL-PRYOR, CRYSTAL DARLEANE-ROBIN",2021-05-15,2026-04-30,Admission activity;Adult;Advisory Committees;Affect;Award;Awareness;Biology;Birth;Blood;Blood Cells;Blood Platelets;Boston;Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia;career;career development;Cell Communication;Cells;Cessation of life;Chemotactic Factors;Child;Chronic lung disease;Clinical;clinical practice;Clinical Research;clinically relevant;Coagulation Process;Communicable Diseases;Complication;CXCL1 gene;CXCL5 gene;cytokine;Data;Dedications;design;Development;Disease;Endotoxemia;Environment;European;experimental study;Extremely Low Birth Weight Infant;Functional disorder;Funding;Future;Goals;Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor;Health;Hematology;Hemorrhage;Hemostatic function;high risk;Host Defense;Hour;Human;Human Biology;Hyperoxia;IL17 gene;Immune;Immune system;Immunology;improved;improved outcome;In Vitro;Incidence;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Response;insight;Interferon Type II;Interleukin-6;Knowledge;Laboratories;Link;Lung;Lung Diseases;lung injury;Macrophage;Manuscripts;Mediating;medical schools;Medicine;meetings;Mentors;Mentorship;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality;mouse model;Mus;Neonatal;neonatal human;neonatal infection;Neonatal Intensive Care Units;Neonatal lung;neonatal lung disease;neonatal lung injury;neonatal mice;neonatal morbidity;Neonatal Mortality;neonatal sepsis;Neonatal Thrombocytopenia;neonate;Neonatology;neutrophil;Newborn Infant;Observational Study;Organ;Oxygen;Participant;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pediatric Hospitals;Phenotype;Physicians;Physiology;Planets;Plasma;Platelet Count measurement;Platelet Transfusion;polymicrobial sepsis;postnatal;premature;Premature Infant;preterm newborn;prevent;primary outcome;Process;Productivity;Publishing;pulmonary function;Pulmonary Inflammation;Randomized;randomized trial;Research;Research Design;Research Personnel;Resources;response;Risk;Role;Scientist;secondary outcome;Sepsis;Severities;statistics;Stimulus;success;Surveys;synergism;systemic inflammatory response;Testing;Thrombocytopenia;Time;Training;training opportunity;Transfusion;transfusion medicine;Umbilical Cord Blood;United States National Institutes of Health;Vulnerable Populations;Writing,Effects of Platelet Transfusions on Neonatal Chronic Lung Disease and Sepsis-Induced Mortality,156051,ZHL1,ZHL1-CSR-Q(O1),NA,NA,4,193125,15370,208495,NA

It plays a key role in the development of lung diseases and is an emerging target for new therapies. However, our understanding of how this important barrier is fundamentally regulated is limited. Thus, it is paramount to identify new key regulators of this tissue. Multiciliated cells (MCCs), critical within this epithelium, nucleate up to 300 motile cilia at their apical surface to generate directional fluid flow which constantly cleans airways from inhaled pathogens, pollutants and dust to maintain pulmonary health (mucociliary clearance). Notably, airway ciliated cells are the primary targets of human SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, impaired clearance by defective MCCs, either acquired or due to genetic ciliopathies, causes chronic airway infections and COPD and is associated with asthma. Our new studies produced compelling evidence that the E2f7 and E2f8 members of the E2f family of transcription factors have previously unknown essential roles in the early phases of multiciliogenesis. Moreover, human E2f7 and E2f8 are dysregulated in patients with asthma, fibrosing interstitial lung diseases and COPD. Furthermore, E2f7 and E2f8 directly regulate human primary ciliary dyskinesia-associated genes. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will comprehensively define the essential role of E2f7 and E2f8 as master regulators of MCC differentiation, with the long-term goal to use this knowledge to design innovative therapies and diagnostic strategies for chronic airway diseases.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a particularly aggressive breast cancer subtype, disproportionately seen in African Americans, and in contrast to other breast cancer subtypes, there are no current targeted therapies. One goal of this research is to develop non-antibody protein-based targeted immunotherapeutics that are personalized for virtually any TNBC patient, and trigger immune cells to seek out and destroy TNBC cells. Protein immunotherapeutics are designed for long in vivo lifetime, which rival monoclonal antibodies, and use existing serum antibodies to kill TNBC cells. A second goal of this research is to develop a low-cost paper based diagnostic platform that will be used to rapidly identify which protein immunotherapeutics are best suited to serve as a combination therapy for a given TNBC patient, and monitor the therapeutic efficacy of the combination over the course of treatment.",16342056 (contact),"MCNAUGHTON, BRIAN RICHARD (contact)",NA,2022-09-20,2027-05-31,Affect;Affinity;African American population;African American Women;aggressive breast cancer;Antibodies;antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity;Antineoplastic Agents;Appointment;Binding;Biological Markers;Biological Products;Breast Cancer Cell;Breast Cancer cell line;Breast Cancer Patient;cancer cell;cancer immunotherapeutics;cancer immunotherapy;cancer subtypes;Cell surface;Cell Surface Proteins;Cell Surface Receptors;Cells;Childhood;Clinic;clinically significant;Combination immunotherapy;Combined Modality Therapy;Complex;cost;Delaware;design;Development;Devices;Diagnostic Equipment;diagnostic platform;Disease;Disparity;Drug Costs;drug discovery;Drug usage;Effectiveness;Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor;Escherichia coli;Estrogen Receptors;Excretory function;experimental study;Generations;Goals;Health equity research;High Risk Woman;Hormone Receptor;hormone receptor-positive;hormone therapy;Human;Immune;Immune mediated destruction;Immune system;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;improved;in vivo;Incidence;Left;Localized Disease;Low income;Malignant Breast Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammalian Cell;Marketing;Mastectomy;Measures;member;Mental association;Methods;Minority Groups;Monitor;Monoclonal Antibodies;Mutate;nanobodies;new technology;novel strategies;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Paper;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;personalized approach;personalized medicine;personalized therapeutic;Phage Display;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;precision drugs;Production;Progesterone Receptors;Proteins;Radiation;receptor;recruit;Reporter;Research;Serum;side effect;Signal Transduction;Source;survival outcome;targeted treatment;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissues;Trastuzumab;Trauma;Treatment Efficacy;Treatment outcome;triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma;tumor;Vaccination;virtual;Woman;Work,Integrating Low-Cost Paper-Based Devices and Personalized Immunotherapeutics to Treat Triple Negative Breast Cancer,15959,ZMD1,ZMD1-MLS,9408,NA,3,289241,79746,NA,368987

Our goal is to better understand the phenomenon of biological embedding of stress – the process by which stress “gets under our skin” to produce permanent changes in biology. We have advanced the hypothesis that the effects of stress may extend all the way down to the level of stem/progenitor cells – the cells that continually replenish our tissues and organ systems. Our project will test this hypothesis in stem/pro- genitor cells obtained from child tissues (umbilical cord blood and cord tissue) at the time of birth, and measure key cellular processes in these stem/progenitor cells that relate to genomic integrity and bioenergetic function (telomere and mitochondrial biology systems) using a unique, translational approach (in vitro to in vivo physiology) in a novel stem cell culture system from these human newborn tissue samples. We expect our study findings to suggest avenues to better optimize long-term health and well-being.",10315591;10208786;1963451 (contact),"BOYLE, KRISTEN ELIZABETH;ENTRINGER, SONJA ;WADHWA, PATHIK D (contact)","WEINBERG, DAVID H",2022-08-15,2027-06-30,Activities of Daily Living;Address;adult stem cell;adverse birth outcomes;Age;age-related disease;Aging;allostatic load;Animals;Antioxidants;Attenuated;Basic Science;Behavioral;biobank;biobehavior;Bioenergetics;Biological;Biological Markers;Biological Phenomena;Biology;Biophysics;Birth;Body mass index;Body System;Cell Culture System;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Differentiation process;Cell Line;Cell Physiology;cell type;Cells;cellular targeting;Characteristics;Child;Chronic stress;classification trees;Clinical Investigator;Cord Blood stem cells;Coupled;Data;Development;Diet;differentiation in vitro;Embryo;Endocrine;Ensure;Epigenetic Process;Ethnic Origin;experimental study;Exposure to;fetal;Follow-Up Studies;Functional disorder;Future;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Generations;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;genome integrity;gestational weight gain;Goals;Growth;Health;Hematopoietic stem cells;Human;human stem cells;Hydrogen Peroxide;Immune;imprint;In Vitro;in vivo;Individual Differences;Inflammatory;innovation;Intervention;intrapartum;Knowledge;Life;life span;Long-Term Effects;Machine Learning;maternal stress;Measures;Mesenchymal;Mesenchymal Stem Cells;Metabolic;Methods;Mitochondria;Modification;Molecular;Mothers;Newborn Infant;novel;offspring;Oxidative Stress;Parents;Pathway interactions;Personal Satisfaction;personalized intervention;personalized predictions;Phenotype;Physical activity;Physiological;Physiology;Placenta;Population;Population Heterogeneity;predictive modeling;Predisposition;Pregnancy;prepregnancy;primary outcome;Process;prognostic;prospective;psychosocial;Publishing;Race;Reactive Oxygen Species;recruit;regression trees;repository;Research Design;Research Personnel;resilience;Resolution;Resource Sharing;response;Resveratrol;Risk;senescence;sex;shared repository;Skin;Sleep;Social support;sociodemographics;Spirometry;Standardization;stem;stem cell biology;stem cells;Stress;Stromal Cells;System;Systems Biology;Telomerase;telomere;Testing;Time;Tissue Sample;Tissues;translational approach;transmission process;Umbilical Cord Blood;Variant,Stress and Human Stem/Progenitor Cells: Biobehavioral Mechanisms,107176,MESH,"Biobehavioral Mechanisms of Emotion, Stress and Health Study Section[MESH]",NA,NA,3,473222,166947,640169,NA
