Using a combination of comparative transcriptomics and a novel functional screen, we identified a novel metabolic pathway (that includes an aminoacid transporter and a conjugating enzyme) in metastatic lesions, which inhibition completely halted the growth of metastases without affecting the primary tumors; furthermore, preliminary data indicate that they may provide metabolic fitness for metastatic cells to grow in these foreign niches, indicating that these lesions evolve by acquiring non-genetic adaptations.

To assist in the resolution of these crises, we plan to develop a single-shot, room- temperature stable, double-nanoencapsulated mRNA vaccine for COVID-19.

Ethnically Chinese and Malaysian mental health patients were studied in Singapore and patients taking anti-psychotic medications were found to have TDD in 40% and 29% of cases respectively. Regardless of prevalence, TDD is a threat to patient adherence and quality of life. TDD only remits in a minority of cases and can be permanent. With 50 million prescriptions for anti-psychotics written annually, more than 44 million persons living with a chronic mental illness are at risk of developing TDD. There are likely over 1.65 million patients living with TDD and the number of patients with TDD is expected to grow with the aging population and increasing off-label use of antipsychotics.

However, studies suggest a possible role of other signaling mechanisms interplaying with estrogens. Kisspeptin is a crucial regulatory protein involved in female puberty as well as a modulator of sex steroids. In this context, we propose that a decrease in expression of kisspeptin and their function in asthmatics compared to non-asthmatics (specifically females) conveys a possible sex specific role of kisspeptin in asthma. Our studies use human airway smooth muscles from both male and female asthmatics vs. non-asthmatics, along with animal studies where we control estrogen levels. These studies will substantially enhance our understanding of how and why kisspeptin signaling influences the asthmatic airway.

In healthy subjects, it is a common symptom ensuing after extended wake or intense learning. However, the reasons why we become mentally tired remain unknown. Based on recent findings, we hypothesize that a key mechanism underlying mental fatigue after sleep deprivation or intense learning is the increasing occurrence of brief, local periods of silence of brain cells. These “OFF periods” normally occur throughout the brain during sleep, but they can occur locally in wake (“local sleep” in wake) when we stay up for too long or engage in intense tasks. This project is relevant to public health because it will provide a mechanistic explanation of mental fatigue and its negative consequences. If successful, the proposed experiments will identify 1) a specific circuit of inhibitory and excitatory cortical neurons responsible for mental fatigue after extended wake or intense learning; 2) a neural mechanism underlying mental fatigue—the active induction of periods of silence in cortical neurons during wake. This project will also result in a large dataset of electrophysiological recordings from multiple areas of the brain. This dataset can be used in future studies to test whether, due to inflammatory or neuromodulatory changes, the neural circuit responsible for mental fatigue after extended wake or intense learning is also involved in pathological fatigue.",7710922 (contact);2094139,"CIRELLI, CHIARA  (contact);TONONI, GIULIO","HE, JANET",2024-03-01,2028-11-30,Acute;Affect;Agonist;Animals;Area;Attention;Autoimmune Diseases;awake;Axon;Behavior;behavior measurement;Behavioral;Brain;brain cell;brain dysfunction;cell type;Cells;Chronic;common symptom;Complex;Corpus striatum structure;Coupled;D Cells;Data;Data Set;density;Disease;Drowsiness;Electroencephalography;Electrophysiology (science);Empathy;Event;exhaustion;experimental study;Fatigue;Feeling;Funding;Future;Generations;Genetic;genetic manipulation;Glutamates;Goals;Head;hippocampal pyramidal neuron;Hippocampus;Hour;Human;Impaired cognition;Impairment;improvement on sleep;in vivo;in vivo evaluation;Inflammatory;Injections;large datasets;Lead;Learning;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;member;Memory;Mental disorders;Mental Fatigue;Modeling;Motivation;motor learning;Multiple Sclerosis;Mus;Nervous System Disorder;neural circuit;neuromechanism;neuronal excitability;Neurons;neuroregulation;non rapid eye movement;novel;optogenetics;Parkinson Disease;Pathologic;Performance;pharmacologic;predictive modeling;presynaptic;prevent;Psyche structure;Public Health;Pyramidal Cells;Rattus;receptor;recruit;Rest;Risk;Rodent;Rodent Model;Role;Sampling;Sleep;Sleep Deprivation;Sleep Disorders;sleep quality;Slow-Wave Sleep;Somatostatin;Stroke;Structure;Study models;Symptoms;Synapses;Testing;Thalamic structure;Time;United States National Institutes of Health;willingness;Work,Local sleep and mental fatigue,131389,BNRS,"Behavioral Neuroendocrinology, Neuroimmunology, Rhythms, and Sleep Study Section [BNRS]",NA,A1,1,365644,189696,555340,NA

In many of these conditions, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy and retinitis pigmentosa, blindness is caused by the loss of rod and cone photoreceptor cells. Therefore, the prospect of therapeutic treatments for a wide array of these conditions depends on scientific advances in our understanding of the biochemistry, physiology, cell biology, molecular biology and genetics of photoreceptor function. Of critical importance in accomplishing this goal is the open exchange of new research findings among the community of vision scientists and the cultivation of the next generation of researchers to study photoreceptor biology and pathobiology. The FASEB Science Research Conference on “The Biology and Chemistry of Vision” is the premier meeting in the field of photoreceptors and their supporting cells.

The propulsive contractions of the colon (colonic migrating motor complexes or CMMC) are thought to be due to neurogenic motor patterns programmed within the myenteric plexus and direct innervation of smooth muscle cells. Recent work on this project has introduced important new information about how colonic motor activity is initiated and propagated. We are investigating mechanisms and functions of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) of which there are four classes in colonic muscles. These cells generate spontaneous, stochastic Ca2+ release events that activate Cl- channels (encoded by Ano1) in the plasma membrane, causing transmembrane inward currents. Neural inputs regulate Ca2+ signaling in ICC, thus modulating the myogenic drive on colonic motility. Loss or disabling of the basic functions of ICC (e.g. blocking Ca2+ signaling or ANO1 channels) causes defects in colonic motor activity, including decreased smooth muscle excitability, inhibition of phasic contractions, and disruption in major motility patterns, such as CMMCs. Because neural signals are transduced by ICC, damage to ICC makes it difficult or impossible to restore colonic motility by enhanced neural output. In the next funding period mechanisms responsible for Ca2+ transients in colonic ICC-MY and regulation of these events by enteric motor neurons will be characterized. Integration of activity between smooth muscle cells and ICC will be studied, and mechanisms responsible for initiation and propagation of propulsive contractions will be clarified. Animal models of ICC loss will also be characterized to develop new tools for testing therapeutics for motility disorders associated with ICC loss (e.g. slow transit constipation).",15086417 (contact);1893935,"BAKER, SAL  (contact);SANDERS, KENTON M","SHEA-DONOHUE, TEREZ",2019-03-01,2028-02-29,3-Dimensional;Address;Aging;Anatomy;Animal Model;Animals;Behavior;Cell membrane;Cell Shape;Cells;Characteristics;Colon;Comparative Study;confocal imaging;Consensus;Constipation;Cytoskeleton;Data;Defect;Diabetes Mellitus;Disabling;Distal;Electrophysiology (science);Enteral;Event;experimental study;Extracellular Matrix;Family;Funding;Gap Junctions;gastrointestinal;Gastrointestinal Motility;Gastrointestinal tract structure;Giant Cells;high resolution imaging;Human;Image;improved;In Situ;insight;Interstitial Cell of Cajal;Investigation;Knowledge;Learning;loss of function;Maintenance;Mediating;Membrane;Membrane Potentials;Migrating Myoelectric Complex;Modeling;Morphology;Motility;motility disorder;Motor;Motor Activity;Motor Neurons;mouse model;Movement;Mus;Muscle;mutant;Myenteric Plexus;Nerve;nerve supply;neural;neuromechanism;Neurons;neuroregulation;neurotransmission;Neurotransmitters;Normal Cell;novel;Obstruction;Operative Surgical Procedures;optogenetics;Organ;Outcome;Output;Pacemakers;Pathology;Patients;Pattern;Peristalsis;Phase;Physiology;Population;preclinical study;Publishing;receptor;Regulation;response;Role;sensor;Signal Transduction;Small Intestines;Smooth Muscle;Smooth Muscle Myocytes;Stomach;Stretching;Symptoms;Techniques;Testing;therapeutic evaluation;Time;Tissues;tool;Transgenic Organisms;Work,Role of interstitial cells of Cajal in patterned colonic motor activity,120759,DNPD,Digestive and Nutrient Physiology and Diseases Study Section [DNPD],NA,A1,5,403642,188345,591987,NA

Our proposed studies will investigate the stealth and biodistribution mechanisms of GM3-PLA-NPs to elucidate new strategies for targeted delivery of safe long-acting drugs in the SLTs and hence aid in the development of nanotherapeutics for prevention and treatment of HIV.,16158343 (contact),"FOFANA, JOSIANE  (contact)","PAUL, MOUSHUMI",2023-02-28,2024-04-30,Address;Adherence;AIDS prevention;Anti-Retroviral Agents;antiretroviral therapy;Binding;Biodistribution;Biotin;CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes;Cell membrane;Cell surface;Cell Survival;Cells;Chronic;Coculture Techniques;combinatorial;comorbidity;cytokine;Data;Dendritic Cells;design;Development;Disease;Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm;Dose;drug action;Dyes;Exposure to;extracellular;Failure;Flow Cytometry;Gangliosides;Goals;HIV;HIV therapy;HIV-1;Image Cytometry;immune activation;immunoregulation;In Vitro;in vivo;Individual;Infection;Inflammation;Inflammatory;inflammatory modulation;Inflammatory Response;Inflammatory Response Pathway;Injections;innovation;Integrase Inhibitors;Label;Lectin Receptors;Ligase;Link;Lipid Bilayers;Lipids;live cell imaging;Lymphoid Tissue;Macrophage;Measures;Mediating;medication compliance;Membrane;monocyte;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality risk;Mus;Myeloid Cells;nanoformulation;nanoparticle;nanopolymer;nanotherapeutic;non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors;nonhuman primate;novel strategies;Nucleosome Core Particle;Oral;Patients;Penetration;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Plasma;poly(lactic acid);Polymers;Predisposition;preservation;prevent;Prevention;Property;Protein-Protein Interaction Map;Regimen;response;Risk;Role;Secondary to;Sialic Acids;Site;Spatial Distribution;spectrograph;Synapses;T-Lymphocyte;targeted delivery;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Tissues;Toxic effect;transmission process;uptake;Viral;viral rebound;viral transmission;virological synapse;Virus,Dual antiretroviral loaded nanoparticles for long-acting suppressive HIV therapy,172625,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-F17A-H(20)],NA,NA,2,23060,0,23060,NA

This was a significant increase compared to 2019. While Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) accounts for much of the severe disease and most of the deaths, P. vivax (Pv) represents the most widespread and numerous malaria parasite with a range stretching even into temperate zones. Pv comprise the greatest proportion of infections and cases in some parts of the world; for example, in the Americas 68.3% (446,000) of 653,000 cases were attributable to Pv malaria in 2019. Evidence is accumulating to show that young children and pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to adverse clinical impacts of Pv malaria, including severe presentations, and preventing infections and relapse in these groups is a priority. Pv is responsible for at least 30% of malaria in U.S. travelers [5]. Efforts to prevent and control Pv malaria are impeded by emergence of drug resistant strains and by repeated relapses from dormant liver stage parasites called hypnozoites. A powerful tool is needed for eliminating Pf and Pv malaria from defined geographical areas, ideally a highly effective, long-acting yet low-cost vaccine that prevents infection, disease and parasite transmission. This proposal describes the development, characterization and assessments of a Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite (PfSPZ) vaccine that is late arresting replication competent (LARC) and has 2 genes Pfmei2 and PfLINUP deleted (PfSPZ-LARC2) and in addition a major immunogenic Pv protein the circumsporozoite protein (CSP). We describe the development of a Pf LARC parasite strain that expresses the P. vivax circumsporozoite protein (PvCSP). This parasite strain called PfLARC2-PvCSP is genetically attenuated to arrest development in the late liver stage, and will provide the basis for a bi-valent LARC PfSPZ Vaccine.",1955443 (contact),"SIM, B.
