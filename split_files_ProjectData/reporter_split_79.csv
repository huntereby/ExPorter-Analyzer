We will also address causality and mechanism with dietary and microbial interventions in a novel ‘avatar’ germ-free CRCLM mouse model which is ‘humanized’ with stool from trial participants.

Introduction This request is for an administrative supplement to NIH grant 1R43NS127740, titled “PANK Activators for the treatment of pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration” due to unforeseen increases in animal costs that were not anticipated at the time of the original budget submission. The supplement will ensure the continuation and successful completion of the proposed research. 2. Justification Most of the funds from the initial reward designated for animals have been used to breed, maintain, and perform drug treatments using the whole-body pank2-/- mouse model of PKAN. There is no observable phenotype associated with the whole-body pank2-/- mouse model, therefore, we initiated breeding of SynCrepank1fl/flpank2fl/fl mice, which display symptoms associated with PKAN including weight loss, locomotor disfunction, and early death. Whole-body pank2-/- mouse model of PKAN.  • We received pank2-/+ heterozygous mice from the Hayflick lab on 01/26/2022 and began breeding them  to obtain pank2-/- homozygous progeny, at a rate of 25%. A total of 191 homozygous pank2-/- animals  were obtained throughout one year of breeding.  • We did not see upregulation or downregulation of genes as previously reported for this model1. The  breeding pairs we received were at the end of their backcross cycle, therefore it was possible that the  RTqPCR results were due to the late cycle, therefore backcrosses were recommended. Heterozygous  pank2+/- mice were bred with C57B6 mice across three generations. After the third generation, three  males were selected, and their sperm cryopreserved.  • Homozygous pank2-/- mice were treated with vehicle, VTAC-1 and VTAC-2, as well as PZ2891 as a  control, for 14 days. Brains were removed and dissected into four parts: the Globus Pallidus (GP), the  Substantia Nigra (SN), olfactory bulb, and cerebellum. Total  RNA from collected tissues were extracted using phenol/chloroform method with QIAzol  and used in qRT-PCR to determine transcript levels of genes relating to CoA biosynthesis. Additionally, CoA levels in each region will be quantified to confirm activation of CoA biosynthesis. Analysis of gene transcript and CoA levels is ongoing. SynCrepank1fl/flpank2fl/fl mouse model of PKAN  • As stated in the alternative approach section in aim 3 of the parent grant, an additional mouse model of  PKAN was originally reported by the team of Dr. Jackowski at St. Jude and has subsequently been used  by BridgeBio to validate efficacy of PKAN therapeutic, BBP-671. This model has been used to study  PKAN as the mice exhibit symptoms similar to individuals diagnosed with PKAN including weight loss,  locomotor impairment and early death2. • We received pank1fl/fl sperm and pank2-/- embryos and began mouse breeding in March 2023. Initial  genotyping revealed three pank2 genotypes and one pank1 genotype: pank2fl/+, pank2fl/fl, and pank2fl/-,  and pank1fl/+. Pank1fl/+ mice were bred with mice expressing each of the three pank2 genotypes to  generate 52 pank1fl/+/pank2fl/+ mice and one pank1fl/+/pank2fl/fl mouse. • SynCre hemizygous mice were obtained from Jackson labs and were bred with mice expressing  genotypes Pank1fl/fl/Pank2fl/+ and Pank1fl/+/Pank2fl/fl to generate Pank1fl/fl/Pank2fl/+SynCre+ and  Pank1fl/+/Pank2fl/flSynCre+. These mice will be bred with Pank1fl/fl/Pank2fl/fl to generate the target mice  expressing SynCrepank1fl/flpank2fl/+ and SynCrepank1fl/+pank2fl/fl genotypes. After each round of breeding,  mice will be genotyped from nail clippings to select for SynCrepank1fl/flpank2fl/fl mice. As  SynCrepank1fl/flpank2fl/fl mice are generated, treatments will begin to maintain consistency of mouse age  between treatments. Sperm from key intermediate stages will be frozen and stored for future breeding.  We expect to have SynCrepank1fl/flpank2fl/fl mice ready for the proposed studies by the end of 2024. See  diagram for breeding details. • Groups of mice consisting of 5 females and 5 males will be housed under 12h light cycles with free  access to chow and water and dosed with 10 mg/kg (of the front-runner VTAC compounds and PZ-2891  and BBP-671 as controls) via oral gavage once daily for 14 days and monitored daily for their weight  and activity. Following treatment, mice symptoms will be monitored including changes in weight and  motor function. The brains of mice which show symptomatic improvement will be removed and dissected  in regions containing the Globus Pallidus (GP), Substantia Nigra (SN), olfactory bulb, and cerebellum.  Total RNA will be collected from tissues and extracted using the phenol/chloroform method with QIAzol  and used in qRT-PCR analysis to quantify mRNA levels of the CoA biosynthetic genes and key markers  of iron and dopamine dyshomeostasis. CoA levels in the brain will be measured by LC/MS-MS and  intracellular iron concentrations will be quantified by ICPMS (Inductively-Couple Plasma Mass Spectroscopy). • Success will be determined by the ability of the VTACs to improve symptoms associated with PKAN,  extend survival, restore CoA levels, and correct of iron and dopamine dyshomeostasis markers. 3. Description of Costs  • Strain reanimation (IVF): $1100/service  • Strain reanimation (embryos): $750/derivation  • Housing cost per diem: $1.27 per cage  • Cryopreservation: $750 per sperm  • Tissue collection: $72/hour  • Mouse genotyping: $10 per mouse 4. Impact on Research The increased costs have put the project at risk of not being able to achieve its specific aims. Without this supplement, we will not be able to continue breeding SynCrepank1fl/flpank2fl/fl mice for treatment with VTACs. The requested funds are essential for maintaining the integrity and scope of the research as originally proposed. 5. Budget Item Cost Housing and Care $59,000 Tissue collection/data analysis $40,000 Total Supplement Request $99,000 6. Timeline The additional funds are needed immediately to cover the increased costs. Upon approval, we anticipate no delays in the project timeline and expect to complete the project as originally scheduled by 08/31/2025. 7. PI Assurance I assure that the requested supplemental funds will be used solely for the purpose of covering the costs associated with studies involving the use mouse models of PKAN conducted under the Sponsored Research Agreement with Dr. Ben Mamoun at Yale and performed at the Yale Animal Core Facility. No other aspects of the project will be altered. 8. Signatures Principal Investigator: Jessica Regan June 17, 2024 Authorized Institutional Official: Choukri Ben Mamoun Founder and Signing Official Choukri Ben Mamoun July 21, 2024 Summary of parent grant  • Aim 1: Characterize PTZ analogs for in vitro activity and selectivity  o Proposed  ▪ Nine VTACs have been characterized for modulation of human PANK3 activity. Here, we  will extend analysis to an additional 29 analogs to identify top compounds based on their  modulation of PANK activity. o Achieved  ▪ In addition to the original nine VTACs, five compounds were confirmed to specifically  activate human PANK3 using an ATPase assay with purified hPANK3 enzyme.  • Aim 2: Further examine the safety of the compounds and evaluate their in vitro cell biological  activity in PANK2-deficient cells. o Proposed  ▪ Extend analyses of hPANK3 activation and toxicity profile of the 14 VTACs and conduct  cell-based assays to identify those that restore biological activity in PANK2-deficient cells  and select ideal candidates for animal models. o Achieved  ▪ Further analyses are being conducted to examine the safety of the initial 9 VTACs as well  as the addition 5 compounds identified in Aim 1. The in vitro cytotoxicity of each of these  compounds is being tested on four human cell lines (HeLa, HepG2, HEK293, and  HCT116) and one primary cell line (HFF-BJ). So far, the initial 9 VTACs have been tested  in the four human cell lines at concentrations up to 100 µM and their toxicity was  compared to PZ-2891. The 9 VTACs tested had similar cytoxicity levels compared to PZ-  2891 in each of the four cell lines, with the majority of the 9 VTACs having IC50’s >100  µM. Cytotoxicity studies with the remaining 5 compounds in these four human cell lines,  as well as all 14 compounds in the primary cell line are ongoing.  ▪ Further evaluation of in vitro cell biological activity of the VTACs are being conducted to  select lead compounds for clinical development. Cell-based assays are ongoing to  identify those compounds which restore biological activity in PANK2-deficient cells.  Treatment of PANK+/+-CoA-Luc and PANK/--CoA-Luc cells with each of the 14 VTACs is  in progress. Cells will be cultured in plates and treated with different doses of the  activators ranging between 1 nM and 1μM or vehicle (media or DMSO) for 24h, with PZ-  2891 as a control. Analysis of relative mRNA levels of CoA biosynthetic genes and other  related genes was conducted in PKAN patient cell lines compared to healthy patient cell  lines as well as HFF wild-type and pank2 knock-out cell lines to identify genes whose  expression levels are altered by PANK2 deficiency. These studies demonstrated reduced  expression of Transferrin Receptor (TFRC) similar to that of PANK2 in PKAN patient cell  lines as well as pank2 knock-out cell lines. Based on these studies, qRTPCR will be  performed to determine if the 14 VTACs can restore expression of TFRC. MTT  colorimetric assay is used to measure cell metabolic activity in untreated and treated  PKAN and control cells following conversion of the tetrazolium dye MTT into its insoluble  formazan. The MTT assay has so far been completed with the initial 9 VTAC compounds. • Aim 3: Evaluate the in vivo efficacy of lead VTAC activators in mouse models of PKAN.  o Proposed  ▪ Initial PK and CNS exposure studies in mice have so far identified VTAC-1 and VTAC-2 as  leads for further evaluation in the mouse model of PKAN.  We will first evaluate these 2 compounds as well as new leads that meet rigorous criteria  for testing in animals for their in vivo pharmacokinetic and safety. Selected compounds  will then be evaluated for in vivo efficacy in pank2-/- mice by monitoring important PKAN  biological metrics including activation of the CoA metabolic pathway, iron homeostasis,  mitochondrial metabolism, and rescue of PKAN-like phenotypes.  o Achieved  ▪ Whole-body pank2-/- mouse model of PKAN were bred from pank2-/+ heterozygous mice  at a rate of 25%.  ▪ Groups of 5 females and 5 males were dosed with 0, 10, and 30 mg/kg of VTAC-1 and  VTAC-2, as well as PZ-2891 as a control. The brain of each mouse was removed and  dissected in regions containing the Globus Pallidus (GP), Substantia Nigra (SN), olfactory  bulb, and cerebellum. RNA from the collected tissues was extracted and qRT-PCR  performed to measure levels of key CoA biosynthetic genes. CoA levels in each brain  region will be quantified by LC/MS-MS.  ▪ Samples from untreated PKAN knock-out and wild-type male and female mice were sent  for LC-MS and metabolomics to quantify RNA transcript levels. RTqPCR analysis on  tissues has been completed, however, the expected upregulation or downregulation of  key genes as described by the Hayflick lab were not observed. Preliminary analyses  indicate a slight increase in CoA levels in the brain upon treatment with VTAC-2 in wild-  type mice compared to vehicle treatment. Further analysis of CoA levels is ongoing and  we expect results to be available by the end of 2024. (1) Jeong, S. Y.; Hogarth, P.; Placzek, A.; Gregory, A.

The negative effects of aging on this “muscle-bone crosstalk” are attenuated by normal physiological exercise so identification of these molecular mechanisms should lead to therapeutics for the twin condition of “osteo-sarcopenia”..",1878636 (contact),"BONEWALD, LYNDA F (contact)","WILLIAMS, JOHN",2012-05-01,2025-05-31,Acceleration;age effect;Aging;Attenuated;beta catenin;bone;bone cell;bone mass;Brain;Cell Line;Cell Physiology;Cell secretion;Cell Survival;Communication;Contracts;Disease;Engineering;Estrogens;Exercise;extracellular vesicles;Functional disorder;Health;heart function;imaging capabilities;Immobilization;Individual;interdisciplinary approach;Intervention;intravital imaging;lipidomics;live cell imaging;Maintenance;mechanical load;Metabolism;metabolomics;Molecular;mouse model;Movement;Muscle;Muscle Cells;Muscle Contraction;muscle form;Muscle function;Musculoskeletal Diseases;Musculoskeletal System;myogenesis;Organ;Organism;Osteoblasts;Osteocytes;Physiological;prevent;programs;Regulation;Role;sarcopenia;sedentary;Societies;success;System;Testing;Therapeutic;Transgenic Mice;Twin Multiple Birth,OSTEOCYTE REGULATION OF BONE/MUSCLE WITH AGING,39355,NA,NA,NA,S1,10,59871,29207,89078,NA

Based on our recent finding that type 1 and 2 CALR mutations activate different arms of an ancient cellular stress response pathway called the unfolded protein response (UPR), we propose to test the hypothesis that differential UPR activation leads to the divergent clinical phenotypes seen in type 1 versus type 2 CALR patients, and that these pathways can be uniquely targeted for therapeutic gain in type 1 versus type 2 CALR-driven MPNs.",10361630 (contact),"ELF, SHANNON ELISABETH (contact)","GILLASPY, ALLISON",2024-08-01,2027-08-31,Acute Myelocytic Leukemia;Anabolism;arm;ATF6 gene;Base Pairing;Binding;Binding Sites;Blood Platelets;Bone Marrow;Bone remodeling;C-terminal;Calcium Binding;calreticulin;cancer cell;Carbon;Cell Compartmentation;Cell Death;Cell Survival;Cells;Cellular Stress;Classification;clinical phenotype;Code;Collagen;curative treatments;cytokine;Data;Deposition;Development;Disease;disease phenotype;Disease Progression;driver mutation;Endoplasmic Reticulum;endoplasmic reticulum stress;Erythrocytes;Etiology;Exhibits;Exons;Fibrosis;Functional disorder;Genes;Glycine;granulocyte;Hematocrit procedure;Hematopoietic;Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation;Hemoglobin;Hemorrhagic Thrombocythemia;In Vitro;in vivo;Incidence;individualized medicine;Inflammation;Inflammatory;inhibitor;Interleukin-6;JAK2 gene;Lead;loss of function;Mediating;Megakaryocyte Proliferation;Megakaryocytes;Metabolism;Molecular;Molecular Abnormality;Molecular Chaperones;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality;MPL gene;mutant;Mutation;Myeloid Cells;Myeloproliferative disease;Neoplasms;novel;Pathogenicity;Pathway interactions;Patients;Peptides;Phenotype;Polycythemia Vera;Primary Myelofibrosis;Production;Prognosis;prognostic;Proteins;proteostasis;response;Risk;Role;sensor;Serine;Signal Transduction;Somatic Mutation;stem cells;stressor;Stromal Cells;Survival Rate;targeted treatment;Testing;therapeutic target;transcription factor;treatment strategy;Up-Regulation;XBP1 gene,The Pathophysiology of Type 1 Versus Type 2 Mutant Calreticulin-Drivenmyeloproliferative Neoplasms,165119,MONC,Molecular Oncogenesis Study Section[MONC],NA,NA,3,294975,127535,422510,NA

With the rapid emergence of digital treatment approaches to physical therapy (i.e., telerehabilitation), access could be improved by reducing or eliminating many barriers that patients report; however, it is unclear how to appropriately incorporate digital treatment approaches into existing health care models. We propose a single-masked prospective randomized clinical trial conducted at a health system serving rural communities to determine the effectiveness of innovative risk-stratified telerehabilitation versus standard educational control for patients with chronic LBP that will match individual patients with specific physical therapy delivery (remote therapeutic monitoring; physical therapy telehealth visits; or psychologically informed physical therapy telehealth visits) based on their psychosocial risk of poor outcomes.",15052075;8186025 (contact),"MCLAUGHLIN, KEVIN ;SKOLASKY, RICHARD L.

The DTC will need to ensure timely completion of the retrospective (first 2 years) and prospective (all 5 years) components of HeartShare. In our application, we demonstrate the ability and prior experience of our multi-PI team and core leaders in the conduct and leadership of large-scale, multi-center studies, particularly in the realms of HFpEF, EHR-based investigation, deep phenotyping, and biorepositories. We also highlight our experience as liaisons/translators among clinical researchers, clinicians, and data scientists; expertise in phenotype ontology and harmonization; and collaboration with the University of Vermont biorepository, which has extensive experience in this realm. For both the retrospective and prospective HeartShare components, the Northwestern DTC will leverage its considerable experience in: (1) cohorts and trials that have data on adjudicated HFpEF patients, and (2) its leadership and track record as the top enroller in HFpEF trials/studies to ensure optimal recruitment by the HeartShare CCs. We will also leverage our expertise in HFpEF, data coordination/management, BioData Catalyst, electronic health record-based research, biostatistics, data science, machine learning, multi-omics, human-computer interaction, and mobile health data monitoring to successfully execute the HeartShare program and meet The HeartShare DTC goals of providing a rich resource to the research community and advancing the science of next-generation phenomics to identify HFpEF subtypes and therapeutic targets. Our HeartShare DTC will carry out each of its 4 primary responsibilities. (1) The Administrative and Outreach Core will oversee HeartShare program operations, research skills development, and capitation to CCs for deep phenotyping costs; support a call center to follow patient outcomes; and promote rapid and broad data-sharing of clinical and molecular data. (2) The Data Portal Core will serve as the primary access point (via a web-based interface) and coordinating center for all HeartShare data; and to develop an interactive patient-facing web-based interface for remote consent, completion of forms, and collection of mobile health data using BioData Catalyst tools. (3) The Data Management Core will oversee and perform data quality, integration and harmonization of various data types; performance of advanced analytics; coordination of biospecimen and imaging biorepositories; and integration with TOPMed for omics analyses.

The short-term pain and functional outcomes associated with varying numbers of initial visits, and the long-term effectiveness of chiropractic care within the context of real- world delivery at VHAs, in terms of clinical impact is unknown. In addition, we know very little regarding outcomes resulting from the broader range of evidence-based chiropractic care strategies most commonly practiced in real world settings.

Here, we attempt to speed up spatial neglect diagnosis, using the brain imaging that is always part of the first hours of stroke care. We will compare 4 methods to identify the special brain imaging features present in people with spatial neglect who respond to early rehabilitation, and who recover best at 3 and 6 months after stroke.

Thus, identifying genetic determinants of antimicrobial resistance and typing of clinically critical bacterial pathogens help accurately define the transmission of drug-resistant and multi-drug-resistant organisms.

Ribosomes in turn are the cellular machines that synthesize all proteins. The most important component and backbone of ribosomes is its RNAs. Ribosomal RNAs are heavily modified by small RNA-protein complexes to properly exert their func- tions. This process occurs in one of three recognizable subcompartments of the nucleolus, the dense fibrillar component (DFC), which we propose to be formed by the modification activity. One of the two major families of the small RNA-protein complexes are impaired in dyskeratosis congenita.  Patients with the bone marrow failure syndrome dyskeratosis congenita (DC) fail to produce suf- ficient blood cells to carry oxygen and fight infections. Most frequently DC is caused by mutations in proteins that associate with many different small noncoding RNAs that are required for a vast spectrum of cellular functions. Although one of these functions has been shown to be impaired in DC patients, it is not known if and to what extent other functions associated with these RNA–protein complexes are affected. For example, we will investigate if and how these RNA–protein complexes affect the nuclear organelles where they are found, when they are mutated in DC. This proposal aims to answer these questions and to solve the mystery that underlies the nucleolus and DC. The experiments will charac- terize the fine structure of the nucleolus and identify new avenues of treatment for patients with DC and possibly with other bone marrow failure syndromes.",1964682 (contact),"MEIER, U THOMAS (contact)","QASBA, PANKAJ",2024-09-13,2025-08-31,Address;Affect;Auxins;Binding;Biogenesis;Biological Assay;Biology;Blood Cells;bone marrow failure syndrome;C-terminal;Cell Line;Cell Nucleolus;Cell Nucleus;Cell Physiology;Cells;Complex;Core Protein;Data;density;Disease;Dyskeratosis Congenita;Electron Microscopy;experimental study;Family;fighting;Fluorescence;Genetic Transcription;Guide RNA;Hereditary Disease;Impairment;In Vitro;in vivo;Infection;Inherited;Inherited bone marrow failure;Length;Light;light microscopy;Link;Liquid substance;lymphoblast;Maps;Mediating;Membrane;Methylation;Missense Mutation;Modification;Molecular;Molecular Chaperones;Monitor;Mutate;Mutation;NAP57;novel;Nuclear;Nucleotides;Organelles;Oxygen;Patients;Phase;Physical condensation;Polymerase;Positioning Attribute;Process;protein complex;protein protein interaction;Protein Region;Proteins;Pseudouridine;Recombinant Proteins;Recovery;recruit;Ribosomal RNA;Ribosomes;RNA;RNA Polymerase I;Sampling;Site;Small Nucleolar Ribonucleoproteins;Small Nucleolar RNA;Small RNA;Structure;Telomerase;telomere;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;transcriptome sequencing;Transfection;Untranslated RNA;Vertebral column,Ribosomal RNA modification in nucleoli and disease,173197,MG,Molecular Genetics Study Section[MG],NA,NA,1,450712,304444,755156,NA
