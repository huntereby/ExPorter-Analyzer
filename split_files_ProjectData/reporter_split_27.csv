UCCC addresses the cancer needs of its catchment, the State of Colorado, guided by its vision to prevent and conquer cancer. Together. UCCC's mission is to unite its community to overcome cancer through innovation, discovery, prevention, early detection, multidisciplinary care, and education. Exemplary research and adroit leadership, propelled by significant institutional investment has led to impactful innovations in cancer biology that translated into preventative, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies proven in clinical trials, approved by the FDA, and then disseminated to improve the standard of care. UCCC seeks to address the needs of underserved populations by providing targeted, culturally appropriate behavioral interventions, colorectal cancer screenings, and by shaping state tobacco control legislation.

While specific autoimmune diseases are infrequent in the population, in the aggregate they affect 5-8% of Americans and can be life-threatening. Current treatments are only moderately effective, and carry a heavy risk of adverse effects. We have identified a monoclonal antibody specific for B cells that shows efficacy in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and type 1 diabetes. This antibody therapy is safer than competing approaches because it does not induce B cell depletion and its effects can be reversed by cessation of treatment, enabling restoration of immune function. With further molecular improvements and clinical development, this antibody will greatly expand the therapeutic options for SLE and other autoimmune diseases.",6274339;1874127;1925815 (contact),"CAMBIER, JOHN C;LARRICK, JAMES W;MENDELSOHN, ANDREW R (contact)","MINNICOZZI, MICHAEL",2023-05-08,2025-04-30,Acute;Adverse effects;Affect;Affinity;Agonist;American;anergy;Animal Model;Animals;anti-CD20;Antibodies;Antibody Formation;Antibody Therapy;Antigen Receptors;Antigen-Antibody Complex;Antigens;Arthritis;Attenuated;Autoantibodies;Autoimmune Diseases;Autoimmunity;autoinflammatory;autoreactivity;B cell therapy;B-Cell Antigen Receptor;B-Lymphocytes;belimumab;CD72 gene;Cells;checkpoint receptors;Chronic;clinical development;Collagen Arthritis;Colorado;COVID-19;Data;Daughter;Development;Disease;Disulfides;Dose;Emerging infection;emerging pathogen;exhaustion;Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis;Extracellular Domain;Formulation;Frequencies;Generations;Health;Human;immune function;immune modulating agents;Immunity;Immunotherapy;improved;In Vitro;in vivo;Inflammation;Injections;Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Integral Membrane Protein;ITAM;Knock-in Mouse;Latent virus infection phase;Lead;Life;Link;Mediating;medical schools;Modeling;Molecular;Monkeypox;Monoclonal Antibodies;mouse model;Multiple Sclerosis;Mus;Mutation;next generation;novel;NR0B2 gene;pandemic disease;Pathogenesis;Pathogenicity;Pathway interactions;Patients;PIK3CG gene;Plasma Cells;Plasmablast;Poliomyelitis;Population;prevent;Pristane;Production;professor;PTEN gene;reactivation from latency;Receptor Aggregation;response;restoration;Rheumatoid Arthritis;Risk;rituximab;Safety;sample fixation;Signal Transduction;Source;src-Family Kinases;Surface;System;Systemic Lupus Erythematosus;Systemic Therapy;T-Lymphocyte;Therapeutic;therapeutic candidate;Therapeutic Uses;Time;Tissues;Transducers;Transgenic Organisms;Tyrosine;unvaccinated;Withholding Treatment;Work,Silencing autoantibody secretion for SLE therapy,172662,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-DCAI-U(10)],NA,NA,2,223033,57129,299773,NA

We have worked with them to develop and test the effectiveness of one such HIV prevention program (FOYC+CImPACT) among grade six students. The grade six program was shown to be very effective through a study that followed the students for three years after they had received the training. Therefore, the Ministry of Education (MOE) of The Bahamas decided to mandate the use of FOYC+CImPACT throughout all government grade six classes in The Bahamas. Over the past decade, the research team partnered with the Bahamian Ministries of Education and Health to utilize two national implementation programs to study teachers’ fidelity of implementation and theory-driven implementation strategies to increase teachers’ continued implementation of evidence-based interventions.

While R-loops serve normal functions, high levels of R-loops are considered deleterious and are often associated with genome instability and a loss of cellular fitness. The mechanism of how Ewing sarcoma is able to maintain high levels of R-loops without genomic instability is not known.

Modern genomics and proteomics technologies have carefully characterized health-related events, which has opened the door to asking more complex questions about normal and disease states. Correspondingly, to confront complex research challenges, the career opportunities to Ph.D. scientists have diversified, including multiple non-academic positions (e.g., industry, biotechnology, government, publishing). Along with this research progress and changing career landscape, the biomedical culture has placed greater emphasis on quantitative data analysis, rigor and reproducibility, and transparency to ensure quality and accuracy of research findings and safety to minimize risk to scientists and the environment. To take advantage of this unprecedented opportunity to thoroughly dissect biological systems with high standards of rigor and many career perspectives, a biomedical work force capable of multi-disciplinary, team-driven, and problem-focused thinking is needed. In total, this modern world of biomedical research requires a rethinking of the Ph.D. training experience. To address the changing needs in biomedical work force training, we have created a Chemistry Biology Interface (CBI) training program at Wayne State University (WSU). WSU has the ideal campus environment for a scientifically rigorous and culturally rich training experience. CBI faculty among six departments and three colleges offer a wealth and diversity of research expertise for graduate training. WSU has in place a series of professional development activities to augment career preparation. The diverse undergraduate population at WSU also synergizes and supports an equally diverse graduate community. Building upon these strengths, the CBI program will augment the graduate training within core disciplines by promoting multi-disciplinary research knowledge and collaboration facilitated by cross-campus mentoring and peer-to-peer advising. These outcomes will be achieved through a series of CBI activities that center around an individualized “My Ph.D.” theme. The foundational activity is an annual ""My Ph.D."" workshop focused on career skills surveying, assessment, and planning, which will be led by CBI student peers and faculty for multi-level mentoring. Complementing the individualized skills evaluation, multi-disciplinary research, scientific rigor, communication skills, and peer cohort building/networking will be accomplished through annual CBI symposia, biweekly seminar activities, a team- taught and literature-based CBI course, a co-mentoring Ph.D. committee structure, early and sustained academic advising, internal and external research experiences (ATTRACT), and community outreach events (ACT OUT). Through these meaningful activities, WSU Ph.D. graduates will form a strong scientific identity with discipline-specific skills and informed multi-disciplinary perspectives. The combination of research breadth, skills depth, and enhanced mentoring facilitates the confident, solution-oriented, and collaborative thinking needed to address complex biological questions and migrate through a diverse career backdrop.",1923096;2442282 (contact),"CHOW, CHRISTINE S;PFLUM, MARY KAY H (contact)","BOND, MICHELLE RUEFFER",2021-07-01,2026-06-30,Biology;Chemistry;Training Programs;Universities,Chemistry Biology Interface Training Program at Wayne State University,142519,TWD,Training and Workforce Development Study Section - B[TWD-B],NA,NA,4,237295,13310,250605,NA

We developed an innovative graduate program relying on the traditions and experience of one of the oldest pathology training programs in the country, but incorporating creative approaches to provide operational (cutting edge in-depth knowledge), technical (state-of-the-art methodology) and professional (transition into careers) skills that will lead to the output of true translational, diverse scientists. The Cellular and Molecular Pathology (CMP) graduate training program at the University of Wisconsin provides rigorous didactic training in fundamental basic biomedical sciences combined with interdisciplinary and innovative training in the pathogenesis of major human diseases. According to the Commission on Pathways Through Graduate School and Into Careers, “between 2010 and 2020, about 2.6 million new and replacement jobs are expected to require an advanced degree, with a projected increase for jobs requiring a doctorate or professional degree” (www.pathwaysreport.org). The primary mission of the CMP program is to prepare graduates for diverse productive careers in biomedical and clinical research, education, industry or government and to position them to make significant contributions toward the health-related research needs of our nation. The CMP program provides graduate students with interdisciplinary and integrated training in the pathogenesis of human diseases with emphasis on molecular, cellular and biochemical approaches. We seek to increase each individual student's appreciation of how specific disease processes directly impact individual patients, while fostering the application of the student's specific research area to potential new concepts in clinical care and treatment. As basic and clinical sciences have evolved, new approaches to apply multidisciplinary knowledge in the field of medicine are required.

Aging is the major risk factor for AD. Furthermore, increasing evidence indicates that astrocytes and microglia are implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified polymorphisms in genes enriched in microglia (e.g. ABCA7 and TREM2) and astrocytes (e.g. APOE and ABCA7) that increase the risk of developing AD. Cellular and animal models to study genotype-phenotype relationship of AD genetic variants enriched in astrocytes and microglia are missing.
