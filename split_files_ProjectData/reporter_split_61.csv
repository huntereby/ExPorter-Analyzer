While implementation  strategies and relevant evidence-based interventions (EBIs) exist to increase screening, few  have been tested in AI/AN populations. Furthermore, few health care settings have adopted  these EBIs, and their evaluation is limited. AI/ANs cite a number of barriers to cancer screening  including cultural reluctance to access Western medicine for non-acute health problems;  transportation difficulties; lack of childcare; and negative perception of health providers.  Enabling factors, however, include access to female health professionals (including Indigenous  health workers), and locally devised health plans that aim to improve access, health provider  knowledge, recall systems, targeted culturally relevant health promotion, and population  registers. Similarly, low HPV vaccination rates among Native communities call for locally and  culturally relevant information and education efforts. Recent studies suggest that low-cost,  targeted, multipronged approach[es] may be effective in Native communities to increase both  vaccination and screening rates, and emphasize the importance of indigenous leadership in  both cancer prevention planning and promotion within the community. This is consistent with  recommendations by the US Community Preventive Service Task Force (USCPSTF) for  multicomponent (individual demand, provider delivery, access) and multilevel (i.e., patient,  provider, health system) EBIs.

In spite of multiple next-gen androgen and its receptor targeted drugs (e.g., abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide), DNA-repair drugs (PARP inhibitors) and microtubule targeting taxane drugs indicated for managing more advanced stage diseases, there is currently no FDA-approved modality before ADT to intercept or delay disease progression in the clinic practice.

PAHs like benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) are found in automobile exhaust and tobacco smoke, and differential metabolism of these chemicals by host-associated microbes could be a contributing factor to bladder cancer pathogenesis; therefore, the aim of this proposal is to define gut and urine microbial metabolism of BaP and determine how this metabolism affects bladder cells.

By offering role model talks featuring Hispanic health research professionals at a Hispanic-serving church, and by providing near-peer mentoring to Hispanic high school students interested in pursuing health science research careers, this initiative will: 1. Build awareness and value among Hispanic parents and youth in targeted under-resourced  Hispanic communities of careers in health research. 2. Engender an interest to pursue health research careers among youth in these same communities. 3. Trigger pursuing a college path in health research among high school students in these same communities. Besides initially serving Hispanics in the greater New London, Connecticut community, this project will have the potential to reach much broader Hispanic audiences. Role model talks will be featured on the project website, which will be promoted via Hispanic Access Foundation’s bilingual social media accounts. Altogether, we foresee 1,000 unique visitors to these web pages during the project period. In addition, during the dissemination phase of this project, Hispanic Access Foundation will reach out to our network of pastors representing 150,000 Hispanic-serving churches.

AfaSci has discovered a non-opioid, single molecule, dual modulator of the T-type calcium channel, a neuronal pain signaling pathway, and soluble epoxide hydrolase, an enzyme involved in inflammation. This dual modulator can provide complementary analgesia and anti-inflammation, leading to better pain relief with fewer side effects.

Our plan is to provide Core users with a subsidy to facilitate their use of these facilities, which includes modern high-throughput and multi-plexing sequencing technologies, mass spectroscopy (including lipidomics and metabolomics), and proteomics. Additionally, the core itself has added laser-capture microdissection instrumentation and plans to acquire a SeaHorse XF analyzer to augment these capabilities. The imaging core retains its services for top-tier histopathology, while including access to high resolution confocal and live-cell imaging and conventional electron microscopy. Additionally, this core has added access to a new serial block face scanning electron microscopic facility that is co-directed by Dr. Mrinalini Hoon who is also a co-director of this part of our core application.

First, we will develop and optimize a safe and effective immune modulation approach to prevent immune responses to the viral capsid and to allow for safe and effective repeated administration of AAV. Second, we will identify a strategy to reduce anti-AAV antibody titer in animals with pre-existing immunity to AAV and allow for safe and effective therapeutic AAV dosing in pre-exposed animals. Since experiments will focus on safety and levels of transgene expression, we will use wild type mice and non-human primates (NHPs).

There are sex-differences in susceptibility factors for PTSD. With the increase in female Veterans, it is important to investigate these differences so that strategies to build resilience in each sex can be developed.

Conventional therapies produce a high rate of cure for patients with localized prostate cancer, but there is no effective treatment for intervention in metastatic prostate cancer. Currently-used prognostic indicators (Digital rectal exam, PSA measurement and Gleason score) do not predict metastases risk accurately. These facts underline the urgent, yet unmet, need for identification and characterization of new targets that can help distinguish between aggressive and metastatic prostate cancer from an indolent disease. Our goal is to address this vital knowledge gap by characterizing the role of Prostate Derived Ets Transcription Factor (PDEF) in PCa aggressiveness, thereby reducing the prostate cancer-related health disparity between African American (AA) and Caucasian men. We propose a novel and unique causative link between PDEF and metastases.

Clinical studies have shown that prolonged schedules of DNA topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitors can be effective in some platinum-resistant ovarian cancers. Our preclinical studies have also shown that PARP inhibitors can enhance the antitumor effects of TOP1 inhibitors in vitro and in ovarian cancer patient derived xenograft (PDX) models despite resistance to the antitumor effects of PARP inhibitor alone. These observations, which reflect the fact that PARP inhibition and PARP inhibitor-induced tumor cell killing are related but separable processes, provide the opportunity to use PARP inhibitors as chemosensitizing agents in ovarian cancers that are PARP inhibitor resistant. Accordingly, this project will study the action of a promising 3rd generation ultra- long acting TOP1 inhibitor, PLX038, in combination with the PARP inhibitor rucaparib in preclinical models and in a phase II clinical trial in platinum- and PARP inhibitor-resistant high grade serous ovarian cancer.",1861030 (contact),"KAUFMANN, SCOTT H (contact)",NA,2009-07-01,2026-08-31,ABCG2 gene;Address;Affect;Animal Model;Antibodies;antibody detection;antitumor effect;bevacizumab;Biochemical;Bioinformatics;Biological Markers;Biometry;Biopsy;BRCA1 gene;BRCA1 Mutation;BRCA2 gene;BRCA2 Mutation;Cancer Model;Cancer Patient;cell free DNA;cell killing;Cell Line;Cells;chemosensitizing agent;Clinic;Clinical;clinical practice;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;cohort;Complex;CRISPR screen;cytotoxicity;design;Development;Diagnostic Reagent;Disease;Disease Resistance;DNA Damage;DNA Repair Enzymes;Dose;drug action;efficacy evaluation;Epithelial ovarian cancer;Excision;Exhibits;Failure;FDA approved;Formulation;Generations;Genes;Genetic;genomic profiles;Genomics;Germ-Line Mutation;homologous recombination;homologous recombination deficiency;improved;In Vitro;in vivo;Infusion procedures;inhibitor;insight;Investigation;irinotecan;Laboratories;Maintenance Therapy;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Mammalian Oviducts;Marrow;Modeling;Mutation;nanoparticle;Neoplasm Circulating Cells;Neoplasms;neoplastic cell;next generation;NKTR gene;novel therapeutics;Ovarian;overexpression;PARP inhibition;patient derived xenograft model;Patients;peritoneal cancer;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase II Clinical Trials;phase II trial;Platinum;Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitor;Polyethylene Glycols;Polymerase;pre-clinical;Pre-Clinical Model;preclinical study;Process;Prodrugs;Progression-Free Survivals;protein expression;Recurrence;Refractory;Regimen;Relapse;Reporting;Resistance;resistance mechanism;response;Sampling;Schedule;Serous;Site;SN-38;Somatic Mutation;synergism;Testing;Therapeutic;Topoisomerase I inhibition;Topoisomerase-I Inhibitor;Topotecan;Toxic effect;treatment response;tumor;Type I DNA Topoisomerases;Woman,Project 2: Next Generation TOP1 Inhibition for the Treatment of Ovarian Cancer,136393,ZCA1,ZCA1-RPRB-8,5391,NA,14,145241,97022,NA,242263

Comprehensive hearing health services are available within the VA to qualifying veterans. The delivery of optimal hearing healthcare mandates tailored treatments are offered based on degree of hearing loss and patient preferences. These options are defined in practice guidelines including the VA since 2004. Significance/Impact: Despite the prevalence of hearing loss among Veterans, there are few projects studying the management of those with severe hearing loss. Ensuring appropriate treatments for those most severely affected represents an important access to care issue with implications for patients’ communication, quality of life and overall health. This also facilitates patient communication in health care settings as being able to hear is a cornerstone of participation in shared-decision making. Innovation: The VA is the ideal setting to study management of severe hearing loss as this is a prevalent condition among veterans, interested patients are offered comprehensive treatments for hearing loss and longitudinal audiometric data are available to allow identification of factors associated with receipt of particular treatment strategies. Stakeholder engagement including interviews with affected Veterans and providers are incorporated in the study design. Specific Aims: 1. Define the prevalence, modes of treatment and time to treatment of Veterans with severe  hearing loss using the Audiometric Repository, a national database of audiograms and a  registry of assistive listening devices, hearing aids and cochlear implants within the VA,  between 2005-2017. 2. Identify which factors are associated with different treatment approaches for Veterans with  severe hearing loss using the Audiometric Repository linked to administrative data from the  electronic medical record during years 2005-2017. 3. Identify facilitators and barriers for distinct management of severe hearing loss among hearing  aid users (including referral for cochlear implants) through semi-structured interviews with  current VHA providers (audiologists, otolaryngologists and primary care providers) and  affected Veterans. Methodology: A mixed methods study using a sequential explanatory design will be employed. Data from the Audiometric Repository will be linked to administrative data from the electronic health record to understand management of Veterans with severe hearing loss. Interviews will be conducted with various stakeholders including Veterans and providers to identify barriers and facilitators to particular treatment modalities. Next Steps/Implementation: Results from this pilot will provide new information on barriers and facilitators of management of severe hearing loss. In addition to a planned manuscript describing our findings, we will develop educational materials for providers on CI indications and criteria for referral. We will also develop an educational brochure for Veterans and families to address potential attitudinal/knowledge barriers. These materials will form the basis for a Merit application to study trajectories of hearing loss and to develop and test an implementation approach to achieve best practices in the treatment of severe hearing loss.",15401585 (contact),"FRIEDMANN, DAVID R (contact)",NA,2020-08-01,2024-03-31,Acoustics;Address;Adherence;Affect;Age;age related;Age Years;American;Attitude;Audiology;Bilateral;Caring;Clinical Management;clinical practice;Cochlear implant procedure;Cochlear Implants;Communication;comorbidity;Computerized Medical Record;connected health;cooperative study;Counseling;Data;Databases;design;Diabetes Mellitus;disability;Disabling;Education;Educational Materials;Elderly;electronic data;electronic health data;Electronic Health Record;Eligibility Determination;Ensure;Evidence based intervention;Family;functional decline;Geographic Locations;Goals;Guidelines;Health;health care settings;health service use;Health Services;Health Services Accessibility;Healthcare;Hearing;Hearing Aids;hearing impairment;hearing loss treatment;Hearing Tests;Impaired cognition;Improve Access;improved;Individual;individualized medicine;inhibitor;innovation;interest;Intervention;Interview;Knowledge;Link;Literature;Manuscripts;Medical;Mental Depression;Methodology;Methods;military service;Modality;Neurocognitive Deficit;noise exposure;Otolaryngologist;Outcome;Outpatients;Pamphlets;Patient Preferences;patient subsets;Patients;Personal Satisfaction;Practice Guidelines;Prevalence;prevent;primary care provider;Procedures;Process;programs;prospective;Prosthesis;Provider;provider factors;Psyche structure;Qualifying;Quality of Care;Quality of life;Recommendation;Registries;Rehabilitation therapy;repository;Research Design;Research Methodology;research study;Risk;Schedule;Services;shared decision making;Social isolation;sociodemographic variables;sound;Specialist;Structure;System;systematic review;Testing;Time;Tinnitus;treatment strategy;United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality;Update;verbal;Veterans;Veterans Health Administration;Work,Resubmssion: Management of Severe Hearing Loss in the Veterans Health Administration,3141,HSR1,HSR-1 Health Care and Clinical Management[HSR1],NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA

The  extremely poor prognosis in PDAC is attributed to lack of early detection, complexity and aggressiveness of the  disease and importantly, resistance to conventional chemotherapy, radiotherapy and molecularly targeted  therapy. This is due to the complexity in PDAC characterized by several genetic, epigenetic alterations, dense  fibrosis and a dynamic immune environment that cross-talk with each other to drive cancer progression and  chemoresistance. Our study proposes to examine immune signals that facilitate communication between  immune, cancer and stromal cells to promote cancer progression. Our preliminary results have identified a novel,  pro-tumorigenic signaling pathway that links immune cells, cancer cells and stroma in PDAC.
