According to the American College of Radiology, megavoltage (MV) volumetric imaging has a clear advantage in terms of metal artifact reduction, direct dose calculation and real-time adaptive radiotherapy, but is challenged by low contrast and high imaging doses.

This involves testing safety and efficacy of a novel drug combination designed to harness specific biochemical synthetic lethality of MTAP, MAT2A, and PRMT5 in mouse models of colorectal carcinoma (CRC). The ultimate goal is to expand treatment options in patients with CRCs for therapies designed to target a subset of cancer genotypes that are rarely present among CRC. We have demonstrated anti-cancer activity of our novel MTAP inhibitor alone. Here we evaluate a potential amplification of its anti- cancer efficacy in combination with a MAT2A inhibitor, as it relates to metabolism and gene expression. Finally, we will solve the transition state structure of the third enzyme involved in synthetic lethality, PRMT5, with the goal of designing new inhibitors with enhanced anti-cancer effects when used alone or in combination with MTAP and MAT2A inhibitors.",15581310 (contact),"BEDARD, GABRIEL T (contact)","PURI, ANU",2022-07-01,2026-06-30,Accounting;Adenosine;Affect;analog;Animals;anti-cancer;anti-cancer therapeutic;anticancer activity;ApcMin/+ mice;Apoptosis;Architecture;Arginine;arginine methyltransferase;Biochemical;Body System;Body Weight;Cancer cell line;Cancer Model;cancer survival;cell growth;Cells;Clinical Trials;Colon Carcinoma;Colonic Neoplasms;Colorectal Cancer;Combined Modality Therapy;design;Development;Dose;driver mutation;drug candidate;Enzymes;experimental study;Familial Adenomatous Polyposis Syndrome;Foundations;Gene Expression;Genetic;Genotype;Glioblastoma;Goals;Growth;Heart;Histone H4;histone methylation;Histones;Human;Immunohistochemistry;In Vitro;in vivo;indexing;Individual;inhibitor;intestinal adenoma;Intestinal Neoplasms;Isotopes;Kinetics;Laboratories;Large Intestine Carcinoma;Lead;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Measurement;Measures;Metabolic;Metabolism;metabolomics;Methionine;methionine adenosyltransferase;Methionine Metabolism Pathway;Methylation;Methyltransferase;Molecular;Monitor;mouse model;Mus;neoplastic cell;novel;novel anticancer drug;novel drug combination;Oral;Pathogenesis;patient derived xenograft model;Patients;pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics;Phase I Clinical Trials;Phase I/II Clinical Trial;Phenotype;Phosphorylases;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Primary Neoplasm;Proliferating;protein biomarkers;Protein Chemistry;Protein Inhibition;Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferase;Proteins;Proteomics;Radiolabeled;rational design;Reaction;Recycling;Reporter;RNA Splicing;Route;S-Adenosylhomocysteine;S-Adenosylmethionine;Safety;safety testing;Schedule;single-cell RNA sequencing;small molecule inhibitor;Specificity;Structure;Tail;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;therapy design;Tissues;tool;Toxic effect;Transferase;Treatment Efficacy;tumor;tumor growth;Wild Type Mouse;Work,Rational design of anti-cancer therapeutics harnessing the synthetic lethality of methionine metabolism and arginine methyltransferases,275213,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-F09B-Z(20)L],NA,NA,3,53974,0,53974,NA

While the development of targeted therapies has improved the outcome for some patients with this disease, these targeted therapies are usually administered in conjunction with conventional cytotoxic agents. Many of these conventional antileukemic drugs induce DNA-protein crosslinks, a type of DNA damage that has previously been difficult to measure. Here we use a recently derived immunological reagent to show that AML cell lines and clinical samples contain a previously unsuspected excess of these DNA-protein crosslinks. In particular, malignant myeloid cells exhibit elevated levels of crosslinks between the nuclear enzyme TOP1 and DNA even before being exposed to TOP1-directed drugs. We now propose to investigate the biochemical basis for the large numbers of pre-existing TOP1-DNA covalent complexes and assess whether the existence of these complexes predicts a favorable response to TOP1-directed anti-leukemic therapy.",1861030 (contact),"KAUFMANN, SCOTT H (contact)","OLKHANUD, PUREVDORJ BALJINNYAM",2021-07-01,2026-06-30,Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia;Acute Myelocytic Leukemia;acute myeloid leukemia cell;Affect;Age;Anthracycline;Antibodies;antileukemic agent;Azacitidine;Binding;Biochemical;Camptothecin;Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program;Case Fatality Rates;Cell Line;cell type;Cells;chromatin protein;Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia;Clinic;Clinical;Collaborations;comorbidity;Complex;covalent bond;crosslink;Cytotoxic agent;Daunorubicin;Decitabine;Defect;design;Development;Disease;DNA;DNA Damage;DNA lesion;DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor;DNA Modification Methylases;DNA Topoisomerases;DNA-protein crosslink;drug sensitivity;Drug usage;Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes;Enzymes;Etoposide;Excision;Exhibits;Exposure to;Formaldehyde;Generations;Hematopoietic;Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation;Hemorrhagic Thrombocythemia;high reward;high risk;histone demethylase;Human;Immunologics;improved;improved outcome;In Vitro;in vivo;in vivo Model;insight;Knock-out;Lead;Lesion;leukemia;leukemia treatment;Leukemic Cell;Lymphoid Cell;Malignant - descriptor;Marrow;Measures;Metabolism;Metalloproteases;Mitoxantrone;Myeloid Cells;Myeloid Leukemia;Myeloproliferative disease;Nuclear;nuclease;Participant;Pathway interactions;Patients;Peptide Hydrolases;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacotherapy;Phase;phase II trial;phosphoric diester hydrolase;Play;Poison;Polycythemia Vera;Process;progenitor;prototype;Reagent;Regimen;Repair Complex;repaired;Reporting;research clinical testing;response;Role;Sampling;Serine Protease;Specimen;Stabilizing Agents;Syndrome;targeted agent;targeted treatment;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissues;TOP1 gene;TOP2A gene;Topoisomerase;Topotecan,Cause and therapeutic impact of DNA-protein crosslink repair defect in myeloid leukemias,248064,MCT2,Mechanisms of Cancer Therapeutics - 2 Study Section[MCT2],NA,NA,4,217313,128215,345528,NA

IDH mutant (IDHm) gliomas are a form of malignant brain cancer. IDH gliomas are more common in younger adults, are initially sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation, yet universally result in lethal recurrence following variable periods of remission. These vexing clinical features of IDHm glioma are partially explained by multiple recently described mechanisms through which IDHm tumor cells escape surveillance by the human immune system. Using mouse models and tumor samples derived from human patients, our group has discovered defective signaling in the Retinoic Acid pathway as a major driver of tumor-induced immune escape. Remarkably, clinical regimen containing All-Trans Retinoic Acid and Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors cure aggressive IDHm gliomas in an immunocompetent mouse model. This recent discovery led to a human clinical trial, recently opened at the University of Pennsylvania, to investigating All-Trans Retinoic Acid and Retifanlimab (a PD-1 inhibiting monocloncal antibody) in patients with recurrent IDHm glioma. Despite this promising development, several substantial questions regarding the mechanism of ATRA action remain unanswered. In this proposal, we set out to answer some of those questions by identifying the specific immune cells responsible for the therapeutic activity of All- Trans Retinoic Acid in IDHm gliomas. Equally importantly, we propose a thoroughly designed set of experiments in mouse models to predict response to ATRA and ATRA+Immune Checkpoint blockade, particularly in patients who receive ATRA or ATRA+Immune Checkpoint blockade prior to surgical resection as part of our trial. This proposal leverages recent advances in immune profiling of tumor tissue and circulating blood immune cells to carefully dissect immune cell populations and genetic signatures that are required for response to therapy in IDHm glioma and provide a readout for immunotherapeutic efficacy of ATRA and potentially other immune-directed therapies in IDHm gliomas. If successful, our proposal will contribute several important data points to help advance the discovery of additional immunotherapeutic strategies to substantially extend the lives of patients with IDHm glioma.",11921583 (contact),"AMANKULOR, NDUKA MGBECHINYERE (contact)","LIU, YIN",2023-07-03,2028-06-30,Address;Adjuvant;Age;Antibodies;Biological Markers;Blood;Brain;Brain Neoplasms;CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;CD8B1 gene;cell type;Cells;Cessation of life;checkpoint inhibition;Chemotherapy and/or radiation;Clinical;clinical efficacy;Clinical Trials;cohort;Combined Modality Therapy;Data;design;Development;Diffuse;Disease remission;Dose;Epigenetic Process;epigenetic silencing;Evaluation;Excision;Exclusion;exhaustion;Exhibits;experimental study;Future;Gene Expression Profile;gene network;genetic signature;Genetic Transcription;Genotype;Glioma;Goals;Hematologic Neoplasms;Human;human subject;Immune;immune checkpoint blockade;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immune system;Immunocompetent;immunogenic;immunogenicity;Immunologic Markers;Immunologic Monitoring;Immunologic Surveillance;Immunologics;Immunosuppression;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;Infiltration;Inflammatory;Institutional Review Boards;Interferon Type II;Interferons;Isocitrate Dehydrogenase;Knowledge;Lymphocyte;Lymphocyte Function;Lymphocytic Infiltrate;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant neoplasm of brain;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Mediator;Modality;Modeling;mouse model;Mus;mutant;Mutation;Myelogenous;Myeloid-derived suppressor cells;Natural Killer Cells;Neoadjuvant Therapy;neoplastic cell;Operative Surgical Procedures;Output;Pathway interactions;Patients;PD-1 inhibitors;Pennsylvania;Performance;Phase II Clinical Trials;Population;pre-clinical;predicting response;Prediction of Response to Therapy;programmed cell death protein 1;Recurrence;Regimen;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Reporting;Resistance;response;restoration;Retinoids;Sampling;Series;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;single-cell RNA sequencing;Sleeping Beauty;small molecule;Solid;specific biomarkers;Specificity;Specimen;T cell receptor repertoire sequencing;T-Cell Activation;T-Cell Receptor;T-Lymphocyte;T-Lymphocyte and Natural Killer Cell;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutically Targetable;Tissues;transcriptome sequencing;treatment response;Tretinoin;tumor;Tumor Biology;tumor eradication;Tumor Immunity;Tumor Tissue;Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes;Universities;Validation;XCL1 gene;young adult,Interrogating Mechanisms of Anti-tumor Immunity in Human Subjects and Murine Models of IDH-Mutant Glioma Treated with All-Trans Retinoic Acid and PD-1 Inhibition,284132,ZCA1,ZCA1-RPRB-6(M2)S,NA,NA,2,490069,198975,689044,NA

ASXL1 is one of the commonly mutated genes in CHIP. In particular, the hotspot frameshift mutation at codon 646 (corresponding to codon G643 in mice-Asxl1tm) represents pathological CHIP mutation with high risk to drive myeloid diseases.

The PI’s goal is to identify the mechanisms that control the modulation of matrix turnover in injured kidneys to devise more effective anti-fibrotic therapies. The PI studies how the matrix receptor integrin α1β1 controls matrix homeostasis in health and disease. She found that integrin α1β1 plays an anti-fibrotic role by negatively regulating tyrosine phosphorylation levels and consequent nuclear localization of the ribonucleoprotein Fused in Sarcoma (FUS). She also found that FUS promotes collagen transcription and its downregulation reduces collagen synthesis. Her goal is to develop strategies to prevent FUS nuclear translocation thus reducing its pro- fibrotic action in a preclinical model.

Work from my collaborator, Dr. Gianfranco Alpini, SR VA RCS, RLR VA Medical Center, has shown that cholangiocytes become senescent during liver damage and take on a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) causing them to secrete mediators which are also considered to be chemoattractants for mast cell migration.

Through their ability to sense and be activated by environmental chemicals, xenobiotic receptors, such as PXR, CAR and AhR, are critical mediators for the environment-gene interactions. The outcome of xenobiotic receptor-mediated gene regulation is impacting the metabolism of xenobiotics and endobiotics and by doing so, impacting the pathogenesis of human diseases. Results from this R35 program cannot only deepen our understanding of the environment-gene interaction and the implications of this interaction in human diseases, but also establish xenobiotic receptors and their target xenobiotic enzymes and transporters as potential therapeutic targets to manage human diseases and morbidity.

Many patients experience weakness in muscle either due to the effects of cancer or due to the effects of treatment. Loss of muscle in cancer patients is not simply due to poor nutrition and has so far proven irreversible. Therefore, effective therapies to restore muscle function will not only improve quality of life but will consequently prolong life. Our VA funded study examines molecular changes in skeletal muscle in breast cancer and develops biomarkers and therapies to overcome muscle defects. Knowledge gained from these studies is being applied to other cancers such as lung, pancreatic, bladder, and head and neck cancers. During this process, we learnt that men and women with the same type of cancer show differences in skeletal muscle biology paving the way for individualizing symptom management that considers sex of the patient as a variable factor.",1868604 (contact),"NAKSHATRI, HARIKRISHNA  (contact)",NA,2020-04-01,2025-03-31,Address;Affect;African ancestry;African Women;Animal Model;anti-cancer research;Appearance;Atlases;Award;Biological;Biological Markers;Biology;biomarker discovery;Bladder;Body Weight decreased;bone;Book Chapters;Breast;breast cancer metastasis;Breast Cancer Model;Breast Cancer Patient;breast cancer progression;Breast Epithelial Cells;Cachexia;cancer cell;cancer initiation;Cancer Patient;cancer stem cell;Cancer Survivor;cancer type;carcinogenesis;career;Cells;Cellular biology;Cessation of life;Chemoprevention;Chemoresistance;chemotherapy;Chronic;Classification;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;Colorectal;Communication;Complement Factor H;Country;Defect;Dependence;Development;Distant;Drug usage;editorial;effective therapy;epithelial to mesenchymal transition;Estrogen Antagonists;estrogenic;Estrogens;Event;experience;Exposure to;Extramural Activities;Faculty;female sex hormone;Functional disorder;Funding;Future;Genetic;genomic aberrations;genomic data;Goals;graduate student;Grant Review;Growth;Head and Neck Cancer;Health;health disparity;Healthcare;high risk;High School Faculty;High School Student;Hormone Responsive;hormone therapy;Hormones;Human;improved;Inflammation;Infrastructure;inhibitor;Institution;International;Journals;Knowledge;Laboratories;lectures;Licensing;Life;Link;Lung;Malignant Breast Neoplasm;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammary Gland Parenchyma;Maps;Medical Students;member;men;Mentors;Methods;MicroRNAs;Mind;Modality;Molecular;Muscle;muscle form;Muscle function;Muscular Atrophy;Nature;Neoplasm Metastasis;nutrition;Oncogenes;Organ;Outcome;Oxygen;Pancreas;Pathway interactions;Patients;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Phosphotransferases;PI3 gene;PI3K/AKT;PIK3CG gene;Postdoctoral Fellow;prevent;Prevention strategy;Process;Productivity;programs;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt;Publications;Published Comment;Publishing;Quality of life;receptor;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Resistance;Resistance development;Resources;Rest;Review Committee;Risk;Role;Scientist;Screening for cancer;Seminal;sex;Sex Differences;Signal Pathway;single cell genomics;single cell sequencing;Skeletal Muscle;skeletal muscle wasting;Socioeconomic Factors;statistics;stemness;summer research;symptom management;Systemic disease;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;therapy development;therapy resistant;Tissue Banks;Tissues;Toremifene;treatment effect;treatment response;tumor progression;Veterans;Woman;Work,BLR&D Research Career Scientist Award Application,5244,ZRD1,ZRD1-RCSR-K(01),NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA

During the last 40 years, the proportion of CRC has increased by about 15% in the veteran population and thus constitutes a significant health risk for all veterans and their family members. The aberrant regulation of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes plays a pivotal role in the transformation of normal epithelium into primary and metastatic cancer. STRAP, a cellular protein, is upregulated in CRC, promotes tumorigenicity, metastasis, cancer stem-like cells, and drug resistance, thus contributing to worse survival of patients with chemotherapy. This study will discover novel and less toxic nanoparticles targeting STRAP in CRC, which will be used to codeliver 5-FU and Oxaliplatin.

Significant exposures also occurred in the Vietnam and Gulf Wars, during missions that involved entering dilapidated and demolished buildings. Scarring in the lung occurs after inhalation of asbestos, but no one knows why. We believe that non-degradable particles reprogram cells in the lung to produce acid and enzymes in a futile attempt to dissolve them, which causes collateral injury and fibrosis in surrounding tissues.

We recently identified a novel, Adriamycin (ADR)-induced mechanism of apoptosis that requires CARP-1 binding with H2AX. In addition, we have found CARP-1 regulates canonical NF-κB in the presence of ADR. CARP-1 binds with IKKγ (aka NEMO). A novel, small molecule inhibitor (SMI) of CARP-1/NEMO binding enhances ADR efficacy and sensitizes HBC cells to ERK-targeting therapeutics.

This research proposal is designed to identify the specific molecular factors that characterize the early bladder lesions, so as to provide more effective ways to diagnose, predict the progression, treat or even prevent the early lesions from advancing to the late stages.",6115649 (contact),"WU, XUE-RU  (contact)",NA,2022-04-01,2026-03-31,Affect;Animal Model;Area;Artificial Intelligence enhanced;Attention;Automobile Driving;base;Basic Science;Behavior;Biological;Biological Markers;biomarker driven;Bladder;bladder carcinoma in situ;Bladder mucosa;cancer initiation;cancer subtypes;Carcinogens;Carcinoma in Situ;CDH1 gene;chemical carcinogenesis;Clinical;Clinical Research;cost;Cytogenetic Analysis;Data;design;Detection;Diagnosis;Differentiation and Growth;Differentiation Antigens;Dominant-Negative Mutation;Doxycycline;Early Diagnosis;effective therapy;Emotional;Environment;Epigenetic Process;Epithelium;Exhibits;experience;experimental study;Exposure to;EZH2 gene;Genetic;genetic analysis;Genetic Drift;Genetic Transcription;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genomics;Heterogeneity;Human;immune cell infiltrate;immunological status;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;improved;In Situ Lesion;in vivo;insight;intravesical;Invaded;KDM1A gene;Knock-out;Knowledge;Lesion;Local Therapy;lost work time;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder;Malignant Neoplasms;Medical Care Costs;Medical center;Modeling;Molecular;molecular subtypes;Monitor;Muscle;muscle invasive bladder cancer;mutant;Neoplasm Metastasis;new therapeutic target;novel;novel diagnostics;Occupations;Oncogenic;Organ;Pain;Pathway interactions;Patients;Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors;Phenotype;Physiological;Polycomb;PPAR gamma;premalignant;prevent;Prevention;programs;progression risk;Quality of life;Radical Cystectomy;Radio;Reagent;Recurrence;Repressor Proteins;Research Proposals;Resources;response;risk prediction;risk stratification;Role;Scientist;Series;single-cell RNA sequencing;Smoking;Squamous cell carcinoma;synergism;System;Tamoxifen;Testing;therapeutic target;Tobacco smoke;TP53 gene;transcription factor;Transcriptional Regulation;Translational Research;Treatment Efficacy;treatment response;UPK2 gene;Urothelial Cell;Urothelium;Variant;Veterans,BCCMA: Basic and Translational Mechanisms of Cancer Initiation of the Urothelium in Veterans Exposed to Carcinogens: Role of PPARg in theFormation and Progression of Carcinoma in situ of the Bladder,5602,ZRD1,ZRD1-ONCA-Y(01),NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite these improvements, approximately 3400 CRC cases are diagnosed yearly within the VHA system. Unfortunately, an average of 615 patients per year are still diagnosed at Stage IV, which has an overall poor prognosis. Thus, our proposed studies fit very well within the VHA cancer research portfolio.

This line of research will deepen not only our understanding of BVES, but also our knowledge of the basic causes of CRC and how it advances.

Our overarching research goal is to understand how chromatin regulatory mechanisms influence nuclear and epigenetic programs, and how de-regulation of these mechanisms contributes to aging and disease. We focus on the mammalian SIRT6 and SIRT7 genes, members of the evolutionarily conserved “Sirtuin” gene family that regulates lifespan, metabolism, and stress resistance in many organisms. My lab has been at the forefront of studying the molecular mechanisms of SIRT6 and SIRT7 and their links to aging, cancer, and stress-resistance. We have pioneered biochemical and genomic approaches that established that SIRT6 and SIRT7 are highly selective histone deacetylase enzymes and identified their first known physiologic substrates. Our discoveries opened up the field for functional characterization of these hitherto orphan enzymes, by my lab and many others. We uncovered novel mechanisms of SIRT6 in preventing genomic instability, telomere dysfunction, DNA damage, heterochromatin dysfunction, aging-related epigenetic programs, and cellular senescence. We also elucidated functions of SIRT7 in regulating epigenetic oncogenic programs, tumor growth and metastasis, metabolic homeostasis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. We have also had a longstanding interest in understanding cellular senescence and its roles in aging and age-related disease pathologies. We have provided many insights into novel triggers of cellular senescence and their regulation by SIRT6 and SIRT7, including heterochromatin defects and accumulation of pathogenic transcripts from non-coding, repetitive DNA sequences. Our ongoing research activities continue to probe the biological functions of SIRT6 and SIRT7, focusing in several areas: (1) Elucidate novel biochemical activities and substrates, molecular interactions, and genomic and epigenomic targets of SIRT6 and SIRT7; (2) Determine the effects of activating or inhibiting SIRT6 and SIRT7 on aging processes in cellular systems and in vivo mouse models; (3) Determine if increased levels of SIRT6 or SIRT7 can protect against pathologies of aging and potentially extend lifespan; (4) Discover novel mechanistic links of these genes to diseases of high impact to the VA patient population including metabolic, inflammatory, neurodegenerative, musculoskeletal, and neoplastic disorders. Importantly, in addition to elucidating the specific functions of SIRT6 and SIRT7, our research on these genes continues to address fundamental questions in the biology of aging, including: (1) Molecular mechanisms of genomic instability, cellular aging, and immunosenescence, and the physiologic impacts of these processes on functional changes of aging and disease; (2) The potential for increased activity of SIRT6 or SIRT7, using in vivo mouse models, to protect against aging-related pathologies and improve health; (3) Epigenetic mechanisms in aging and cancer biology, which, unlike genetic mutations, can be reversible and offer potential targets for developing novel therapeutic strategies; (4) Novel mechanistic and physiologic interplay of metabolic changes and pathologies of aging; (5) Overlapping or opposing molecular processes in aging physiology and cancer.  Together, our work has a broad impact on research into molecular mechanisms of aging, metabolic disorders, cancer, and other aging-related pathologies, and promises to continue to provide new insights that may be translated into therapeutic strategies for diseases that impact Veterans’ health. .",1907889 (contact),"CHUA, KATRIN F (contact)",NA,2022-04-01,2027-03-31,Address;age-related disease;aged;Aging;aging mechanism;aging process;aging related;Area;Automobile Driving;Award;Binding;Biochemical;Biochemistry;Biological Process;Biology;Biology of Aging;Cancer Biology;Cardiovascular Diseases;career;Cell Aging;Cell Physiology;Cells;Chromatin;Chronic Disease;Collaborations;Defect;Diabetes Mellitus;Direct Costs;Disease;DNA Damage;DNA Sequence;DNA Sequence Alteration;Enzymes;epigenetic aging;Epigenetic Process;epigenomics;extend lifespan;Functional disorder;Funding;Future;Gene Expression Regulation;Gene Family;gene network;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Genomic approach;Genomic Instability;Genomics;Goals;Grant;Health;Healthcare;Heart Diseases;Heterochromatin;Histone Deacetylase;Histone Deacetylation;histone methyltransferase;Homeostasis;Human;human old age (65+);immunosenescence;Impairment;improved;in vivo;Inflammation;Inflammatory;insight;interest;Journals;Lead;life span;Link;Liver diseases;Lysine;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;member;Metabolic;Metabolic Diseases;Metabolic stress;Metabolism;Methylation;military veteran;Molecular;Molecular Biology;Morbidity - disease rate;mouse model;muscle regeneration;Musculoskeletal;Nature;Neoplasm Metastasis;neoplastic;Nerve Degeneration;non-alcoholic fatty liver disease;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;Nuclear;Obesity;Oncogenic;Organism;Orphan;Oxidative Stress;Paper;Pathogenicity;Pathologic;Pathology;Pathway interactions;patient population;Physiological;Physiology;Population;prevent;Process;professor;programs;Proteins;Proteomics;Publishing;Reader;Regulation;Research;Research Activity;Research Personnel;Resistance;Risk Factors;Role;Scientist;senescence;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Sirtuins;Squamous Cell Lung Carcinoma;stem cell biology;Stress;structural biology;System;targeted treatment;telomere;Therapeutic;Tissues;Transcript;Translating;tumor growth;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Untranslated RNA;Veterans;Work,BLRD Research Career Scientist Award Application,6035,ZRD1,ZRD1-RCSR-K(01)A,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our central hypothesis is that loss of function mutations of COMPASS create epigenetic imbalance at histone sites facilitating immune evasion by Enhancer of Zeste-2 (EZH2). In this proposal, we will investigate EZH2- mediated repression of antigen presentation, chemokine production and lymphocyte recruitment, and enhanced Tregulatory activity to identify new immunotherapy strategies for treatment of Veterans.",6069708 (contact),"MEEKS, JOSHUA JAMES (contact)",NA,2016-10-01,2025-03-31,Accounting;Aftercare;anti-PD1 therapy;anti-tumor immune response;Antigen Presentation;Award;bench-to-bedside translation;Bladder;Bladder Neoplasm;Blocking Antibodies;cancer cell;Cancer Etiology;Cancer Model;cancer survival;Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program;Carcinogens;Carcinoma;Cause of Death;CD3 Antigens;CD8B1 gene;Cells;checkpoint therapy;chemokine;chemotherapy;Chromatin;Chromatin Remodeling Factor;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Network;Complex;Data;Detection;Early Therapeutic-Clinical Trials Network;Enhancers;Enzymes;Epigenetic Process;epigenetic regulation;epigenetic therapy;Equilibrium;Eragrostis;Exposure to;Frequencies;Funding;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Genomics;Goals;histone demethylase;Histones;Human;Immune;immune activation;immune cell infiltrate;immune checkpoint;Immune Evasion;Immune response;Immune system;Immunotherapy;Impairment;improved;In Vitro;Infiltration;inhibitor;innovation;Interdisciplinary Study;Investigation;Investigational Therapies;Link;loss of function mutation;lymph nodes;Lymphocyte;Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;men;Molecular;mouse model;Mus;Mutation;Nature;novel therapeutic intervention;novel therapeutics;Organoids;Outcome;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Patients;PD-1 inhibitors;pembrolizumab;Phase I/II Clinical Trial;Phase I/II Trial;Polycomb;Precision therapeutics;Production;Property;recruit;Recurrence;refractory cancer;Regulation;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Repression;Repressor Proteins;Research;Resistance;response;Risk Reduction;Role;Site;Smoking;Solid Neoplasm;Somatic Mutation;stemness;T-Cell Activation;T-Lymphocyte;therapy resistant;Trans-Activators;Transcriptional Regulation;Transitional Cell Carcinoma;Translating;treatment strategy;tumor;tumor microenvironment;Urothelium;Veterans;Work,Epigenetic Regulation of Immune Evasion in Bladder Cancer,3692,ZRD1,ZRD1-ONCA-Y(01),NA,NA,8,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our veterans suffer disproportionately from end stage lung disease, making the improvement of lung transplant outcomes a vital mission. Thus, there is a critical need to develop new treatments.

This is particularly concerning for U.S. veterans, who are at an increased risk for lung cancer, from which 5,500 veterans die each year. Cancers often have abnormalities in their ability to repair DNA damage, which we believe are important to the development of mutations and other characteristic changes or lung cancer. Our laboratory has found a critical role of the DNA repair protein, Xeroderma Pigmentosum Group C (XPC) in protection against non-small cell lung cancer development. Using mouse carcinogen models of lung cancer and human lung cancer samples, we will look at the impact of DNA repair and XPC specifically on the earliest genetic changes and response to immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer.

A prior publication has shown that ARSB is reduced as melanomas progress in invasiveness. ARSB is required for removal of sulfate groups of chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S) and for the degradation of C4S. In the absence of ARSB, C4S accumulates and affects the function of other critical molecules which bind to it, more or less depending on the sulfation. Changes in binding with C4S lead to transcriptional events, including increased expression of the melanoma specific proteoglycan CSPG4 and of pro-MMP2, which facilitates invasion of melanoma cells. This project addresses how decline in ARSB leads to increased PD-L1 and considers how modulation of ARSB may affect the progression of melanoma, impact on the response to checkpoint inhibition, and reduce morbidity and mortality.",8366742 (contact),"TOBACMAN, JOANNE KRAMER (contact)",NA,2021-07-01,2025-06-30,Address;Affect;anti-PD1 therapy;Apoptosis;Arylsulfatase B;Binding;Biological;Breast;cancer cell;Cardiac;CD34 gene;Cell Line;Cell Physiology;Cell Survival;Cells;Characteristics;checkpoint inhibition;checkpoint therapy;Chondroitin;Chondroitin Sulfate A;chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan;Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycan;Clinical;Coculture Techniques;Colon;Dermatan Sulfate;Disease;Doctor of Medicine;Doctor of Philosophy;Dose;Early Diagnosis;Effectiveness;enzyme activity;Enzymes;Event;Excision;experience;experimental study;Family;Family member;Galectin 3;Gelatinase A;General Population;Genetic Transcription;Growth;Human;human tissue;humanized mouse;Immune;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;immunomodulatory therapies;Immunooncology;Implant;improved;insight;Insulin Receptor;interest;Invaded;Investigation;knock-down;Knockout Mice;Lead;lead sulfate;Liver;Lymphocyte;Lysosomal Storage Diseases;Malignant Neoplasms;MAP Kinase Gene;MAPK3 gene;MAPK8 gene;Matrix Metalloproteinases;Measures;Mediator;melanocyte;Melanoma;Melanoma Cell;Metastatic Melanoma;MMP2 gene;Modification;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality;mouse model;Mucopolysaccharidosis VI;Mus;Mutation;Neurologic;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutic intervention;Nuclear Translocation;Oncologist;Orthopedics;overexpression;p38 Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase;Pathology;Patients;pembrolizumab;Phosphorylation;polysulfated glycosaminoglycan;programmed cell death ligand 1;Prostate;Protein Dephosphorylation;Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase;Proteoglycan;PTPN11 gene;Publications;Publishing;Radial;Recombinants;Recurrence;Reporting;Research Personnel;respiratory;response;Role;Signal Transduction;Signaling Molecule;Stage at Diagnosis;Structure;Sulfatases;Sulfate;Testing;Time;Tissue Microarray;Tissues;Toxic effect;Transcription Coactivator;transcription factor;transcriptome sequencing;Treatment Effectiveness;Treatment Protocols;Veterans;Work;Xenograft Model,Impact of N-Acetylgalactosamine-4-Sulfatase (Arylsulfatase B) on the Progression of Melanoma,5342,ZRD1,ZRD1-ONCB-A(01)1,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA

The post- deployment demographic data and occupations suggest a potential risk for veterans to be exposed to metals, such as iAs and Pb, in environmental as well as occupational settings. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms that link metal exposure and prostate cancer are understudied. This application will test the hypothesis that iAs or Pb transforms prostate epithelial stem-like cells to initiate or increase PCa risk in a mouse models.

While stent technology has improved over the years, including the development of drug-eluting stents, failure rates remain high and current technologies are associated with significant challenges. We propose to develop an innovative, paradigm-shifting stent technology that will obviate the need for placement of permanent metal stents in the arterial system for the treatment of severe atherosclerosis. Specifically, we propose to develop a solid biodegradable stent from a liquid drug-eluting polymer by photo-polymerizing the stent in the body using a specially designed triple balloon catheter. This custom-formed stent will prevent thrombosis and restenosis while simultaneously promoting endothelialization and long-term vascular health.

Consequently, a major goal of NIH is to understand the neural mechanisms that underlie adaptive and maladaptive threat processing. The hippocampus and locus coeruleus both contribute to fear and anxiety, but it is not known how they interact during these states to promote the encoding of aversive memories. This represents a major gap in our understanding of the neural systems that contribute to emotional disorders. Altered catecholamine release by the locus coeruleus accompanies schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and ADHD, which are often comorbid with fear and anxiety disorders. Alzheimer’s disease also produces severe atrophy of the locus coeruleus, which reduces catecholamine release throughout the brain and is thought to exacerbate amnesia. To determine how altered catecholamine levels impact these disorders, it is essential to establish the basic mechanisms by which neuromodulatory inputs to the hippocampus regulate the formation of aversive memories.",7689233 (contact),"WILTGEN, BRIAN J (contact)","BABCOCK, DEBRA J",2023-08-01,2027-07-31,Address;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;American;Amnesia;Animals;Anxiety;Anxiety Disorders;Association Learning;Atrophic;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;Auditory;aversive conditioning;Aversive Stimulus;Bipolar Disorder;Brain;Catecholamines;comorbidity;conditioned fear;Cues;Data;Disease;Dopamine;Dopamine Antagonists;Dopamine Receptor;Dorsal;Electrophysiology (science);Emotional disorder;emotional experience;Environment;Event;experience;experimental study;Extinction;follow-up;Food;Fright;Future;Genetic;Goals;Hippocampus;Hour;Human;Impairment;in vivo;Learning;Life;locus ceruleus structure;long term memory;member;Memory;memory consolidation;Memory impairment;memory process;Mental disorders;Monitor;neural;neuromechanism;Neuromodulator Receptors;Neurons;neuroregulation;Norepinephrine;novel;optogenetics;Play;prevent;Procedures;Process;psychologic;Rattus;rehearsal;response;Role;Schizophrenia;sensor;Shock;Stimulus;Synaptic plasticity;System;Testing;Time;tool;Training;United States;United States National Institutes of Health,The role of novelty and surprise in aversive conditioning,129217,BRLE,"Biobehavioral Regulation, Learning and Ethology Study Section[BRLE]",NA,NA,2,357138,210046,567184,NA

Clinically they are characterized by memory loss and impairment of cognitive functions secondary to a progressive accumulation in the brain of toxic tau protein. Currently, because the mechanisms responsible for this accumulation remain unknown, no therapy is available against these devastating diseases. In recent years, small molecules called microRNAs have emerged as master regulators of brain health and disease. Although their levels are altered in AD and tauopathies, we still do not know whether they are responsible for them.

By measuring the motions of cochlear structures in animals using state-of-the-art high-resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT), we will be able to create anatomically realistic 3D finite-element computational models of the inner ear and these models will, in turn, allow us to predict how a patient’s hearing and OAEs would be affected by specific types of structural damage or genetic mutations, thus providing a powerful way of diagnosing hearing problems in terms of their structural basis. These models may also accelerate the development of biological interventions centered around the regeneration of cochlear structures, by providing ways of predicting and comparing the hearing outcomes of various therapeutic strategies, or by providing understanding of the structural changes in the cochlea arising from noise damage; and such computer models may reduce the need for animal experimentation in the future.",8650392 (contact),"PURIA, SUNIL  (contact)","CYR, JANET",2007-02-05,2028-06-30,3-Dimensional;Acceleration;Acoustic Stimulation;Address;Affect;Anatomic Models;Anatomy;Animal Experimentation;Animals;Apical;Area;Basal Plate;base;Basilar Membrane;biological development;Bulla;Cell Adhesion Molecules;Cell membrane;Cell Physiology;Cells;Clinical;Cochlea;Cochlear duct;Complex;Computer Models;Data;Diagnosis;DNA Sequence Alteration;Elements;Environment;Esthesia;experimental study;External auditory canal;flexibility;Frequencies;Funding;Future;Gerbils;Goals;hair cell regeneration;Hair Cells;Hearing;Hearing problem;hearing range;histological slides;Human;Image;In Situ;in vivo;Individual;Inner Hair Cells;Intercellular Junctions;Intervention;Knowledge;Labyrinth;Lead;Liquid substance;Location;machine learning algorithm;Measurement;Measures;Mechanics;meter;Microanatomy;Microscopic;Modeling;mosaic;Motion;Mus;Mutation;Natural regeneration;Noise;Optical Coherence Tomography;Organ of Corti;otoacoustic emission;Outcome;Outer Hair Cells;Pathology;Patients;Persons;Phalanx;Phase;Pillar Cell;pressure;Process;Property;Publishing;Radial;Research;Resolution;response;Role;Sensorineural Hearing Loss;sound;Specific qualifier value;Stereocilium;Stretching;Structure;System;Techniques;tectorial membrane;Tectum Mesencephali;Testing;Therapeutic;Thinking;Translating;Travel;two-photon;Viscosity;Wild Type Mouse;Work,Measuring and Modeling the Cochlear Organ-of-Corti Motions Responsible for Inner-and Outer-Hair-Cell Drives and Amplification,7910,AUD,Auditory System Study Section[AUD],NA,NA,16,409528,286670,696198,NA
