The development of effective pharmacological treatments for Iraq/Afghanistan-era Veterans with PTSD is especially urgent, as Veterans returning from deployments experience high rates of PTSD often resulting in debilitating symptoms and reduced quality of life. Converging data suggest that pregnenolone is a promising pharmacological agent for treating PTSD symptoms.

Identifying novel enzyme-catalyzed reactions and understanding their catalytic mechanisms is essential for expanding the biocatalytic toolbox. We have recently discovered a unique copper-containing antibiotic, fluopsin C, which is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a leading cause of multidrug-resistant nosocomial infections. By studying how P. aeruginosa makes fluopsin C, we identified an unusual biosynthetic pathway that involves novel enzyme chemistry. For instance, two iron-dependent enzymes of a new heme-oxygenase-like enzyme family catalyze a carbon excision and an oxidative decarboxylation and N-hydroxylation respectively. Two lyases of the adenylosuccinate lyase enzyme family exhibit novel activities of making and breaking carbon-sulfur bonds respectively. The chemistries we identified have expanded the catalytic capabilities of these enzyme families. We hypothesize that the fluopsin C biosynthetic enzymes use novel catalytic mechanisms and can be repurposed or engineered to generate new molecules. To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of enzyme kinetics, structural biology, spectroscopy, and synthetic chemistry tools, with a focus on three enzymes in fluopsin C biosynthesis. Studies of these distinct enzymes will advance the fundamental understanding of how their respective enzyme family catalyzes diverse chemistry. Defining the mechanisms and substrate scope of the enzymes will allow them to be further explored for biocatalytic use. Scientific justification. The proposed ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled high resolution mass spectrometer (UHPLC-HRMS) will replace a current, but aging equipment of an earlier model in the Li lab that is essential to the success of the NIH-funded project. Our current instrument is an Agilent 6520 Quadruple Time-of-Flight (QToF) coupled with a 1200 series HPLC. We use this instrument extensively for characterization of enzymatic reactions that are described in the parent award. The proposed instrument, 6546 QToF with Jet Stream source coupled with 1290 Infinity II HPLC system, will augment our extant capabilities by improving sensitivity, increasing experiment throughput, and reducing downtime. For instance, the 6546 QToF with Jet Stream source can detect analytes at both low and high concentrations with sub-parts per million mass accuracy and isotope fidelity within 5%. The 1290 Infinity II HPLC system uses a high-speed binary pump with capability of pressure up to 1300 bar and 5 ml/min; the high pressure and flow rate are particularly suitable for separating chiral and polar molecules. Many small- molecule products and intermediates in the enzymatic reactions exhibit minimal ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) light absorbance, therefore, these compounds cannot be detected via the traditional UV-vis detector. High resolution mass spectrometry detectors are essential for the detection and characterization of these molecules. The requested UHPLC-HRMS will be used for three key aspects of this project: (1) analysis of products of enzymatic assays toward both native and nonnative substrates including isotope-labeled compounds; (2) detection of low-level transient intermediates of enzymatic reactions; 3) metabolomic analysis of bacterial cultures to identify novel natural products. The instrument was not requested in the original grant application because: We did not anticipate the discontinuation of our service contract or availabilities of parts. Our current instrument is 13 years old and was down or under repair for a significant amount of time in the past year (~50 days, approximately 1200 hours or 15% of the year). Last year, we received notice that our instrument can no longer be covered under a service contract due to its age. The manufacturer of the instrument, Agilent Technologies, also stopped making parts for the 6520 model. Also, we did not anticipate the need for ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography for separations of chiral compounds or anticipate the number of metabolomics experiments that we would be performing to identify novel compounds. The requested instrument will replace our existing equipment AND provide new capabilities to advance the goals in the parent award as described below: Aim 1: Mechanism of methine carbon excision by the heme-oxygenase-like enzyme FlcD. The requested UHPLC-HRMS will allow us to characterize the activity of FlcD variants and detect transient intermediates that exist in low quantities in the FlcD reaction. FlcD excises a methine carbon from the oxime of its substrate. To identify essential residues for substrate binding and catalysis, we need UHPLC- HRMS to measure the activities of FlcD variants accurately and quickly. The high-resolution mass spectrometry will also allow us to detect and quantify low-level reaction intermediates amongst high concentrations of substrates and products. Additionally, the instrument with isotope fidelity within 5% is essential for distinguishing the products with mass differences less than 1 Da from isotope labeling experiments. Aim 2: Mechanism of oxidative decarboxylation and N-hydroxylation by the heme-oxygenase-like enzyme FlcE. The requested UHPLC-HRMS will allow us to characterize the activity of FlcE variants and detect transient intermediates that exist in low quantities in the FlcE reaction. FlcE catalyzes sequential decarboxylation and N-hydroxylation. Similar UHPLC-HRMS analysis as described in Aim 1 is essential for high-throughput characterization of FlcE variants to identify essential catalytic residues and low-level reaction intermediates. In addition, we are expanding our study to include homologs of FlcD and FlcE that we have identified in uncharacterized biosynthetic gene clusters. Metabolomic capabilities of the UHPLC-HRMS will enable us to identify new natural products and novel functions of heme oxygenase-like enzymes. Aim 3: Substrate scope analysis and bioengineering of the adenylosuccinate lyase FlcB. The requested UHPLC will allow us to characterize the activity and enantioselectivity of FlcB and variants in a high-throughput format. We found that the adenylosuccinate lyase FlcB exhibits a broad substrate scope toward thiol and amine nucleophiles that is different from its native substrate cysteine. We are characterizing the regio- and stereo-selective formation of both C-S and C-N bonds by measuring the enantio excess and turnover number of each reaction in triplicates. The proposed instrument will allow us to analyze >100 samples a day while providing high resolution to separate the enantiomers. This capability will enable us to examine the activity our engineered variants of FlcB much more quickly and accelerate the identification of useful variants as biocatalysts. Routine training and maintenance: Every personnel on the project will participate in the initial on-site training by the manufacturer (Agilent). One person in the group will be designated the person-in-charge on the instrument, and this person will train other new users in the group. Maintenance on the LC will be covered by a service contract, which includes preventative maintenance visits once a year and unlimited on-site repairs. Timeline for installation: The instrument will be delivered and installed on average 7 weeks after the order is placed. We expect the instrument to be fully functional by that time.",10652468 (contact),"LI, BO  (contact)","SIMONOVIC, MILJAN",2022-09-20,2026-08-31,13 year old;Acceleration;adenylosuccinate lyase;Administrative Supplement;Age;Aging;Amines;Anabolism;Antibiotics;Applications Grants;Binding;Biochemical Reaction;Biological Assay;Biomedical Engineering;Carbon;Catalysis;Charge;Chemistry;Contract Services;Copper;Coupled;Cysteine;Decarboxylation;Detection;detector;enantiomer;Engineering;Enzyme Kinetics;Enzymes;Equipment;Excision;Exhibits;experimental study;Family;fluopsin;Funding;Gene Cluster;Goals;Heme;High Pressure Liquid Chromatography;Homologous Gene;Hour;Human Resources;improved;Industrialization;instrument;Iron;Isotope Labeling;Isotopes;Lyase;Maintenance;Manufacturer;mass spectrometer;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Measures;metabolomics;Modeling;Multi-Drug Resistance;N hydroxylation;Natural Products;non-Native;Nosocomial Infections;novel;Oximes;Oxygenases;parent grant;parent project;Pathway interactions;Persons;Pharmacologic Substance;pressure;Pseudomonas aeruginosa;Pump;Reaction;repaired;Research;Resolution;Sampling;Series;Site;small molecule;Source;Spectrum Analysis;Speed;Stream;structural biology;success;Sulfhydryl Compounds;Sulfur;Synthesis Chemistry;System;Technology;Testing;Time;timeline;tool;Training;ultra high pressure;ultraviolet;United States National Institutes of Health;Variant;Visible Radiation;Visit,Ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled high resolution mass spectrometer,148685,NA,NA,NA,S2,2,205000,0,205000,NA

In this diversity supplement, we will expand our investigations based on newly published data that telomerase inhibitors are potent ferroptosis inducers, and further rooted in the understanding that telomerase is a key MYCN-driven dysfunctional pathway in neuroblastoma, we will determine the efficacy of clinically- advanced telomerase inhibitors in combination with canonical Ferroptosis inducers.",10310162 (contact);8320609,"FABER, ANTHONY CHARLES (contact);OLZMANN, JAMES A","FORRY, SUZANNE L",2024-04-01,2028-08-31,Anabolism;Antioxidants;Apoptosis;Apoptotic;Applications Grants;BCL1 Oncogene;cancer cell;cancer therapy;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Death;Cell Line;Clinic;Clinical;clinical efficacy;Clinical Investigator;Coenzyme A;Combined Modality Therapy;Complex;Cysteine;Data;Dependence;Drug Metabolic Detoxication;Drug Targeting;efficacy evaluation;experimental study;FDA approved;Genetic;Genomics;Glutathione;glutathione peroxidase;Goals;Grant;improved;inhibitor;Investigation;Iron;iron metabolism;kinase inhibitor;Malignant Childhood Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;mouse model;MYCN gene;Neuroblastoma;neuroblastoma cell;novel;novel therapeutics;Oncogenes;Oncogenic;Pantothenate kinase;parent grant;Pathway interactions;patient derived xenograft model;Patients;Pediatric Neoplasm;Pharmacologic Substance;Phenotype;pre-clinical;Production;programs;Publishing;Reaction;Reactive Oxygen Species;Refractory;Research Design;resistance mechanism;screening;Selenocysteine;Telomerase;Telomerase inhibition;Telomerase Inhibitor;Therapeutic;Time;transcription factor;Translating;treatment response;tumor;Work,MYCN drives a ferroptotic vulnerability in neuroblastoma,276207,NA,NA,NA,A1S1,1,25727,14214,39941,NA

Immunotherapies that are effective in other cancers, such as checkpoint blockade, are rarely effective in castration resistant prostate cancer. However, some patients with lethal prostate cancers who harbor certain molecular features may respond to checkpoint blockade. We will analyze the tumors of 200 Veterans with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer for these molecular features that might predict response to checkpoint blockade.

Despite attaining notable progress on most health indicators for the Sustainable Development Goals, Bangladesh has a high prevalence of a number of infectious diseases. Close living arrangements with animals and poultry, poverty, lack of regulations, poor infection control hygiene practices and inadequate resources, exacerbates the risk of emerging infections, making the country a hotspot for the emergence of a number of infectious diseases, including those with epidemic or pandemic potential. From early detection to intervention, we commit our efforts in various aspects of combating emerging infectious diseases. Our work spans epidemiology, virology, virus ecology, surveillance, risk analysis, prevention, and social and behavioral change. Our long-standing collaboration with the global partners provides the opportunity to foster the tracking of infections through hospital-based surveillance and population-based surveys in alliance with the Government of Bangladesh. Our research focuses on detection and response, building on our existing partnerships and surveillance capabilities and aims to provide important data for prioritizing emerging infections for public health intervention in Bangladesh. The proposed projects address important public health problems of Bangladesh, which will provide clinicians and policy makers with data to make public health decisions. Our surveillances support International Health Regulations (IHR), Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), global health security and global surveillances. Our laboratory capacity enabled us to study emerging infections and antimicrobial resistant pathogens.
