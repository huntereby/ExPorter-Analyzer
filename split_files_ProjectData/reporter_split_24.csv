Obesity and diabetes are critical conditions that impair the metabolic regulation of many tissues. This proposal will optimize NAD functions in the metabolism of fracture tissues for the enhancement of bone fracture repair in an obesity/Type-2 diabetic condition. Obesity and the associated condition of Type-2 diabetes have become more frequent in the general population and are even more serious among aging veterans. It is well established that Type-2 diabetics generally suffer from impaired tissue and bone healing caused by an insufficient metabolic response to the requirements of tissue repair. Among the many documented effects of Type-2 diabetes on bone, the critical processes of osteogenesis and vascularity are reduced. Wound healing in challenging physiological conditions such as diabetes and obesity is therefore particularly problematic in bone repair and requires novel approaches that optimize tissue metabolism for healing.  This study will develop novel local therapeutic approaches to improve the tissue redox potential and promote bone repair in an obesity/Type-2 diabetes condition. This intervention will increase NAD production and fracture tissue metabolism through the local application of NAMPT agonists and augment NAMPT functions in the NAD salvage pathway. To achieve these objectives, selected agonists of NAMPT functions will be screened for their action on periosteal cells and identified as therapeutic candidates for the enhancement of NAD biosynthesis. These NAMPT agonists will subsequently be applied locally to the fracture tissues of mice induced to an obesity/Type-2 diabetic through a high-fat diet and bone repair then evaluated.  We have acquired exciting preliminary data demonstrating that local applications of an antagonist of NAMPT inhibits the functions of bone cells in vitro and impairs bone formation in vivo in the fractures of normal mice. It therefore stands to reason that the local application of an agonist of NAMPT functions would produce the opposite effect, enhancing NAD production and tissue metabolism, promoting bone formation in mice with physiologic conditions of reduced tissue metabolism and ultimately enhancing otherwise impaired bone fracture healing. We have chosen the obesity/Type-2 diabetic condition to test our hypothesis that augmenting NAMPT functions through the local application of an NAMPT agonist improves bone formation and fracture repair in an obesity/Type-2 diabetic condition, we hypothesize that NAD production is insufficient to maintain the tissue metabolism necessary for sufficient bone formation and fracture repair.  Two specific aims are proposed to develop this approach. 1) Agonists of NAMPT function will be screened in those bone cells established as mediators of endochondral bone formation, specifically periosteal cells. The effects of these NAMPT agonists on bone cell proliferation, motility and redox potential will be characterized. 2) Candidate NAMPT agonists that are especially potent or multifunctional in the enhancement of these functions in periosteal cells will subsequently be injected directly to the tibial fractures of mice that have been induced to the obesity/Type-2 diabetes condition through a high-fat diet. The effects of these agonists on bone repair in this condition will be characterized by various radiologic and histologic approaches for their promotion of healing. The results will help to develop local therapeutic interventions that improve impaired bone fracture repair.  The completion of the proposed studies should facilitate the development of novel therapeutic interventions that improve tissue responses to the metabolic requirements of wound repair and promote the healing of skeletal and non-skeletal tissues in challenging conditions such as age, obesity and diabetes.",8775337 (contact),"RUNDLE, CHARLES  (contact)",NA,2023-05-01,2025-04-30,Adenosine;Age;Aging;Agonist;Anabolism;Animal Model;antagonist;Blood Vessels;bone;Bone callus;bone cell;Bone Density;bone fracture repair;bone healing;bone repair;Cartilage;cell motility;Cell Physiology;Cell Proliferation;Chronic;Clinical;Clinical Pathology;comorbidity;Complications of Diabetes Mellitus;Data;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Diabetic mouse;Dinucleoside Phosphates;dosage;Dose;Economics;efficacy testing;Fracture;Future;General Population;healing;Health;High Fat Diet;Histologic;Histology;immune cell infiltrate;Immunohistochemistry;Impairment;improved;In Vitro;in vivo;Inflammation;Injury;Intervention;Longevity;Measurement;Measures;Mediator;Medical;Metabolic;Metabolism;microCT;Motility;mouse model;Mus;NADH;Niacinamide;nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutic intervention;Obesity;Oryctolagus cuniculus;Osteoclasts;Osteogenesis;Overweight;Oxidation-Reduction;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;patient population;Periosteal Cell;pharmacologic;Physiological;Population;Prevalence;Probability;Process;Production;Radiology Specialty;Reactive Oxygen Species;Regulation;repaired;response;Roentgen Rays;Safety;sensor;Signal Pathway;skeletal;small molecule;Testing;Therapeutic;therapeutic candidate;Therapeutic Intervention;Tibial Fractures;Time;tissue repair;Tissues;Titrations;Type 2 diabetic;United States;Veterans;Wild Type Mouse;wound;wound healing,NAMPT regulation of fracture tissue metabolism during bone healing,4395,RRDS,Rehabilitation Research and Development SPiRE Program[RRDS],NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA

To date the factors that promote fat deposition in the liver and the transition from steatosis to NASH and cirrhosis in humans are unknown in specific human genetic backgrounds.

The full complement of these genes constitutes the organism's genome. Furthermore the genome of each individual within a species varies slightly, thus providing the genetic basis of the many differences we see between individuals. The technology of DNA sequencing has allowed scientists to construct the shared genome sequence of humans and many species of plant and animal, providing powerful evidence for the evolutionary connections between species. Effort is now going into decoding the genetic differences between individuals within a species, particularly for individual humans and their susceptibility to disease. Many of these advances rely upon interactions between a diverse set of experts, ranging from engineers developing ever faster sequencing technologies, bioinformatics experts who handle the very large datasets generated by these machines, biologists who interpret the results in the context of known biology to shed new light on fundamental mechanisms, and medical experts who seek to apply this information to improved medical treatment and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

Changes in their overall shapes are important in establishing a link between the inside and outside of the cell. Therefore, defects in integrin structures are implicated in many diseases—including bleeding disorders, inflammation, and cancer—and thus are critical and proven drug targets. The platelet integrin, called αIIbβ3, is essential in platelet aggregation events. Dysregulated platelet aggregation is the trigger for abnormal thrombotic disorders such as heart attacks and strokes. There are currently three licensed αIIbβ3 drugs; however, these cause severe bleeding complications and are thus only used for a brief period of time (less than 72 hours). Using these clinical and preclinical drugs, our proposal aims to gain a new understanding of αIIbβ3 structure and function with the ultimate goal of positively impacting the broad integrin αIIbβ3 therapeutic space in the future.",15096803 (contact),"WANG, ZHAO  (contact)","BAI, C BRIAN",2022-05-05,2026-04-30,3-Dimensional;Adaptor Signaling Protein;Affinity;Agonist;antagonist;Architecture;Binding;Biochemical;Biological Assay;Biology;biophysical techniques;Blood Coagulation Disorders;Blood Platelets;Cell surface;Cell Surface Receptors;Cells;Cessation of life;Cholesterol;Classification;Clinical;clinical effect;clinically relevant;Complex;Cryo-electron tomography;Cryoelectron Microscopy;Cytoskeleton;Defect;Detergents;Development;Disease;Dose;Drug Design;Drug Targeting;Drug usage;effective therapy;EGF gene;Equilibrium;Event;experimental study;Family;Feasibility Studies;Fibrinogen;Future;Goals;Hematological Disease;Hemorrhage;Hour;Human;Hybrids;Imaging Techniques;Immunotherapy;improved;In Situ;in situ imaging;In Vitro;Inflammation;inhibitor;insight;Integral Membrane Protein;Integrins;Investigation;Ions;Kinetics;Laboratories;Length;Licensing;Ligands;Link;Macrophage-1 Antigen;Malignant Neoplasms;Maps;Membrane;microvesicles;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Conformation;Molecular Probes;Monoclonal Antibodies;Myocardial Infarction;nanodisk;nanometer resolution;novel;particle;Pathology;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physiological;Platelet Activation;Platelet aggregation;platelet function;pre-clinical;Process;Property;Protein Structure Initiative;Proteins;receptor;reconstitution;Regulation;Reporting;Research;Resolution;Roentgen Rays;Role;Shapes;Signal Transduction;skills;small molecule;Specimen;Stroke;structural biology;Structure;success;Surface;targeted treatment;Techniques;Therapeutic;therapeutic target;Thermodynamics;Thick;Thigh structure;Thrombasthenia;Thrombocytopenia;Thrombosis;thrombotic;Time;tomography;Vesicle;Visualization;von Willebrand Factor,Investigation of the Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms of Thrombocyte Integrin Signaling,162842,HTBT,"Hemostasis, Thrombosis, Blood Cells and Transfusion Study Section[HTBT]",NA,NA,3,288000,108600,396600,NA

The successful validation of FLIm, with the sophisticated incorporation of head and neck cancer patient and radiology data to improve the tissue classifier, will allow for more cures with less long- term side effects and will be easily extended to other robotic and endoscopic procedures, thus advancing innovation well beyond TORS.",12436574;6647839 (contact);2291274,"BIRKELAND, ANDREW CHARLES;MARCU, LAURA  (contact);SORGER, JONATHAN M","AVULA, LEELA RANI",2014-09-12,2026-04-30,Accounting;Address;Adopted;Affect;Age;Area;Authorization documentation;Biochemical;Biological;cancer surgery;Cauterize;Characteristics;Classification;Clinical;Clinical Protocols;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;cohort;Colorectal Cancer;Computer software;Coupled;Data;data acquisition;Data Display;data visualization;Databases;Decision Making;deep learning;design;Detection;Devices;Diagnostic;diagnostic value;Disease;Documentation;Environment;Epithelium;Excision;Feedback;flexibility;Fluorescence;fluorescence lifetime imaging;functional outcomes;Funding;Goals;Head and Neck Cancer;head and neck cancer patient;Hemostatic function;Histopathology;Human;human subject;Image;image reconstruction;image registration;Image-Guided Surgery;imaging detection;Imaging Device;Imaging Techniques;Imaging technology;improved;In Situ;information display;innovation;Intuition;Knowledge;Label;learning progression;Legal patent;Location;Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm;malignant mouth neoplasm;Malignant neoplasm of thorax;Malignant Neoplasms;malignant oropharynx neoplasm;Medical Records;Metabolic;Methods;Morphologic artifacts;Motion;neoplastic;Noise;Normal tissue morphology;novel;Operative Surgical Procedures;optical imaging;Oral;Oral cavity;Oropharyngeal;Patients;Peer Review;Performance;Positron-Emission Tomography;pragmatic implementation;Predictive Value;preservation;Procedures;Property;prospective;Prospective Studies;Radiology Specialty;radiomics;Reporting;Risk Management;Robot;robotic system;Robotics;Scanning;sex;side effect;Signal Transduction;solid state;Specimen;Spectrum Analysis;Speed;Surface;Surgeon;surgery outcome;Surgical margins;Surgical Oncology;symposium;System;Testing;Time;Tissues;tumor;Urologic Cancer;Validation;Visual;Visualization,Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging/Spectroscopy System For Robotic Cancer Surgery Guidance,187427,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-SBIB-Q(57)R],NA,NA,10,427500,188123,615623,NA

Nearly 2 billion people worldwide infected with hepatic viral diseases are at risk for developing liver cancer and dying owing to limited therapeutic options. While historically systemic chemotherapy has been the cornerstone to cancer treatment, inability to achieve uniform drug delivery to tumors, collateral toxicity to non- cancerous liver and systemic side-effects have limited progress in the development of novel therapies for liver cancer. We propose a transformative platform technology that uses a catheter based locoregional approach to deliver X-ray visible bioengineered biomaterial, i.e. next generation TACE, to induce a more efficient ischemic cell death within the tumor microvasculature that can be coupled with chemo- and immunotherapy.
