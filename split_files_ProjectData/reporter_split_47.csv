Currently, an estimated 5.7 million Americans of all ages have AD. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) plays a critical role in maintaining synaptic plasticity and neuronal function by controlling lipid homeostasis, with the APOE2 allele having a superior function. The APOE2 has been found to be more prevalent among centenarians and associated with decreased susceptibility to AD. Studies on the role of the APOE2 in relation to AD suggest that APOE2 is neuroprotective and is positively associated with cognitive functions in aging. Therefore, increasing APOE2 level in the brain is an effective therapeutic strategy for AD. Although gene therapy possesses immense potential of treating various neurodegenerative diseases including AD, its clinical application is limited mainly due to lack of safe and effective vectors that can efficiently deliver the therapeutic gene across the blood brain barrier. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to design a gene delivery carrier for efficient delivery of pDNA encoding APOE2 to brain for prevention and treatment of AD.

One to the pathological features of this disease are neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that occur in the cytoplasm of neurons and are made up of an unfolded protein called tau. NFT occur initially in a region of the brained termed the entorhinal cortex, then “spread” to other limbic and association areas over more than a decade; this spread corresponds to the clinical symptoms of the disease and correlates with the destruction of neurons. Evidence suggests that this misfolded protein is transferred from neuron to neuron, and how this occurs is an important and central question that remains unanswered. Our studies have identified receptor molecules on the surface of neurons that are capable to binding tau and mediating its internalization into neurons. This grant will investigate detailed mechanisms of how these receptors guide this misfolded protein to the cytoplasm of the cell to trigger formation of more neurofibrillary tangles and thereby propagate formation of this disease.",6206686;2072820 (contact),"HYMAN, BRADLEY T.;STRICKLAND, DUDLEY K.

On top of this, many teenagers experience chronic sleep deprivation and misalignment of their circadian rhythms due to biological shifts in their sleep/wake preferences paired with early school start times. Many studies find that this increases the risk for substance use (SU). However, we don’t know what impact circadian rhythm and sleep disruption either together or independently have on the neuronal circuitry that controls reward and cognition, or if there are interventions that might help to prevent these changes. Our center will perform human and animal studies with the goal of understanding the important role of sleep and circadian rhythms in the vulnerability for SU in adolescents.

Thus, treatments that reduce both are hypothesized to block and potentially reverse pathogenesis and disease progression. Avanti Biosciences is pioneering the development of potent negative allosteric modulators of DYRK1A, a kinase that phosphorylates tau and whose activity is linked to p-tau mediated synaptic and neuronal dysfunction and death in AD. Furthermore, DYRK1A phosphorylates the APP and enhances its affinity for Beta-Secretase 1 (BACE1) and the γ-secretase complex, increasing overall Aβ levels and plaque deposition2. Thus, DYRK1A inhibitors are potentially helpful in treating both hallmarks of AD, neurofibrillary tangles, and amyloid plaques. In collaboration with NYS Institute for Basic Research, Avanti Biosciences has identified a new series of fluoro catechin derivatives that potently and efficiently inhibit the activity of DYRK1A both in vitro and in vivo.

We have established for the first time a unique platform system of non-integrative, temporally controlled, tunable gene therapeutic reprogramming of blood platelets (the cells responsible for clot formation) and their parent cells megakaryocytes, which we have found is naturally selective for the megakaryocyte / platelet lineage without affecting other cell types, and which we have demonstrated yields strong antithrombotic and antibleeding therapeutic benefit. In this proposal, we will use mouse models of thrombosis and bleeding, including models of acquired and inherited bleeding disorders, to select novel RNA drug formulations with the strongest therapeutic benefits with limited risk of deleterious side effects, and we will determine efficiencies of different administration routes, which together will firmly set the stage to advance preclinical development of these novel antiplatelet drugs.",6380084 (contact);6299937,"GOLDFINGER, LAWRENCE E (contact);STALKER, TIMOTHY J.","GILLASPY, ALLISON",2024-05-01,2026-04-30,Acceleration;Achievement;Acute;Address;Adjustment Disorders;ADP Receptors;Advanced Development;Affect;Affinity;Animal Model;Antiplatelet Drugs;Aspirin;Blood coagulation;Blood Coagulation Disorders;Blood Platelet Disorders;Blood Platelets;blood vessel occlusion;cell type;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Management;Clinical Trials;Coagulation Process;Data;Disease;Disease Management;Disease susceptibility;Dose;Drug Administration Routes;Drug Formulations;efficacy evaluation;Encapsulated;Fibrinolytic Agents;frontier;Gene Expression;Genes;Goals;Hematological Disease;Hemorrhage;Hemostatic Agents;Hemostatic function;Human;improved;in vivo;Inflammatory Response;Inherited;inhibitor;Intravenous;Ischemia;Lead;Life;Limb structure;Liposomes;Megakaryocytes;Messenger RNA;Minor;Modeling;Molecular Target;Morbidity - disease rate;mouse model;Mus;nanoparticle;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;Nucleotides;oligonucleotide therapeutics;Oligonucleotides;Parents;patient population;Patients;PAWR gene;Pharmaceutical Preparations;platelet function;precision medicine;preclinical development;prevent;programs;Property;receptor;Risk;Risk Management;RNA;Route;side effect;small molecule;Specificity;standard of care;Structure;subcutaneous;System;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;therapeutic development;therapeutic gene;therapeutic RNA;therapeutic target;therapy development;therapy outcome;Thrombin Receptor;Thrombosis;thrombotic;Time;Tissues;Transfection;Untranslated RNA;uptake;Vascular Diseases;vascular injury,RNA-based therapeutics for hemostasis and thrombosis,173910,ZHL1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZHL1 CSR-F (J1)],NA,NA,1,350000,196000,546000,NA

The inability of corticospinal neurons to re-generate is in stark contrast with their ability to generate precise circuitry during development, during which axonal growth cones, subcompartments at the ends of these exceptionally long growing axons, respond to their environment relatively independently and are thus responsible for axonal guidance, and establishment and maintenance of functional synapses and functional circuitry. Using novel approaches to study cellular subcompartments of these vastly “polarized” neurons, I will investigate cell body- and growth cone-localized RNA and protein molecular machinery and thus local mechanisms responsible for executing developmental and treatment-enabled regenerative growth of corticospinal neurons, toward future development of targeted therapies for people with disability from spinal cord injury.",14158176 (contact),"VICENT ALLENDE, MARIA ALEJANDRA (contact)","HENKEN, DEBORAH B",2023-09-01,2026-08-31,Adult;Animal Model;Axon;axon growth;axon guidance;Body Size;candidate identification;candidate selection;Cell Physiology;Cells;Central Nervous System;Cerebral cortex;Clinical;combinatorial;comparative;Cytoskeleton;Data;Development;disability;Disabled Persons;Disease;Elements;Environment;Exhibits;Future;gain of function;Genetic;genetic manipulation;Goals;gray matter;Growth;Growth Cones;Human;In Vitro;in vivo;injured;Injury;insight;Investigation;Label;Maintenance;Mediating;meter;Methodology;Modeling;Molecular;Motor output;Movement;Mus;Natural regeneration;Nerve Regeneration;nerve supply;neuron development;neuron regeneration;neuronal cell body;neuronal circuitry;neuronal growth;Neurons;novel strategies;Output;Parents;Persons;postnatal;postsynaptic;Process;programs;Proteins;Proteome;Proteomics;receptor;Recovery of Function;recruit;regenerative;Regenerative capacity;regenerative growth;Regulation;repaired;Research;RNA;Signal Transduction;Spinal Cord;Spinal cord injury;subcellular targeting;Synapses;synaptogenesis;System;targeted treatment;Therapeutic;Thoracic spinal cord structure;trafficking;Training;Transcript;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing;translational progress;Translations;Validation;Work,Subcellular investigation of molecular programs responsible for corticospinal neuron development and treatment-enhanced regeneration,113352,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-F03A-E(20)L],NA,NA,2,53974,0,53974,NA

However, the genetic background impacts considerably on the phenotype of a specific disease. These effects are due to genetic background and/or environmental influence on the disease driver, complicating diagnosis and proper treatment selection. Therefore, it is of utmost importance and relevance to investigate genetic background effects on disease development and progression. We now understand that genetic background effects are due to epistatic interactions that modulate disease driver function. However, common animal models are not suitable for studying this question because laboratory strains of these animals are mostly inbred and selected for laboratory use. Because they are closely related and at best represent different populations of just one species, they do not constitute high enough genetic diversity to allow identification of modulating epistasis. To circumvent this hurdle, we propose to implement various Xiphophorus fish species. These species present high inter-species phenotypical and genetic variation and harbor natural alleles that are disease associated. They offer the possibility of producing artificial inter-species hybrids, providing the unique possibility to investigate epistasis underlying diseases including cancer, metabolic disorders and aberrant disease related molecular traits. This suitability makes Xiphophorus the experimental model organism of choice to fill a knowledge gap in disease model research and to develop innovative research strategies. Xiphophorus is a genus of live-bearing freshwater fish that includes 26 species. The Xiphophorus Genetic Stock Center is a national resource center that hosts 61 pedigree lines that belong to 24 species.

This is particularly important since currently there is not a system which is available to individuals before their prosthesis is fabricated, and this is the very time period in which training is the most valuable.",10468837 (contact),"KALIKI, RAHUL REDDY (contact)","WU, GUANGYING",2021-01-15,2026-03-31,Amputation;Amputees;Businesses;Caring;Certification;Classification;Clinical;clinical care;Clinical Research;Computer software;Contracts;design;Development;Devices;Documentation;efficacy evaluation;Elbow;Electrodes;Electromagnetics;Elements;empowerment;experience;fabrication;flexibility;functional outcomes;functional restoration;Hand;improved;Individual;interest;Learning;limb loss;Limb structure;Lithium;Marketing;Measures;meetings;Methodology;Methods;Mission;Modeling;Motor;Muscle;Notification;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Patients;Pattern Recognition;Phase;Polymers;Process;prospective;Prosthesis;Radial;Rehabilitation therapy;Residual state;Safety;Signal Transduction;skills;Surface;System;Technology;Testing;Time;Training;Transference;Upper Extremity;Validation;verification and validation;virtual;visual feedback;wireless;Work;Wrist,Regulatory clearance of a rehabilitation system for individuals with upper limb loss,119842,ZNS1,ZNS1-SRB-C(07),NA,NA,4,741161,296464,1110259,NA

Our new method for clinical TB diagnosis should make it easier to determine whether TB drugs are working in patients; additionally, if they are not working well, new insight gleaned from this work may help us to better understand why.",1922998 (contact),"BERTOZZI, CAROLYN  (contact)","LACOURCIERE, KAREN A",2021-09-01,2026-08-31,active method;Adamantane;Address;Affinity;analog;Antibiotics;Antigens;Bacteria;Bacterial Infections;Biological;Biology;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Survival;Cells;Chemicals;Chronic lung disease;Clinical;Clinical Treatment;Collaborations;Combined Modality Therapy;Complex;cost;Detection;detection method;Development;Diagnostic Reagent;Drug Screening;Dyes;ebselen;Fluorescence;Frustration;Funding;Generations;Genetic;Glean;global health;Grant;Growth;high-throughput drug screening;HIV/TB;Hour;Image;In Vitro;Infection;inhibitor;insight;Instruction;Investigation;Knock-out;Label;Libraries;Lipids;magnetic beads;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Membrane;Metabolic;Methods;Microscope;Microscopy;model organism;Modeling;Molecular;mycobacterial;Mycobacterium Infections;Mycobacterium marinum;Mycobacterium tuberculosis;Natural Immunity;next generation;nile red;Participant;pathogen;Patients;Performance;performance tests;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacotherapy;point of care;point-of-care diagnostics;Population;Protocols documentation;Proxy;Reagent;Regimen;Resistance;Resource-limited setting;Role;Sampling;screening;South Africa;Sputum;Structure;supply chain;System;Time;Trehalose;Tuberculosis;Tuberculosis diagnosis;tuberculosis drugs;tuberculosis treatment;Virulence;Visualization;Work;Zebrafish,Chemical Mycobateriology,51622,NSS,NSS,NA,NA,23,313704,160363,474067,NA

The results from this study will provide a greater understanding of the effects of epinephrine on the brain in cardiac arrest as well as provide the data required to determine if clinical trials of this endovascular therapy are warranted in cardiac arrest victims.,12360010 (contact),"JOHNSON, MICHAEL AUSTIN (contact)","SOPKO, GEORGE",2022-09-01,2025-08-31,Algorithms;Animals;Aorta;Automation;Biological Markers;Blood flow;Blood Pressure;blood pressure control;Blood Vessels;Brain;Cardiac;Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation;Caring;Case Series;Catheters;Cell Death;Cerebral Ischemia;cerebral ischemic injury;Cerebrovascular system;Cerebrum;Circulation;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Coronary;coronary perfusion;Critical Care;Data;Descending aorta;Devices;Discipline of obstetrics;Distal;emergency settings;Epinephrine;Equipment;experimental study;Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation;femoral artery;Foundations;Future;Goals;health care settings;Heart;Heart Arrest;heart function;Heart Injuries;hemodynamics;Hemorrhage;Histologic;Histology;Hospitals;Hour;improved;improved outcome;innovation;interest;Intervention;ischemic injury;Laboratories;Lasers;magnetic resonance imaging biomarker;Measures;Methods;Modeling;Movement;myocardial injury;Nervous System Physiology;Neurologic;Neurological outcome;neuron loss;Neuronal Injury;novel therapeutics;Organ;organ injury;Output;Patients;Performance;Perfusion;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;pharmacologic;Physiology;Pilot Projects;porcine model;prevent;Public Health;rearrest;renal artery;Renal function;Research;research study;Resuscitation;Series;Shapes;Shock;standard of care;survival outcome;Technology;Testing;Tissues;Titrations;Transesophageal Echocardiography;Translational Research;translational study;Trauma;United States;Urine;vasoconstriction;Ventricular Fibrillation;Work,"Endovascular blood pressure targeting in cardiac arrest, a translational research study",163145,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-TDPS-R(01)],NA,NA,3,376283,158455,534738,NA

Even though local administration of drugs is becoming increasingly necessary to provide therapeutic efficacy, no research or tools exist on understanding the flow of fluid into tissue.
