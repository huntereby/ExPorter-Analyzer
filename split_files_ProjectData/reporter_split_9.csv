Our understanding of the root causes of complex cognitive impairments remains limited. Neuroplasticity is a fundamental brain process that underlies cognitive functioning making it a very attractive area for clinical investigation as it provides a basic mechanistic understanding (at the cellular and neural levels) of what causes cognitive dysfunction in TBI and SCZ.

We have found that alternative DNA structures serve as endogenous mutation hotspots in human cancer genomes, and that DNA structure-indcued genetic instability is altered with age in a tissue-specific fashion and by cytosine methylation; thus, we will explore the underlying mechanisms involved to inform on the development of various types of cancer. Results from the proposed study are expected to have a significant positive impact by delineating the relationship between tissue-specific DNA structure-induced genetic instability and epigenetic modification- related non-B DNA formation and instability as a function of age, which will guide the long-term goal of developing new strategies to prevent and/or treat age-associated diseases, such as cancer.",2089073 (contact),"VASQUEZ, KAREN M (contact)","OKANO, PAUL",2002-01-28,2028-01-31,Age;age effect;age related;age related changes;age-related disease;Aging;aging population;aging related;Brain;Cancer Etiology;cancer genome;cancer risk;cancer type;cell type;Chromatin;chromatin immunoprecipitation;Colon;Cytosine;Data;Development;DNA;DNA Damage;DNA Double Strand Break;DNA Repair;DNA Repair Gene;DNA Sequence;DNA Structure;Epigenetic Process;Etiology;Funding;Future;Generations;Genetic;Genetic Induction;Genome;Goals;H-DNA;Human;improved;Incidence;Individual;Induced Mutation;innovation;Kidney;Knowledge;Link;Liver;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammals;Measures;Methylation;Mismatch Repair;Modification;Mus;Mutagenesis;Mutation;novel;Nucleotide Excision Repair;old mice;Outcome;Pathologic Mutagenesis;prevent;Property;Proteins;Proteomics;Public Health;public health relevance;Publishing;repaired;Reporter;Research;Small Intestines;Spleen;Structure;Testing;Tissue Extracts;Tissues;Z-Form DNA,Repair of Genome Destabilizing DNA Structures,93729,CE,Cancer Etiology Study Section[CE],NA,NA,23,237500,132068,369568,NA

Current techniques to map epigenetic landscapes in different cell types are dependent on the ability to isolate these cell types at high purity using cell surface markers and high-quality antibodies that are frequently unavailable, or through the expression of cell type-specific fluorescent reporters in transgenic animal models that are extremely time intensive to generate. Therefore, in this proposal we plan to develop single-cell multiomics technologies to simultaneously quantify the transcriptome and different epigenetic marks/features from the same cell, thereby enabling unbiased cell type identification in silico using the transcriptome and quantification of gene regulatory landscapes by pooling together the epigenome of cells that correspond to the same cell type, resulting in an marker-free approach to map the epigenome of different cell types, including rare ones, within complex tissues.",15399359 (contact),"DEY, SIDDHARTH SUBHAS (contact)","PAZIN, MICHAEL J",2020-02-04,2025-01-31,Address;Aging;Animal Model;Antibodies;Bar Codes;Binding;Biochemical;Biological Assay;Cell Line;Cell Separation;Cell surface;cell type;Cells;Chromatin;Chromosome Mapping;combinatorial;Complex;Consumption;Data;Development;developmental disease;Disease;DNA;DNA Methylation;DNA-Protein Interaction;Epigenetic Process;epigenome;experimental study;Eye;Fluorescence;Frequencies;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Regulation;Generations;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Genome;Genome Mappings;genome-wide;Genomic DNA;Goals;high throughput technology;histone modification;Homeostasis;Human;improved;in silico;in vivo;Investigation;Knowledge;Malignant Neoplasms;Maps;Measurement;Messenger RNA;Methods;methylome;multiple omics;neural;new technology;Nuclear Lamina;Nucleic Acids;Organism;Pattern;Phenotype;physical separation;Play;Polycomb;Process;programs;Proteins;Rattus;Reporter;Retina;Sampling;Science;single cell sequencing;single cell technology;System;Techniques;Technology;Time;Tissue Sample;Tissues;transcription factor;transcriptome;transcriptomics;Transgenic Animals;Work,A marker-free technology for mapping the epigenome of cell types in mammalian tissues,11013,GCAT,"Genomics, Computational Biology and Technology Study Section[GCAT]",NA,NA,5,225000,109872,334872,NA

In recent years, targeted EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies have been successful in treating lung cancers, but unfortunately the effectiveness of these and other targeted drugs tends to be limited in time, with the almost inevitable appearance of resistant tumors and the resulting dismal 5-year survival rate, with over 130,000 deaths per year.  We propose to develop an alternative approach to suppress EGFR signaling in treatment-refractory lung cancer, which would also be applicable to any other cancer dependent on EGFR signaling. This strategy is based on the rational design of antisense drugs that re-program EGFR gene expression to replace the oncogenic EGFR isoforms with potent inhibitory, naturally existing soluble decoy EGFR variants, both when the EGFR pathway is driven by EGFR-activating mutations, or by wild-type EGFR overexpression.",8248999 (contact),"CARTEGNI, LUCA  (contact)","FORRY, SUZANNE L",2018-12-01,2025-11-30,Affect;Alternative Splicing;Antibodies;Antisense Oligonucleotide Therapy;Antisense Oligonucleotides;Appearance;autocrine;Automobile Driving;Biodistribution;Biological;Biological Models;Bypass;Cancer Etiology;Cancer Model;Cell Line;Cells;Cessation of life;Chemistry;Clinical Trials;Colorectal Cancer;Data;Dendrimers;design;Development;Dimerization;Disease Resistance;Dominant-Negative Mutation;drug development;Drug Kinetics;Drug resistance;Drug Targeting;Effectiveness;EGF gene;EGFR gene;EGFR inhibition;Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor;Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor;epidermal growth factor receptor VIII;ERBB2 gene;Excision;experimental study;extracellular;Future;Gene Expression;Generations;Glioblastoma;Heterodimerization;Human;In Vitro;in vivo;inhibitor;inhibitor therapy;Introns;Investigation;knock-down;Lead;Length;Ligand Binding;Ligand Binding Domain;Ligands;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Malignant Neoplasms;Methodology;Methods;Modeling;mouse model;mutant;Mutate;Mutation;mutational status;nanoparticle delivery;Neoplasm Metastasis;Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma;Normal tissue morphology;novel;novel drug class;Oncogenic;overexpression;paracrine;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Peptides;Pharmaceutical Preparations;pharmacologic;Phosphotransferases;Play;Polyadenylation;Positioning Attribute;Preparation;programs;Property;Protein Isoforms;protein purification;rational design;receptor;Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases;Recombinant Proteins;Refractory;Relapse;Residual state;Resistance;resistance mechanism;RNA;RNA Splicing;Role;Safety;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Specificity;STAT3 gene;success;Survival Rate;System;targeted cancer therapy;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;tool;Toxic effect;Transcript;Transmembrane Domain;Treatment Protocols;treatment response;tumor;tumorigenesis;Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor;Variant;Xenograft procedure,Targeting Refractory EGFR-Driven Tumors By Induction Of Dominant-Negative EGFR Splicing Variants,233897,BMCT,Basic Mechanisms  of Cancer Therapeutics Study Section[BMCT],NA,NA,6,241728,101616,343344,NA

Early endosomes act as a literal “fork in the road” for receptors, as both the endocytic recycling and lysosomal pathways are initiated from this dynamic organelle. Early endosomes play a crucial role in the transport of metabolic nutrients, such as iron, as well as in receptor signaling via epithelial growth factor receptor. Significantly, cancer cells exhibit an enhanced dependence on iron for growth and are more susceptible to iron depletion than their normal counterparts. Since cancer cell 3D growth was shown to alter organelle morphology and better mimic in vivo tumor characteristics, the analysis of the morphology and function of organelles and inter-organelle interactions in 3D tumor systems is the new frontier of cancer cell biology. Thus, breast cancer cells grown as 3D tumor systems in vitro will be used to elucidate the complex relationship between signaling and iron metabolism that takes place in the early endosomes, and cancer progression.",1973884 (contact),"BARROSO, MARGARIDA  (contact)","SALNIKOW, KONSTANTIN",2020-02-01,2026-01-31,3-Dimensional;Address;Affect;Biochemical;Biological;Breast Cancer Cell;breast cancer progression;Bypass;cancer cell;Cancer cell line;cancer diagnosis;cancer therapy;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell membrane;Cell Physiology;Cell Proliferation;Cells;Cellular biology;Characteristics;comparative;Complex;Cytosol;Dependence;Development;Early Endosome;EGF gene;Endosomes;Epithelium;Exhibits;Foundations;Freezing;frontier;Growth;Growth Factor Receptors;Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases;Homeostasis;Human;In Vitro;in vivo;Iron;iron metabolism;Malignant Breast Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammary Neoplasms;MCF10A cells;Mediating;Metabolic;Microscopy;migration;Mitochondria;mitochondrial membrane;Molecular;Morphology;Nature;new therapeutic target;novel;Nutrient;Organelles;overexpression;Oxygen;Pathway interactions;Phosphotransferases;Play;Population;Predisposition;Process;Property;receptor;Receptor Activation;Receptor Signaling;receptor-mediated signaling;Recycling;Regulation;Research Proposals;Role;sensor;Shapes;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Site;System;Testing;TFRC gene;Three-Dimensional Imaging;Tissues;tool;trafficking;tumor;Tumor Biology;tumor progression;Tumor Tissue;Work,Endosome-mitochondria interactions in breast cancer cells,233188,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-CB-H(55)R],NA,NA,5,384074,146435,530509,NA

Understanding the mechanisms involved in mtp53 engaging more PARP and MCM proteins on chromatin during DNA damage, and testing for detection of mtp53 and PARP in TNBC, offer opportunities to expand TNBC knowledge. Completing this work will provide mechanistic insights on how mtp53 cross-talks with PARP and MCM proteins on chromatin in cell culture, xenograft models, and patient tissue.

Several tumor suppressor proteins are now known to participate in homologous recombination, and defects in these proteins are broadly associated with human cancers. Included among these are BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are key proteins involved in the early stages of homologous recombination, and are frequently mutated in hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. To help extend our understanding of how BRCA1 and BRCA2 participate in homologous recombination we have developed a powerful new experimental platform based on state-of-the-art optical microscopy that enables us to directly observe the proteins that participate in homologous recombination in real time.
