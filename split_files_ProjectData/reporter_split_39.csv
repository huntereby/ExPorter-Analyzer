The proposed research is relevant to public health because it defines the selectivity and activity determinants of bacterial sortases, a therapeutic target for antibiotic development against Gram-positive bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus) and a widely utilized tool in protein engineering. Within these applications, the majority of sortase-mediated ligation efforts utilize a single, highly specific sortase enzyme (from S. aureus), whereas observations for the broader protein family suggest a spectrum of target specificity. A greater understanding of the mechanistic basis of bacterial sortase selectivity and activity can dramatically expand next-generation protein engineering efforts; therefore, the proposed research is directly in line with the mission of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences to “support basic research that… lays the foundation for advances in disease treatment.”",10574711 (contact);12305490;15384699,"AMACHER, JEANINE FAYE (contact);ANTOS, JOHN M;MCCARTY, JAMES JOSEPH","SIMONOVIC, MILJAN",2024-05-01,2027-04-30,2019-nCoV;abeta accumulation;Affect;Affinity;Africa South of the Sahara;Amines;antibiotic design;Antibiotic Resistance;Antibiotics;Antimicrobial Resistance;arm;Bacillus anthracis;Bacteria;Basic Science;Binding;Binding Proteins;Biochemical;Biological Assay;Biology;Biotin;C-terminal;Catalysis;Cell surface;Cell Wall;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Chemicals;Chimera organism;Computational Biology;COVID-19 vaccine;Cysteine;Development;Diagnostic tests;Dimerization;Disease;Drug resistance;Engineering;Enzymes;Event;flexibility;Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer;Foundations;Gram-Positive Bacteria;Hand;Health;high throughput screening;Human;improved;In Vitro;innovation;Knowledge;Length;Ligation;Lipids;Listeria;Listeria monocytogenes;Maps;Measures;Mediating;methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus;Methodology;Methods;Mission;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Conformation;molecular dynamics;Mutation;nanobodies;nanodisk;National Institute of General Medical Sciences;Nerve Degeneration;next generation;pathogen;pathogenic bacteria;Peptide Synthesis;Peptides;Peptidoglycan;Peptidyltransferase;Phase;Play;Positioning Attribute;preference;Productivity;Protein Biochemistry;Protein Dynamics;Protein Engineering;Protein Family;protein purification;Proteins;Public Health;Reaction;reaction rate;Reporting;Research;Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae;Role;Series;sortase;Specificity;Staphylococcus aureus;Streptavidin;Streptococcus;Streptococcus pyogenes;structural biology;Substrate Interaction;System;Techniques;Testing;therapeutic target;tool;transacylation;Transmembrane Domain;vaccine evaluation;Variant;Work,Improved Understanding of Bacterial Sortase Activity Towards Next-Generation Protein Engineering,154315,MSFB,Macromolecular Structure and Function B Study Section[MSFB],NA,NA,1,300000,82912,382912,NA

The majority became addicted after being prescribed opioids for pain. The crisis is especially acute for veterans. Up to 25% of patients at VA outpatient clinics have received opioids for pain, and an estimated 8-12% have gone on to develop opioid use disorder. These statistics highlight a crisis that was created by a perfect storm of ill-advised pain treatment practices, healthcare expectations, and rampant availability of cheap high potency illicit opioids. To address the crisis, improved healthcare practices, better pain medications, and better addiction therapies are needed. Improved knowledge of the mechanisms underlying opioid addiction, craving, and relapse could help predict who may be at risk, and guide new therapeutic strategies for addiction that do not rely on alternative opioid medications. This proposal highlights a pathway that may contribute to addiction vulnerability, and could lead to new therapies that repurpose non-opioid medications already available for human use.",1897303 (contact),"WEMMIE, JOHN A (contact)",NA,2019-10-01,2027-09-30,Accidents;Acids;Acute;addiction;Address;Affect;Ambulatory Care Facilities;American;AMPA Receptors;Analgesics;ASIC channel;Behavior;Behavioral;Behavioral Paradigm;Brain;Buffers;carbonate dehydratase;Carbonic Anhydrase IV;Cations;Chronic;Cocaine;cocaine self-administration;conditioned place preference;craving;Data;Dendritic Spines;density;drug of abuse;Enzymes;expectation;experimental study;extracellular;Functional disorder;Glutamate Receptor;Glutamates;Goals;Healthcare;Human;illicit opioid;improved;inhibitor;innovation;Knowledge;Measures;Mediating;Molecular;Molecular Target;Morphine;Morphology;mu opioid receptors;Mus;N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors;Neurobiology;Neurons;Neurotransmitters;non-opioid analgesic;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;novel therapeutics;Nucleus Accumbens;Opiate Addiction;Opioid;opioid epidemic;opioid overdose;opioid use disorder;overdose death;overexpression;Pain;Pain management;Pathway interactions;Patients;Permeability;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacotherapy;Physiology;Pilot Projects;Play;postsynaptic;prescription opioid;presynaptic;prevent;Protons;Rattus;receptor function;Regulatory Pathway;reinforced behavior;Relapse;response;Risk;Role;Self Administration;Signal Transduction;statistics;Structure;Synapses;Synaptic Cleft;Synaptic plasticity;Synaptic Transmission;Testing;United States;Vesicle;Veterans;Wild Type Mouse;Withdrawal,Investigating a novel regulatory pathway for opioid-induced synaptic plasticity and behavior,4440,ZRD1,ZRD1-NURA-C(01),NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA

BD is associated with disruptions in daily (circadian) rhythms in sleep and activity. Lithium is an inexpensive, effective treatment for BD that protects neurons, and restores circadian rhythms. However, 30-50% of patients with BD fail respond adequately to lithium treatment. Lithium non-responsive patients often experience delays in receiving effective treatment and may require more expensive drugs.

Very frequently, Veterans with mTBI also have comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and/or addiction. While an estimated 400,000 Veterans have a history of blast mTBI, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, and treatment options have limited benefits. To fill these gaps, we propose to study a chemical messenger system (the dynorphin/kappa opioid receptor system) that plays a critical role in trauma-induced behavioral problems. We will test two different drugs to inhibit this system, one long-lasting and one short-lasting.

While more than 20 million U.S. adults suffer from CKD, the rates are higher among Veterans. Moreover, Veterans with CKD also have much higher rates of other diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Some forms of injury to the kidney can be temporary, referred to as acute kidney injury (AKI). However, recent research suggests that even AKI can cause CKD by itself. When AKI occurs in the setting of CKD, it can worsen CKD to complete kidney failure as has been shown in several studies in the Veteran population. CKD itself can impede the recovery from AKI.

The factors that promote cyst generation and progression remain unknown. In this application, we report a novel mechanism for cyst formation and expansion which indicates that TSC cysts are driven by the creation of an imbalance in the population of cells lining the cyst. In this model, genotypically normal intercalated cells become the dominant cell type and the targeted principal cells gradually disappear.

By analyzing ALS mouse models and a large number of tissue samples from FALS and SALS patients, we show that misfolded proteins activate a highly conserved protein kinase, called HIPK2, which serves as a molecular switch to promote neuronal cell death, leading to hypothesize that HIPK2 is a feasible therapeutic target for ALS.

Our initial goals are to confirm our findings that cannabidiol suppresses tremor in the harmaline mouse model of essential tremor, and that a specific enzyme inhibitor that raises the brain level of a natural endocannabinoid also suppresses tremor. Our pilot data indicate that these agents work by activating a specific serotonin receptor subtype. We will seek to confirm out pilot findings that drugs that selectively activate these serotonin receptors suppress tremor and, also study how well they are tolerated and whether their effectiveness wears off.

We will argue and present new findings that the development of SNH and the events leading to protection against NEC are regulated through similar mechanisms, leading us to suggest that the onset of SNH, which displays potent antioxidant properties, is not a random event in preterm newborns but may have evolved as a protective event to combat inflammatory diseases. Using novel animal models that express the human UGT1 locus and the UGT1A1 gene and develop SNH during the neonatal period, experiments are outlined to examine the interrelationships in the mechanisms that control the onset of SNH and NEC with the intention of exploiting these findings to identify potential therapeutic targets to treat NEC.",1861157 (contact),"TUKEY, ROBERT H (contact)","LOH, KATRINA SHUEH WEN",2023-07-01,2028-04-30,Acceleration;Acids;Acute;Affect;Age;Animal Model;Antioxidants;Area;Ataxia;Athetosis;Bilirubin;Biological;Biological Markers;Birth;Breast Feeding;Catabolism;Cell Lineage;Cell Maturation;Central Nervous System;Cerebral Palsy;Cessation of life;Clinical;combat;constitutive expression;Data;Defect;Development;Developmental Delay Disorders;Disease;Dystonia;effective therapy;Enteral;Event;experimental study;Fatality rate;feeding;Food;Gene Expression;Genes;Genetic;genetic corepressor;Genetic Transcription;Goals;gut inflammation;gut microbiota;hearing impairment;Heme;Human;Human Milk;Hyperbilirubinemia;improved;Individual;Inflammatory;Intention;intestinal barrier;intestinal epithelium;Intestines;Kernicterus;Knock-out;Knockout Mice;Laboratories;Link;Lipopolysaccharides;Liver;mammary;Metabolism;microbiota;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;mouse model;Movement Disorders;Mucous body substance;Mus;Muscle hypotonia;NCOR1 gene;Necrotizing Enterocolitis;Neonatal;Neonatal Jaundice;neonatal mice;Neonatal Mortality;neonatal period;neonate;Newborn Infant;novel;Nuclear Receptors;nursing mothers;Nutrient;oculomotor;Oligosaccharides;Oxidative Stress Induction;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Play;premature;preterm newborn;Process;Production;Property;Proteins;Publications;receptor;Regulation;Repression;reproductive;Research;Risk;Role;Serum;Signal Transduction;Source;Symptoms;Syndrome;Technology;Term Birth;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;therapeutic target;therapeutically effective;Tissues;TLR4 gene;Toxic effect;Transferase;UDP-Glucuronosyltransferase 1A1;UGT1A1 gene;Work,Severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (SNH) and the expression of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) play key roles in the development of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC),136599,DBDT,Drug and Biologic Disposition and Toxicity Study Section[DBDT],NA,NA,2,388861,225539,614400,NA

The actions of poorly informed and supported caregivers negatively affect persons living with ADRD and caregivers themselves. The challenges of ADRD caregiving may be alleviated with tailored services and supports. However, evidence-based models have typically been developed outside real-world care settings; few explicitly engage family at the point of care or are poised for widespread diffusion. The spread of consumer health information technology affords new opportunities to support ADRD caregivers within health care delivery. The patient portal allows patients to view test results and sections of their electronic medical record, perform health management tasks (e.g. scheduling visits, paying bills, filling prescriptions), access educational materials, and communicate with clinicians using secure messaging. Many care delivery organizations allow patients to share access to their patient portal account by registering a “care partner” to have their own identity credentials (login/password). Through shared access, patients may select whether and who electronically interacts with clinicians on their behalf, thus, respecting patient preferences while supporting care partners with timely information about patient health and treatments, and a mechanism to electronically navigate health system demands. Emerging evidence suggests that engaging care partners through shared access to the patient portal improves patient and family communication and confidence in their ability to manage care. Shared access may be particularly relevant in ADRD care due to the long and progressive course of the disease and heavy reliance on caregivers. Little is now known about electronic information sharing preferences and practices of persons with ADRD and their caregivers, or the feasibility of deploying novel interventions through consumer health information technologies to better support ADRD care and management.

The study employs a model protein and polymer system as surrogates for proteins and nucleic acids, both are common precursors for biomolecular condensates. By examining the effects of a wide range of crowding agents commonly used to simulate the crowded environment within living cells, this study aims at elucidating the effects of crowding on the conformation and intermolecular interactions of protein and polymer molecules, and to establish connections between the molecular-level information and the bulk phase behavior of proteins. Collectively, our research will provide a comprehensive, molecular-level understanding of protein phase behavior in cell-like environments, thereby advancing the fields of biophysics and cellular biology, and opening new avenues for therapeutic development in diseases related to abnormal protein phase separation.",78383950 (contact),"XU, AMY  (contact)","CHO, THOMAS Y",2024-09-20,2027-08-31,Address;Affect;age-related disease;Antibodies;Behavior;Biological Process;biological research;biomacromolecule;biophysical properties;Biophysics;cell age;Cell Physiology;Cell Volumes;Cells;Cellular biology;chemical property;Complex;Crowding;Crows;Disease;Disease Progression;Disparity;Environment;Excipients;Formulation;Goals;Individual;intermolecular interaction;Investigation;Link;Liquid substance;Measures;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Conformation;Nature;Neutrons;novel;Nucleic Acids;Phase;Phase Transition;Physical condensation;physical property;Play;Polymers;Process;Property;protein function;protein protein interaction;Proteins;Research;Research Personnel;Roentgen Rays;Role;Sampling;Series;Sucrose;System;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;therapeutic development,Phase behavior of proteins in crowded environments,154243,MSFB,Macromolecular Structure and Function B Study Section[MSFB],NA,NA,1,300000,141108,441108,NA

Current estimates suggest that chronic pain impacts nearly half of Veterans, and studies have shown that people who experience chronic pain are at increased risk for a number of adverse health outcomes, including suicide and opioid overdose. Although multiple national initiatives within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have attempted to decrease the number of veterans with opioid prescriptions for pain management, these efforts focus on analyzing VA data only. Given that many Veterans receive care and treatment from non-VA community clinics and medical centers, it is imperative to study suicide or accidental overdose risk amongst Veterans with pain disorders by analyzing both VA and non-VA data. The overall objective of this proposal is to integrate large-scale VA and non-VA data across New York, Chicago and Florida to study the risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide and accidental opioid overdose deaths in Veterans receiving chronic opioid therapy (COT).",1881639;9622830 (contact),"OSLIN, DAVID W.;PATHAK, JYOTISHMAN  (contact)","FREED, MICHAEL",2020-08-10,2025-05-31,Accidents;Address;Age;alcohol misuse;Algorithms;Area;care fragmentation;Caring;Cessation of life;Chicago;Chronic;chronic pain;chronic pain patient;Clinical;Clinical Data;cohort;Communities;community clinic;Data;data integration;data modeling;Data Reporting;Data Set;data warehouse;deep learning model;deep neural network;demographics;deprivation;design;detection method;Electronic Health Record;electronic structure;experience;Feeling suicidal;Firearms;Florida;Funding;General Population;Health;Health behavior;Health Services Administration;Health system;Healthcare;Homelessness;indexing;Individual;innovation;Learning;Link;machine learning algorithm;machine learning method;machine learning prediction;Medical;Medical center;medical specialties;Medicare claim;Mental disorders;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality;mortality risk;Natural Language Processing;New York;New York City;novel;Opioid;opioid misuse;opioid mortality;opioid overdose;opioid therapy;opioid use;Outcome;overdose death;overdose risk;Pain Disorder;Pain management;Patients;Pattern;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;Predictive Analytics;prescription opioid;primary outcome;Provider;provider factors;Public Health;public health emergency;Research;Risk;risk mitigation;risk prediction;risk prediction model;secondary outcome;Site;social health determinants;sociodemographics;Source;Standardization;Structure;suicidal risk;Suicide;Suicide attempt;suicide rate;Text;Time;Veterans;Veterans Health Administration,Linking VA and non-VA data to study the risk of suicide in chronic pain patients.,121907,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-HDM-E(90)],NA,NA,5,539294,129857,669151,NA

However, little is known about the spatio-temporal characteristics of neural progneitors migrating from the subventricular zone to the bioscaffold. A major limitation to map and understand the contribution of neurogenesis to brain tissue regeneration is the lack of in vivo imaging tools that can be utilized to visualize this process. We here described a novel method in which we inject gadolinium- gold nanoparticles into the lateral ventricle to tag newly born neural progenitors and track their migration using T1-weighted MRI. The positive signal emanating from these cells can unequivocally be attributed to labeled cells and allow us to increase spatial resolution to resolve a very detailed brain anatomy, specifically the tissue-bioscaffold interface.

However, cancer causing mutations can bypass this arrest in cell division and re-initiate cellular division. These cells must also re-activate a mechanism that ensures that telomeres once again maintain the structural integrity of chromosomes but are no longer capable of blocking cell division. This is achieved by activating one of two different telomere maintenance mechanisms. One of these mechanisms is known as alternative lengthening of telomeres, or simply ALT. Cancers that rely on ALT tend to be among the most aggressive and patients often have a poor prognosis. Therefore, understanding the molecular basis for the activation and maintenance of the ALT pathway and identifying the key regulators of ALT is critically important for improving the detection and treatment of this devastating disease.",12451195 (contact),"O'SULLIVAN, RODERICK  (contact)","WITKIN, KEREN L",2016-07-01,2027-06-30,Address;Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose;ADP ribosylation;Affect;ATRX gene;Biochemical;Biological Assay;Bypass;cancer cell;Cancer Etiology;cancer prevention;cancer therapy;Cancerous;Cell division;Cell Survival;Cells;cellular targeting;Chromatin;Chromatin Modeling;chromatin modification;chromatin remodeling;Chromatin Remodeling Factor;Chromosomes;Complex;DAXX gene;defined contribution;Deposition;Detection;Disease;Dissection;DNA;DNA biosynthesis;DNA Damage;DNA Double Strand Break;DNA Repair;DNA Sequence Alteration;Ensure;Enzymes;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Genome;Glycoside Hydrolases;Goals;Histone H3.3;histone modification;Histones;Homeostasis;Impairment;improved;Individual;innovation;Knowledge;Length;Licensing;Maintenance;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Mediator;Metabolism;Molecular;Molecular Chaperones;mutant;Mutate;Mutation;novel strategies;Nucleosomes;Optics;Pathway interactions;Patients;Phase;Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose;poly ADPR glycohydrolase inhib;preservation;Process;Prognosis;Proteomics;public health relevance;recruit;Recurrence;Regulation;Repair Complex;repaired;Repression;Research;response;Role;sensor;Serine;Stress;Structure;synergism;targeted cancer therapy;telomere;Telomere Maintenance;Telomere Pathway;therapeutic target;therapy development;Untranslated RNA,Inhibition of the ALT pathway by interfering with Poly-ADP-Ribose metabolism,207209,CG,Cancer Genetics Study Section[CG],NA,NA,8,227092,122660,349752,NA
