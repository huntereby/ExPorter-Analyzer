This career development award details a 5-year training plan to facilitate the transition of Dr. Barbara H.
Chaiyachati to an independent career as a physician-scientist studying predictors of mental and physical health
of children after trauma with an objective to identify actionable targets of intervention. Experiences of child
abuse and neglect place hundreds of thousands of children at risk for negative health outcomes every year in
the U.S. Better understanding of proximate mental and physical health predictors after childhood traumatic
stressful events (TSE), including predictive role of genetic susceptibility integrated with early biologic
embedding by epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) and increased inflammation, may facilitate targeted
interventions to ameliorate the spectrum of long-term health burdens. Thus, multimodal phenomic and genomic
approaches are needed to elucidate the complex connections between maltreatment and health. The proposed
project builds on the diverse clinical and research experiences of the candidate, with mentorship led by Dr.
Raquel Gur, the Karl and Linda Rickels Professor of Psychiatry, Neurology and Radiology at the University of
Pennsylvania and an expert in neurodevelopmental trajectories, and Dr. Hakon Hakonarson, Professor of
Pediatrics at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and an expert in translational genomics. A team of
collaborators adds expertise in developmental psychology, basic and clinical immunology, psychiatric genetics,
and behavioral epigenomics, with grounding in child abuse clinical care. The research leverages large,
ancestry-diverse, adversity-exposed cohorts within established biorepositories to identify measurable,
biologically-relevant health predictors after adversity in childhood. Dr. Chaiyachati will conduct phenomic
(physical, mental health, systemic inflammation by cytokines) and genomic (whole genome and methylome)
assessments. Specifically, Aim 1 is to determine the impact of TSEs and genetic stress sensitivity, as marked
by genetic risk for PTSD, on mental and physical health in adolescence; Aim 2 will assess the impact of TSE
on epigenetic aging per DNA methylation clocks; and Aim 3 will test for increased inflammation after
experiences of maltreatment. Completion of the proposed studies will improve our understanding of mental and
physical health trajectories after experiences of trauma. This proposal will also provide the candidate with
experience studying phenomic and genomic data, writing grants and scientific papers, and allow her to gain
skills requisite for supervision and leadership. Furthermore, this proposal will establish Dr. Chaiyachati’s
intersectional research agenda and position her for independence as a physician-scientist."

There is a tremendous unmet need for effective synthesis methodologies and strategies for the construction of
aleutianamine and other members of the discorhabdin class of natural products. This has significantly hindered
the mechanistic, basic and applied science studies for this unique class of alkaloids which offers significant value
in the control of a variety of diseases and clearly warrants additional basic research into the synthesis,
mechanism of action and basic pharmacology. Natural Products (NPs) have played a key role as therapeutics
for a variety of diseases and the data presented in this application reveals the tremendous potential for these
molecules. After 25 years of studying marine organisms for new and innovative chemistry we have identified a
single truly remarkable molecule called aleutianamine. Aleutianamine has been recovered from a Latrunculia
sponge collected from the deep ocean off the coast of the Aleutian Islands by NOAA Alaska. We have
exhaustively interrogated extracts for any detectable quantities of this molecule and the only remaining option to
generate mechanistic and in vivo data is to first generate the drug through a reliable synthesis. This molecule is
extremely unique chemically and is a member of two very rare groups of bioactive natural products including the
iminoquinones and the thioalkaloids and is certain to be a product of the extreme conditions of these deep ocean
environments where cold temperatures, high pressure, and anoxic conditions deplete of UV irradiation provides
a unique environment for biosynthesis and rearrangement to form highly unusual molecules. Aleutianamine and
other members of this class as well as their synthetic intermediates offer unique controls for a diversity of
diseases including malaria, inflammation, viral diseases and cancer strongly supporting the development of
strategies to provide consistent supply of the drug and approaches to the generation and diversification of the
class. Due to the rare and limited supply of this molecule the specific aims of this program involve the
development of synthesis methodologies using two different routes in addition to the isolation and
characterization of starting materials and related molecules for SAR and investigations into alternative
approaches involving biosynthetic starting materials for the construction and optimization of the molecule."

Life-threatening traumatic exposures requiring presentation to acute care medical settings are endemic in the
US in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, firearm proliferation, and extreme weather events, and constitute
both a substantial source of individual suffering and a significant public health burden. Each year in the US,
over 30 million individuals present to acute care medical settings after injury, and approximately 2.5 million
individuals are so severely injured that they require inpatient hospital admissions. The overarching goal of the
Trauma Survivors Outcomes and Support (TSOS) R01 investigation is to advance the sustainable delivery of
high quality trauma center mental health screening, intervention and referral procedures for diverse injury
survivors. Over the past two decades, the TSOS study team that includes research scientists, trauma surgical
policymakers, patients, and frontline clinicians has established a track record of using evidence derived from
NIH pragmatic trials to directly target American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (College)
regulatory policy. The TSOS R01 investigation will refine and test optimal stepped care intervention strategies
for diverse injury survivors presenting to acute care medical settings with PTSD and associated comorbidity.
This single trauma center site pragmatic trial investigation will individually randomize 424 patients (212
intervention and 212 control) to a brief stepped care intervention versus College required screening and
referral control conditions. The stepped care intervention consists of proactive care management, as well as
medications and psychotherapy elements targeting PTSD and comorbidity. Blinded follow-up interviews at 3-,
6-, and 12-months post-injury will assess the symptoms of PTSD and related comorbidity for all patients. The
emergency department health information exchange will be used to capture population-level automated
emergency department/inpatient utilization data for the intent-to-treat sample. The R01 aims to test the primary
hypotheses that intervention patients will demonstrate significant reductions in PTSD symptoms and
emergency department/inpatient utilization when compared to control patients. The investigation will also
explore mediators and moderators of intervention treatment effects that directly address actionable national
trauma center quality improvements. A mixed method Rapid Assessment Procedure-Informed Clinical
Ethnography implementation process assessment will facilitate the integration of study results into national
College policy requirements, guidelines, and verification criteria. A national trauma center survey will elucidate
the progression of PTSD and comorbidity screening, intervention and referral for all US level I and II trauma
centers. An end-of-study College policy summit will harness pragmatic trial data to inform the capacity for US
trauma centers to implement high quality acute care medical mental health services for diverse patient
populations."
10872127,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Dysfunction of glutamatergic synapses in inhibitory interneurons (INs) is increasingly being linked to psychiatric
diseases and neurological disorders. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms distinguishing
glutamatergic synapse function in INs from those in excitatory neurons is hindered by a lack of insight into their
molecular composition. The applicant's long-term goal is to develop an independent research career focusing
on the molecular basis of glutamatergic synapse function in INs. The overall objective of this proposal is to
identify IN-specific excitatory synaptic proteins (IN-ExSPs), and assess how these proteins regulate
glutamatergic synapse function in INs. This proposal is aligned with the central hypothesis that unique protein
specializations support the function of glutamatergic synapses in INs, at least in part, through the process of
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), a phenomenon that it ubiquitous across biology and has been recently
linked to glutamatergic synapse function. The project's rationale is to establish a molecular framework for
understanding how IN glutamatergic synapses impact health and disease. The central hypothesis will be tested
by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Identify glutamatergic synaptic proteins specific to or enriched in interneurons;
and 2) Evaluate the contribution of IN-ExSPs to glutamatergic synapse function in interneurons. Under the first
aim, cell-type-specific immunoisolation and mass spectrometry will be used to identify novel IN-ExSPs. For the
second aim, IN-ExSPs will be screened for LLPS-properties, and the effect of their overexpression or knockout
on IN glutamatergic synapse function, and behaviour, will be assessed. The proposed research is innovative, in
the applicant's opinion, firstly because it introduces a cell-type-specific dimension to the molecular-investigation
of glutamatergic synapses; and secondly, because it assesses how IN-ExSPs that undergo LLPS influence
glutamatergic synapse function in INs, which largely lack dendritic spines and therefore have a unique problem
to overcome in terms of biochemical compartmentalization and synapse stability. The proposed research is
significant because it will yield new insights into the molecular mechanisms supporting the function of
glutamatergic synapses in INs, an area in which very little is currently known. This could uncover innovative
strategies to selectively increase the function of glutamatergic synapses in INs, providing more precise
therapeutic interventions to tackle psychiatric diseases and neurological disorders. The applicant has assembled
an expert mentoring team to provide the technical training and career development guidance required to obtain
a tenure track academic position. In particular, the applicant will receive training in electrophysiology and analysis
of quantitative mass spectrometry data, and will further develop skills in molecular, biochemical, and advanced
imaging techniques."
10871546,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The identification of hundreds of genes associated with autism and related neurodevelopmental diseases
(ASD/NDDs) in recent years has created and opportunity to leverage genetic discoveries into therapeutics for these
disorders. Classically ASD/NDDs were assumed to be intractable due to disrupted development in utero, but
studies in mice have demonstrated that restoring gene activity after birth can likely ameliorate phenotypes in
some prominent ASD/NDDs. These findings create an imperative to systematically test the feasibility of
genetically targeted therapies across ASD/NDDs with distinct genetic causes, but limited studies of this type
have been carried out to date. A major class of disorders that has yet to be investigated in this paradigm is
ASD/NDD caused by mutation of “epigenetic writer” enzymes. These enzymes chemically modify chromatin and
DNA to control gene expression during development and throughout life. While the important potential role of
these genes in early cell fate and patterning has suggested it will be it difficult to correct defects after altered
development, recent studies have uncovered postnatal functions for these factors that are likely to be drivers of
phenotypes in ASD/NDD. Therefore, in the proposed studies we will develop enabling mouse transgenic
reagents to investigate the tractability of genetic rescue of ASD/NDDs caused by mutation of epigenetic writers.
Our previous studies that have uncovered postnatal functions for the ASD/NDD-associated writer DNA
methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) and defined robust phenotypes in heterozygous mutant mice the mimic human
DNMT3A ASD/NDD mutations. We will therefore investigate the tractability of genetic reinstatement of the
DNMT3A gene for rescue of molecular and organismal deficits in mice. We will implement a newly-established
DNMT3A conditional genetic rescue strain to test the requirements for timing of DNMT3A reinstatement
necessary to rescue molecular deficits in vivo (Aim 1). We will then perform proof-of-principle studies to
investigate the degree to which behavioral and physiological function can be rescued by gene reactivation (Aim
2). Together these studies will establish enabling technologies and essential proof-of-principle findings to guide
future large-scale development gene targeted therapeutics in DNMT3A disorders. Furthermore, by assessing
the tractability of reinstatement for epigenetic writers in ASD/NDD, our studies can motivate therapeutic research
efforts across a broad class of genetic causes for these disorders, advancing toward treatments for these
devastating conditions."
10870915,"Summary/Abstract
High blood pressure is considered a risk factor for dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD)
progression. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a hormonal and neuropeptide system that
regulates blood pressure and is implicated in cardiovascular-neurodegenerative diseases, and
as a potential target for dementia and AD treatment. While the function of the circulatory RAS in
diseases such as hypertension is well-known, its role in the brain particularly in brain areas
affected by dementia and AD remains unclear. Using a genetically diverse humanized AD
mouse model and new-generation ultrahigh-sensitivity mass spectrometry, this proposal will
focus on elucidating the role of the brain RAS and hypertension risk in AD. We will focus our
efforts across three objectives: (1) Measure the profiles of brain angiotensin peptides and
peptidases in genetically diverse AD-BXD mice and the impact of susceptibility and resilience to
late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD); (2) Determine the effects of hypertension on the
angiotensin peptide–peptidase profiles in the early-onset (6 mo.) susceptible strains; (3) Utilize
bioinformatic tools for multivariate-statistical data analysis to uncover connections between the
angiotensin peptide-peptidase system of the brain and the intricate interplay among cognitive,
cardiovascular, behavioral, sex-dependent, and neuropathological factors, and whether these
relationships contribute to the susceptibility and progression of dementia and the risk of
developing AD. These investigations hold the potential to unveil new biological mechanisms that
contribute to dementia and AD risk and provide the opportunity for identifying new therapeutic
directions that could potentially prevent or slow down the progression of dementia and AD."
10873282,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Sexually reproducing organisms rely on meiosis, a specialized cell division that produces haploid
gametes such as sperm and eggs, to restore the genetic content of the zygote through fertilization. Errors in this
process lead to the production of offspring with an abnormal number of chromosomes or aneuploidy, and this is
a major cause of human miscarriages and birth defects such as Down syndrome. Accurate segregation of
chromosomes during meiosis requires that they pair, synapse, and undergo crossover recombination with their
homologs. Although genetic studies over the decades have identified a list of proteins that are essential for
meiotic processes, it remains largely unknown how these protein machines work together to drive and coordinate
chromosome dynamics. Our research program will investigate these fundamental processes by combining
biochemical analysis using purified components, with the ability to examine meiosis in the context of highly
tractable C. elegans germline. One major focus of our work is the synaptonemal complex (SC), a proteinaceous
scaffold that assembles between paired homologous chromosomes. The SC is a hallmark of meiotic prophase
and yet plays a poorly understood role in regulating crossover recombination. Although genetic and cytological
studies have identified SC proteins in various organism, how individual components interact with each other to
form the regular, repetitive arrangement of the SC is largely unknown. The recent discovery of two novel SC
components in C. elegans, SYP-5 and SYP-6, has uniquely positioned our group to investigate the structure and
functions of the SC. We will refine our purification protocols to isolate SYP protein complexes and determine the
stoichiometry and protein-protein interactions among the SC components. This work will reveal the molecular
map of the SC, which will provide a foundation for understanding its conserved structure throughout eukaryotes.
In parallel, we will delineate the signaling cascades by key cell cycle kinases and phosphatases to establish key
regulatory mechanisms that govern homolog pairing, synapsis, and meiotic recombination. We will determine
the mechanisms by which PLK-2 regulates the dynamic properties of the SC and its affinity to pro-crossover
factors. We will also decipher how the CDK multisite phosphorylation code elicits a switch-like response and
mediates crossover designation. Our studies will illuminate the mechanisms underlying meiotic chromosome
behavior to a biochemical level and ultimately shed light into how organisms faithfully transmit genetic information
from parent to progeny."
10873283,"The curious case of PARP1 in CNS myelin formation and repair
 Current anti-inflammatory drugs diminish immune attacks yet are ineffective in preventing neurological
progression of multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system
(CNS) with no cure affecting ~ 400,000 people in the USA. Remyelination failure, primarily resulted from
impaired differentiation of oligodendrocytes from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (i.e. impaired OPC
differentiation), is one of the major causes for MS neurological progression. Remyelination-promoting therapy
represents a promising option in combination with current immunosuppressive medications, for treating MS.
However, few medications are available for targeting myelin repair. Our long-term goal is to discover
remyelination-promoting strategies for treating demyelinating disorders. The objective of this proposal is to
address if and how poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) regulates OPC differentiation and myelination
and determine therapeutic values of PARP1-mediated pathways in myelin repair. PARP1 is a multi-faceted
nuclear protein that has been extensively scrutinized in cancer biology. Upon activation, PARP1 catalyzes the
covalent addition of poly(ADP-ribose) units to its target proteins, a process called PARylation which can be
reversed by the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG). The clinical rationale underlying this
proposal is that oligodendroglial lineage cells in the active but not chronic MS lesions display elevated PARP1
activity, suggesting that PARP1 may be a potential target for remyelination-promoting therapy. However, our
current knowledge of PARP1 in oligodendroglial biology and pathology is extremely limited and its therapeutic
value in remyelination has yet to be determined. The central hypothesis is that PARP1, acting through its
enzymatic activity, is an intrinsic dual-model driver of OPC differentiation and myelination which could be
harnessed to promote myelin repair. Our central hypothesis is built on the conceptual and methodological
foundations laid by our preliminary data of genetic and pharmacological manipulations in vitro and in vivo. The
hypothesis will be test in three specific aims: 1) determine the effect of PARP1 depletion on OPC differentiation
and myelination; 2) define the mechanisms underlying PARP1-regulated OPC differentiation and myelination;
and 3) determine the effects of loss- and gain-of-function of PARP1-mediated PARylation on myelin repair. We
will pursue these three aims by employing unique transgenic models generated in our laboratory. The
proposed research is significant because it will interrogate the therapeutic potential of PARP1 in myelin repair
and lay the conceptual groundwork to develop remyelination-promoting strategies. The expected outcomes will
have an important positive impact because they will establish the first conceptual picture regarding the function
and mechanism of PARP1 in CNS myelin formation and repair and they will provide new data justifying
intervening PARP1-mediated PARylation as a promising option for remyelination-promoting therapy."
10871326,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a devastating cause of death and disability. Progression of non-fatal cases of
TBI often leaves patients at increased risk for subsequent injury and disease. Improved understanding of the
mechanisms of TBI is fundamental to improving strategies for both prevention and treatment. Recent
experiments show evidence that the brain softens (i.e., its stiffness is reduced) following TBI. Little is known
about the significance or mechanisms of this softening, but it is typically believed to result from edema. Recent
data from our team show that overstretch (deformation beyond typical physiological conditions) changes the
structure and function of cerebral arteries. These changes include softening, with reductions in stiffness as
high as 80% for large, but still sub-rupture, deformations. Given the predictions of finite element (FE) models
that cerebral vessels significantly influence the structural response of the brain, it follows that softened blood
vessels likely contribute to overall brain softening. It is, of course, also possible that brain tissue itself softens
with deformation. Based on these data, our guiding hypothesis is that TBI-induced deformation directly softens
the brain and its associated tissues, leading to reduced constraint of brain motion and thus contributing to
increased risk of injury in subsequent trauma. We further hypothesize that softening is a direct function of
strain and that it correlates with both injury severity and subsequent injury susceptibility. If these hypotheses
are true, softening has significant potential as a quantifiable biomarker of both injury severity and subsequent
susceptibility. This is particularly notable since softening can be quantified non-invasively, and within specific
regions, using magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), with potential to be used in diagnosis, treatment, and
definition of recovery status for individual patients. Such data is also expected to be useful for validation of FE
TBI models. Additionally, given that vessel softening occurs at deformations well below those that result in
hemorrhage, this biomarker could provide novel insight into the mechanics of mild TBI. As a step toward
pursuing these hypotheses, the overall objective of this R03 proposal is to obtain preliminary data
demonstrating softening in a large animal model of inertial TBI. This will be accomplished through two aims.
Aim 1 will characterize TBI in the pig. The pig is commonly utilized as a model of inertial TBI because of its
gyrencephalic brain. We have previously utilized this model to study mild, repeated loading and here propose
to extend our model to investigate single loading events producing mild to moderate injury. We will
characterize the new model by defining the relationship between loading conditions and injury severity,
described through both magnetic resonance imaging and histology. Aim 2 will quantify TBI-induced brain tissue
softening using MRE. In addition to the imaging protocol mentioned for Aim 1, MRE will be performed before
and after TBI to allow determination of brain stiffness. We hypothesize that brain softening will be detectable
following mild loading and will increase as a function of injury severity."
10876400,"Project Summary – Comparative structural and functional analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa inhibitor
of vertebrate lysozyme paralogs.
Thomas Leeper, PI, Kennesaw State University.
The proposed integrative studies will investigate a significant regulator of peptidoglycan biochemistry in the
cystic fibrosis pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), known to display multidrug resistance
(MDR). Specifically, Inhibitor of Vertebrate Lysozyme protein 2 (IVYp2) will have its structure determined
by NMR (Aim 1) and compared to its ability to inhibit hydrolase enzyme kinetics (Aim 2). While IVY
proteins were originally suggested to inhibit lysozyme glycoside hydrolases, subsequent work suggested
that the evolutionary origin of IVY’s may have been to inhibit lytic transglycosylases (LTs). For example,
IVYp2 has no effect on lysozyme activity in enzyme inhibition assays but has been shown to inhibit LTs,
at least in vitro. In order to determine which LTs are recognized in vivo enzyme inhibition assays with
LTs (Aim 2) will be compared to novel applications of complementation and genetically encoded
crosslinking studies in IVY knockout PA strains (Aim 3). The identified cognate IVY-LT pairs will be
compared to the NMR structure of IVYp2 (Aim 1) and existing complex structures for other IVYs (i.e.
IVYp1) bound to lysozyme to suggest regions important for LT molecular recognition. Graduate and
undergraduate students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, will significantly participate in
this research to facilitate data collection while providing them important training and advancement
opportunities. These innovative studies will establish the background and workflow needed for future
drug discovery efforts to develop new drug classes targeting novel biochemical pathways in MDR PA."
10875149,"PROJECT SUMMARY
MitoNEET is a druggable target, with recognized roles in type-2 diabetes, cancer, and Parkinson’s Disease. The redox-
active [2Fe-2S] cluster of mitoNEET, localized in the cytosol at the outer mitochondrial membrane, has enzymatic capacity
to convert thiol-containing molecules known to regulate the cellular redox balance, such as cysteine and glutathione. The
electronic properties and stability of the [2Fe-2S] cluster of mitoNEET are sensitive to pH, mutagenesis, ligand binding,
and covalent modification. Cluster instability and release from mitoNEET cause an increase of free iron in the cytosol. The
iron increase is a known harmful event that at the least causes oxidative stress and at most kills the cell through the initiation
of ferroptosis. Metabolic activity towards thiols combined with the instability of the cluster makes mitoNEET well-
positioned to act as both a sensor for free thiol content in cells and a putative perpetrator of ferroptosis. We hypothesize that
mitoNEET has a unique role in contributing to redox homeostasis through the metabolism of sulfur-containing intermediates
and signaling into the ferroptosis pathway. It contributes to the cell's ability to maintain physiological glutathione
concentrations and the cytosolic free iron pool."
10877069,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most common form of pancreatic cancer, is one of the
deadliest forms of cancer. Poor survival rates are largely due to the late stage at which PDAC is diagnosed
and a lack of effective therapies. The long-term goal of this research program is to discover new therapeutic
approaches and drug combinations for the treatment of PDAC and other incurable cancers. Previous studies
by our group identified a new class of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) inhibitor with activity in a variety of solid
and hematological cancer types including PDAC. PDIs are emerging oncology targets that play a critical role in
the proper folding of newly synthesized proteins. PDIs are overexpressed in a variety of tumor types and are
attractive oncology targets. In an unbiased screen of FDA-approved oncology drugs, we found this new class
of drug could dramatically enhance the activity of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors with the strongest
synergy being observed in PDAC models. The specific objectives of this study are: (1) to uncover the
molecular mechanism responsible for the remarkable synergy between PDI and HDAC inhibitors in PDAC, (2)
to resolve binding of novel PDI inhibitors to their target using X-ray crystallography, and (3) to demonstrate the
preclinical anti-cancer activity of lead PDI inhibitors as single agents and in combination with HDAC inhibitors
in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of PDAC. These aims are built on clear rationale from the
existing literature and strong preliminary data. This work is innovative because we investigate the activity and
mechanism of a new drug candidate and new treatment combination for the treatment of PDAC, a cancer in
desperate need of new therapies. It is our expectation that this work will deliver a new drug candidate and
combination treatment regimen for the treatment of PDAC, provide insight into the druggability of an emerging
cancer drug target in PDI, and uncover molecular mechanisms that enhance the activity of HDAC inhibitors."
10877545,"Project Summary
More than three in every ten Medicaid enrollees has a diagnosed mental health condition, and many in this
group face significant barriers accessing the care they need. In most states, Medicaid enrollees with mental
health conditions are covered by managed care organizations, which contract with sets of health care
providers and facilities to deliver medical care to its members. The size, composition, and stability of these
“provider networks” can affect care continuity and treatment outcomes, particularly in mental health, where
provider networks tend to be much smaller than those for physical health. The Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services requires each Medicaid managed care provider network to provide sufficient and timely
access to mental health services. However, little evidence exists to help states understand which mental health
network attributes affect patient outcomes and how to design, monitor, and regulate provider networks. Against
these knowledge gaps, the overall objective of this proposal is to estimate the effects of mental health
networks on health care utilization and outcomes for adult Medicaid enrollees with mental health conditions
(including those with serious and mild/moderate mental illness). We propose to use the 2016-2023
Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T-MSIS) Analytic Files (TAF), which provides
comprehensive enrollee-level claims data related to service utilization and prescription use for all states and
the District of Columbia. We hypothesize that network size, provider churn (exit), and provider panel size (a
measure of the degree of plan participation) influence enrollees' mental health care access and outcomes.
Specifically, our aims are to 1) identify mental health network attributes associated with plan switching among
Medicaid enrollees with mental health conditions; 2) determine the effects of changes in network size and
network quality on utilization and patient outcomes; 3) estimate the effects of involuntary network disruption on
patient outcomes; and 4) assess how telemedicine affects the attributes and measurement of mental health
networks. We apply a number of innovations, including the construction of empirical provider networks from
administrative claims data, a focus on psychiatrists and psychiatric mental health nurse practitioners, and a
robust study design to evaluate the impact of mental health provider network attributes on patient-level
outcomes. In collaboration with an advisory committee of Medicaid and mental health policy stakeholders,
results will provide actionable evidence to improve access to high-quality mental health services within a
constrained mental health delivery system.

10877621,"Summary
Tumor formation and cancer cell proliferation depend on enhanced ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis. Ribosomes are the molecular machines responsible for protein production within cells. Emerging data indicates that inhibition of ribosome formation and function can prevent cancers from forming in certain contexts. For example, liver disease predisposes patients for liver cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma, and this transition is marked by enhanced ribosome biogenesis. Inhibition of ribosome function prevents liver tumor formation in mouse models. Thus, additional compounds that attenuate ribosome production and activity may be able to prevent the formation of tumors. Unfortunately, previously available methods used to study ribosome biogenesis are laborious and not easily scalable. This has significantly hampered the development of new ribosome biogenesis inhibitors. To overcome this critical barrier, we have developed an innovative platform that we call ribo-SNAP, which allows us to assay the dynamics of ribosome biogenesis at single cell resolution in living cells. Using this platform, we have successfully completed pilot compound screens and identified new genes and small molecules that inhibit the protein synthesis capacity of cancer cells. In parallel, we have also developed a second novel assay called SidBait, which allows us to robustly and rapidly identify compound targets within cells. Using these approaches, we are in a unique position to identify and develop ribosome biogenesis inhibitors as effective anti-cancer agents. We now seek to expand our efforts to the larger NCI natural product library. The proposal is divided into UG3 and UH3 sections. Under Aim 1, we will further optimize the ribo-SNAP platform and conduct a small pilot screen of a subset of fractions from the SOOK natural product library. In Aim 2, we will use Sid Bait to identify the targets of compounds identified in the pilot screen or our ongoing screen of an independent 3SOK compound library. Experiments described under Aim 3 will directly test the extent to which ribosome biogenesis inhibitors can prevent liver tumor formation in mouse models. These three aims have clear milestones and we anticipate that the successful completion of the UG3 phase will allow the project to advance. During the UH3 phase, the large of screening will expand to the entire SOOK library under Aim 4. Sid Bait will be used in Aim 5 to begin to determine the mechanism of action of specific compounds. Finally, under Aim 6, mouse models will be used to test whether lead molecule prevent cancer progression. The successful completion of the entire project described in this proposal will provide an unparalleled collection of ribosome biogenesis inhibitors that can be further developed into novel therapeutics for the prevention of liver cancer."
10878670,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 There are approximately 500,000 childhood cancer survivors in the U.S. today. Childhood cancer
survivors are vulnerable to late effects of therapy including chronic health conditions and premature death.
Predicting survivor-specific risk of late effects, discussing how to manage these risks, and offering early
preventions and interventions are critical components of survivorship care. Over 75% of childhood cancer
survivors have prevalent symptoms, and constantly poor or worsening symptoms are associated with onset of
medical late effects. However, regular symptom monitoring is uncommon in survivorship or primary care. The
core concept of this R01 grant proposal is to enable regular monitoring of patient-generated health data (PGHD),
including symptoms, physical activity, energy expenditure, sleep behavior and heart rate variability, and utilize
these data in predicting survivor-specific risk of late effects to improve survivorship care and outcomes.
 The proposed application will enroll 620 adult survivors of childhood cancer from the St. Jude Lifetime
Cohort Study who are ≥5 years post diagnosis and currently ≥18 years of age at enrollment to achieve the
following 3 specific aims: Aim 1) use a mobile health platform to collect dynamic PGHD data over 3 months and
use them to develop and validate risk prediction models for future quality-of-life (QOL); Aim 2) develop/validate
risk prediction models and establish personalized risk prediction scores for other outcomes (unplanned care
utilization, physical performance deficits, onset of chronic health conditions) using the same approach as Aim 1;
and Aim 3) create a web-based tool to calculate and report personalized outcome-specific risks, and facilitate
integration of risk scores into the survivor’s patient portal and hospital’s Electronic Health Record (EHR).
 We have a series of preliminary data to support this R01 grant proposal: a) in a pilot study assessing 20
common symptoms with a mobile health platform, childhood cancer survivors completed 90% of all required
evaluations over 3 months; and b) in a prediction analysis from ongoing cohort of childhood cancer survivors,
the inclusion of longitudinal symptom data generated a superior model performance in predicting future QOL
(prediction measure, AUC=0.85) compared to the use of only age, sex, and childhood cancer type (AUC=0.63).
 Linking through a mobile health platform, we will use a smartphone to collect symptom data, a wrist-worn
accelerometer to collect momentary activity/behavioral data, and a finger sensor to collect heart rate variability
data. We will predict patient-reported outcomes (poor QOL, unplanned healthcare utilization) and clinically-
assessed outcomes (physical performance deficits, onset of chronic health conditions) on the 12th and 24th
months after collecting risk factors. We will apply state-of-the-art machine/statistical learning techniques to
capture features of dynamic changes in PGHD to predict these outcomes. We will build a Central Cancer
Survivorship Platform to integrate predicted risks presented with interpretable scores into a patient portal and
EHR, and to inform clinicians and survivors about potential adverse-event risks for risk management/intervention."

Overview of research in the laboratory: The Optical Imaging and Spectroscopy (OIS) laboratory focuses in de-
veloping and advancing optical technologies to help improve the understanding of biological processes and the
ability to identify disease. Specifically, the OIS lab focuses on label-free imaging, linear and nonlinear spectros-
copy, and advanced signal processing techniques to gain access to novel forms of functional and molecular in-
formation for a variety of applications. To date, these efforts have led to advances in spectroscopic optical co-
herence microscopy (SOCT), quantitative phase imaging (QPI), nonlinear pump-probe microscopy, and stimu-
lated Raman scattering (SRS). The lab has pioneered several new forms of molecular contrast, including molec-
ular reorientation, nonlinear phase dispersion spectroscopy, ultraviolet hyperspectral imaging, and dispersion-
based SRS. The lab has also developed new computational methods for analyzing spectral and morphological
features in an unsupervised manner. Finally, these methods have been applied to help in cell identification and
phenotyping, basic biological studies, disease detection and staging, and more.
Goals for the next five years, and the overall vision of the research program: Recently, the OIS lab pioneered
quantitative oblique back illumination microscopy (qOBM) and has made important advances in deep ultravio-
let (UV) microscopy as a means to address critical challenges in biology and medicine. Over the five years of
this proposal, this program seeks to explore the capabilities of these highly promising new tools. Through a
combination of system/hardware and computational/software developments, the proposed program will show
the tremendous utility of these label-free optical methods to reveal critical molecular, functional, and structural
detail that is currently impossible to obtain or requires prohibitive expensive or complex systems.. The main
focus of the work is on technology development, but it will also explore a number of applications that are in
dire need of such label-free, non-invasive, low-cost, easy-to-use imaging methods.
The proposed program will lead to a robust platform that will guide future innovation. A clear example is tying
in the tremendous power of emerging computational methods, such deep neural networks for image transla-
tion and classification. Additionally, with the advent of the proposed tools and a better understanding of their
capabilities, researchers will be able to venture into more targeted effort to tailor these tools for specific appli-
cations. Thus, the proposed work and the capabilities it will enable in the future can have tremendous potential
to improve and influence biology and medicine."
10878808,"This is a proposal to renew an advanced predoctoral training program focused on Integrative Approaches to Explore Cellular Interactions in Neural Circuits. The goal of this program is to endow trainees with diverse research interests and scientific backgrounds with skills necessary for the study of neural circuits using multidisciplinary approaches and rigorous methodologies. This integrative program specifically targets trainees with research interests at the interface between molecular/cellular and systems/behavioral neuroscience by emphasizing scientific approaches that span multiple levels of analysis and employ multiple experimental models. The program's goals will be accomplished through a tailored curriculum that includes advanced coursework in the study of neural circuits, training in rigorous neuroscience research techniques and quantitative analysis, and mentorship in science communication and career planning. In a course that has been specifically designed for this training grant, trainees will learn from contemporary studies of neural circuits that incorporate diverse approaches, including cell and molecular neurobiology, genetics, synaptic physiology, and behavior. In this renewal, we add a new training component for PhD candidates that brings their research project to a biostatician for in-depth feedback on scientific methodologies and rigor in data analysis, in the context of the trainee's own experimental results. This training program enables predoctoral students to prepare for the intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary nature of modern neuroscience research by providing: (a) high-quality scientific education in the fundamental principles of neurobiology, state-of-the-art techniques to study neural circuits, and statistical approaches to rigorous experimental design; (b) mentoring that aids trainees’ progress toward their future careers in science, and (c) training in the professional skills that are necessary for success in academic research, including critical reading, grant writing, oral presentation, leadership, management, and networking. Four trainees will be selected by an Executive Committee on the basis of their excellence in research, interest in neural circuits, and potential for future leadership. Each trainee will be appointed for one year and will continue to receive mentoring and career development support in subsequent years. Thirty-one faculty from the NYU School of Medicine and NYU Arts and Science campus will participate in this multidisciplinary training program. Faculty mentors lead strong NIH-supported research programs and use cellular, molecular, and genetic approaches to reveal basic principles of neural circuit assembly and function. The environment at NYU strongly supports the goals of this training program, and education continues to be a core mission of our neuroscience community."
10878809,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Microtubule-associated motor proteins couple the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to mechanical work, which
is then used to power intracellular movements associated with cell division, migration, and transport of cellular
cargoes. There are two classes of microtubule-associated motors, cytoplasmic dynein-1 (dynein) and kinesins.
These motors move in opposite directions on the microtubule track: dynein moves toward the microtubule minus-
end, which is typically near the nucleus and kinesin moves toward the microtubule plus-end. While there are
over forty kinesins, there is only one dynein that promotes cytoplasmic cargo trafficking. Dynein is highly
regulated and interacts with a vast network of proteins that modulate its function and activity. However, molecular
mechanisms of how many dynein binding proteins regulate dynein activity is largely unknown. Understanding
how dynein is regulated is a pressing need as mutation in dynein or its regulators is associated with many
neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. This proposal seeks to decipher the rules that govern
dynein-mediated cellular trafficking using an interdisciplinary approach combining proteomics, biochemistry,
structural biology, single molecule fluorescence microscopy, and fixed and live cell imaging. We will focus on
two overarching goals. The first goal is to determine the function of a new class of dynein regulatory proteins
that our lab has discovered. These novel regulators associate with kinesin, dynein, and known dynein regulators
and promote the formation of focal adhesions. By determining the function of these new regulators, we will
determine the role of microtubule-based transport in focal adhesion assembly and dynamics. The second goal
is to determine the molecular mechanism of how the dynein regulatory protein, Nudel functions. Here, we will
focus on determining how Nudel effects the kinetics of dynein activation and dynein’s ability to bind to and move
on the microtubule track. Completion of this goal is a pressing need, as Nudel dysfunction is associated with
microcephaly, epilepsy, and schizophrenia. Together, the results of this work will reveal novel mechanisms of
dynein regulation, which has broad implications in human health and disease."
10878817,"Vertebrate and invertebrate neural progenitors are temporally patterned to generate a great
diversity of neural types in a birth-order dependent manner. Series of temporal transcription
factors (TTF) were found to be sequentially expressed in Drosophila neuroblasts, and they are
proposed to form transcriptional cascades to control the sequential generation of different neural
types. However, whether the cross-regulations inferred from mutant phenotypes are direct
transcriptional regulations haven't been demonstrated. Furthermore, the cross-regulations
among TTFs are often not sufficient for the temporal transitions, suggesting other mechanisms
are at play to regulate the temporal progression. We use the Drosophila medulla neuroblasts to
study these questions. In the previous R01 period, we identified molecular mechanisms
controlling transitions to the Slp and Ey temporal stages, and also identified a comprehensive
list of novel temporal transcription factors through single-cell RNA sequencing. In this renewal
application, we present our preliminary data of single-nuclear ATAC seq, which revealed the
dynamic chromatin accessibility during temporal patterning of medulla neuroblasts. Through
analyzing the differentially accessible regions, we identified the possible enhancers controlling
the temporal expression patterns of TTF genes. Through integration of scRNA-seq and
snATACseq and a combination of reporter assays, genetic analysis and Dam-ID experiments,
we propose to elucidate the transcriptional regulatory networks controlling the sequential
temporal transitions in great detail. Furthermore, we found that different epigenetic factors are
required at different steps of temporal patterning. We propose to further examine how they
regulate the dynamic chromatin accessibility and how they are recruited to specific target genes
during temporal patterning. Finally, we propose to examine the fundamental molecular
mechanisms that coordinate the growth/proliferation with TTF cascade progression, and will test
our hypothesis that early TTFs have different roles in controlling growth/proliferation than late
TTFs through a combination of approaches."
10878819,"ABSTRACT
The goal of this proposal is to investigate the potential for teixobactin (TXB) to treat drug-resistant tuberculosis
(TB). TB is a major global health issue and second largest killer by an infectious agent. Non-compliance by TB
patients due to lengthy treatment times have resulted in drug-resistant strains that require longer treatment
durations and a high risk of adverse side effects. Thus, there is a pressing need for a drug regimen that is safer,
shorter in duration and avoids drug resistance. The most remarkable property of TXB is the lack of any detectable
resistance. This lack of resistance is most likely due to its two-pronged mode of action. TXB hits two related
targets—lipid II, precursor of peptidoglycan and lipid III, precursor of wall teichoic acid. These highly conserved
targets are not mutable, as they are not proteins and are not directly coded by DNA. In addition, once bound to
its bacterial target, TXB self-associates into large macromolecular structures that weaken the membrane and
further contribute to its potent killing activity. Likely, these structures are irreversible, which can explain how low
TXB doses are so effective in various animal models of infection. Since discovering TXB, we and others have
failed to generate resistant mutants in any species including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Importantly, in a recent
study conducted at John Hopkins University, TXB was highly efficacious in a validated rabbit model of TB,
demonstrating its promise to treat this devastating disease.
 TXB is in preclinical development as an intravenous (IV) drug for treating serious skin infections caused
by pathogens such as MRSA. At a pre-Investigational New Drug (IND) meeting, the FDA generally agreed with
our development plan, and an IND submission is planned in approximately 1.5 to 2 years. The goal of this
proposal is to continue exploring TXB’s potential to treat TB. In this project, Aim 1 will produce enough TXB for
all the proposed studies. Aim 2 will conduct blood and lung PK studies in mice using intranasal administration of
TXB. Intranasal administration offers several advantages, including delivering the drug directly to the primary
site of infection (lung) and avoiding side effects with drugs delivered systemically. Aim 3 will use the Kramnik TB
mouse model to test the efficacy of intranasal TXB delivered alone and in combination with current TB drugs.
Kramnik mice develop pulmonary granulomas that more closely resembled human lesions. Aim 4 will use a
validated rabbit model to compare the efficacy of IV-delivered TXB alone and in combination with other TB drugs.
In Aims 3 and 4, TXB drug regimens will be compared to the BPaL (bedaquiline, pretomanid, linezolid) regimen
currently used for multidrug resistant TB. With successful completion of these studies, we will have demonstrated
the promise of TXB for treating drug-resistant TB and explored a convenient route of administration."
10879083,"Velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) occurs in up to 40% of patients following cleft palate repair and results in
hypernasality and nasal air emission during speech, which substantially limits communication. VPI has
traditionally been treated with pharyngoplasty, which is over 80% effective but leads to obstructive sleep apnea
(OSA) in 15%–50% of patients. To avoid the risk of OSA, some surgeons have begun performing palate re-repair to treat VPI. Early experience suggests re-repair is 84% effective in resolving VPI and that it does not
lead to OSA, although results vary substantially depending upon the criteria for patient selection. Given the
potential of re-repair to reduce the risk of OSA, and the substantial limitations in our knowledge about its
effectiveness, there is a critical need to compare the effectiveness of palate re-repair to pharyngoplasty and to
determine which patients are most likely to benefit from each operation. This proposal addresses this need
through three specific aims: (1) Compare the effectiveness of palate re-repair with that of pharyngoplasty for
treating VPI. (2) Determine the anatomic abnormalities of the palate that predict resolution of hypernasality
following palate re-repair and following pharyngoplasty. (3) Identify barriers and facilitators to implementing
personalized VPI procedure selection. Aims 1 and 2 will be achieved by conducting an observational
comparative-effectiveness study of palate re-repair versus pharyngoplasty in patients with VPI following their
initial cleft palate repair. The study will enroll 528 participants over a 3-year period from 10 cleft centers, using
propensity score matching to control for known factors or those suspected of influencing surgical procedure
assignment and speech outcome after surgery. Aim 1 will compare the two procedures for the outcomes of
hypernasality, nasal air emission, and OSA at 12 months after VPI surgery. An overall comparison of
procedures will be performed, as will subgroup analyses for patients with specific exam and morphologic
criteria. Aim 2 will be achieved by obtaining velopharyngeal MRI on participants prior to VPI surgery; MRI
enables direct evaluation of the velar muscles and soft tissues responsible for VPI. Aim 2 will test whether the
anatomic anomalies of velar muscle dehiscence, velar muscle malposition, and/or a short velum, as visualized
on MRI, predict resolution of hypernasality following palate re-repair. Aim 3 will use implementation science
methods to understand providers’ current approach to VPI procedure selection, identifying factors that may
delay or encourage implementation of a personalized approach to VPI management built upon findings in Aims
1 and 2. Completion of these aims will provide the first direct comparison of palate re-repair to pharyngoplasty
for the treatment of VPI, establish the morphologic and anatomic features that predict successful treatment
with each procedure, and identify barriers and facilitators to implementing personalized VPI procedure
selection. The proposed research will produce a significant positive impact for children with VPI after cleft
palate repair by enabling surgeons to select the most effective, least harmful surgical procedure for each child."
10878588,"ABSTRACT
Approximately one in six children in the US is affected by neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). A wide range
of medical and psychiatric conditions commonly co-occur with NDD, impacting quality of life. The causes of
NDD are largely unknown, and few modifiable risk factors have been identified. A growing body of evidence
supports a critical role for both genetic and environmental factors, particularly during gestation and the early
postnatal period. Understanding the underlying etiology is crucial, as the identification of risk factors and the
mechanisms by which they act would allow for earlier identification, treatment, and prevention of NDD and
associated morbidity. In our currently funded IMPaCT study (1R01HD095128), we are testing the hypothesis
that maternal inflammation during pregnancy stemming from immune or metabolic dysregulation adversely
impacts neurodevelopment. We are leveraging the unique resources of the Kaiser Permanente Research
Biobank Pregnancy Cohort to conduct a longitudinal prospective investigation of maternal gestational
inflammatory conditions, immune and metabolic biomarkers during pregnancy, and maternal genetics in
relation to NDD. The goal of this new application is to extend the aims of IMPaCT to interrogate additional
gestational biomarkers - maternal autoantibodies (MA) to fetal brain proteins - in the pregnancy blood samples
collected from the mothers of 750 ASD, 2000 developmental delay (DD), and 2000 general population (GP)
control children. Our overarching hypothesis is that maternal gestational immune/metabolic
dysregulation is associated with the presence of MA during pregnancy which predisposes to altered
neurodevelopment of the child. In Aim 1, we will examine maternal risk profiles related to the presence of
MA during pregnancy that are associated with NDD. In Aim 2, we will explore whether maternal genetics are
associated with the presence of MA during pregnancy. In Aim 3, we will examine the joint effects of maternal
MA reactivity and maternal clinical characteristics, biomarkers of immune and metabolic function and genetic
factors on ASD and DD, on phenotypic subgroups of ASD (ASD+/-Intellectual Disability (ID), ASD+/-
developmental regression) and DD (language delay, motor delay, global delay, ID), and on clinical subtypes of
the child defined by commonly co-occurring inflammation-mediated immune and metabolic conditions,
and determine if associations differ by child sex. We seek funds to assay for MA in the maternal pregnancy
biospecimens from the ~2500 mothers in our IMPaCT cohort plus an additional ~2250 mothers and perform
statistical analyses to address our specific aims. This large scale, comprehensive study provides a framework
to explore relationships between maternal immune dysregulation and metabolic function, maternal
autoantibody reactivity in the first and second trimesters, maternal genetics, and risk for a range of
neurodevelopmental disorders in children. Findings will contribute to the development of prenatal and newborn
screening for adverse neurodevelopment, ultimately enabling earlier intervention and primary prevention."
10800652,"Project Summary 
 Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is one of the most common gastrointestinal emergency in the neonatal 
period. It is characterized by severe intestinal inflammation that can rapidly result in intestinal necrosis, sepsis, 
and potentially death. Despite advances in medical care, mortality and morbidity caused by NEC has not 
changed. This is largely due to the poor understanding of the complex pathogenesis, the limitations of the current 
animal models, and the lack of specific therapeutic or preventative therapies. 
 Although the etiology is unclear, evidence suggests that prematurity, formula feeding, altered intestinal 
microbiome, and hypoxia-ischemia play major roles in NEC. Preterm infants have impaired intestinal 
permeability, and exhibit prominent intestinal epithelial TLR4 expression; all of which render the bowel at risk of 
bacterial translocation, an exaggerated inflammatory response, and NEC development. Therefore, identifying 
strategies or interventions that promote maturation of intestinal defenses, epithelial integrity, and modulate 
inflammation is critical in preventing this deadly disease. 
 We have promising preliminary data demonstrating that oral hyaluronan at a molecular weight of ~ 35 
kDa (HA 35kDa) reduces mortality, severity of intestinal injury, and systemic inflammation in a murine model of 
NEC. HA is a glycosaminoglycan found in almost all tissues including extracellular matrix. Studies showed that 
HA isolated from breast milk or commercially available HA 35kDA, protects against bacteria-induced colitis by 
increasing the expression of antimicrobial β-defensins, and tight junction protein ZO-1 in colonic epithelium in 
vivo and in vitro. Based on our preliminary data and the previously reported biological effects of HA in the large 
intestine, we propose to directly investigate the effect of HA 35kDa on the (1) immature intestinal defenses, 
specifically antimicrobial peptides produced by enterocytes and Paneth cells, (2) intestinal barrier including 
mucous lining and TJ formation, and (3) on the development of the intestinal microbiome in healthy pups and 
pups with NEC (Aim 1).To facilitate translation of our results to human studies, we propose to evaluate the effect 
of HA 35kDa on a novel premature non-human primate model (NHP) of NEC (Aim 2). 
 The ultimate goal of this project to initiate a new research direction in a disease that has shown little 
clinical progress over the past 50 years. Results from our study would enhance our understanding of NEC and 
lead to identification of new preventative strategies that will improve patient outcomes."
10890688,"In order to achieve the end of the HIV epidemic, concerted efforts will be needed to address the HIV care
continuum, including improving retention in care and viral suppression among persons living with HIV (PLWH).
Currently, in the U.S., it is estimated that less than 50% of PLWH are retained in care and even fewer are
virally suppressed. Studies have shown that these PLWH have poorer clinical outcomes and are at risk of
transmitting HIV to others, hence the need for innovative solutions to improve retention in care and subsequent
viral suppression. Theory-based mHealth interventions have been shown to be promising in reaching these at-
risk groups and improving HIV-related outcomes. PositiveLinks is a clinic-deployed mHealth platform that
includes patient and provider smartphone apps, a web portal for clinic staff and providers to manage patient
cohorts, an online implementation guide, and a learning management system to train and certify clinic staff. It
has theory-based features including daily queries of adherence, mood, and stress, graphical feedback for self-
monitoring, secure messaging with staff, appointment reminders, anonymized peer support, information
resources, and document upload capability to support insurance re-enrollment. A 12-month prospective study
in poorly retained adults with HIV found that PL increased RIC and VS, with app usage related to benefit as
well as improved social support and stigma. PL is a promising existing mHealth tool for PLWH, but its efficacy
has not been tested in a rigorous randomized trial, nor in urban populations. We propose to test the efficacy of
PositiveLinks to improve retention in care and viral suppression among a cohort of PLWH in a high HIV
prevalence city of Washington, DC. Participants will be identified from the DC Cohort, a longitudinal
observational prospective cohort of PLWH receiving HIV care at 14 clinical sites in Washington, DC. First, we
will conduct formative research to assess the feasibility, acceptability and usability of PositiveLinks among this
urban cohort and conduct subsequent adaptations based on these findings. We will then conduct an efficacy
study through a cluster randomized controlled trial at 14 DC Cohort sites among 560 PLWH. Clinics will be
randomized to PL or usual care. Our primary outcomes will include viral suppression, retention in care and visit
constancy at 12 months. Finally, we will conduct mixed methods implementation science research guided by
the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and RE-AIM to identify site, patient, provider, and
system factors that characterize best practices in program implementation. If successful, this research will lead
to the development of a novel and efficacious approach to improving retention in care and viral suppression
among PLWH which could lead to next-generation dissemination research that will contribute to HIV epidemic
control. This project is responsive to NIH priorities, National HIV/AIDS Strategy, and Ending the HIV Epidemic
goals as it is cross-cutting, seeks to reduce health inequities, and to improve health outcomes to achieve
sustained viral suppression in a geographic hotspot for HIV."

This proposal aims to continue the development of XNAT. XNAT is an imaging informatics platform designed
to facilitate common management and productivity tasks for imaging and associated data. We will develop the
next generation of XNAT technology to support the ongoing evolution of imaging research. Development will
focus on modernizing and expanding the current system. In Aim 1, we will implement platform components, in
including a new archive file management system and database interface, a streamlined image annotation
interface, a module to support integrations with cloud applications, and a set of software development kits
(SDKs) to support development of tools that interact with XNAT data and services. In Aim 2, we will implement
two innovative new capabilities that build on the services developed in Aim 1. The XNAT Workspaces module
will link Jupyter Notebooks with XNAT, creating a computing environment that enables users to mount
specified data sets in their Notebooks, share and clone Notebooks, save Notebooks to version control
systems, and publish them as static dashboard. XNAT Workspaces will be linked to XNAT Container Service
and high-performance computing and cloud computing resources to enable scalable computation. The XNAT
Machine Learning (ML) Studio will provide an integrated application for data science teams to build and
annotate data sets, train and validate ML models, and publish their models as deployable applications. ML
Studio will implement quality control, logging, and provenance tracking to help users avoid the pitfalls that often
plague machine learning efforts. For both Aim 1 and 2, all capabilities will be developed and evaluated in the
context of real world scientific programs that are actively using the XNAT platform. In Aim 3, we will provide
extensive support to the XNAT community, including developer workshops and hackathons, online
documentation, discussion forums, and the XNAT Academy training platform. These activities will be targeted
at both XNAT users and developers. Together these aims represent a major advance in imaging informatics
that is unique in the field and will greatly benefit an extraordinarily broad research portfolio."

mentorship program for digital health research focused on obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD)
prevention. The candidate currently has 14 mentees ranging from high school to junior faculty level. In the four
years her K24 has been funded her mentees earned 104 co-authorships on papers and submitted 40 grants
(31 thus far) under her mentorship. The proposed mentorship plan will build additional training experiences into
her mentorship program by providing mentees with a transdisciplinary mentoring experience that represents
experts in behavioral science, preventive cardiology, health informatics, data science, and innovative research
designs. Mentees from collaborating labs at UMass Medical School, Penn State University, and Worcester
Polytechnic Institute will “embed” in each other's lab to learn a broad range of digital health research skills with
an emphasis on data science, innovative methodologies, and designing innovations with commercial potential.
Mentees will learn how to: utilize mobile apps and online social networks in their research; analyze social
network data; conduct qualitative and quantitative data analyses; leverage innovative research designs (e.g.,
MOST); employ behavior change strategies in mobile and social network environments; design preliminary
studies; and write grants. The candidate's training goals are to expand her research into implementation,
dissemination, and larger scale program projects; enhance her mentorship of young investigators seeking to
study innovative technologies; increase capacity to translate NIH-funded digital health innovations into the
healthcare economy; and increase capacity of the UConn Center for mHealth and Social Media to build a
national reputation for training in behavioral digital health research in CVD risk reduction. The overarching goal
of the research plan is to test ways to leverage social media to deliver health behavior programming in ways
that maximize efficacy, scalability, and dissemination potential. Three research aims are proposed, all of which
test the efficacy of cardiovascular disease prevention and/or weight management programs delivered via social
media. The first aim proposes to test the efficacy of a Facebook-delivered CVD prevention healthy lifestyle
program for young women. The second aim is to test the efficacy of a similar CVD prevention program but
tailored to adult family members in families that have already been impacted by a life-threatening disease. This
Facebook-delivered CVD prevention program will leverage family ties to promote behavior change. The third
aim is to conduct a feasibility trial of multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) study which will test the optimal
formats for goal setting and problem solving messages in a social media delivered weight loss intervention.
This work will provide preliminary data for 3 R01 applications. The proposed work will produce training
experiences and data that will contribute to the mentorship of the next generation of researchers who will have
transdisciplinary expertise to leverage social media in the delivery of CVD prevention interventions."

Research. Cancer incidence increases dramatically with age. While the average life expectancy continues to
rise, one consequence is that cancer cases are predicted to grow by 45% between 2010 and 2030, highlighting
the critical need to study the intersection between aging physiology and tumorigenesis. However, the majority of
cancer research is performed using young adult mice as pre-clinical cancer models, where impact of
environmental risk factors, like aging, on key features of tumorigenesis cannot be measured. The immune
system is especially vulnerable to functional decline with aging. Many different kinds of immune cells can be
found infiltrating tumors, where CD8+ T cells in particular can identify and selectively kill cancer cells by
recognizing tumor features that differ from normal tissue. Although studies have shown that aging diminishes
CD8+ T cell proliferation and effector responses following bacterial and viral infections, the role of aging on anti-
tumor immunity is still a major black box. Based on our preliminary data in tumors from young and aged mice,
we hypothesize that impaired anti-tumor immunity by CD8+ T cells contributes to tumorigenesis during aging. To
test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will first develop mouse models to study aging, cancer, and anti-tumor immunity, and
then identify mechanisms that alter immune cell function in the tumor niche using flow cytometry and single cell
RNA-sequencing. In Aim 2, we will define metabolic changes in the aged tumor microenvironment and then test
whether these are causal for CD8+ T cell dysfunction. Finally, Aim 3 will determine whether enhancing metabolic
pathways in immune cells identified by transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis can improve tumor control
during aging. By revealing how the tumor microenvironment changes with age and the impact on anti-tumor
immunity, these studies will identify mechanisms that drive T cell dysfunction in tumors that may be targeted to
improve cancer prevention and therapy.
Candidate. Dr. Alison Ringel, PhD, is the PI for this research proposal. She has worked as a postdoctoral fellow
for the past five years at Harvard Medical School, where she has sought to understand the molecular
mechanisms that drive tumorigenesis in response to environmental cancer risk factors such as obesity. She is
in the process of interviewing for tenure-track faculty positions and has mapped out a detailed professional
development plan that will enable her to transition to an independent research career where she will develop her
research program on aging and tumorigenesis. She aims to become a leader in cancer immunology by applying
an innovative systems biology approach to dissect the tumor niche, which will distinguish her independent work
from that of her postdoctoral mentors. Her long-term goal is to lead an independent cancer research program
dedicated to the discovery of molecular mechanisms within tumors that regulate local immune responses and
tumor progression."
10888468,"Project Summary/Abstract
Reactivation of viruses from latent infection can result in series disease. In addition, latent infections are a
barrier to curing certain viral diseases. For the persistent herpesvirus, Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), the
mechanisms that regulate entry of the virus into a latent infection are not known. The formation of
heterochromatin on the viral genome in neurons has long been hypothesized to contribute to suppressing gene
expression for latency establishment. However, no functional studies have yet identified a role for
heterochromatin formation as a mechanism to promote entry into latency or maintain a latent infection. There
are multiple different types of heterochromatin, which differ their mechanisms of gene silencing and ability to
be reversed for gene expression to take place. Our overall hypothesis is that HSV actively promotes a type of
heterochromatin to enable both persistence and reactivation. Our data indicate that the histone modification,
H2AK119ub1, is enriched on the HSV genome during latency. H2AK119ub1 functions to repress gene
expression, but it is also known to be rapidly remodeled to permit gene expression to take place in response to
certain stimuli. Importantly, our preliminary data indicate that H2AK119ub1 needs to be deposited onto HSV
genomes to later enable reactivation to occur. To understand the contribution of H2AK119ub1 to HSV latency
and reactivation, along with the mechanism of H2AK119ub1 deposition on the genome, complementary in vitro
and in vivo models of HSV latency are essential. Our lab has developed novel in vitro model systems to
investigate the molecular mechanisms of HSV latency establishment and reactivation, which we combine with
high-resolution imaging to investigate the association of individual viral genomes with chromatin-associated
proteins. These assays will be complemented with epigenetic assays to map and quantify protein association
with viral genomes in vitro and in vivo. In aim 1, we will investigate how H2AK119ub1 impacts the
establishment of latency. In aim 2, we will determine how the protein complex responsible for H2AK119ub1 is
recruited to viral genomes via interacting with the HSV long non-coding RNA known as the Latency Associated
Transcript. In aim 3, we will examine why H2AK119ub1 association is required for the formation of reactivation
competent latent infection. Upon completion of these aims, we will understand how heterochromatin is targeted
to the HSV genome to limit lytic gene expression specifically in neurons and therefore promote latency
establishment. We will answer a long-standing question on the mechanistic function of the Latency Associated
Transcript in regulating latency establishment and reactivation. Finally, we will understand how different types
of heterochromatin modulate the ability of HSV to undergo reactivation. Ultimately, we will identify targets for
therapeutics that could act to directly prevent latency establishment or reactivation, or modulate the latent
epigenetic structure into a form that is non-permissive for reactivation."

10891395,"PROJECT SUMMARY
About 5% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) are driven by chromosomal translocations of the anaplastic
lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene. ALK-positive NSCLC is highly sensitive to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs),
and there are currently five FDA-approved ALK TKIs (crizotinib, alectinib, ceritinib, brigatinib, and lorlatinib) for
clinical use. While patients initially benefit from these ALK-targeting therapies, essentially all cancers will develop
drug resistance. Upon relapse, standard cytotoxic chemotherapy has modest activity and immune checkpoint
inhibitors (ICIs) do not provide any substantial benefit despite evidence that the expression of ALK by tumor cells
induces a spontaneous immune response in patients. In preclinical mouse models, we demonstrated that the
spontaneous ALK-specific immune response generated by ALK-driven lung cancers is insufficient to build an
efficacious anti-tumor response. However, a vaccine that potentiates ALK-specific immune responses in mouse
models can achieve a significant therapeutic effect including complete cure. Building on these studies, we
propose to develop the first therapeutic ALK vaccine for clinical use in patients with advanced ALK+ NSCLC. To
achieve this goal, through immunoproteomic analysis, we have identified the precise ALK peptides that are
processed by tumor cells and presented by two major MHC class I molecules in ALK-driven cell lines. We
confirmed that these peptides are immunogenic in transgenic mice, patients, and healthy donors. These
validated ALK peptides will be included in the formulation of an ALK vaccine for clinical use together with a novel
highly potent vaccine adjuvant. The clinical trial will also be supported with additional funding from industry and
foundation grants. Leveraging these data and support, we will launch a first-in-human Phase I clinical trial to test
the efficacy of the ALK vaccine in NSCLCs that have progressed after treatment with ALK TKIs. In this trial, the
safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the ALK vaccine will be tested in two cohorts of patients expressing either
HLA-A*0201 or HLA-B*0702 MHC-I molecules. The ALK vaccine will be added to ALK TKIs (cohort 1) or
administered together with an ICI (cohort 2) at the time of acquired TKI resistance. Circulating and intratumoral
immune responses to the ALK vaccine will be determined in treated patients. Potential mechanisms of escape
will be also studied in patients and mouse models. Finally, a discovery effort will allow the identification of ALK
peptides presented on additional MHC class I molecules to support a future design of a vaccine with broader
application to patients with different MHC-I molecules. Through this project we expect to develop the first cancer
vaccine to treat ALK-driven lung cancers that could be eventually use to treat any ALK-driven tumor."

SMARCA4-mutant NSCLC represents a prevalent, aggressive subset in urgent need of effective therapies.
SMARCA4 encodes BRG1, a key ATPase subunit of the SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF)
chromatin remodeling complex. SMARCA4 mutations are present in 9-11% of patients with NSCLC, with
truncating, BRG1-inactivating mutations comprising greater than one-third of these alterations. Thus, SMARCA4
is one of the most frequently mutated genes in NSCLC that has no targeted treatment option. SMARCA4
mutations often overlap with molecular alterations (KEAP1 and STK11 mutations) that decrease sensitivity to
traditional therapeutic approaches such as immunotherapy and chemotherapy. In a recent study from the Kim
laboratory, BRG1 deficiency increased DNA replicative stress and enhanced sensitivity to ATR pathway
inhibition in preclinical lung cancer models. Ataxia telangectasia mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase is a
key regulator of cellular response to replication stress that activates the DNA damage checkpoint in response to
single strand DNA created during the resection of DNA double-strand breaks or due to defects in DNA replication.
Here, we will test the hypothesis that the underlying replication stress associated with BRG1 deficiency provides
a therapeutic opportunity for SMARCA4 mutant lung cancer; we will identify drug combinations effective with
ATR inhibition. We will build upon our discoveries by (Aim 1) comprehensively characterizing hallmarks of
replication stress and assessing immune system activation in NSCLC clinical specimens with SMARCA4
mutations, (Aim 2) evaluating sensitivity of SMARCA4-mutant NSCLCs to therapies targeting replication stress
defects, and (Aim 3) performing pre-clinical studies to assess the anti-tumor effects of ATR inhibition in
combination with anti-PD1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. We will leverage existing preclinical models of SMARCA4-
mutant, BRG1-deficient NSCLC generated in the Kim Lab (CRISPR-generated isogenic BRG1-deficient lines,
GEMM) and Hata Lab (BRG1-deficient patient-derived xenograft (PDX)), together with patient samples from Drs.
Dagogo-Jack and Cheng to evaluate the antitumor activity of rational combinations of candidate drugs to support
future development of clinical trials. Overall, the studies proposed in this grant aim to advance the care of patients
with SMARCA4-mutant NSCLC by exploring a novel, promising approach that exploits a unique vulnerability
induced by BRG1 deficiency. We envision that the work proposed in this study will inform clinical trials exploring
novel combination therapy approaches (ATR inhibition plus immunotherapy or gemcitabine) in patients with
BRG1-deficient NSCLC, potentially paving the way for future approvals."
10891399,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Genotype directed therapy is the standard of care for the significant proportion of advanced non-
small cell lung cancer patients whose tumors harbor a targetable genetic mutation within EGFR,
ALK, ROS1, BRAF, RET, MET, NTRK or HER2. Although this therapeutic approach is effective,
acquired drug resistance inevitably occurs. The current management strategy for acquired
resistance is to evaluate the mechanism of resistance with a biopsy to help guide subsequent
treatment. However, mechanisms of resistance can be heterogenous and not all patients’ tumors
harbor an actionable resistance mechanism. Moreover, even when a targetable mechanism of
resistance is identified and a subsequent therapy available, acquired resistance will develop
again. An alternative strategy is to intervene therapeutically prior to the clinical development of
acquired drug resistance by specifically targeting the residual drug tolerant persister (DTP) cells,
a small population of cells that remain after effective genotype directed therapies and ultimately
give rise to acquired resistance. There have been no clinical strategies developed against DTPs,
in part due to the lack of the biological and mechanistic understanding of this state.
In this project we will lay the foundation for clinical therapeutic strategies aimed at DTP cells by
uncovering factors that lead to formation of the DTP state and identifying targets that can kill DTP
cells. We will build on prior research from our group centered around the DTP state in EGFR-
mutant lung cancer showing: 1) YAP/TEAD activation results in transcriptional repression of the
pro-apoptotic protein BMF and thus limits EGFR inhibitor mediated apoptosis; 2) the DTP state
displays some features of cellular senescence and anti-apoptosis agents may be an effective
strategy; and 3) cancer-associated fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment can facilitate DTP
emergence and modulate the senescence phenotype of established DTPs. Building upon this
foundation, the experiments detailed in this project utilize a combination of innovative techniques
and a unique and large collection of patient-derived cancer and fibroblast models from
genomically-driven cancers to understand the vulnerabilities of the DTP state and design optimal
clinical approaches to combat these harbingers of drug resistance in patients."
10891692,"PROJECT SUMMARY: NEUROBEHAVIORAL CORE 3
We are proposing the creation of a research program entitled, “Increasing the therapeutic index of brain tumor
treatment through innovative FLASH radiotherapy (FLASH-RT), focused on translating a novel irradiation
modality rapidly into the clinic. The overall hypothesis to be tested is whether radiation delivered at ultra high
dose rates (compared to the much lower dose rates used in current clinical practice) can significantly
ameliorate normal tissue complications while maintaining acceptable if not improved tumor control. To test this
hypothesis, the program will deploy a comprehensive series of preclinical studies that will critically evaluate
tumor control, neurocognitive outcomes and resultant radiation injury to the brain following FLASH-RT and
conventional dose rate irradiation. Collectively, these studies will generate the requisite data sets required for
the rapid translation of the novel FLASH irradiation platform to the clinical scenario. Preclinical studies in mice
assessing orthotopic tumor control, cognition, neuronal and vascular structural plasticity, immune-modulation
and oxygen dependent mechanisms of radiation injury are coupled with a clinical trial in GBM dog patients to
inform the oncologists of the potential benefits of this potentially paradigm shifting technology. The objectives
of this program project will be facilitated by the activities conducted by the dosimetry/physics core (Core 2) and
the Neurobehavioral Core (Core 3).
The primary function of Core 3 will be to provide a uniform behavioral testing platform in which animals
irradiated at the other performance sites (CHUV, Stanford, Indiana) will be shipped to and tested at UCI. The
neurobehavioral core at UCI is able to accommodate the neurocognitive testing objectives required for animals
subjected to single fraction, and multifraction FLASH and conventional dose rate irradiation protocols as
described in Projects 1, 2 and 4. This will be accomplished through a unifying neurobehavioral testing
platform, designed to determine how specified irradiation protocols impact sensitive paradigms of learning,
memory and mood, multifaceted endpoints critical to therapeutic outcome.
Core 3 will be led by Dr. Chares Limoli, renowned expert in analyzing the impact of multiple radiation types,
paradigms and cancer treatment regimens on cognition, and operated by neurobiologist Munjal Acharya and
radiobiologist Janet Baulch. This team has more than 12 years of behavioral testing experience and has been
recognized for identifying some of the first stem cell, exosome, pharmacologic and genetic based strategies for
resolving cancer treatment-induced cognitive dysfunction. In sum, Core 3 will serve as an integrative hub to
ensure experimental consistency across Projects 1, 2 & 4. More broadly, Core 3 will provide a major service to
the radiation oncology research field by promoting the acquisition and dissemination of data relevant to a
potentially transformative branch of radiation oncology and cancer treatment in general."

 This K23 Career Development Award is designed to provide the training needed for the PI to achieve
her long-term career goal of conducting independent, programmatic intervention research in developmental
populations. The training will emphasize gaining expertise in higher-intensity, multi-method, within-subject data
collection and analysis. This award builds on the PI’s emerging experience in tic disorders and pediatric
behavioral interventions, and her ability to quickly learn and apply advanced statistical methods. The award will
extend the PI’s training through the following short-term training goals: 1) multi-method data collection and
integration (electronic momentary assessment [EMA], wearable devices, neurocognitive tasks), 2) leading and
designing pediatric clinical trials, 3) managing and analyzing large, multilevel datasets, and 4) career
development and contribution to the field. The PI has developed a training plan to accomplish these goals in
concert with her mentors, a team of leading experts in the fields of psychiatry and psychology, who will closely
monitor training through regular meetings. The highly structured training plan also includes a set of formal
coursework and workshops for each training goal to complement the hands-on experience the PI will gain from
leading the research project.
 The objective of this proposal is to comprehensively map symptom change across time and during a
behavioral intervention for youth with Persistent Tic Disorders (PTDs). PTDs affect approximately 1% of the
population, can cause significant disability, have high rates of comorbidity, and are associated with a four-fold
increase in suicide risk. Research has established that tic symptoms and their change over time are highly
idiographic. However, first-line, evidence-based, existing interventions are “one-size-fits-all,” and are only
effective for 60% of patients. The current study aims to use advanced statistical methods and a novel
theoretical framework to map the stability of tic patterns, along with systemic factors that relate to tic change
over time. Study hypotheses, based on the literature and preliminary data, are that a) tic change patterns will
be stable before intervention for all participants, b) disruption of stable patterns during the intervention phase
will be associated with treatment response, and c) this disruption will depend on the specific driver of tic
symptoms pre-intervention. N = 30 youth ages 12-17 with chronic tics will be recruited for the study. There will
be three study phases: 1) pre-intervention (4 weeks), 2) intervention (8 weeks), and 3) post-intervention (4
weeks). Before and between each phase, participants will complete 4 traditional assessments to assess
symptoms and treatment response. Throughout the 16 weeks of the study, we will collect EMA data focused
on factors relevant to tics (4x per day), physiological data from wearable devices (passive, continuous), and
neurocognitive task performance and tic video observation (1x per week). Results will inform efforts to develop
individualized interventions for individuals with PTDs to improve treatment outcomes."

The proposed work will develop a first-of-its-kind, transportable informatics tool, the Population Cancer
Assessment and Surveillance Engine (Pop-CASE), that integrates patient-level cancer registry data for a
population with granular community-level data in a standardized data model, while providing a user-friendly
query tool to facilitate quick searching by researchers and community outreach professionals. Broadening
access to these types of data for researchers and other stakeholders will advance the pace and breadth of
cancer disparities research and will catalyze action to reduce disparities.
Building on the work of an existing prototype and with ongoing input from a nationwide Steering Committee, we
aim to 1) build the Pop-CASE data base and computational layer using an extended set of community and
health system data sources and embedding additional calculation capabilities, 2) build a user-friendly interface
with export capabilities, and 3) develop an Implementation kit featuring a software container for creating
location-specific instances of Pop-CASE and an implementation guide.
These aims will be accomplished by first creating a relational data base in PostgreSQL with tables derived
from North American Association of Central Cancer Registry (NAACCR) standard record formats; U.S. Census
American Community Survey data; Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) data; small area estimates for
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) cancer screening, risk behavior, and comorbidity burden
measures; National Provider Index (NPI) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provider and facility location
information; historical “redlining” data reflecting discriminatory lending practices; and other sources as guided
by our Steering Committee. A computational layer with logic for age adjustment, distance calculations, and
calculation of common indices of disparity or disadvantage will be coded in Python. A user interface built in a
Javascript-based framework will enable specification of complex queries with output at various user-selected
geographic levels and options for report export—all with embedded capabilities for tiered access to small
number counts and patient-level data sets. A modern container framework will be used to develop a
“PopCASE-in-a-box” software container allowing other cancer centers or cancer registries with access to
patient-level registry data to create a secure, location-specific instance of Pop-CASE. In the final project year,
the University of Southern California (USC) project team members will use the PopCASE container to
implement a PopCASE instance based on Los Angeles County cancer registry data and known as “LA-CASE.”
PopCASE will provide a new tool for cancer control researchers, with place-contextualized cancer data at a
fine geographic scale. It can also provide the Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) professionals and
cancer center leaders working to curb cancer disparities at the local level with an unprecedentedly powerful
catchment area data tool."
10890252,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Excessive cell death contributes to tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease (AD), which are pathologically
characterized by the aberrant accumulation of the microtubule associated protein tau and its oligomerization into
neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). To identify therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative tauopathies such as
Alzheimer's disease, it is vital to elucidate molecular mechanisms controlling cellular response to proteotoxic
stress due to tau accumulation. We have examined how BCL-2 family member BOK, which chiefly appears
bound to the inositol-3-phosphate (IP3R) calcium transporter in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), induces
apoptosis in response to select ER stress stimuli. We found BOK mediates calcium transfer from ER to
mitochondria and is key to forming mitochondrial-ER contact sites (MERCs), also called mitochondrial ER-
associated membranes (MAMs). MAMs are central signaling hubs, mediating cell processes like calcium transfer
and metabolic homeostasis; many are regulated by BOK. Our objective is to directly address how BOK regulates
tau-induced cell death in neurons through specific MAM subsets, including the ion-MAM, which mediates calcium
transfer, and the phago-MAM, which is where autophagosomes are produced. Aim 1 will determine the role of
BOK in ion-MAM regulation of tauopathy by examining calcium levels and cell death in BOK deficient cortical
neurons challenged by mutant tau-induced ER stress. Aim 2 will determine the role of BOK in phago-MAM
regulation of tauopathy by analyzing the impact of BOK and MAM formation on autophagy in neurons challenged
by mutant tau. Aim 3 will determine the physiological consequences of loss of BOK on tauopathy-induced
neurodegeneration. This project is conceptually innovative in our recognition that BOK regulates MAMs, which
are altered in patients diagnosed with dementia. The project is technically innovative in our use of 2Phatal, two-
photon chemical apoptotic targeted ablation, to study cell death in tauopathies. This technique uses a
femtosecond-pulsed laser to induce dose-dependent apoptosis of individual cells in mouse brains in vivo without
collateral damage. Our hypothesis is that BOK's ability to impact ER-stress induced apoptosis, calcium
regulation, and MAM formation suggests a critical but undefined role in the production of autophagic membranes
and the regulation of neuronal cell death in tauopathy-induced neurodegeneration. This project will elucidate the
metabolic pathways regulated by BOK to reveal potential mechanisms to prevent tau-mediated death of neurons,
providing targets for therapeutic development. This proposal is submitted in response to PAR-23-179, Small
Research Grant Program for the Next Generation of Researchers in AD/ADRD Research (R03 Clinical Trial
Optional). The proposed project leverages the Principal Investigator's prior discoveries and expertise on the
multi-domain, pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family member BOK to examine a novel role in autophagy failure and cell
death as it relates to AD and other tauopathies."
10890261,"The escalating incidence of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) places a tremendous
economic burden on society and families across the globe. To date, medical approaches for preventing and
treating AD/ADRD have yielded limited success. Preventive strategies, such as physical activity, hold promise
for sustaining cognition and thus reducing AD/ADRD risks in older adults. However, this literature has focused
exclusively on the effects of the total amount of time or volume of higher-intensity physical activity (or exercise)
on cognitive health. Beyond the total volume amount performed, older adults accumulate their physical activity
through irregular lifestyle activity bouts (e.g., intermittent short periods of walking activities) throughout the day.
How these lifestyle activity bouts are accumulated and allocated from day-to-day may represent a scalable and
relatively more achievable behavioral target that may generate cognitive benefits. When older adults’ cognition
is sustained on a daily basis without drastic variations over time, their risks for developing AD/ADRD can be
reduced as a result. Thus, the proposed study is designed to bridge the knowledge gap by determining
whether the distribution of lifestyle physical activity bouts is associated with the mean level and the variability in
older adults’ daily cognitive function. This study will leverage mobile technology to collect data on daily physical
activity bouts and daily cognitive function using a research-grade accelerometer and validated cognitive
assessment smartphone app. To achieve our study objectives, we will recruit older adults who have higher
risks for developing AD/ADRD and will repeatedly measure their daily physical activity bouts and performance-
based cognitive function. A total of 84 high-risk older adults (ages 60+, 40% African American or other races
besides White/Non-Hispanic) will be recruited from the local community. Eligible participants will wear the
lightweight activPAL accelerometer for 21 days to capture the distribution of their daily bouts of physical
activity. During the same 21-day period, they will also complete up to five ultra-brief cognitive tests delivered by
the NIH-funded M2C2 app during waking time each day. We will apply intensive longitudinal data analysis via
an NIH-funded statistical program to answer our research questions. This study will determine if specific
distributions of lifestyle physical activity bouts represent a promising behavioral target that can be engaged in
future efficacy trials for sustaining cognitive health in everyday life. Findings will also provide an evidence-
based foundation for advancing ADRD preventive science to reduce AD/ADRD risks or slowing down the
pathological process during the long pre-clinical AD/ADRD phase."

N-nitrosamines include some of the most mutagenic chemicals known to humankind, and they are present at
and near Superfund Sites, in drinking water, and in food and drugs. What is needed are new methods to detect
N-nitrosamines in water that can be used to enable distributed sensing. A major limitation in informing risk of
exposure is the fact that N-nitrosamine detection requires sophisticated laboratory equipment in centralized
locations. These methods, although highly accurate, are expensive and require trained technical staff. The goal
of this project is to create materials and methods that are sufficiently inexpensive to be performed routinely by
individuals without the need for detailed technical training. Specific Aim 1 is to create and deploy porous
absorptive polymer films and particles with recognition elements specific for N-nitrosamines.
Recognition containing solid phase extraction materials can be used to concentrate N-nitrosamines from water.
Under conditions where N-nitrosamines are detected, Project 3 then contributes to the identification of which N-
nitrosamines are present, to be done via conventional centralized laboratory determinations (to be developed by
Project 4). Knowing which N-nitrosamines are present will guide studies of biological impact to be done by Project
1 and Project 2. Specific Aim 2 is to create and apply a novel NDMA optical sensor that exploits NDMA
fragmentation products. The solid phase extraction materials also serve as a platform for field-deployed
sensing systems. The detection mechanisms make use of photolytic breakdown of N-nitrosamines that can be
conducted in solution or directly in solid phase extraction materials. Reactive species generated by photolysis
allow for detection by additional reactions to organic aromatic molecules that can be used to create new emissive
species or highly colored materials. Additionally, reactive species generated photolytically can be used to create
chemiluminescence. Specific Aim 3 is to create a field-deployable device effective for use by community
members to perform Citizen Science. The new optical based sensing methods given will be evaluated for
sensitivity, accuracy, resistance to interfering species, and the ability to be translated to methods appropriate for
use by community members. Providing sensing methods will be facilitated by leveraging smartphone cameras
as detectors. Smartphone methods can be used in both colorimetric and emissive detection methods. With
support from the CEC, empowering communities to frequently detect N-nitrosamines in their environment and
water supplies will help to create a more comprehensive understanding of risk and how seasons, weather, and
human interventions impact the exposure risks. Trainees will drive the research and will be supported by the
Research Experience and Training Coordination Core, and research translation will be fostered by the
Administrative Core. Results on which N-nitrosamines are present will be combined by the Data Management
and Analysis Core with new understanding of biological impact to contribute to our comprehension of risk for
specific water samples."

N-nitroso (-N-N=O) compounds include some of the most powerful chemical mutagens known and encompass
a family of chemicals with hundreds of different structures. However, only a handful of N-nitrosamines are
routinely measured via EPA Standard Methods, and these methods are not effective at the low levels anticipated
to cause health impacts. To overcome this challenge and reduce human exposure, Project 4 seeks to measure
and destroy a suite of N-nitrosamines at the point of use in homes, where they are needed most to protect public
health and the environment. First, Specific Aim 1 is to develop methods to detect a suite of established and
novel N-nitrosamines using multi-dimensional gas chromatography paired with both mass spectrometry (for
identification) and flame ionization detection (for quantification with authentic standards or via an effective carbon
number concept when authentic standards can be neither synthesized nor purchased). This technique enables
estimation of nearly a dozen critical environmental parameters, such that novel molecules detected in complex
mixtures will have at-the-ready physicochemical metrics to feed environmental fate models and predict exposure.
Water samples will be collected in collaboration with the Community Engagement Core using traditional
collection methods as well as novel Recognition-Solid Phase Extraction (R-SPEs) materials that concentrate N-
nitrosamines (to be developed in Project 3), and fractions of extracts will be provided to Project 2 for mutagenicity
assessment. Knowledge about the levels of NDMA will inform Project 1 so that environmentally relevant levels
can be studied for their biological impacts using novel genetically engineered mice that are sensitized to NDMA.
In addition, the Data Management and Analysis Core will integrate data for “what” and “how much” with data on
biological impact to inform risk. Armed with knowledge of environmental levels of N-nitrosamines, Specific Aim
2 is to develop novel in-home water filtration technologies based on electrochemical processes and
molecular recognition with enzymatic destruction. The latter relies on genetically engineered microbes that
act as non-living scaffolds for enzymes; as such, it overcomes many classical challenges faced by bioreactors
and opens up vast possibilities to leverage advances in biotechnology for long-awaited revolutions in water
treatment. Specific Aim 3 will test the degradation products to ensure that they are no longer genotoxic
by collaborating with Project 1 to use “Chem-Sense” cells that act as animate detectors of DNA damage.
Trainees will drive the research and will be supported by the Research Experience and Training Coordination
Core to ensure optimal professional development. In addition, Project 4 will benefit from activities organized by
the Administrative Core that ensure close collaborations with other Projects and with the Cores, as well as
opportunities for research translation to stakeholders, including people living near the Olin Chemical Superfund

ensure that MIT SRP data are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). Specific Aim 2 is to
foster cross-disciplinary collaboration and data integration among Projects and Cores and to share best practices
for a broader impact. Specific Aim 3 is to leverage computational modeling techniques in order to reveal
mechanistic understanding of disease and provide important information about risk. Importantly, the major
goals of the MIT SRP are made possible by a Systems Approach of interactions and interdependencies
among all Projects and Cores. The DMAC is essential to the Systems Approach, because it unifies the team
to focus on data and results from all components, so that effective collaboration is fostered. Constant updating
also provides agility, since researchers can embrace collaborative opportunities as they arise in real time.
Importantly, the DMAC also brings advanced computational modeling techniques so that data streams can be
merged across the program. Integrating knowledge of what, where, and how much N-nitrosamines are in water
with new knowledge of their biological effects will contribute to the understanding of risk and enable prevention
strategies. All research is made possible by Trainees, and their success rests on the Research Translation and

create innovative, hands-on learning experiences that teach key concepts of biology and environmental
health sciences. Working with the tribal educators (Culture Keepers), the MIT team will co-create and distribute
hands-on experiential learning kits to teach key concepts of biology and environmental health to Tribal Youth.
The CEC will also work with high-school teachers in Wilmington to optimize hands-on teaching experiences for
Wilmington high-school teachers to share knowledge related to the research focus of the MIT SRP Projects 1

teaching experiences to underrepresented minority (URM) individuals to inspire careers in environmental health.
Specific Aim 2 is to intervene and prevent disease by working with all Projects to empower stakeholders
to reduce the levels and toxicity of hazardous substances. The CEC will partner with community
stakeholders to better communicate with organizations that can help to provide cleaner water, including the EPA.
In addition, to reduce the levels of toxicants, the CEC (with support from the Environmental Science and

nitrosamines will be collected by the CEC in collaboration with community members via a Citizen Science project.
Data on the levels of N-nitrosamines will be integrated with data from the other Projects and Cores to contribute
to risk evaluation. The CEC will also help to deploy a novel filtration device that destroys N-nitrosamines. By
empowering people with knowledge of what is in their water and by offering filtration devices, the CEC will reduce
the amount and toxicity of hazardous chemicals in drinking water."
10868682,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – RESEARCH EXPERIENCE AND TRAINING COORDINATION CORE
N-Nitrosamines are a family of chemicals that include some of the most potent mutagens known. N-Nitrosamines
are a major concern for people who live near the Olin Chemical Superfund Site, and they are also a concern of
the Passamaquoddy Tribe, because the water treatment methods used for their drinking water are known to lead
to formation of N-nitrosamines. The mission of the Research Experience and Training Coordination Core
(RETCC) is to recruit, train, and engage the best and the brightest students for careers in Biomedical Research
(BMR) and Environmental Science and Engineering (ESE) with a focus on public health. With support from the
RETCC, trainees will participate in all of the proposed research, engagement, and translation activities, and they
will contribute data to and benefit from the Data Management and Analysis Core (DMAC). As such, trainees fuel
the entire MIT SRP program. By fostering and enabling interactions among trainees and between trainees and
leaders, the RETCC supports an innovative Systems Approach of inter-dependencies among subsystems
(Projects and Cores). Via a Systems Approach, all trainees impact and are impacted by all of the Projects and
Cores via a network of connections that are fostered by the Administrative Core and the DMAC. Data generated
by trainees will be managed by the Data Management and Analysis Core and will be integrated with data from
other parts of the program to contribute to risk evaluation. Innovative aspects of the RETCC include cross-
disciplinary research opportunities, training in how research can be leveraged to impact policy, and a new “MIT
SRP Exploration Program” that enables trainees to spend time in other MIT laboratories. In addition, there will
be several approaches to support pipeline development so as to increase the number of top students with diverse
backgrounds and expertise pursuing careers in environmental health sciences and engineering. This work will
include creating an MIT undergraduate research opportunity that focuses on SRP research, a new “Public Health
Democratization” Pipeline Project to connect URM SRP Trainees with younger URM students. Specific Aim 1
is to provide opportunities to trainees for research, translation, community engagement, and data
analysis that will help protect human health from hazardous chemicals. Specific Aim 2 is to strengthen
and create programs to promote professional development. Specific Aim 3 is to recruit and promote
diverse students and postdocs. Specific Aim 4 is to provide formal training to ensure that MIT SRP
trainees have successful and responsible careers in biomedical research and environmental science
and engineering. The Administrative Core will foster opportunities for trainees to participate in research
translation, which includes interactions with stakeholders. Furthermore, the Community Engagement Core (CEC)
will open doors for trainees to work with community members, including helping to deploy sensors and a filtration
device that will destroy N-nitrosamines. Taken together, the RETCC provides the foundation upon which trainees
thrive and enables the collective impact of the entire program."
10870218,"PROMOTING CENTER EXPERTISE – PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Successful engagement of translational researchers depends on how well we understand our NM4R community,
adapt to their needs, and disseminate discoveries. Partnerships developed through open, bidirectional
communication across a diverse cadre of stakeholders who appreciate and value different perspectives,
expertise, and experiences are needed to solve complex problems. Keys to success include working vigilantly
to understand those needs, communicating effectively, rigorously assessing performance, continually improving
quality and delivery, and promptly promoting new discoveries and unique resources available through the NC
NM4R. These are strengths that define the NC NM4R’s Promoting Center Expertise (PCE) component. PCE
leadership, along with the Executive Committee, leverage these strengths to maximize participation in our center
and, most importantly, ensure our work is responsive to the priorities set forth in the NIH Research Plan for
Rehabilitation (RPR). Thus, the PCE component is our key piece to promote and disseminate NM4R science
and research resources for maximal impact on the field. These efforts assure that the NC NM4R has a positive,
significant, and lasting impact on NM4R research. PCE employs a proactive, multifaceted approach with two
Specific Aims. AIM 1. Increase NM4R research workforce breadth and numbers through strategic
outreach, communication, engagement and collaboration (Promotion). We promote our expertise and
programs through a strategic outreach program tailored to NM4R researchers and researchers in adjacent fields.
Substantial effort supports identifying a diverse pool of potential candidates for outreach. We actively seek to
increase gender/racial/ethnic diversity and the diversity of focus areas within rehabilitation. Outreach occurs
through an active presence with interactive booth displays at national forums where rehabilitation science is
catalyzed, promoted, and sustained, as well as through a vibrant interactive web portal. Advanced symposia
focused on developments in the field of NM4R and support for Special Interests Groups (SIGs) will help engage
a vibrant and active NM4R community. AIM 2. Ensuring novice and experienced NM4R investigators are
exposed to impactful tools and research (Dissemination). In this aim we focus on maintaining a vibrant web
portal to disseminate information, techniques and research throughout the community engaged through the
previous aim of center promotion. The web portal serves as our primary avenue for this dissemination throughout
the community, as we will disseminate original content such as live-streaming webinars electronically captured
for subsequent archiving and barrier-free access, in addition to special-topics symposia. The portal will not only
expose the NC NM4R to investigators in the USA, but anyone with internet connection in the international
community will be able to access our educational content (but services will be limited to US investigators)."
10870219,"ADMINISTRATIVE OVERSIGHT – PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The overall goal of the Administrative Oversight component (Admin Oversight) is to coordinate the
development and high impact functioning of a national center (NC) at the Medical University of South Carolina
(MUSC) to support researchers in the field of neuromodulation for rehabilitation (NM4R). In order for the NC
NM4R to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the field of NM4R, we oversee numerous individual component
functions to ensure a cohesive program that aligns with the needs of the research community and actively
contributes to the coalescing of research priorities. The PD/PI leads Admin Oversight and manages all necessary
functions with input and assistance from the Executive Committee who have diverse expertise and experience
in NM4R, and the External Advisory Board (comprised of 5 eminent scientists who represent the broad NM4R
research community and provide objective oversight, evaluation, and strategic interactions to optimize the
Center’s impact). Admin Oversight integrates diverse visionary leadership, sound operations and fiscal
management, coordination with NCMRR program staff and Network centers, and a multifaceted evaluation plan
to ensure NC NM4R success. Our work is organized under these Specific Aims:
AIM 1. Leadership and Oversight. The Executive Committee (EC) provides balanced leadership, program
integration, oversight and accountability for all NC NM4R programs, services, and interactions.
AIM 2. Strategic Planning and Collaboration. Our guiding principle is that the center must impact the NIH
Research Plan for Rehabilitation (RPR) priorities. Thus, the organizing structure and operational plan serve to
ensure this impact – from decision-making processes that require explicit mapping of investments to RPR
priorities, to a robust evaluation program that ensures responsiveness to the rehabilitation research community.
AIM 3. Operations and Fiscal Management, The PD/PI oversees an administrative infrastructure that ensures
efficient implementation of Executive Committee decisions, sound fiscal management, and compliance with
federal and local regulations.
AIM 4. Program Evaluation. The Evaluation Director is responsible for developing an integrated, long-term
evaluation plan to ensure quality control of programs and continual improvement responsive to research
community needs as well as document the impact of the NC NM4R on the research community.
AIM 5. Prioritizing Investigator/Collaboration Opportunities and Pilot Study Funding. This aim defines the
framework for acceptance for workshops, advanced hands-on training programs and consultative services. The
EC also prioritizes individual pilot studies for funding. In each of these functions, the EC acts like an NIH Council,
setting priorities based on the results of a first-level merit review by a separate review group and strategic criteria.
AIM 6. Diversity Planning. The Executive Committee is responsible for approving diversity recruitment and
retention strategies to be operationalized by the Program Manager under the PD/PI’s oversight."
10870221,"NETWORK COORDINATING CENTER – PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The Medical Rehabilitation Research Resource Network (Network) is NCMRR’s main vehicle for supporting
rehabilitation research infrastructure. Thus, the proposed goal of the Coordinating Center (CC) at the National
Center of Neuromodulation for Rehabilitation (NC NM4R) is to maximize Network potential by catalyzing
activities to promote cross-center and multi-stakeholder communications, support central web portal and
directory services, ensure strategic network-wide activities to increase impact on rehabilitation research and
support NCMRR with central data collection and outcomes analyses. CC will build upon extensive infrastructure
and decades of MUSC experience in informatics, team science, distance learning, event management, and
communications to create a coordinating center that is responsive to current Network. We will implement both
traditional and innovative approaches to make rehabilitation research highly visible; empower scientific teams
and the Network to impact RPR priorities; and connect active stakeholders. We will do so via the following
Specific Aims. AIM 1. Develop a Network web portal. There is a need for a central Network web portal to
provide a unified point of entry, and central catalogue, for rehabilitation researchers to access Network resources
versus the current environment where researchers must navigate to each center’s website to find applicable
resources. We envision an entry point that would allow a user to more easily see offerings across centers (e.g.,
unified directory of core resources, unified calendar of training events, unified list of funding opportunities, etc.).
AIM 2. Coordinate trans-center activities. We will develop a dynamic ecosystem to support effective, efficient
and coordinated communications across the Network and to external stakeholders. AIM 3. Foster development
of collaborative strategies to support Network impact on RPR. We propose a number of innovative strategy
and communications opportunities aimed at optimizing network impact such as: 1) Face-to-Face Strategic
Retreats: These one- or two-day meetings would convene key center leadership members and be dedicated to
identifying multicenter and network wide strategies to advance the network’s impact on RPR priorities. 2) Annual
Network RPR Priority Conference. 3) Network hosted Webinars to accompany Rehabilitation Research-related
FOA’s. We propose developing Network-wide webinars in response to FOAs/RFAs of particular relevance to
rehabilitation researchers. AIM 4. Document, synthesize, and analyze infrastructure outcomes and impact.
To document the incredible work happening across the network and help tell the story that the Network is greater
than the sum of its parts, experienced evaluation and data collection services are needed. The CC has
demonstrated expertise in large-scale multi-center evaluation. We propose to provide Network data coordination
services to collect, analyze, and transform data into actionable insights to accelerate the impact of Network
infrastructure and components."
10879027,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of the proposed study is to develop novel cognitive and neuroimaging markers to detect subtle
cognitive and neural changes in association with beta-amyloid (Aβ) deposition and tau-protein neurofibrillary
tangles (NFT), pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), among clinically intact older adults. Recent
advances in in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) have significantly increased our awareness of the
presence of Aβ plaques in approximately 20-50% of cognitively normal older adults who are now considered
as preclinical AD. Differentiating healthy older adults from those who are in the preclinical stage of AD,
however, remains to be challenging, in part because behavioral and neural measures that are sensitive and
specific to detect the presence of Aβ plaques in the stage of preclinical AD are largely lacking. Furthermore,
the co-presence of NFT pathology in these individuals makes it difficult to link AD pathologies to specific
cognitive function. Identifying how brain aging and AD pathology affect cognition and the underlying neural
systems would offer more sophisticated behavioral phenotypes and neural markers with clinical utility in aiding
early diagnosis and treatment monitoring that otherwise may remain undetected with traditional
neuropsychological tests. We will recruit 50 healthy young adults and 125 cognitively normal elderly who will
undergo cognitive experimental, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological assessments. Aim 1 will test the
hypothesis that Aβ deposition and NFTs in cognitively normal elderly will differentially impact a set of cognitive
component tasks that disproportionately tax frontoparietal and medial temporal lobe functions. Aim 2 will test
that Aβ deposition and NFTs differentially affect brain activation and connectivity patterns measured by
structural and functional MRI during cognitive tasks that use a gradient degree of frontoparietal and medial
temporal lobe function. Aim 3 will compare the sensitivity and specificity in detecting the effect of Aβ deposition
and NFTs on cognition between cognitive component tasks and traditional neuropsychological assessments. A
successful completion of the aims will elucidate the mechanistic link between AD pathologies and cognitive
consequences in the early stage of the disease and contribute to novel behavioral and neuroimaging markers
of early AD. The developed cognitive task battery has a potential to be developed as a screening test for the
presence of AD pathologies in a non-invasive, more accessible, and more affordable manner for clinically
intact older adults."
10879140,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The COVID-19 pandemic took lives of more than 2.5 million people globally including more than 500 thousand in the
United States in one year. Many deaths occurred after rapid health deterioration, shortly after symptoms of the disease were
manifested. Clinical evidence collected from patients with severe disease indicates that this deterioration occurred because
of the cytokine storm and resulting activation of the coagulation system, leading to uncontrolled thrombotic events in
pulmonary microvasculature and throughout the body. Similar to COVID-19, severe complications of other infectious
diseases are known to be associated with coagulation abnormalities causing disseminated intravascular coagulation, venous
thromboembolism, arterial thrombosis, or ischemic stroke. High levels of D-dimer, the test for hyperactive coagulation
system, were found to be correlated with high mortality in patients with infectious disease including COVID-19. Many of
these patients could be saved if they were properly and timely treated based on infectious disease risk assessment. However,
tests that effectively predict the severity of infectious diseases are not available yet.
 The objective of this proposal is to develop a drop-of-blood test for rapid point-of-care assessment of infectious disease
severity, based on integrated quasi-static acoustic tweezing thromboelastometry (i-QATT). In this unique approach,
comprehensive coagulation analysis is done without inducing blood sample contact with artificial surfaces and by using a
single drop of blood, which volume (4-6 microliters) is nearly 100 times less the minimal sample volume currently required
for coagulation tests. For rapid assessment of infectious disease risk inside a hospital or under outpatient settings, we propose
to use this method on venous blood samples or finger prick capillary blood samples. We hypothesize that 1) i-QATT
capillary blood analysis can detect coagulation abnormalities, 2) severe complications from infectious diseases develop due
to cytokine storm-induced activation of the coagulation system, and 3) severity of infectious diseases can be assessed from
blood coagulation analysis. The technology development for infectious disease severity assessment and testing the above
hypotheses will be achieved via the following specific aims: 1) establish and standardize the acoustic tweezing technology
for coagulation measurements of capillary blood, 2) assess changes in the coagulation system induced by cytokine storm
via drop-of-blood measurements, and 3) test the feasibility of drop-of-blood acoustic tweezing technology for infectious
disease severity assessment."
10879065,"Abstract
Blood vessels play a critical role in the circulatory system. The main function of blood vessels is transporting
blood from the heart to the rest of the tissues and organs throughout the body and then bringing it back to the
heart. The structures of blood vessels are crucial to their physiological functions. The intima consists of
endothelial cells, which are intertwined with a polysaccharide intercellular matrix to form the lumen for blood
transportation. In straight sections of a blood vessel, endothelial cells (ECs) typically align and elongate in the
direction of blood flow. The media is the middle layer in the vessels, where the elastic fibers, polysaccharides,
and vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are mainly located. In particular, the circumferentially aligned SMCs
in ring-like patterns control the constriction/dilation of the vessels, enabling modulation of hemodynamics.
Tissue engineering has provided a promising strategy to repair and replace portions of tissues, where blood
vessels are one of the most important yet challenging tissue to engineer. However, engineered blood vessels
using conventional strategies based on scaffolds are usually produced using relatively sophisticated
microfabrication procedures, and cannot be easily applied to vessels with complex architectures and/or small
sizes. In comparison, the recent advances in the three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting technology have provided
unprecedented flexibility in engineering blood vessels with high resolution, strong fidelity, and good complexity.
Nevertheless, 3D bioprinting of structurally stable and functional vascular tissues has rarely been achieved. To
this end, we propose to develop a unique bioprinting strategy, combining the digitally tunable microfluidic
hollow fiber bioprinting method and the stretchable hydrogel-based bioink formulations, to generate
structurally, mechanically, and functionally biomimetic non-branching macrovascular grafts of various sizes,
shapes, and structures to significantly facilitate vascular transplantation."
10879066,"Project Summary:
Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) has a high mortality rate (~60%), with a large proportion of the
survivors becoming functionally dependent. aSAH survivors have long term cognitive deficits and memory
impairment in their productive years with major responsibilities with respect to work and family.
In a 30-year nationwide population-based cohort study using data from Danish medical databases, the authors
computed the absolute risks and hazard ratios (HR) of dementia up to 30 years after stroke. Compared with
the general population, the HR (95% confidence interval) for dementia among ischemic stroke survivors was
1.72 (1.66–1.77), 2.70 (2.53–2.89) after intracerebral hemorrhage, and 2.74 (2.45–3.06) after aSAH.
Why is that?? In aSAH subjects, accumulation of hemoglobulin (Hb) and non-heme iron (Fe) which are the
natural byproduct lysis of red blood cells leads to significant neuronal cells death. Several preclinical studies in
animals showed that both products lead to neuronal death and atrophy of any brain structures exposed to it
and specifically the hippocampus and amygdala. These data were replicated in human, where authors found,
the level of ferritin (Ft) in CSF, a reporter of the amount of Fe in brain, was found to strongly correlate with
progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD).
What is the mechanistic pathway of this process?? Our group showed that Hb is toxic to neuronal cells in
vitro and adding deferiprone (De) attenuated and reversed this effect significantly. We then confirmed these
results in a mouse model of intraventricular hemorrhage. Additionally, in a proof-of-concept study we showed
that De significantly decreased Ft in CSF (p<0.0001) suggesting a potential therapeutic effect. Furthermore,
others also showed in preclinical studies using different animal models, Fe chelating agents decrease Fe
content both in the subarachnoid space and intraventricular improving the functional and cognitive outcome in
these animals. Therefore, we propose this grant to test the hypothesis that deferiprone, a lipid soluble Fe
chelating agent and therefore diffuse easily across the blood-brain barrier, will significantly decrease Ft (a
reporter of total non-heme Fe content in CSF) in subjects with aSAH and hence improve cognitive function.
To test this hypothesis, we propose a phase 1/2a single-center randomized double-blinded placebo vs. De trial
that recruits and enrolls 66 subjects with aSAH who require placement of EVD as a standard of care. Subjects
will be randomized equally into 2 groups: A) placebo & B) 15 mg/kg bid for 21 days. Ft will be collected daily
from CSF. We will also test the cognitive changes using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment test along with a
battery of well-standardized and widely used cognitive tests that measure various aspects of cognitive and
behavioral functioning. We will also assess the volume of hippocampus and amygdala in this cohort and
compare them to a matched, historic control cohort using specific MRI protocol. These tests will be correlated
with the Ft content in CSF and the volume of hippocampus and amygdala on imaging studies obtained."
10879071,"Project Summary and Abstract
Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms of postural instability and gait disorder (PIGD) cause profound
disability and are inadequately treated by current therapies. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the
subthalamic nucleus (STN) and Globus Pallidus (GP) is effective for PIGD, but not nearly as much as
for other PD symptoms e.g. bradykinesia and rigidity. Standard DBS optimization relies on assessing
changes in symptoms each time stimulation changes, a very time consuming process. PIGD changes
slowly in response to changes in stimulation. Hence, DBS is normally optimized to quicker-
responding symptoms, which may be why DBS works better for symptoms other than PIGD. The goal
of DBS optimization is to affect neural target structures which best ameliorate symptoms. Different
target structures may ameliorate different symptoms. While bradykinesia and rigidity are thought to
respond to stimulation of the subthalamopallidal projection, PIGD is thought to involve other
structures, especially pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN). PPN afferents and efferents, passing through
or near STN & GP may therefore be more effective stimulation targets for PIGD.
New directional DBS electrodes, coupled with high field strength MRI imaging and patient-specific
computational models, now enable more selective targeting of these pathways. We hypothesize that
targeting the ascending PPN efferent pathway will increase the effectiveness of DBS on PIGD,
whereas targeting the descending pallidofugal pathway, by inhibiting PPN, will decrease its
effectiveness for PIGD.
We will compare effects on gait, postural instability, bradykinesia, and rigidity, of DBS
targeting pedunculopallidal and pallidopeduncular pathways, directly, as well as subthalamopallidal
pathway directly, pallidosubthalamic pathway directly, and pallidopeduncular pathway
indirectly (by targeting inhibitory afferents to GP pars interna GPi). Preoperative 7 Tesla
structural and diffusion-weighted MRI scans and postoperative high-resolution CT scans will
determine electrode location and orientation, relative to nuclei and fiber tracts. Patient-specific
models from these imaging datasets will estimate percent activation of each fiber tract, and a
novel particle swarm optimization will design stimulation settings maximizing the difference in
activation between pathways being compared. Aims 1 (STN) & 2 (GP) compare settings in a single-
session, within-subjects experimental design. Aim 3 compares settings with much longer wash- in/
out intervals, and will also collect data between laboratory testing sessions using measures of
functional status and quality of life. This project will comprehensively investigate how DBS can
be tailored on a patient-specific basis to treat disabling symptoms of PIGD."

Nucleic acid aptamers (aptamers) have been used as therapeutic agents or delivery ligands for various
biomedical applications such as regenerative medicine, cancer therapy, molecular biosensing, cell delivery,
detoxification, anti-inflammation, anti-coagulation, etc. However, the success of these applications largely
depends on the discovery and delivery of high-affinity and high-specificity aptamers, which remains challenging
today. Therefore, the objective of this project is to study an innovative method for aptamer selection and
truncation, and to further examine the efficiency of in vivo aptamer delivery in regulating inflammation. We will
work on four specific aims to achieve the objective. In the first three aims, we will focus on aptamer selection
and truncation. Notably, while these three aims are related to one another, the proposed research activities in
these aims can be conducted independently. After the selection and truncation of high-quality aptamers, we will
examine microneedle-mediated aptamer delivery for local, defined treatment of inflammation using an animal
model. The success of this project will not only lead to the development of a technological platform for
therapeutic aptamer discovery, but also pave a new way of fighting against inflammatory cytokines in the
treatment of complicated immune disorders."

Hallmark pathologic processes of diabetic retinopathy (DR) include neural and glial dysfunction, recruitment of
inflammatory cells, endothelial dysfunction, vascular occlusion, and loss of the blood retinal barrier.
Inflammasomes are innate immune signaling platforms implicated in acute responses to foreign pathogens as
well as numerous chronic neurodegenerative- and inflammatory-related diseases. Inflammasome blockade is
being explored for multiple complex neurovascular conditions including Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis,
age-related macular degeneration, and rheumatoid arthritis. Clinical and preclinical evidence suggest that
inflammasome activity may also contribute to pathological hallmarks of DR by promoting production of
inflammatory cytokines, leukostasis, and loss of microvascular integrity. Despite this evidence, major gaps in
knowledge persist with respect to the timing, cellular sources, and pathological implications of inflammasome
activation in the context of diabetic retinopathy. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that NLRP3
inflammasome activation in circulating immune cells and resident neuroglia drives neuronal and microvascular
dysfunction in diabetic retinopathy. We will test this hypothesis in three specific aims: 1) We seek to identify cell
types that exhibit inflammasome activation and the timing thereof in an animal model of type 1 diabetes; 2) We
seek to determine the contribution of core inflammasome constituents to hallmark pathological phenotypes in
animal models of retinal pathologies due to diabetes. To accomplish this, we will utilize global and cell-specific
genetic knockouts of inflammasome constituents in models of diabetes; 3) We seek to test the efficacy of
pharmacological inflammasome inhibitors in preclinical models of neural, immune, and vascular defects due to
diabetes. Collectively, these thematically related, but independent aims will establish the contribution of
inflammasome in pathological processes of diabetes in the retina. These studies may thereby open new
interventional avenues for this prevalent blinding condition."
10867634,"Mental health among young adults represents a public health crisis, requiring more efficient and precise means
of understanding illness trajectories in the general population. Such models could provide opportunities for
early identification and intervention for mental illness during the period of adolescence to young adulthood, as
youth navigate key psychosocial milestones and neuropsychiatric illness becomes entrenched. Work by the
investigators and others has demonstrated the utility of electronic health records (EHR) for developing risk
stratification models for psychiatric outcomes. Yet, the investigators and others have also shown that the
diagnostic codes available in EHR are insufficient to reliably predict the evolution of psychopathology over
time. As such, RFA MH-23-105 seeks strategies to augment EHR-based models to efficiently capture
signatures that may improve clinical prediction. Among the broad range of potential measures, brief batteries
that capture dimensional traits, including quantitative symptoms and cognition, are at the core of evidence-
based, developmentally relevant psychopathology frameworks and are consistent with the consensus that
clinical staging must be approached through a transdiagnostic lens. Variation in such traits is not well-captured
by standard EHR data but represents an important aspect of neurodevelopment and its relationship to clinical
and functional outcomes. This study proposes to integrate remotely-delivered cognitive tasks and brief
symptom inventories to enhance prediction of prospective outcomes among transition age youth. Specifically, it
will apply methods developed by the investigators to a cohort of N= 10,000 individuals age 18-20 identified
from EHR in the Mass General Brigham Health Care system and assessed prospectively every 6 months for 2
years. Aim 1 will identify, enroll, and retrospectively characterize this cohort, extending EHR codes with
validated NLP methods to characterize dimensional psychiatric symptoms and cognitive functioning
retrospectively for up to 10 years, using data censored 6 or 24 months prior to baseline to predict current
status. Aim 2 will collect enhanced phenotyping (neurocognitive and self-report psychiatric and psychosocial
functioning data) on this cohort every 6 months and apply both standard and novel interpretable machine
learning methods to derive predictors of 180-day psychiatric outcomes. Aim 3 will apply interpretable machine
learning methods to determine the value of enhanced phenotyping over EHR data alone for 24-month
outcomes . We hypothesize that adding these low cost, low burden phenotypes will improve the performance
of models predicting longitudinal neuropsychiatric outcomes in a manner that can be translated across health
care systems with diverse populations."

The olfactory system encodes and analyzes odorants. Chemicals bind to members of large families of receptor
proteins tuned to different chemical features. While we have a comprehensive inventory of the receptor genes
that underlie olfactory detection, we are far from having a similarly comprehensive understanding of the
chemical features detected by olfactory systems.
 This proposal leverages four developments—the ability to record the output of an entire olfactory
system (the vomeronasal system), a large and structurally-rigid class of odorants (sulfated, carboxylated, and
glucuronidated steroids), a new tool to identify the receptor gene(s) that have particular ligand detection
profiles, and a new tool for ectopically expressing a chosen receptor gene and studying its function—to
develop the first system-wide understanding of how an olfactory system represents the chemical world. The
overarching goal is to develop insights analogous to (and with similar predictive power to) the role of cone
photoreceptor tuning curves in our understanding of color vision.
 The specific aims of the proposal are (1) to reveal new principles of combinatorial coding through a
system-wide analysis of the vomeronasal system’s coverage, redundancy, and specificity via a large ligand
screen and quantitative analysis of the structural features required for activating each receptor; and (2) to
reveal relationships between receptor sequence and odorant structure by deorphanizing a large subfamily of
vomeronasal receptor genes. Preliminary data suggest that structural rigidity of steroid metabolites
contributes greatly to the tractability of these aims, supporting quantitative and predictive analysis on a
system-wide scale."
10869893,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Our goal is to identify the mechanisms responsible for cardiovascular disability in peripheral artery disease (PAD)
and to then examine therapies that will reduce the impact of these pathophysiologic processes. We have
demonstrated that the exercise pressor reflex (EPR) during leg exercise is exaggerated in PAD patients. The
mechanisms for the exaggerated EPR in PAD patients have not been examined thoroughly. Utilizing both human
and animal studies, we propose to examine the roles of blood flow restriction (BFR) and ischemia-reperfusion
(IR) stress in inducing the exaggerated EPR. We anticipate that a blockade of acid sensing ion channels (ASICs)
with amiloride will reduce the exaggerated EPR and enhance the walking tolerance in PAD patients. Aim 1:
Determine the role of BFR in inducing the exaggerated EPR in PAD. We hypothesize that BFR leads to a
greater H+/lower pH in the interstitium of exercising muscles and thereby accentuates the EPR via stimulating
ASICs. We propose to employ BFR in healthy subjects to simulate the BFR in PAD. We speculate that BFR will
augment the EPR in the placebo trial and amiloride will reduce the EPR and increase exercise time/load under
BFR condition. We also speculate that amiloride will play the same beneficial role in PAD patients. In animal
studies, we speculate that BFR by femoral artery occlusion will increase interstitial H+/decrease pH thereby
exaggerating the EPR via ASIC subtype 3 (ASIC3) and prolonged occlusion will upregulate ASIC3 expression
in muscle afferent nerves of PAD. Aim 2: Determine the role of IR in inducing the exaggerated EPR in PAD.
We hypothesize that IR contributes to the exaggerated EPR in PAD and amiloride reduces the exaggerated EPR
induced by IR stress via blocking ASICs. Healthy subjects will perform plantar flexion exercise under free flow
conditions and after 20 min ischemia followed by 20 min reperfusion. We speculate that IR stress will accentuate
the EPR. PAD patients before and after leg revascularization will also perform plantar flexion exercise. We
speculate that amiloride will improve the EPR and increase exercise time/load in subjects after IR stress and in
PAD patients with revascularization. In animal studies, we will examine the EPR in IR rats at different time
courses and speculate that in IR rats satisfied reperfusion will alleviate the EPR and the pressor response
induced by activation of afferent nerves’ ASIC3. Aim 3: Determine the effects of ASIC on exercise ability in
PAD and fundamental mechanisms. We speculate that amiloride will decrease the pressor response to
walking and increase the claudication onset time and walking distance/time in PAD patients. In animal studies,
we speculate that exaggerated EPR induced by the IR will be attenuated in ASIC3 knockout rats. We will
compare the protein levels of ASIC3 and its current response in muscle afferent neurons between IR rats at
different time courses and their counterparts serving as controls. We speculate that ASIC3 expression and its
current response in muscle afferent neurons will be amplified during the initiating IR stage and the effects of IR
will be reduced by ASIC3 knockout or with sufficient time of reperfusion."
10869897,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting 6-7 million people worldwide. Traditional
high frequency, isochronal deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for the motor signs associated
with PD. Clinical outcomes, however, vary across centers and within centers across patients. Adverse effects
can be induced by “current-spread” to unintended brain areas when the DBS lead is sub-optimally placed which
limits clinical benefits. Coordinated reset (CR) DBS is a promising novel DBS approach that has the potential to
overcome the limitations of traditional DBS. By alternating lower intensity stimulation delivered in a burst pattern
across different contacts of the DBS lead, CR DBS is associated with less current spread, thus reducing the
incidence of adverse effects, and improvement in motor signs that persist for days to weeks after cessation of
stimulation, i.e. carryover effect. Although the effectiveness of CR DBS has been demonstrated in both preclinical
and clinical studies, the selection of CR parameters that provide the greatest carryover effect has been
challenging. The optimal target for CR DBS must also be identified. The proposed study using a within-subject
experimental design will 1) optimize the critical parameter (cycle rate) of CR DBS, (2) compare the effect of CR
DBS in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi), and (3) characterize
the changes in cortical and subcortical neuronal activities associated with its therapeutic effect. The nonhuman
primate model of PD will be used with each animal implanted with DBS leads in the STN and GPi and high-
density Utah arrays placed over the primary motor, dorsal premotor and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices.
Objective and quantitative motor assessments will be performed to measure the acute and carryover effect of
CR DBS with different cycle rates and in different targets (STN and GPi). The central hypothesis is that the
therapeutic effect of CR DBS is greatest when the cycle rate is based on subject-specific pathophysiological
biomarkers associated with the PD state. We further hypothesize that CR DBS in GPi will provide greater acute
benefits in motor signs and induce significantly longer carryover effects. We predict that motor improvements
induced by CR DBS will correlate with a reduction in synchronized neuronal activity within and across cortical
and subcortical nodal points in the basal-ganglia-thalamocortical (BGTC) circuit. The results of this study will
provide a time efficient approach for the selection of CR DBS cycle rate based on subject-specific biomarker
activity in the BGTC circuit, identify the optimal target for CR DBS and enhance our understanding of the
mechanism(s) underlying the therapeutic effect of CR DBS. Results of the study will significantly advance the
development of CR DBS for the treatment of PD that will enhance clinical outcomes, prolong battery life and
induce fewer side effects leading to higher quality of life for PD patients undergoing DBS."

For nearly 20 years, the Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study (MIDAS) research network
has been an active community of infectious disease modeling researchers. The opening of the
MIDAS to the broader community and the COVID-19 pandemic spurred an intense increase in
interest, with membership growing from 152 researchers in 2019 to more than 1000 in 2023.
Since 2019, the MIDAS Coordination Center (MCC) led by the University of Pittsburgh has
worked to support the community. The MCC has provided the community with resources in
support of ID modeling, through a FAIR catalog of infectious disease modeling resources,
including a curated archive of COVID data as provided by public health agencies, and through
the creation of more than 200 COVID-19 and Mpox datasets in the standards-compliant Project
Tycho data format. Community support efforts included an active website; special-interest
groups for Latin-American researchers and students; support for the COVID-19 and Flu
Scenario Modeling Hubs; monthly webinars; and events including the Workshop to Increase
Diversity in Mathematical Modeling and Public Health and the MIDAS annual meeting. To
increase the rigor of modeling efforts, the MCC team developed and validated a checklist for
information needed to ensure the reproducibility of infectious disease modeling efforts.
In the next phase of the MCC, leading modelers from the University of Virginia, Johns Hopkins
Bloomberg School of Public Health, and the University of Maryland will join forces with the team
at the University of Pittsburgh to expand the community focus of the MIDAS network and
promote further advances in modeling research. The new MCC will: 1) develop a community-
focused process to extend the MIDAS catalog with software, educational, and modeling results
resources; 2) Expand the collection of Tycho-formatted gold standard datasets and related data;
3) Organize community-based activities, including workshops, working groups, educational
activities and challenges; 4) Train the next generation of infectious disease researchers; 5)
organize coordination and outreach activities, including efforts aimed at engaging with public
health officials, mapping of community activities; hosting monthly webinars; and planning an
annual meeting; and 6) conduct novel research into the development of model description
frameworks and taxonomies in support of rigorous evaluation of modeling approaches. A focus
on responsiveness to community-needs will ensure the relevance and impact of MCC efforts."

Critical self-judgment is a common phenomenon underlying a wide range of psychological disorders. The
proposed project aims to investigate the neural mechanism of critical self-judgment by analyzing fMRI and
questionnaire data from a total of 203 subjects collected from 5 previous projects that all included mindfulness
or compassion-based interventions for various conditions, e.g., depression, anxiety, trauma, stress and chronic
pain. The analyses will particularly evaluate the effective and functional connectivity among the amygdala, the
hippocampus, inferior frontal gyrus and precuneus, to test the central hypothesis that critical self-judgment is
characterized by excessive influence from negative valence on the left Inferior Frontal Gyrus-Pars Triangularis
(IFGPT), a key area for internal speech and self-awareness, which further influences the precuneus (PCu) of
the default mode network (DMN), a neural circuitry that supports self-referential processes.
Aim 1: To elucidate the effective connectivity in the neural circuitry during critical self-judgment. Using
fMRI data from a self-reappraisal task that included self-critical vs. self-reassurance conditions, Granger
Causality analysis will be conducted with fMRI time series from regions of interest of the hypothesized neural
circuitry to test whether there is significant effective connectivity in the directions of amygdala→IFGPT and
IFGPT→PCu during self-critical condition. Similar analyses with the self-reassurance condition will test whether
there is significant effective connectivity in the direction of MPFC→amygdala and IFGPT→amygdala, reflecting
frontal inhibition of negative affect.
Aim 2: To identify features from resting state fMRI that are associated with trait critical self-judgment.
Through analyzing resting state fMRI data with the CONN toolbox, we will extract Resting State Functional
Connectivity (RSFC) from regions of interest in the proposed neural circuitry, then use linear mixed effects
models to test whether the severity of trait critical self-judgment is collectively predicted by RSFC of
hippocampus-IFGPT, amygdala-IFGPT, IFGPT-PCu, hippocampus-PCu and amygdala-PCu.
Aim 3: To investigate whether post-intervention changes in trait critical self-judgment are predicted by
changes in the proposed neural circuitry. By analyzing post-intervention changes in fMRI metrics and trait
critical self-judgment severity, we will test whether post-intervention changes in trait critical self-judgment are
predicted by post-intervention changes in RSFC of hippocampal-IFGPT, amygdala-IFGPT, IFGPT-PCu,
hippocampus-PCu and amygdala-PCu."
10867705,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Suicide rates among Black youth have increased significantly in recent decades, exceeding those among Whites
by over 60%. Black youth also surpass all other racial/ethnic groups in Emergency Department (ED) visits for
suicidal ideation/self-harm. Scholars have suggested that racism and discrimination may be potential causes of
these concerning trends. One visible and pervasive example of routine discrimination against Black populations
is hyper-surveillance through racially targeted police stops. Research shows that police contact is a social
determinant of mental health among youth, with an increase in psychological distress, anxiety, depression, and
trauma symptoms following police contact. However, no study has examined the causal relationship between
racially disproportionate police stops and ED visits for suicidal ideation/self-harm and suicide mortality among
Black youth. To address this gap in research, we propose to examine the relation between police stops and (i)
ED visits for suicidal ideation/self-harm and (ii) suicide mortality among Black youth (outcomes). We propose a
multi-state, county-level examination of the relation between police stops of Black individuals and suicide-related
outcomes (ED visits for suicidal ideation/self-harm, suicides) across 10 US states (AZ, FL, KS, MA, MN, NC, NJ,
NY, SC, WI), from 2006 to 2019 using national, high quality datasets and advanced econometric methods. We
also leverage the unique case of the New York Police Department's (NYPD) stop, question, and frisk (SQF)
policy as a natural experiment towards causal examination of the relation between racially targeted police stops
and suicide-related outcomes among Black youth in New York City (NYC). In 2013, a federal court ruled NYPD’s
SQF policy unconstitutional (Floyd, et al. v. City of New York, et al., 2013), and the number of stop-and-frisks
conducted by NYPD declined sharply. We will use this ruling as a natural experiment to examine the causal
impact of hyper-surveillance on suicides among Black youth in New York City. We will retrieve data on police
stops by race for 10 US states from the Stanford Open Policing Database, and New York City-specific police
stops data from the New York Civil Liberties Union's stop-and-frisk database. Suicide mortality by region, age,
race, and sex will be obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics mortality database. We will acquire
ED visits data (by ICD9/10 diagnosis code, race, age, sex, county, month, year) from the State Emergency
Department Database (SEDD) and the State Inpatient Database (SID). We will formulate our exposures as the
volume of police stops of black persons and the ratio of Black to White police stops (per 100,000 population).
We will conduct empirical analyses using (1) two-way fixed effects, (2) time series, (3) difference-in-difference,
and (4) synthetic control methods to examine the spatio-temporal relation between our outcomes and exposures.
Our study will rigorously examine the ecological relation between racially disproportionate police stops and
suicide-related outcomes among Black youth. Findings from our study may inform policy-relevant interventions
for suicide prevention among vulnerable populations."
10869137,"Project Summary/Abstract
Optic neuropathies and retinal diseases are leading causes of irreversible blindness worldwide. Currently,
there are no therapies to restore vision loss. Whole eye transplants could restore vision if the neural circuits
between the eye and the brain could be restored. The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop therapies
that regenerate lost retinofugal pathways and enable whole eye transplants. In experimental spinal cord injury
models, neural stem cells (NSCs) have been used to form neuronal relays that restore injured connections and
function. Similarly, NSCs have demonstrated the capacity to form neuronal relays in the optic nerve and
integrate into the injured visual system. The overall objectives in this application are to (i) determine the degree
of visual function recovery from long-term NSC-derived neuronal relays in the injured optic nerve and (ii)
develop methods to guide neuronal relay axons through the optic chiasm and to appropriate synaptic targets.
The central hypothesis is that stem cell-derived neurons transplanted into the optic nerve form neuronal relays
that can be guided to appropriate targets to restore vision-related function. This proposal will test this
hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) measure the functional recovery from long-term optic
nerve grafted NSCs in the injured visual system, 2) investigate the role of canonical chiasmal guidance cues
on neuronal relay axon guidance, and 3) target neuronal relay axons to host vision-associated nuclei. In the
first aim, rodent optic nerve transection models will be treated with NSCs to restore retinofugal connections
with neuronal relays. Long-term integration and function of NSC-derived neuronal relays in restoring vision will
be evaluated with visual function testing and histological assessments for the structural indicators necessary
for effective neuronal relay conduction. For the second aim, NSCs with genetic modifications of canonical optic
chiasm guidance pathways that are important in development will be transplanted into a rodent optic nerve
transection model. These modified NSCs will be used to assess the effect of developmental guidance cues
that persist in the adult optic chiasm on the decussation of growing axons in the injured visual system and the
manipulability of those pathways. In the final aim, transduction of vision-associated nuclei to express
neurotrophins using an adeno-associated virus will be used to guide NSC-derived optic nerve neuronal relay
axons to innervate specific targets and facilitate recovery of visual function. The research proposed is
innovative because it overcomes current limitations in optic nerve regeneration by leveraging stem cells and
enables research on important downstream considerations necessary for successful optic nerve regeneration.
The proposed studies are significant because they develop a novel use of stem cells to form neuronal relays to
regenerate the optic nerve and advance axon guidance and targeting strategies in optic nerve regenerative
research. The positive translational impact is the potential development of therapeutic strategies that restore
vision, including whole-eye transplants."
10869262,"Project Summary / Abstract
Primary visual cortex (V1) processes visual information along parallel pathways and distributes the
results to high level cortical areas and subcortical targets. In mice, a species that lacks a strong, columnar
organization, neurons carrying information from different streams are spatially intermixed, but
nevertheless connect with specificity, both within and across areas. How are connections between
neurons established on such a fine scale despite the spatial intermixing of neurons?
We hypothesize that the visual properties of receptive fields of V1 neurons correlate with transcriptomic
cell types, which further guide their projection patterns and orchestrate the wiring of local connections.
We will establish if there is a correlation between cell type and visual function in V1. Our strategy consists
of the following steps. Step 1) Express GCaMP8 in a sparse set of L2/3 neurons under the control of
tamoxifen. Step 2) Use volumetric, in-vivo 2-photon calcium imaging to extensively characterize the visual
properties of the labeled neurons. Step 3) Process the tissue using expansion-assisted iterative FISH
(EASI-FISH) to yield the transcriptomic signatures of cells within the volume. Importantly, we will
determine which cells express GCaMP8 that will provide the landmarks for alignment. Step 4) Alignment
between in-vivo recordings and transcriptomic data using GCaMP6 expression. Step 5) Clustering of
neurons according to visual properties and transcriptomic signature.
The project addresses one of NEI’s priorities: to improve the understanding of neural activity and
molecular events in the formation of central visual circuits. Success in this project will deliver the first
database of excitatory cells in L2/3 of the mouse containing a characterization of their visual properties,
cortical location, and transcriptomic signatures. We will test if basic properties of visual neurons, such as
their receptive field linearity, correlate with cell types. The work will pave the way to study critical
questions about how early visual experience interacts with genetic programs that lead to cell
differentiation and their connectivity in a future R01."
10869149,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive breast cancer subtype that accounts for ~20% of breast
cancer diagnoses. Importantly, non-Hispanic-Black (NHB) and Hispanic women are disproportionally affected
by TNBC with worse clinical outcomes than non-Hispanic-White women (NHW), even when risks are adjusted
for diagnosis and other clinical factors as well as socio-economic factors. This indicates that biological factors
also influence the clinical course of TNBC in patients from different racial/ethnic backgrounds. We recently
identified robust TNBC prognostic subgroups based on BRCA1/2 status and the levels of an immune-related
gene transcriptional signature. Specifically, we demonstrated that BRCA1/2 mutant tumors (BRCAmut) and
BRCA1/2 wildtype tumors with high levels of the immune-related gene signature (nonBRCA-ImmuneHigh)
associate with the best therapy response rates (as measured by pathological complete response to platinum-
based chemotherapy). In contrast, BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation (BRCA1meth), and BRCA1/2 wild type
status with low expression of the immune-related gene signature (nonBRCA-ImmuneLow), are linked to poor
response rates. Importantly, BRCA1/2 mutations (linked to better prognosis) are less common in both NHB and
Hispanic TNBC patients compared to NHW patients, while evidence from the TCGA TNBC dataset shows a
higher prevalence of BRCA1meth cancers (linked to poor prognosis) in NHB than in NHW patients, consistent
with the disparities in clinical outcomes. In addition, racial/ethnic differences in TNBC tumor immune cell
infiltration have recently been reported. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that at least part of the
disparities in clinical outcomes between TNBC patients of NHB and Hispanic ancestry vs. those of NHW ancestry
is due to different prevalence of TNBC molecular features that associate with better or worse therapeutic
outcomes. Here, to test this hypothesis, we will assess BRCA1/2 gene status (BRCA1/2 mutations and BRCA1
promoter methylation, Specific Aim 1) and levels of the immune-related gene signature (a panel of 30 immune
genes, Specific Aim 2) in a retrospective cohort of ~300 primary TNBC samples from women of NHW, NHB
and Hispanic ancestry. We will then determine the prevalence of the four TNBC prognostic subtypes (BRCAmut,
BRCA1meth, nonBRCA-ImmuneHigh, nonBRCA-ImmuneLow) within each race/ethnicity towards ascertaining
whether their prevalence accounts for differences in response outcomes between NHW and NHB/Hispanic
TNBC patients. Successful completion of this study will generate novel insight into the basic molecular
mechanisms underlying cancer health disparities and will provide the groundwork for a future prospective study
to expand and validate the prognostic value of this type of patient stratification across more refined race and
ethnicity subgroups."

This proposal requests funds to purchase a BD FACSymphony S6 flow cytometric sorter to be housed in an
active and established core, the Flow Cytometry Core at the California National Primate Research Center
(CNPRC). The CNPRC is one of seven national designated primate research centers. Local, regional, and
national investigators pursue translational research at CNPRC that is relevant to immunology, infectious
disease, gene therapy and somatic cell genome editing, regenerative medicine and stem cell transplantation,
cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodevelopment. The instrument is requested to support >20 current
NIH-funded research projects from 6 Major Users and 11 Minor Users, as well as pending and future NIH-
funded research, that spans basic, translational, and even clinical research. These projects include studies of
therapeutic HIV vaccines, SIV pathogenesis, genome editing, retinal gene therapy, tissue-targeted AAV
vectors, and even a phase-1/2a human clinical trial of a next-generation COVID vaccine candidate, for which
mechanistic immunologic analysis will be performed at UC Davis. All these studies and indeed much of
modern biomedicine requires the ability to separately study functions of specific cell types, or even individual
cells. To perform such studies reproducibly and at an adequate quality level, furthermore, requires an
instrument that is consistently checked and maintained, and one that should be under service contract. The
BD FACSymphony S6 flow cytometric sorter will serve the increasing number of samples of our Users that are
currently stressing a >20-year-old FACSAria flow sorter. The FACSAria was purchased using institutional
funds and has been successfully maintained for an extraordinarily long serviceable lifetime, and was under
service contract continuously until BD no longer offered the contract. However, the age and wide use of the
older instrument impacts availability to the expanding NIH-funded research of our Major Users. Together,
these constraints are hampering the progress of NIH- funded projects in their laboratories as well as efforts of
their collaborators. The FACSymphony S6, with its greater selection of channels matched to those in our
analytic cytometers, better robustness, more consistent maintenance, and higher laser power, will significantly
advance our Major and Minor Users’ pursuits of novel mechanistic insights. We will integrate this instrument
into an existing CNPRC core facility, the Flow Cytometry Core, which is maintained by UC Davis and CNPRC
with significant infrastructure and oversight and advisory committees. The existing infrastructure will integrate
the operation, maintenance and management of the proposed instrument which will, in turn, stimulate new
research projects and innovations for many years."
10870249,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Reading acquisition is most often accomplished during childhood with the benefit of both the left and right
hemispheres. Students who have undergone hemispherectomy surgery during early childhood must rely on a
single hemisphere for all functions and therefore establish reading brain systems using unique configurations
that are yet to be understood. While brain plasticity for reading has been examined via typical development,
developmental disabilities, and interventions, we lack insights into the potential of a single hemisphere to carry
reading functions despite evidence that the left and right hemisphere together play important roles in reading
ability. Children often acquire reading skills following hemispherectomy, underscoring the neuroplasticity
potential for establishing supporting brain systems. Our proposal examines the association between reading
outcomes and structural/functional brain targets in children relying on a left or right hemisphere compared to 1:1
matched typically developing peers. We focus on reading in the hemispherectomy community given the
opportunity to study a single hemisphere ethically and practically; because we lack sufficient understanding of
reading acquisition among these students that hampers their educational efforts; and to inform our understanding
of the potential of a single hemisphere for reading. This singular opportunity capitalizes on the largest convening
of this community that will be in our vicinity. Scientifically, this opportunity can improve our understanding of the
neuroplastic potential of a single hemisphere to support reading skills, identify unique or shared functions by
hemisphere, offer insights regarding acquired reading difficulty during childhood, and relate individual differences
in reading outcomes to brain structure and function. Practically, this information is crucial for developing effective
reading recommendations and practices for the hemispherectomy community as well as more broadly (e.g.,
those impacted by neurosurgery or acquired/developmental reading difficulties during childhood). Datasets will
include 40 students post-hemispherectomy (grades 1-12; ages 6-17) who will be recruited from a large convening
(July 2024) in Boston, and 40 typically developing (TD) 1:1 matched readers. We predict that reading scores will
be positively associated with (1) white matter properties of arcuate fasciculus (AF) and inferior longitudinal
fasciculus (ILF), key connectivity regions associated with reading skill, and (2) recruitment of the key left
hemisphere reading regions in left hemisphere-only and right hemisphere homologues in right hemisphere-only
participants. Our discovery of the neurocognitive basis of reading in hemispherectomy will offer a novel
consideration of plasticity with insights that can inform improved understanding of reading difficulties as well as
bring attention to proactive and preventative measures in support of children with reading difficulties. These
goals align with NIH's mission by examining the impact of learning disabilities (LDs) on reading, developing
knowledge about LDs in the hemispherectomy community, emphasizing prevention and early intervention, and
establishing and applying fundamental knowledge about the brain to optimize reading acquisition."

The nervous system interacts with the immune system in ways that have been identified to contribute to a number
of diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, infection, brain cancer, and multiple sclerosis. The field of
neuroimmunology is a quickly growing research area that involves complex models and manipulations, most
often using in vivo models in mice. These models, though useful, lack human components, and have the added
difficulties of complex manipulations, difficulty in modulating individual organs without affecting others, and
difficulty in the acquisition of dynamic data. In contast, organ-on-chip systems offer benefits in these areas as
well as flexibility of cellular components and experimental conditions, but have rarely been applied to
neuroimmunology beyond models of the blood-brain barrier. Here we propose to develop a microphysiological
system that recapitulates the brain-meninges-lymph node axis in both healthy conditions and in a model
Alzheimer’s disease. To do so, we will integrate three tissue engineered models recently established in our
laboratory – of the human brain, lymph node, and meninges – into a user-friendly microfluidic device for media
recirculation, and validate the function of each compartment separately and together. We will deliberately retain
modularity of the system, so that we can examine the interactions of these components while easily manipulating
single organ compartments with fluid flow, drugs, mutations, or disease states. We will characterize the response
of each component to fluid flow, enable T cell circulation between organs, and test the response to inflammation
of each component separately and together. Next, we will convert the baseline model into an Alzheimer’s specific
model by incorporating a suite of tissue engineered models of Alzheimer’s brain, derived from neural stem cells
from individual Alzheimer’s patients. After confirming lymphatic drainage of amyloid similar to what has been
shown in vivo, we will quantify the impact of the Alzheimer’s brain on the inflammatory state of the meninges and
draining lymph node compartments, and determine the physical and chemical requirements for biomimetic T cell
migration into and within the brain. If successful, we will have both a baseline “normal” system linked through
multiple compartments and created from all-human components, poised as a foundation for future use across
neuroimmunological research, and a model of interactions between the brain, meninges, and cervical lymph
nodes in Alzheimer’s Disease. Ultimately, we envision using these systems for mechanistic tests of disease
onset and progression, as well as to test variations in drug responses between individuals of varied ancestry,
sex, and age, by sourcing cells from patients representative of different cohorts."

10876940,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Although concurrent chemoradiation (CRT) improves the overall survival for head and neck cancer (HNC)
patients, it is associated with debilitating toxicities (e.g., mucositis, dysphagia, and fatigue), which may lead to
increased healthcare utilization (e.g., emergency department (ED) visits, feeding tube (FT) placements) during
and after treatment. In light of the extremely high treatment-related burden, HNC patients need extensive and
persistent care and support from their families. Patients' family caregivers are their most important and valued
source of support and care; yet, caregiving is physically and emotionally taxing. In fact, family caregivers report
high rates of psychological distress, fatigue, and sleep disturbances, which may not only compromise their own
quality of life but also the quality of care they are able to provide to the patient. Therefore, evidence-based,
dyadic supportive care programs targeting both patient and caregiver outcomes are urgently needed. To
address critical knowledge gaps and build upon our pilot work, we propose an efficacy trial of a 6-week dyadic
yoga (DY) intervention targeting patient health utilization and caregiver QOL outcomes. The proposed
research will randomly assign patient-caregiver dyads to either a dyadic yoga (DY) or usual care (UC) control
group. To increase accessibility, the intervention will be delivered via video-conferencing following our pilot-
tested procedures. Patients and caregivers will be assessed at baseline (prior to randomization and starting
CRT) and then again, at the end of treatment and 1, 3, and 6 months later. During the treatment period, we will
assess patients and caregivers' symptoms on a weekly basis. At the 3-month follow-up assessment, we will
also collect qualitative samples to further understand participants' experiences. We will integrate data from
institutional records with self-report measures to evaluate efficacy, estimate costs and assess the cost-
effectiveness of the DY intervention relative to UC for both patients and caregivers. Based on our exciting pilot
findings, we propose a mediational model hypothesizing that the intervention will impact patient and caregiver
outcomes via improved symptom burden, objective physical function, and relationship well-being and reduced
pharmacological management using quantitative and qualitative methods. Thus, this innovative and
scientifically rigorous design will address imperative hypotheses that are highly relevant to the clinical care of a
vulnerable patient-caregiver population. The knowledge gained from this randomized controlled trial will
advance the science of behavioral medicine, and, ultimately, inform the clinical care of a vulnerable and
understudied population.

Pharmacogenetic testing is expected to enhance drug safety and efficacy while improving clinical outcomes by
tailoring treatment regimens to the individual. Key to maximizing benefits of this approach will be
comprehensive characterization of genetic variation that modulates drug absorption, distribution, metabolism
and excretion, drug target interaction and pharmacological response across populations. Significant advances
in cataloguing pharmacogenomic profiles from major populations of the world have aided clinical applications
but have largely excluded historically marginalized populations and small, geographically isolated populations,
including American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) people. These populations continue to be
underrepresented in genomic research for a variety of reasons: lack of community engagement, historical
mistrust, and geographical remoteness. Recent genetic studies by the Northwest Alaska Pharmacogenetic
Research Network (NWA-PGRN)—a center with multiple institutional and tribal partners—have shown that
AIAN people carry variants in pharmacogenes that are both novel and common, have allele frequencies of
known variants that are different than other ethnic or racial groups, and display high inter-tribal variability as
well. To broaden this research, we propose to leverage the lessons learned and build on research from the
NWA-PGRN to understand inter-individual variation in drug responses and provide novel indicators and
guidelines for implementing personalized medicine in AIAN communities. Our overall goal is to fill this
knowledge gap through characterizing genomic variation of pharmacogenes in a wide range of AIAN
populations using an ethical and community-engaged framework that focuses on developing and deepening
research partnerships with AIAN communities. We also seek to investigate the relationships between
genotype-phenotype of novel variants using in silico prediction and in vivo functional assays. This work will
create a general model for genomic research that engages communities in the research plan throughout the
research project (from start to completion and beyond) and will serve as a foundational way to shift the
research framework in genomics."
10877058,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Diabetes affects over 30 million Americans, which represents a staggering 9.4% of the population.
Diabetes causes an elevated blood glucose level. Over time, the presence of high glucose in the body
results in damage to various tissues. Metformin is an FDA drug commonly used as a ﬁrst line therapy for
the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes. It mainly acts to make tissues more sensitive to insulin, thereby
enhancing the effects of insulin produced by the pancreas to homeostatically lower blood glucose levels.
Importantly, however, Metformin also prolongs lifespan and delays the onset of aging from yeast to
mammals. In higher organisms, it additionally reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and inhibits
tumor growth. Astoundingly, given its clinical use in humans since 1958, the exact molecular mechanisms
underlying its wide-ranging health benefits are unknown. This Catalyst project is directed towards
elucidating the direct cellular protein targets of Metformin for the first time. Our encouraging preliminary
data shows that we can apply cutting-edge proteomics approaches to such binding events in an unbiased
way. In this project, we wish to extend this extremely promising approach to a diverse range of organisms.
By identifying molecular targets of Metformin in a variety of phylogenetically different model organisms
(yeast, worms, flies, mouse, and humans), we will be able to home in on proteins of crucial importance,
while simultaneously screening out non-specific binders. We will mechanistically test discovered targets
by loss- and gain-of-function experiments using various assays, which will be adapted as the project
advances. After validation of a small number of strong candidate Metformin binding proteins, we will test
these promising candidates in mammals by making transgenic mice harboring deletions in the relevant
genes coding for these proteins. We anticipate that the identification of specific mechanistic Metformin
targets will facilitate the development of novel therapeutics to treat diabetes and promote healthy aging.
Both of these goals are closely aligned with the core missions of NIDDK, and the wider NIH."
10875762,"Project Summary/Abstract
The broad, long-term objective of the proposed research is to determine the mechanisms regulating
fibrin and fibrinogen function, with the goal of improving the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular
disease. In so doing, we plan to train the next generation of scientists with an interdisciplinary skill set.
In this specific proposal, we will study the polymerization, structural properties, and enzymatic digestion of fibrin
fibers. Fibrin fibers polymerize into a 3-D gel after thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin. The structural properties
of fibrin are regulated by many factors such as enzyme concentrations, and altered fibrin structures have been
linked to pathologies such as diabetes and COVID-19. Although fibrin polymerization has been studied for
decades, there remains a crucial gap in our understanding of how early fibrin polymers transition into a fully-
formed gel. Because the transitional period likely determines the final gel structure, this gap in knowledge
prevents a direct association between polymerization processes and the biochemical and pathological conditions
that result in altered clot structures. In this research project, we will utilize recently developed approaches to
determine mechanisms of fibrin polymerization. We hypothesize that these polymerization processes propagate
throughout the entire coagulation process, affecting both the final gel structure and fibrin's resistance to
enzymatic digestion. Testing this hypothesis will rely heavily on undergraduate student researchers, providing
training in molecular biology, biochemistry, biophysics, mathematical modeling, and blood coagulation.
Specific Aim 1: Make direct observations of fibrin polymerization and quantify polymerization
processes and kinetics. Using high framerate, high resolution fluorescent microscopy techniques combined
with advanced image analysis tools, and atomic force microscopy, we will observe and quantify fibrin
polymerization. In so doing, we will measure rates of fiber growth, changes in fiber stiffness, and branch point
formation for the first time. Our experimental results will be tested against mathematical models to differentiate
competing hypotheses about these processes.
Specific Aim 2: Validate fibrin structural properties with multiple techniques and correlate the final
structural properties of fibrin gels with the early stages of fibrin formation. Using two or more different
techniques, we will measure fibrin structural properties including fibrin fiber length and diameter as well as
network pore size and branch point density. These network structural properties will be correlated with
polymerization processes to identify which aspects of polymerization determine fibrin structures.
Specific Aim 3: Determine how early clot structures affect lysis. We will measure the fibrinolysis rates of
whole networks and individual fibers within the network using novel fluorescence-based microscopy
approaches. We will correlate lysis rates with polymerization processes such as fiber growth rates, to test our
hypothesis that the entire hemostatic process is determined by the early stages of polymerization."
10875858,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The main treatment of cancer is surgery, which has shown the best overall survival rate compared to radiotherapy
and chemotherapy; but after the surgery, detection of lymph nodes metastases strongly influences the patient
prognosis. Moreover, the most important factor for predicting long-term cancer survival is completeness of the
surgical resection; but this may be difficult to achieve with microscopic disease. Unfortunately, current imaging
modalities to localize cancer, such as PET, CT, and MRI, which are used pre- and post-operatively, are limited
by resolution - larger than 0.5–1cm to be detectable. Consequently, current treatment failure in cancer is partly
driven by lack of molecular imaging modalities to assess occult metastasis, response to therapy, or improved
surgical resection techniques. Thus, detection of micrometastatic disease, achieving good resection margins at
the time of surgery, and proper identification of nodal spread remain hurdles to improving surgical outcomes,
treatment morbidity, and overall survival outcomes for our patients.
 The proposed research aims to address the limitations of current imaging modalities in cancer detection and
surgical resection. By developing near-infrared chemiluminescent and fluorescent (NIR CFL) chitosan-based
nanoparticles (CNPs), we seek to improve the detection of micrometastatic disease and guide image-guided
surgery. These CNPs can be activated by body heat and stored at low temperatures, providing convenience and
safety during use. Through the conjugation of synthetic targeting ligands, we aim to enhance tumor targeting
and assess surgical margins and metastatic lymph nodes using chemiluminescence and fluorescence optical
imaging. Our approach combines in vivo and ex vivo imaging modes, enabling the identification of deep
anatomical locations and microscopic targets with high contrast and excellent signal-to-noise ratio. Preliminary
results obtained in mice demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of our approach, showcasing the ability of
chemiluminescence imaging to detect target sites over 4cm below the body surface.
 The anticipated outcomes of this research include advancing the combined use of optical imaging in vivo,
enabling improved detection of micrometastatic disease, reducing surgical morbidity by preserving normal tissue,
and providing valuable guidance for management decisions in cancer patients. By addressing the challenges
associated with cancer treatment failure, incomplete resection, and nodal spread identification, this project has
the potential to significantly enhance surgical outcomes, reduce treatment-related complications, and improve
overall survival rates for patients."
10877830,"Despite higher rates of incident or recurrent MI and fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) among women aged 85
and older (120/1000) than men (85/1000), and the disproportionate burden of disability and co-morbidity in
aging women related to diagnosed and occult cardiovascular disease (CVD), prevention of CVD in this
vulnerable population is vastly understudied. This application builds upon the now completed Objective
Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health (OPACH) Study (NHLBI R01 HL105065), ancillary study
embedded in the Women’s Health Initiative Long Life Study led by Dr. LaCroix. The OPACH team studied
accelerometer-measured physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in relation to incident CVD among
7048 women ages 63-99. Our primary results showed a statistically significant, dose responsive, 20%
reduction in incident CHD, a 10% reduction in incident CVD, and a 24% reduction in all-cause mortality for
every additional hour spent in light PA (1.6-2.9 METs) in older women; and a 12% increased risk of CVD for
every additional hour spent sedentary. To classify light PA, the OPACH team conducted a laboratory
calibration study (200 OPACH women) to determine accelerometer cutpoints for absolute intensity relevant to
the usual daily PA habits of older women. Age-specific classification of PA intensity is critical because resting
metabolic rate and maximal aerobic capacity decline with aging, whereas the energy cost of aerobic activity
increases with age. Because of these age-related changes and the heterogeneity in how they occur in older
adults, the 2018 PA Guidelines Evidence Report urged researchers to: “Conduct prospective cohort studies of
PA and physical function in older adults that include objective measures (e.g., heart rate monitors) of relative
intensity of PA.” The term “relative” in this context refers to the maximal exercise capacity of individuals.
OPACH2 and the OPACH2 Calibration Study are designed specifically to derive validated accelerometer-
measured PA relative intensity and determine its association with incident CVD (CHD, heart failure, stroke) and
mortality through 2027. To do this, we will obtain a second accelerometer measurement of PA and SB with
contemporaneous measurement of heart rate (a physiological measure of PA intensity) using a non-invasive
cardiac monitor patch (Cardea SOLO) in 4200-5000 surviving OPACH women. We will also investigate cross-
sectional associations at the second accelerometer wear (2022-2023) of relative and absolute PA intensity with
indicators of underlying CV health including traditional risk factors (lipids, glycemia, inflammation, blood
pressure, adiposity), novel biomarkers of CVD pathology (cardiac troponin, brain natriuretic peptide, galactin-
3), heart rate variability (from Cardea SOLO patch), and physical performance. Finally, we will determine the
association of changes in accelerometer-measured PA and SB over ≈10 years with changes in traditional
cardiovascular risk factors, novel biomarkers, and physical functioning during the same interval, and with
incidence of clinical CVD events and mortality through 2027."
10877832,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Protein ADP-ribosylation (ADPr) is a dynamic, NAD+-dependent post-translational modification. The mammalian
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) proteins that catalyze ADPr target several chemically distinct amino acid
side chain functionalities on hundreds of substrate proteins to mediate a multitude of orthogonal signal
transduction pathways. Adding to this complexity is the potential for ADP-ribose polymer formation, a process
wherein the PARP1/2 and TNKS1/2 enzymes elongate ADP-ribose chains from mono-ADPr sites. Highlighting
the importance of poly-ADP-ribose in physiology and disease are: (i) the expanding clinical utility of PARP1/2
inhibitors to treat DNA repair-deficient cancers, and (ii) TNKS1/2 function in Wnt/b-catenin signaling and
dysfunction in developmental diseases including Cherubism. Aberrant ADPr activity has also been reported as
an underlying cause of cardiovascular and neurogenerative diseases, and these findings have inspired intense
efforts to elucidate PARP substrate profiles, determine PARP regulatory mechanisms, and develop PARP
isoform-specific inhibitors. However, given the liberal deployment of ADPr in cellular signaling and its
topologically complex chemical nature, our understanding of how specific mono- and poly-ADPr sites impact
protein function and elicit distinct biological activities has lagged behind. The proposed work aims to fill this
knowledge gap by developing novel approaches to reconstitute ADPr-mediated signaling events in highly
controlled biochemical and cellular environments. We recently developed a chemoenzymatic strategy to install
serine ADPr onto peptides and proteins with full control over modification site and ADP-ribose chain length.
Using this technology, we identified critical molecular determinants of DNA damage-induced chromatin
remodeling and uncovered specialized functions for nucleosome serine poly-ADPr. We are now in a unique
position to build upon our technologies and address fundamental questions in PARP biology. We will explore
mechanisms that govern poly-ADPr activity and investigate how different modification sites and accompanying
polymer lengths encode for specific biochemical outputs throughout the cell. Such information may guide more
effective strategies to identify and treat diseases that rely on dysfunctional ADPr activity."
10878811,"Diabetes is the most widespread blinding disease in working-age adults. Up to 70% of diabetic patients suffer
from corneal problems including neuropathy and epithelial keratopathy (delayed wound healing, recurrent
erosions, ulcers) that impair vision and cause pain and discomfort. Diabetic keratopathy is underdiagnosed,
and therapy remains symptomatic. We identified markers altered in human diabetic corneas and restored their
normal-like levels in corneal organ cultures by gene and nano therapy, which also restored normal stem cell
phenotype and corneal wound healing. Epigenetic changes also appear to contribute to diabetic complications.
In the previous funding period, we designed new approaches to normalize diabetic corneas (1) to avoid toxicity
and (2) to remove stable epigenetic changes in diabetic cells. We developed nontoxic nanobioconjugates
(NBC) that efficiently normalized stem cell marker expression and wound healing in cultured LEC and organ-
cultured corneas, based on antisense modulation of c-Met, MMP-10, and cathepsin F expression. We also
discovered a new marker, Wnt5a, reduced in diabetic corneas by dual DNA methylation and microRNA-203
epigenetic suppression. Addition of Wnt5a or demethylating agent Decitabine to diabetic cells or corneas
restored wound healing kinetics and stem cell marker expression. In another approach, we produced induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from diabetic LEC to remove diabetic epigenetic signatures and differentiated
them back to potentially normalized limbal-like epithelium. Such formerly diabetic cells expressed several stem
cell markers similar to normal, as we expected. In this proposal, we will optimize normalization of human
diabetic corneas structurally (by stem cell marker expression) and functionally (by wound healing kinetics).
We hypothesize that (1) a combination of NBC targeting several diabetic markers with DNA demethylating
agents would provide more efficient diabetic corneal normalization than single therapies, and (2) iPSC-derived
LEC-like cells could be differentiated into transplantable corneal epithelial cells using air-lifting and natural
corneal surface support. We aim to understand mechanistically how the normalizing treatments change gene
and protein expression levels and affect corneal cell populations using validated single-cell RNA-seq approach.
Aim 1. To develop combined nano and epigenetic therapy for diabetic corneal wound healing and progenitor
cells using novel NBCs and DNA demethylating agents. Aim 2. To unravel changes in gene expression and
cell populations in diabetic corneal epithelium by scRNA-seq following treatment with combined
pharmacological agents. Aim 3. To produce and characterize differentiated corneal epithelium with non-
diabetic properties in air-lifted cultures using diabetic iPSC-derived limbal-like epithelial cells.
Our aims fit well major initiatives of the NEI Strategic Plan 2021: (1) A game-changing advance – gaining
single-cell resolution in transcriptomic analyses, (2) Explore different cell therapies and tissue models derived
from iPSCs, and (3) Optimize gene delivery for the eye including non-viral systems, such as nanoparticles."
10879084,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent lung disease and is the 4th leading cause
of death in the world. COPD results from inhalation of oxidants, such as cigarette smoke, which causes
inflammatory cell infiltration and lung destruction. COPD is a progressive disease leading to significant
morbidity and mortality. There are no therapies to halt the decline in lung function. Our long-term goal is to
understand the mechanisms underlying COPD pathogenesis so that we can develop an immunotherapy to
stop disease progression. T regulatory cells (Tregs) decreased in the lungs of smokers with COPD compared
to smokers without COPD. Lung dendritic cells (DCs), which are able to polarize T cells to become Tregs or T
effector cells (Teff), are more mature in COPD, suggesting that they have a pro-inflammatory as opposed to a
tolerogenic phenotype. We hypothesize that in COPD, the increased number of mature pro-inflammatory DCs
are driving T cells towards Teff phenotype, whereas under normal conditions, tolerogenic DCs would be more
likely to promote induction of Tregs. In return, Tregs can modulate DC phenotype and function, suggesting
that subtle crosstalk feedback mechanisms are involved in the regulation of DC and Treg. However, no studies
have looked at whether dysregulated crosstalk between Treg and DC populations contributes to COPD
pathogenesis. Our specific aims are: 1) to demonstrate that COPD is associated with a shift from tolerogenic to
pro-inflammatory DCs; 2) to show that pro-inflammatory DCs preferentially polarize T cells towards a Teff
phenotype compared to tolerogenic DCs; and 3) to provide evidence that the transfer of Tregs will restore the
number of tolerogenic DCs in the lung. This proposal will utilize an established murine cigarette-smoke based
COPD model and also excess human lung tissue from consented patients undergoing clinically-indicated lung
surgeries, both with and without COPD. This allows us to conduct translational research and take
observations from human samples to the mouse model where we can answer more mechanistic questions.
Despite the abundance of clinical trials related to Treg therapy, there are currently no similar trials looking at
Tregs in patients with COPD. Successful completion of this proposal will fill critical gaps in knowledge and
provide pre-clinical data in support of exploring Treg therapy for COPD patients. This proposal will take place
with the combined resources of the University of Michigan and the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System (the
physical location of the laboratory). There are world-class facilities at both locations. The VA houses a murine
smoke-exposure facility, Microscopy Core, and FACSAria sorter, and all equipment and space needed to
conduct the research. Many members of the Immunology Graduate Program have labs at the VA, making for
a robust scientific environment. The training plan developed to successfully complete this proposal includes
advanced training in acquisition and analysis of fluorescent microscopy images, laboratory-specific training for
the study of lung leukocytes, and training in human research protections and the analysis of human data."
10879088,"Project summary
Genome structure, at a fundamental level, can be described by the division of the genome into
autosomes and sex chromosomes. Meiotic drive, segregation mechanisms, sexual antagonism,
epistasis, benefits of higher or lower recombination, and drift have all been implicated in
changes in chromosome number as well as the proportion of the genome contained within sex
chromosomes. However, despite over a century of work, none of these factors can adequately
explain the striking variation in genome organization across species. The long-term goals of our
research program are: (1) to develop new and robust models to better explain the forces that
lead to changes in the number of chromosomes and the proportion of the genome contained in
sex chromosomes, and (2) to understand how these characteristics impact the evolution of
other traits including common chromosomal disorders like Klinefelter syndrome and Turner
syndrome. This will be achieved by implementing a three-pronged approach combining
comparative, genomic, and theoretical methods to gain new insight into genome evolution. First,
comparative phylogenetic methods will be applied to genomic and phenotypic data spanning
long evolutionary time scales to estimate the rates of evolution of sex chromosomes and
chromosome number and link variation in these rates with life-history or other traits. Over
shorter time periods genetic and genomic studies are used within and among species to
understand the nature of segregating variation in genome structure and genetic variation that is
sexually antagonistic. Finally, these approaches are supplemented with theoretical work to test
and develop hypotheses inspired by results or to aid in experimental design for genetic and
genomic studies. Together, the results of this work will be an unprecedented understanding of
the evolutionary forces that have shaped the large-scale structure of genome across the tree of
life and continue to impact our genomes today"

My current research is focused on understanding mechanisms by which breast cancer initiates and
progresses. While many studies on breast cancer progression are focused on cancer cell biology, we are
evaluating breast cancer as a systemic disease that influences the function of multiple organs. Breast cancer-
associated deaths are not simply due to metastasis of cancer cells to distant organs or resistance to treatment
but also due to its deleterious effects of cancer on bone and skeletal muscle. Unlike lung and pancreatic
cancers where cancer leads to debilitating weight loss and clinical appearance of cachexia, physical
appearance of most breast cancer patients remains “normal”. However, loss of skeletal muscle mass without
overt loss of body weight is very common and this loss of muscle mass is associated with poor outcome. In our
VA funded study, we are molecularly dissecting cancer-associated skeletal muscle changes, developing
biomarkers of skeletal muscle changes for early detection of cancer-induced systemic effects, and therapeutic
modalities to limit the effects of cancer on skeletal muscle. These studies are extended to other cancers
including bladder, lung, pancreatic, and head and neck cancers. We observed specific molecular differences in
skeletal muscle of men and women with the same type of cancers. Thus, there are sex-dependent differences
in cancer progression pathways, which are being explored to develop therapies that may be applicable to men
with cancer. Since 11% of patients treated at VA are cancer survivors, our studies have important implications
in improving health care at VA.
 Additional studies in the laboratory are on 1) mechanisms associated with breast cancer metastasis
and therapeutic resistance; 2) genetic ancestry-dependent variability in the normal breast biology; 3) defining
cell-of-origin of breast cancer using single cell genomics, 4) the impact of exposure to extraphysiologic oxygen
on normal and cancer stem cells; and 5) developing chemoprevention strategies by understanding earliest
events in breast cancer initiation. These studies have no overlap with VA-funded studies and funded by
independent agencies. Goals of these ongoing efforts are to comprehensively understand breast cancer
development and progression and to further contribute to individualizing breast cancer characterization and
treatment. We aim to develop methods to classify breast cancer based on cell-of-origin and explore therapeutic
modalities based on genomic aberrations. Our study on the effects of extraphysiologic oxygen is expected to
change the method of tissue collection for biomarker discovery. The laboratory has been very productive over
the years with 29 publications since 2015 including two recent co-author publications in prestigious journals
Nature and Nature Communications and several senior author publications in journals such as Cancer
Research. Our publications have received more than 15,100 citations with H-factor of 62. The institutional
infrastructure, both at IU and VA, and collaborations within and outside the institution and continuous
extramural funding for the past 23 years enabled us to achieve these goals.
 In addition to research, I have been involved in mentoring junior faculty, post-doctoral fellows, graduate
students, medical students, high school students, and high school teacher summer research for the past 23
years (>50 mentees). I served/serve in various grant review committees at national and international levels and
serve as an editor of prestigious journals such as Cancer Research. Since 2015, I have given 37 invited
lectures at national and international venues highlighting the significance and recognition of our research."
10881682,"Dr. Pran K. Datta is currently a Research Microbiologist at the Birmingham VA Medical Center
(BVAMC), AL, and a Professor at the VA-affiliated University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). He has a
long-standing track record in the mechanistic studies of colorectal (CRC) and lung cancer. Since 2010, he has
been contributing significantly to VA research and services through training, mentoring, and collaboration with
VA investigators. His established expertise in basic and translational cancer research has also attracted
investigators from diverse disciplines at the VA Medical Centers in the US, Vanderbilt University, and UAB,
which has led to collaborative grants and high-impact publications.
 A seminal discovery from Dr. Datta's lab is the identification and cloning of a TGF-ß-receptor binding
protein STRAP (Serine Threonine Kinase Receptor Associated Protein) that inhibits TGF-ß signaling and
activates Wnt/ß-catenin and Notch signaling. The second seminal contribution of his study is to establish the
role of STRAP in activating the stemness of cancer stem-like cells. His third seminal contribution is to identify
a smoking-regulated miRNA signature that promotes NSCLC progression and chemoresistance. His high
impact research resulted in more than 70 papers and reviews in reputable top-tier scientific journals (some of
them with impact factor range 8.7-22.7). The fundamentals of the following projects are based on these high
impact and highly cited papers. Around 20 of his papers are cited more than 100 times each.
 Project I: Translational research on colorectal cancer (CRC) pathogenesis and targeting by
nanotherapy. During the last 40 years, the proportion of CRC has increased by about 15% in the veteran
population and thus constitutes a significant risk for all veterans and their family members, including women,
especially over 50 years of age. Consistent with this, there were more than 52,000 new cases of colorectal
cancer cases in VA during the last 5 years. To combat this problem, the PI's lab will therapeutically target the
pro-oncogenic functions of STRAP by siRNA-based nanoformulation in potential treatment of CRC patients as
well as by sensitizing 5-FU and/or Oxaliplatin based chemotherapy.
 Project II: Circulating microRNAs as predictive biomarkers for brain metastasis in non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC). Consistent with the fact that lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death in
the US veteran population, there were 41,780 new lung cancer cases and 19,543 lung cancer deaths among
the VA population during the last 5 years. The percentage of active-duty military personnel who smoked was
highest during the Vietnam and Korean Wars (75%). Similarly, 60% of Afghanistan and Iraq War veterans
used tobacco. The death records of 52,000 veterans of Vietnam War showed that these veterans died of lung
cancer at a 58% higher rate than veterans who did not serve there. To this end, Dr. Datta's lab is trying to
identify a miRNA signature in primary lung tumors that predicts NSCLC metastasis to the brain. Then this
miRNA signature will be validated using serum to stratify NSCLC patients at high risk for developing brain
metastasis and investigate their function in NSCLC progression and metastasis.
 In addition to conducting these highly innovative and high impact research programs, Dr. Datta has
been recognized for his exceptional contributions to training, mentoring, and services at the local and national
VA. As the Director of Research in the Hematology and Oncology Division and of the T32 Training Grant, Dr.
Datta oversaw the research development and mentored junior faculty and clinical and postdoctoral fellows; a
number of those are in academia with high positions. Taken together, the RCS Award is expected to assist
him develop high-impact diagnostics and therapies for veterans and other Americans in need."
10889966,"1. ABSTRACT
 The blood-brain barrier (BBB) restricts the influx of biomolecules from the vasculature to the brain
parenchyma. This attenuates exposure levels of the brain to systemically administered drugs, especially large-
size molecules such as antibodies. This issue also makes systemic treatment of glioblastoma (GBM), the most
devastating brain cancer, ineffective in most cases. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that a
measurable number of GBM cells, in particular cells near the growing edge of the infiltrative tumor area, exist
behind an intact BBB. Collectively, the features of the BBB create a special challenge for effective treatment of
central nervous system (CNS) diseases, including brain cancer, using drugs that have proven efficacy in other
diseases.
 Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are an emerging drug class with prominent target specificity, durable
therapeutic efficacy, and high translatability in drug development. While promising, clinical benefits of ADCs in
the treatment of brain diseases, in particular GBM, remain unconfirmed. Unfortunately, recent interim analysis
in a Phase 3 study using the anti-EGFRvIII ADC Depatux-M (formerly called ABT-414) revealed no survival
benefit for patients with newly diagnosed GBM receiving this ADC. Thus, improvement in BBB penetrability for
ADCs is critically needed to advance this promising molecular format toward truly effective and safe systemic
therapy for CNS diseases.
 We have developed novel ADC linker technologies, including: 1) branched linkers for site-specific and
simultaneous installation of two distinct molecules onto a single antibody and 2) enzymatically cleavable linkers
with exceptional circulation stability. Using these technologies, we have successfully constructed
homogeneous conjugates appended with peptides that facilitate traversing the BBB through receptor-mediated
transcytosis. One of the homogeneous peptide conjugates, as compared to a conventional heterogeneous
variant, showed greater accumulation into the brain parenchyma in healthy mice (2.7-fold) and orthotopic GBM
tumors in a xenograft mouse model (3.6-fold). Based on these findings, we hypothesize that homogeneous
conjugation of properly designed BBB-penetrating peptides with ADCs will be a promising approach for
systemic drug delivery to the brain. In this project, we will prepare a variety of BBB-penetrating peptides and
construct antibody conjugates with various conjugation modalities (linker attachment site, linker structure, and
stoichiometry of the peptides and payloads). All conjugates will be evaluated in vitro and in vivo for plasma
stability, receptor-mediated transcytosis efficiency, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, tolerability, and
immunogenicity profiles. We will then evaluate a panel of BBB-permeable ADCs for tumor targeting efficiency
as well as therapeutic efficacy in cell line-based and patient-derived xenograft mouse models of orthotopic
GBM. We will also perform intravital fluorescence microscopy to evaluate kinetics and dynamics of
extravasation in both healthy and tumor-bearing mouse models.
 Successful completion of this project will clarify the effect of the peptide structure and conjugation modality
on BBB penetrability of antibody conjugates as well as other drug properties. We also expect to identify rational
molecular design to unleash the full therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies and ADCs for brain
targeting, which may ultimately lead to novel drug development strategies toward a cure for difficult-to-treat
CNS diseases, such as GBM."
10889968,"Abstract 
Pregnant women are more likely to be infected with the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) than the general population, and the bacterium can be vertically transmitted leading to fetal infection and pregnancy loss. Despite its public/health/relevance, the determinants of maternofetal transmission remain undefined. Examination of clinical Lm isolates indicates that subpopulations of strains possess an enhanced ability for vertical transmission. One of these strains, 07PF0776, was first noted for its ability to target the heart, and this cardiotropism requires InlB, a bacterial surface protein known to be important for the invasion of mammalian cells. Experimental evidence indicates that InlB is similarly required for vertical transmission and that high InlB expression alone is sufficient to significantly enhance vertical transmission in an unrelated strain. The goal for this project is to elucidate the mechanisms by which InlB enhances the vertical transmission of hypervirulent Lm strains and of Lm generally. The project aims are designed to connect strain-specific genetic variations to altered bacterial behavior, host pathology, and immune responses. The current working hypothesis is that enhanced translation of inlB occurs in Lm hypervirulent subpopulations as the result of a trinucleotide substitution in the 5’ untranslated region (UTR) of the inlB transcript that promotes ribosome binding. It is also hypothesized that amino acid variations within InlB enhance InlB binding to the bacterial cell wall and thus increase InlB surface abundance. Aim 1 will determine how InlB levels are altered in 07PF0776 by looking at InlB synthesis, degradation, and cell wall affinity. This aim will also explore how the 5’ UTR contributes to increased protein expression. Aim 2 will determine how increased InlB expression promotes bacterial colonization of the placenta and fetus. Experiments will use pregnant mice as a model and compare strains with varying levels of InlB activity. Fluorescence microscopy combined with immuno-histochemistry will determine if InlB-high-expressing strains have enhanced invasion of specific placental cell types, or alternatively gain access through new portals of entry. RNAScope in situ hybridization and flow cytometry will establish how bacterial localization impacts the nature of the placental immune response. The ultimate goal of the above aims will be to establish the mechanisms by which strains of Lm cause severe fetal and neonatal disease. These studies may eventually allow for improved treatment of severe Lm infection and more effective strategies to protect pregnant women from Lm-induced pregnancy complications."
10888813,"“Understanding the chlamydial developmental cycle at the single cell level”.
Project Summary/Abstract
The bacteria in the chlamydiales order are obligate intracellular parasites of eukaryotic cells. They are reliant on
a developmental cycle consisting of at least three phenotypically distinct cell forms termed the reticulate body
(RB), the intermediate body (IB) and the elementary body (EB). The EB is infectious but does not replicate. The
RB replicates in the host cell but is non-infectious, while the IB is an intermediate form that transitions to the EB
form. Completion of this developmental cycle is central to chlamydial pathogenesis. Within this order, the genus
Chlamydia contains the causative agents of a number of important pathogens of humans. C. psittaci causes
zoonotic infections resulting in pneumonia, while C. pneumoniae is a human pathogen that causes respiratory
disease and is linked to atherosclerosis. Biovars of C. trachomatis are the causative agents of trachoma, the
leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide, as well as sexually transmitted infections with the potential to
cause pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. Irrespective of the resulting disease, all chlamydial species
share the same obligate intracellular life cycle and developmental cell forms. The mechanisms that regulate the
development of the distinct cell forms are currently poorly understood. Our preliminary and recently published
data indicates the cycle should be broken down into four stages; EB germination, RB
amplification/maturation, IB production, and EB formation. Understanding these forms and their
contributions to the developmental cycle and pathogenesis has been obfuscated by the mixed cell environment
of the chlamydial inclusion. Our data show that the chlamydial replication niche contains mixed phenotypic
cells as early as after the first few rounds of replication. Therefore, two aims focusing on understanding the
regulation of gene expression in these populations. In Aim 1, we will develop a CRISPRi knockdown screen
to assess the role of essential genes on cell type regulation. For Aim 2, the spatial gene expression
pattern of cell type specific genes and the DNA elements that generate this expression pattern will be
determined at the single cell level. Completion of these aims will lead to a more complete understanding of
the developmental cycle and allow for careful dissection of the effects of mutations, chemical agents, ectopic
expression of regulatory proteins, and therapeutic treatments on the different aspects of the developmental cycle."

biomedical careers. AI4Health is designed to promote the interest of diverse adolescents in biomedical careers
through leveraging significant advances in game-based learning technologies to create engaging interactions
that enable them to virtually explore biomedical careers and learn how AI can be used to solve health science
problems. The project has three aims:
1. Design and develop AI4Health to engage diverse adolescents’ interest in biomedical careers utilizing AI-
 driven learning technologies that integrate the following components: (a) the AI4Health Career Adventure
 Game will introduce adolescents to the world of biomedical research and health science careers with a
 focus on AI through a series of interactive game episodes in which students will take on the role of
 biomedical researchers and health science professionals; (b) the AI4Health Student Discovery website,
 which will feature interactive video interviews with biomedical research and health science professionals
 about their careers and how they use AI; and (c) the AI4Health Teacher Resource Center website, which
 will provide online professional development materials and in-class support for teachers’ classroom
 implementation of AI4Health.
2. Investigate the impact of AI4Health on adolescents’ knowledge of, interest in, and self-efficacy for pursuing
 biomedical research and health science careers featuring AI by conducting a matched comparison study in
 middle school classes.
3. Examine the effect of AI4Health on diverse adolescents by gender and race/ethnicity. Working closely with
 adolescents from groups underrepresented in the biomedical sciences throughout all design and
 development phases of the project, the project team will specifically design AI4Health to develop girls’ and
 those from underrepresented groups’ knowledge of, interest in, and self-efficacy to pursue biomedical
careers."

patient-oriented research on schistosomiasis and women's reproductive health in Tanzania and Lebanon, and
to conduct a new study on human papillomavirus (HPV) persistence in women with schistosome infections.
The candidate has spent the past 16 years conducting research in Tanzania on: (1) the female genital tract
and gut mucosal effects of schistosome infections and how these affect host immune response to viral
infections and vaccines, and (2) implementation science to improve women's reproductive health in resource
limited settings. She has also established longstanding partnerships with a leading research organization

10891158,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Overweight (OW) and obesity (OB) are prevalent, unhealthy, and costly. The obesogenic environment is a main
contributor to OW and OB, filled with visual cues signaling highly varied, highly palatable, and fattening foods,
that can be potential triggers for approach motivation and consummatory behavior. Food cues additionally lead
to cue-induced craving, and associations between food cue-reactivity, craving, and weight gain make craving a
probable contributor to the OB epidemic. Personalized treatment innovations for OW and OB that target food
cue-reactivity and craving are sorely needed for prevention and treatment. One promising approach to alleviate
food cue-reactivity and craving is real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (rtfMRI-NF).
Beginning rtfMRI-NF work related to craving is promising, including studies showing that this approach can be
used to reduce food and drug cue-related brain activity and craving. However, prior rtfMRI-NF studies of food
cues are limited by 1) no studies provided feedback from complex brain networks, 2) no studies used a viable
clinical brain biomarker for feedback, and 3) no studies linked feedback training to eating behavior. To address
these gaps, we have developed and tested connectome-based rtfMRI-NF to provide feedback based on
functional connectivity within complex whole brain networks. We used connectome-based predictive modeling,
a well-validated machine learning approach for generating predictive models of brain-phenotype associations
from functional connectivity data, to identify a transdiagnostic brain biomarker of craving, the “craving network,”
that can be targeted for rtfMRI-NF. This proposed project will use connectome-based rtfMRI-NF to train volitional
control of the “craving network” in response to food cues among individuals with OW or OB and high craving and
measure effects on craving and eating behavior. Individuals with OW or OB and high craving (N=50) will be
randomized to receive either active or sham (yoked) connectome-based rtfMRI-NF at 3 weekly training scans
including feedback, transfer (no feedback), and resting state runs. Food craving and eating behavior will be
measured at each scan and at 1 month. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that individuals with OW and OB can
learn to reduce craving network strength using rtfMRI-NF. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that craving network
feedback is associated with reduced food craving and positive changes in eating behavior, and that reduced
craving network strength will be correlated with reduced craving. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that craving
network feedback is associated with decreased craving network strength during resting state, a measure of basal
changes without explicit engagement of the craving network. Overall, this project builds on important prior
research and preliminary data demonstrating the significance and feasibility of testing a highly innovative
approach to reduce food cue-reactivity and craving using connectome-based rtfMRI-NF. Findings will inform a
fully powered larger trial, and should impact research on OW and OB and improve our understanding of craving
which is generalizable."

According to the World Health Organization, approximately 15 million children are born prematurely each year.
Many of these infants end up spending days to weeks in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Infants who are
born prematurely are often exposed to noise and light levels that affect auditory and visual development.
Subsequently, these children can have long-term impairments in cognition, visuospatial processing, hearing, and
language. We have developed a rodent model of NICU exposure to light and sound using the Mongolian gerbil
(Meriones unguiculatus), which has a low frequency human-like audiogram and is altricial. To simulate preterm
infancy the eyes and ears will be opened prematurely, followed by exposure to the NICU-like sensory
environment throughout the gerbil’s cortical critical period of auditory development. Here, natural eye-opening
closes the critical period ~ P18, and early eye opening simulates the effect of preterm birth, by closing the critical
period precociously (Mowery et al., 2016). This motivated the core hypothesis that early eye opening induces
precocious closure of auditory development through feed forward peripheral visual excitatory input onto cross
modal synapses located in auditory cortex. Recent research has provided preliminary validation for the effect of
early light and noise exposure on long-term brain development (Gay et al., 2023). We will test this hypothesis
with three aims. The first aim will track electrophysiological development of inhibition within the auditory cortex
after NICU (early eye/ear opening) or noise only (early ear opening) exposed neonates, juveniles, and adults.
The second aim will track the development of physiological peripheral measures for auditory (auditory brainstem
response) and visual (visual evoked potentials) function in NICU (early eye/ear opening) or noise only (early ear
opening) exposed neonates as they develop into juveniles and then adults. Histological measurements of the
white and grey matter along the visual and auditory neuraxes will be generated and correlated with any
impairments to peripheral physiology thresholds of each animal in AIM 2. The third aim will behaviorally test
measures of auditory and visual based decision-making impairments in NICU (early eye/ear opening) or noise
only (early ear opening) exposed animals after they have become adults. Together, the findings from this project
will introduce a new animal model of the NICU preterm infant, with which mitigative and treatment-based
approaches to early light and sound exposure can be ethically carried out by the research community. We hope
to establish this animal model to create a bridge between clinical pediatric physician researchers and the animal
research community to advance clinical treatments and care for the NICU-exposed preterm infant."
10864445,"Vector insects are responsible for over 700,00 deaths annually and hundreds of billions of dollars in associated
economic impact. Although many vector insect species have had their genomes sequenced, the regulatory component
of these genomes is largely undefined. Characterizing regulatory sequences—in particular, “enhancers”—is critical
for understanding the organization of gene regulatory networks and how the genome informs phenotype.
Enhancers play important roles in mediating insecticide resistance, pathogen transmission, host recognition, mating
success, and other critical vector-relevant biological processes. Enhancers also serve as major components of
biotechnology tools requiring precisely targeted gene expression, adding additional importance to their identification
and characterization. Given that enhancers are so important, but that few insect enhancers are known other than for
the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, there is a pressing need for efficient methods for enhancer discovery that can
be applied to a wide range of vector species. We previously developed “SCRMshaw,” a computational method for
enhancer discovery, and used it to predict enhancers in over 36 insect species including vector mosquitoes.
SCRMshaw utilizes known enhancers as “training data” to guide its search for unknown enhancers with related
function. We have demonstrated that we can use Drosophila enhancers, of which many (~38,000) are well-
characterized, as training data to discover similar enhancers in other insect species. Unfortunately, despite this large
number of known Drosophila enhancers, training enhancers are not available for many significant cell types. This is
especially true for non-embryonic stages of the life cycle and cells of particular interest for vector biology, e.g.
those involved in insecticide resistance, pathogen transmission, and reproduction. This proposal addresses this
major shortcoming by developing a new way to generate SCRMshaw training data, using scATAC-seq data. This will
open up a broad potential source of training data for currently under-studied cell types, and enable prediction of
enhancers in species at greater evolutionary distances from Drosophila. It will also allow for significantly
improved estimation of true- and false-positive enhancer prediction rates. The proposed approach is rapid;
inexpensive; and requires empirical data from only a single representative organism but can be applied to dozens
to hundreds of loosely-related organisms. It will allow a single set of quality scATAC-seq experiments in
Drosophila or a vector mosquito to be leveraged for enhancer prediction in the majority of vector insect species.
This work will therefore provide immediate important outcomes by enabling functional regulatory annotation of
an expanded set of relevant cell types for a significant portion of sequenced vector insects. It will have a major
long-term impact on our ability to address fundamental questions of vector biology and to improve strategies for
vector control."

 Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma (UTUC) is a rare disease that accounts for 5-10% of all urothelial tumors
with an estimated annual incidence in Western countries of almost two cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The 5-
year specific survival is < 50% for stage 2-3 patients but < 10% for those with stage 4 disease. This poor survival
rate demands improvements in preoperative detection. Diagnosis and preoperative risk-stratification of UTUC
patients present distinct challenges given the limitations of current available tools. Although urine cytology has
an acceptable specificity to detect UTUC, the sensitivity is relatively low, particularly in low-grade carcinomas
and pelvicalyceal tumors. The invasive ureteroscopy (URS) biopsy can enhance the diagnostic accuracy, yet
under-grading and under-staging rates remain a concern at 32% and 46%, respectively. Nowadays, clinical
decision-making and the prognosis of UTUC relies heavily on TNM stage and pathological grade that is not
accurately available until radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) is performed. Major improvements in predictive tools
have occurred in recent years and unique parameters have been proposed to distinguish between low- and high-
risk tumors. DNA methylation alterations have emerged as potential diagnostic and prognostic factors for
urothelial carcinoma at the molecular level. For example, bladder cancer-specific DNA methylation changes can
be detected in urine sediments and can be used as non-invasive diagnostic or surveillance markers. Thus, a
personalized medicine approach for the diagnosis and prognosis of UTUC is urgently needed. The goal of this
study is to develop DNA methylation biomarkers to identify aggressiveness of UTUC. In a preliminary study, we
identified differential DNA methylation patterns in a small group of patients who had exhibited DNA markers for
UTUC aggressiveness. We hypothesize that bladder cancer DNA methylation marker panels can be used to: 1)
characterize UTUC-specific and/or aggressive UTUC specific DNA methylation markers in primary UTUC
specimens (Aim 1); 2) validate these markers in urine sediments of UTUC patients for monitoring disease
diagnosis, prognosis and recurrence (Aim 2). Results from this proposal will support further independent
investigations into the role of DNA methylation markers in UTUC diagnosis and prognosis, improve the standard
of care in predictive tools and different parameters have been proposed to distinguish between low- and high-
risk tumors and provide UTUC-specific DNA methylation profiles that aid physicians’ decisions."
10864446,"Abstract
Extremely preterm infants born at 23 to 26 weeks gestation have the highest incidence of thrombocytopenia
and bleeding and the highest mortality among neonates admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).
Approximately 20% of extremely preterm infants develop a severe intracranial hemorrhage, almost always in
the first week of life, which is the highest risk period for bleeding. Platelet transfusions are frequently
administered to extremely preterm neonates at higher platelet count thresholds than those used in older
children and adults to decrease the risk of bleeding. Paradoxically, a recent multicenter randomized trial of
infants <34 weeks gestation conducted in Europe (PlaNeT-2) found that neonates randomized to a lower
platelet transfusion threshold of 25x10^9/L, compared to 50x10^9/L, had a significantly lower risk of death or
serious bleeding. However, 39% of infants received one or more platelet transfusions before enrollment, and
the median age at recruitment was 7-8 days, suggesting that a high proportion of thrombocytopenic infants in
the first week of life were not randomized before being transfused. This likely contributed to the persistent
uncertainty regarding optimal platelet transfusion thresholds, specifically in the most immature preterm infants
in the first week of life. In a recent survey, 57% of responding European NICUs continued to use thresholds
above 25x10^9/L in infants <28 weeks’ gestation and <7 days old. Another question raised by PlaNeT-2 was
whether thresholds lower than 25x10^9/L can be safely applied to extremely preterm infants after the first week
of life, when the risk of bleeding is much lower. The Neonatal Platelet Transfusion Threshold (NeoPlaTT) trial
was specifically designed to address these critical questions and will test the hypothesis that, among extremely
preterm infants born at 23 to 26 weeks gestation, a low platelet transfusion threshold, compared to a high
threshold, will improve survival without major or severe bleeding up to 40 weeks postmenstrual age. The
Specific Aims will (1) determine the comparative effectiveness of low platelet transfusion thresholds
(25x10^9/L in the 1st week of life, 20x10^9/L thereafter), compared to high thresholds (50x10^9/L in the 1st
week, 35x10^9/L thereafter), on the risks of death or major/severe bleeding for infants born at 23 to 26 weeks
gestation; (2) determine the comparative effectiveness of high vs. low thresholds on mortality as a key
secondary outcome, along with serious morbidities and need for platelet transfusion. Importantly, the trial will
be conducted in the NICHD Neonatal Research Network, which is a consortium of NICUs with established site
research infrastructure and extensive experience conducting multicenter clinical trials with early recruitment of
high-risk neonates. If our hypothesis is confirmed, this trial will change the current paradigm regarding the
liberal use of platelet transfusions to prevent bleeding towards the avoidance of unnecessary platelet
transfusions in this population. Most importantly, knowledge generated from the NeoPlaTT trial may improve
outcomes in our most vulnerable patients, while also decreasing costs and conserving resources."
10868700,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – PROJECT 1 EXPOSURE
Hundreds of U.S. sites are contaminated by poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which have been
associated with deleterious impacts on immune function, metabolism, and endocrine health. Project 1 of the
Sources, Transport, Exposure, and Effects of PFAS (STEEP) Center (P1–Exposure) provides a critical link
between the biomedical and engineering projects by focusing of PFAS exposure sources of concern near
contaminated Superfund sites (air, water, and fish). P1–Exposure directly addresses the SRP mandate to
“...develop methods and resources to detect hazardous substances and assess the risks they pose to human
health” through the development of novel mechanistic and statistical tools to support PFAS exposure
assessment and innovative environmental measurements in collaboration with P4–Detection using a suite of
analytical techniques to close the PFAS mass budget. P1–Exposure research is essential to the overall STEEP
II goals to “Assess the distribution, transformation and bioaccumulation of PFAS and “Engage new and
established stakeholders across multiple sites.” Most prior work has focused on a limited suite of PFAS analytes,
transport through aqueous media, and drinking water as the main vector of exposure. However, abundant
polyfluoroalkyl precursors that degrade into terminal PFAS have been detected in environmental samples,
atmospheric deposition is increasingly recognized as a major PFAS transport pathway, and contaminated
seafood is another important vector for human exposure. The central hypothesis of P1–Exposure is that
environmental PFAS exposures have been substantially underestimated due to large quantities of undetected
polyfluoroalkyl precursors present in air, water, and biota. Aims 1 and 2 will investigate the propensity of PFAS
precursors for bioaccumulation in aquatic food webs using field research in Cape Cod, MA, downstream of AFFF-
contaminated sites. New knowledge of PFAS bioaccumulation mechanisms from field research and collaboration
with P3–Mechanisms will be formalized in a mechanistic food web model, compared to traditional SRP
contaminants of concern (polychlorinated biphenyls and methylmercury), and applied to understand time trends
in seafood exposures for Faroese children in P2–Critical Effects. Aim 3 will develop modeling tools for
characterizing atmospheric source-receptor relationships for PFAS across the contiguous U.S. Aim 4 will
enhance a statistical approach for predicting private wells likely to have PFAS contamination in the states of MA,
MI, and NJ. P1–Exposure research will be conducted in partnership with many stakeholders including the
Mashpee-Wampanoag Tribe on Cape Cod, MA in partnership with CEC and state program managers and
scientists in MA, MI, and NJ. All modeling and data management practices for new measurements and model
output will be supported by STEEP’s DMAC. P1–Exposure research and engagement with multiple states will
provide ample training opportunities through the RETCC.

10868702,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – PROJECT 2 CRITICAL EFFECTS
Metabolic diseases, including obesity and type 2 diabetes, are major public health problems of multifactorial
etiology, in which early-life exposures to environmental pollutants, such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances
(PFAS), appear to play a role. In parallel, a critical effect of PFAS exposure is immunotoxicity that paves the
way for immune dysfunction and infectious disease. STEEP Project 2 (P2–Critical Effects) will examine the
role of developmental exposure profiles for these high-priority environmental pollutants and determine
outcomes up to ages 5 and 14 years to allow identification of windows of susceptibility. We will rely on two birth
cohorts from the Faroe Islands (total N >1000) to prospectively explore the associations between exposure
profiles of PFAS and outcomes, including immune deficiencies (suboptimal antibody production after
vaccinations, and increased frequency of infectious disease) and metabolic abnormalities (excess adiposity,
hyperlipidaemia, low bone mineral content, and prediabetes). P2–Critical Effects will further evaluate the
possible usefulness of clinically relevant biomarkers in serum (such as cholesterol subfractions,
adipocytokines, insulin-like growth factor-1). Exposure data are already available from analyses of maternal
pregnancy, cord blood and postnatal serum at ages 18 months, 5 and 9 years from the oldest Cohort 5, and
clinical data, including DXA scans, are available for comparisons with age 14 years. The youngest Cohort 6 is
currently being formed, with blood samples and human milk being taken during infancy for PFAS analyses that
will allow determination of PFAS transfer from lactation. Multiple regression analyses with adjustment for other
environmental chemicals will be complemented by structural equation models and other advanced statistical
methods. Thus, the proposed study will aim at providing prevention potentials and new insights into the
pathogenesis of major public health problems that are associated with early-life exposures to high-priority
environmental pollutants."
10868706,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – PROJECT 3 MECHANISMS
Project 3 (P3–Mechanisms) is a biomedical project utilizing expertise in pharmacy and chemical engineering to
elucidate mechanisms that underlie per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) absorption, distribution,
and excretion (ADE). PFAS have been detected in human serum and excreta. Since the inception of STEEP I,
it has become evident that PFAS contamination is global, exposure is ubiquitous, and the need to understand
PFAS properties is urgent. There is a large gap in knowledge regarding the mechanisms by which the ~7000
PFAS that are on the commercial market are absorbed, retained, and are eliminated by the living system, with
very little understood about the mechanisms that dictate PFAS ADE. Cell-based studies suggest both protein
binding (i.e., Serum Albumin and Fatty Acid Binding Proteins) and xenobiotic/drug transporters (i.e., Organic
Anion Transporting Polypeptide (OATP2B1) and ATP-Binding Cassette Subfamily G Member 2 (ABCG2)) are
potential mechanisms that dictate PFAS absorption, distribution, and excretion in vivo. P3–Mechanisms will use
mouse knock-out models and cell-based assays to test the hypothesis that protein transporters and protein
binding are critical factors for PFAS ADE and tissue distribution through accomplishing the following three aims:
Aim 1: Determine the contribution of OATP2B1 as a critical uptake mechanism for cellular PFAS uptake, tissue
distribution and elimination; Aim 2: Determine the contribution of Serum Albumin and Fatty Acid Binding Proteins
as critical mechanisms for PFAS uptake, tissue retention, and elimination; and Aim 3: Determine the contribution
of ABCG2 as a critical efflux mechanism that influences PFAS ADE. The outcome of the proposed work will be
the validation of critical mechanisms using in vivo, rodent based tools and in vitro humanized tools. The findings
of the project will help guide the prioritization and selection of key toxicological mechanisms that can be targeted
in larger screening efforts. Key mechanisms identified by P3–Mechanisms will inform P1–Exposure, P2–
Critical Effects, and P4–Detection and will be incorporated into bioaccumulation modeling. Projects 1, 2, and
4 will inform P3–Mechanisms about new PFAS to characterize in the proposed in vitro models. P3–
Mechanisms will provide an interdisciplinary training experience through STEEP’s RETCC and will support the
Community Engagement Core (CEC) through participation in bidirectional communications about findings and
PFAS science. This work will significantly advance our mechanistic understanding of PFAS ADE, especially in
relationship to predicative physiochemical properties of emerging PFAS, which addresses SRP Mandate #2
(techniques of assessing the effects of hazardous substances on human health). It uses a mechanistic approach
to identify underlying genetic risk or dietary factors that modulate PFAS ADE, which addresses the broad SRP
Mandate # 3 (development of methods of assessing the risks hazardous substances pose to human health) and
SRP Mandate #4 (development of biological, chemical, and physical methods of decreasing hazardous
substances and their toxicity)."
10865332,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Complications from preterm birth are the leading causes of global mortality in children under the age of five.
The failure to mount appropriately-timed maternal-fetal immune tolerance is associated with preterm delivery.
However, our current understanding of the humoral immune system in this process has been limited to a
handful of examples of pathogenic antibodies that occur with pregnancy complications in humans. To fill this
knowledge gap, it is essential to obtain a comprehensive portrait of autoimmune repertoire dynamics during
normal and complicated pregnancies. The long-term goal of this work is to leverage serological autoantibody
profiles for development of non-invasive predictors for preterm delivery and identification of key targets for
preventative immunomodulatory therapeutics. In Aim 1, Dr. Rackaityte will chronicle the autoimmune changes
across the time course of pregnancy using phage display immunoprecipitation and sequencing to generate
machine learning models predictive of gestational age. Completed during the K99 phase, this high-resolution
timeline of autoreactivity during pregnancy will build the foundation for understanding the roles, both protective
and pathogenic, of these critical humoral immune adaptations. In Aim 2, Dr. Rackaityte will dissect antibody-
antigen interactions specific to preterm pregnancy to discover contact points that lead to functional inhibition of
the targeted protein. In the K99 phase, a suite of patient-informed recombinant antibodies will be generated
through an evolution-driven antibody phage display system, and these will be tested in the R00 phase for their
ability to inhibit target protein function. This will provide the framework for future studies to interfere with
antibody-antigen interactions to prevent preterm delivery. In Aim 3, Dr. Rackaityte will develop murine models
of inflammation during pregnancy that will be employed to determine the in vivo consequences of maternal
autoantibodies on pregnancy outcome. This will deliver a validated model for interrogating the in vivo role of
autoantibodies that lead to labor progression, a unique opportunity to mechanistically dissect observations
made in humans for targeted therapeutic development. Dr. Rackaityte’s goal is to develop an independent
research program in translational reproductive immunology, which is highly complementary to the mission of
UCSF geared towards facilitating direct interactions between basic scientists and clinicians. To accomplish her
goals, Dr. Rackaitye will receive guidance from her scientific advisory committee and her primary mentor, Dr.
Joseph DeRisi. To complete her training and build a foundation of skills for her independent laboratory, she will
develop expertise in recombinant antibody generation (with Dr. Charles Craik), mouse model development
(with Drs. Tippi MacKenzie and Mark Anderson), and clinical metadata analysis of reproductive disorders (with
Dr. Marcelle Cedars). She will attend UCSF and MOSAIC UE5 sponsored programs to gain skills in grant
writing, leadership, and lab management as well as targeted coursework to prepare her successful transition to
an independent career."

This application is for an NHLBI R03 Small Grant Award for K08 Recipients entitled “Fibronectin Extra Domain
A Degradation as an Antifibrotic Approach in Lung Fibrosis.” I am a physician in Pulmonary and Critical Care
Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, and I am building a research program focused on the study of basic
mechanisms of lung fibrosis with a focus on host protein degradation pathways that could be exploited to mitigate
fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis is a sequela of several Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) and is characterized
pathologically by lung interstitial thickening and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) components.
Clinically, the development of end-stage lung fibrosis is associated with high morbidity and mortality and the
median survival is 3-5 years in patients diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. While two
pharmacotherapies are approved for pulmonary fibrosis from some ILDs, there continues to be an urgent, unmet
need for effective therapies to treat chronic fibrotic lung diseases. FN-Extra Domain A (FN-EDA) is a splice
variant of the glycoprotein Fibronectin that contains an alternatively-spliced A domain with unique properties.
FN-EDA is pathologically enriched in the ECM of patients with chronic fibrosing lung diseases, including
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and Systemic Sclerosis-Interstitial Lung Disease. FN-EDA is a centerpiece in the
“fibro-inflammatory” axis driving aberrant ECM deposition and is a “druggable” target in the pathogenesis of
pulmonary fibrosis. The aims of this study are 1) to determine the mechanism of FN-EDA degradation in lung
fibroblasts. We will determine if FN-EDA half-life differs in diseased vs. healthy lung fibroblasts and examine if
defects in lysosomal FN-EDA degradation account for increased FN-EDA levels in diseased fibroblasts.
Mechanistically, we will determine if the EDA domain is modified by ubiquitin to direct FN-EDA degradation. Our
second aim is to determine if the repurposed drug Lonafarnib reduces FN-EDA levels and fibrotic responses in
vitro and in vivo in a bleomycin-induced model of murine pulmonary fibrosis. We show that the drug lonafarnib
increased lysosomal activity and reduces FN-EDA levels in vitro. We will build on this data and determine IC50
values for lonafarnib in vitro in primary lung fibroblasts and human precision-cut lung slices, In vivo, we will use
an established model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis to test if lonafarnib reduces lung fibrosis. This
proposal is a direct result of my K08-specific training plan and activities and builds on our published work
examining FN-EDA degradation. I learned high throughput screening methodologies to apply to my research
questions as part of my K08 and have developed assays for use in this proposal. This work will inform a larger,
more comprehensive R01 proposal in 24 months’ time. My work will be completed within the Division of
Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, which is committed to the
development of physician-scientists."

intersectional identities. For example, STB prevalence varies by rurality, such that rural sexual minorities have
higher STB prevalence than urban sexual minorities. Regardless of one’s identities, STB risk occurs in acute

10879141,"Group A Streptococcus (GAS, S. pyogenes) remains a major public health threat. This widespread Gram-
positive bacterial pathogen causes acute invasive diseases and gives rise to severe autoimmune sequelae,
and is responsible for morbidity and mortality on a global scale. An essential virulence factor of GAS, the
antigenically variable M protein, enables the bacterium to evade opsonophagocytic killing by the immune
system. The M protein confers this indispensable function of phagocyte resistance by recruiting specific soluble
human proteins to the GAS surface that block the deposition of the major opsonin C3b as well as antigen-
specific opsonic antibodies — namely, C4b-binding protein (C4BP), factor H (FH), and fibrinogen (Fg). In
some GAS strains, an M-like protein serves this function. More than 220 M types are known, and while most M
protein types bind C4BP, FH, or Fg, or a combination of these, no consensus binding motif is evident in M and
M-like proteins for any of these human proteins, except most recently for C4BP due to our breakthrough. This
is because the exposed portion of the M protein that recruits these anti-opsonic human proteins is
sequence variable. While inhibition of these interactions has been shown to render GAS sensitive to immune
killing, the lack of consensus binding motifs has hindered the therapeutic goal of targeting these
interactions. Our recent breakthrough, reported in Buffalo et al., offers a solution to this problem. In effect, we
found that hidden within the variable region of many M proteins is a three-dimensional (3D) pattern that
is conserved for binding C4BP. This 3D C4BP-binding pattern in the M protein is dispersed (or hidden)
within a sea of variable amino acids, which makes the 3D pattern nearly impossible to identify by primary
sequence alone. However with structural knowledge in hand as a guiding template, the 3D pattern becomes
easily recognizable within the primary sequence of many M types. We hypothesize that just as with C4BP,
hidden within the variable regions of M and M-like proteins are 3D patterns that are conserved for
binding FH and Fg. We propose to test this emerging theme of conservation hidden within variability by
unveiling potentially conserved FH- and Fg-binding 3D patterns in M and M-like proteins. We also propose to
complete our work on C4BP, as the 3D pattern we discovered and published in Buffalo et al. explains only
about a half of the set of M proteins implicated in C4BP binding. We propose to carry this out through X-ray
crystallography. We have an extensive record of success with crystallographic studies of the M protein, and
have obtained initial co-crystals of M proteins bound to C4BP, FH, and Fg. In each case, we will take
advantage of the highly detailed level of information provided by our structural studies to determine the precise
functional contributions of each of these interactions to virulence through our long-standing collaboration with
co-Investigator Victor Nizet (UCSD). The results from our studies will provide essential guidance in designing
anti-virulence strategies, and may have applications in the development of a broadly neutralizing GAS vaccine."

Thailand has the highest HIV prevalence rate in the Asian-Pacific region, with an estimated 1.2% of its adult
population infected. Currently there are 0.5 million of PLWH living in Thailand, with a handful of populations
more vulnerable to HIV, including men who have sex with men (MSM) (9.2-40%), transgender individuals
(12%), sex workers (1-16%), and substance users (19%). Also, the overall mortality rate among Thai PLWH
was 3.56%. This high mortality rate explained the notable HIV treatment cascade issues in Thailand. An
important reason is HIV-related stigma still poses significant barriers for Thai PLWH to access healthcare and
carry out health-protective behaviors to engage in care, including adherence to medications. The purpose of
this study is to culturally adapt and evaluate the feasibility of a 4 weekly 2-hour group-based stigma reduction
intervention protocol to promote health engagement. The scientific premise is, Buddhist-Thai culture provides a
unique cultural context for Thai PLWH to understand HIV stigma and sufferings. Our hypothesis is that Thai
PLWH will display lower internal stigma and more care engagement following the intervention. This study
addresses the critical need to optimize care engagement through addressing HIV stigma within the local
cultural contexts. Our long-term goal is comprehensive, culturally-sensitive stigma reduction intervention for
Thai PLWH. We will conduct a mixed-methods study with two study phases. In Phase 1, we will collect
qualitative data through conducting 30 in-depth interviews with Thai PLWH to revise our cultural
conceptualization of stigma process. In Phase 2, we will conduct a pilot randomized-controlled trial (RCT) to
test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the adapted stigma reduction intervention among
80 Thai PLWH. Innovations include: 1. proposing a cultural approach to examining HIV stigma and
intervention, to increase feasibility and acceptability for PLWH in Thailand, and allow for generalizability of
findings to other PLWH populations in countries influenced by Buddhist culture; and 2. contributing to further
expanding the toolbox of interventions for HIV stigma reduction, given many modern interventions have
adapted principles of Buddhist philosophy. Aims are to: 1. Follow the ADAPT-ITT model to culturally adapt an
evidence-based stigma reduction intervention (Phase 1). 2. Evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and
preliminary efficacy with a randomized-controlled trial among 80 Thai PLWH and assess outcomes with both
subjective and objective measures (Phase 2). 3. Revise and finalize the study protocols for future project
operation by documenting emerging difficulties and solutions throughout this pilot project implementation.
Culturally-sensitive stigma reduction intervention is a promising intervention to assist Thai PLWH in decreasing
internal stigma and promoting health engagement, and hence help address HIV epidemics in this underserved
population."

10879146,"Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, such as preeclampsia (PEC) cause significant maternal
morbidity and mortality, and have emerged as an important early life, and potentially modifiable, risk factor
of heart disease in younger women. PEC is diagnosed as new onset hypertension after 20 weeks gestation
with evidence of end organ damage, thought to occur because of placental ischemia and an imbalance of
angiogenesis. Importantly, PEC is associated with significantly increased CVD risk that persists into later
life, far beyond the pregnancy period. Understanding how PEC affects cardiovascular (CV) health both from
a biological and socio-behavioral perspective (ie. socially constructed gender roles and stress) is critical to
inform risk communication, stratification and to identify and target new treatments to reduce CV disease
(CVD), especially among young, high risk women.
 Although patients with PEC often have traditional pre-pregnancy CV risk factors such as type 2
diabetes and obesity, these risk factors do not fully explain the elevated CV risk conferred after a pregnancy
complicated by PEC. Two factors thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of PEC and injure endothelial
cells are an imbalance of angiogenesis and alterations in renin-angiotensin-system (RAS), driven by
placental ischemia and resulting in oxidative stress with systemic inflammation. From a socio-behavioral
perspective, there is evidence that social determinants of health and psychological stress influence PEC
severity and future CVD outcomes. Women’s lived experience, including how they experience socially
constructed gender roles, stress and neighborhood factors affect health outcomes significantly in PEC. We
recently developed noninvasive, reproducible MRI-based methods to measure coronary endothelial function
(CEF), offering a means to probe mechanisms contributing to coronary artery disease (CAD) pathophysiology
in postpartum women with recent PEC. Abnormal CEF plays a critical role in the development, progression
and clinical manifestations of CAD, independently predicts CV events, and is a target for medical
interventions. We propose in this application to determine in postpartum women with PEC: 1) whether CEF,
and markers of inflammation/imbalanced angiogenesis are inversely related and 2) whether measures of
stress (both psychosocial stress and physiologic measures) are associated with endothelial abnormalities
and postpartum hypertension. We will determine, in women with a history of PEC, whether reduced CEF can
be explained, at least in part, by increased inflammation/abnormal angiogenesis/stress. Together these
studies will offer new pathophysiologic insights into increased CVD risk in women with PEC, and which
factors contribute most to vascular dysfunction. This study, if funded, will address significant knowledge
gaps regarding sex and gender specific variables that affect postpartum vascular health in young
women and provide data to design future interventional studies to improve health outcomes in PEC."

The overarching goal of this candidate’s research is to address the health care needs of underrepresented
children diagnosed with a resonance disorder of hypernasality to establish potential programs and interventions
to increase access to needed health care services. The focus is hypernasality which is a resonance disorder
where excessive sound resonates from the nasal cavity during speech for a child who has undergone a primary
cleft palate repair called a palatoplasty.6 The main cause of a resonance disorder is Velopharyngeal Pharyngeal
Incompetence (VPI) which is typically evident post primary cleft palate repair and is characterized as
hypernasality which can affect an individual’s speech intelligibility. Post cleft palate repair, VPI can alter speech
outcomes. After surgical intervention, speech therapy is often needed to address VPI. Timing is key at improving
resonance for children who exhibit hypernasality.13 The proposed research will address finding barriers to speech
therapy services for underrepresented populations to ascertain their access to health care services. To achieve
this, we will use MarketScan databases to evaluate access to speech therapy services. Completion of this project
will advance the candidate’s pursuit of addressing health care disparities for underrepresented populations as it
relates to receiving speech therapy and health care services as an independent clinical research scientist.
To achieve the goals of this research plan and transition to independence, the candidate requires further
development in 1) secondary analysis of administrative data, 2) expertise in qualitative methods research to
inform and evaluate barriers to health care access, and 3) professional development as an independent
researcher. This proposal includes a strong team of mentors. Dr. Katie Suda is the Primary Investigator (PI) of
this grant and has multiple R01s, Dr. Leah Fabiano has significant training in health disparities research and R01
funding, Dr. Mandy Hampton Wray has a background in behavioral research as it relates to speech disorders
and R01 funding. Lastly, Dr. Noel Jabbour is a well-respected Otolaryngologist and has successfully published
research focused on children with cleft palate."

The retinal pigment epithelium-choriocapillaris (RPE-CC) complex is the primary site of disease pathogenesis in
several eye diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and related macular dystrophies, like
Sorsby’s fundus dystrophy (SFD). Notably, sub-RPE accumulation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3
(TIMP3) is a prominent feature of SFD/AMD. However, it is not known “how” sub-RPE TIMP3 accumulation
promotes SFD/AMD pathology. This is partially because the RPE-CC is a functional composite making it difficult
to study the contribution of spatial changes in RPE versus CC layer during disease development in vivo.
Furthermore, the lack of a representative model of the RPE-CC in vitro has significantly impacted our ability to
study RPE-CC interaction in vitro. Using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we have developed an iPSC-
RPE-CC model that recapitulate key features of both healthy and AMD/SFD eyes. Specifically, iPSC-RPE-CC
shows evidence of fenestrated CC-like vasculature and Bruch’s membrane like ECM. Similarly, SFD iPSC-RPE-
CC displays two central hallmarks of SFD/AMD, drusen and choroidal neovascularization (CNV)-like pathology.
Notably, longitudinal analyses of control versus SFD iPSC-model showed that sub-RPE TIMP3 accumulation
occurs relatively early and precedes maculopathy cellular events. Furthermore, our preliminary proof of concept
studies shows that sub-RPE TIMP3 accumulation in the SFD iPSC model promotes pro-maculopathy cellular
changes via dysregulated lipid metabolism and sterile inflammation. Based on these strong preliminary studies,
the overall goal of this proposal is to establish the independent contribution of sub-RPE TIMP3 accumulation to
AMD/SFD pathology development. We will perform spatial (RPE versus CC) and temporal (e.g., prior and after
drusen formation) manipulation of TIMP3 expression/activity in i) SFD iPSC-RPE-CC and ii) control iPSC-RPE-
CC cultures (iPSCs derived from healthy subjects with normal vision) to test the hypotheses that sub-RPE TIMP3
accumulation leads to dysregulated lipid metabolism and sterile inflammation and consequently i) drusen
beneath the RPE monolayer and ii) CC atrophy and CNV. From a therapeutic standpoint, we will
pharmacologically target dysregulated lipid metabolism and sterile inflammation in SFD/AMD iPSC models."

Up to one-third of young adults report use of marijuana or alcohol in the past month, with 8% reporting daily
marijuana use and 32% engaging in heavy episodic drinking. Marijuana and alcohol use peak during emerging
adulthood and can still have an impact on the developing brain. Both substances are associated with lower
academic achievement, negative health effects, addiction, and driving impairment and injury. Simultaneous
alcohol and marijuana (SAM) use, defined as use of both substances at the same time or in close proximation
of each other with overlapping effects, is common among young adults. Past research has shown that SAM
use occurs in almost one-fourth of young adults and can lead to more negative consequences than use of
either substance alone. Though brief interventions have been developed for alcohol and marijuana use
independently, many are targeted to college populations. Young adults in the community who are at risk for
developing substance use disorders (SUDs) often have more limited options. Targeting protective behavioral
strategies (PBS), such as setting limits on the frequency of SAM use, may help reduce negative consequences
and prevent development of SUD. No current intervention addresses SAM use and few leverage new
technological methods (e.g., smartphones) or strategies (e.g., PBS) to engage young adults. Ecological
momentary interventions (EMIs) and just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) offer opportunity for
interventions on SAM use by delivering intervention components in real-time, in a person's natural
environment, using mobile devices. Technological advances afford increased adaptability to support an
individual as his/her context changes, when the individual is receptive and in need of assistance. The goal of
this treatment development project is to develop an adaptive EMI (a-EMI) that is grounded in self-regulation
and social cognitive theories. To determine the most efficacious intervention strategies, we will utilize the
Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) framework. Historically, most interventions are built initially as a
package of strategies, from which it is difficult to determine the most effective components. As an alternative,
the MOST framework allows for successive testing of intervention components to identify the best combination.
Following pilot testing, we will assess the feasibility and efficacy of intervention components on two outcomes
(negative consequences and PBS) using a fractional factorial experimental design, with post-assessment and
one- and three-month follow-ups. 136 diverse young adults recruited from primary care clinics who report
current SAM use will be randomly assigned to one of eight groups, representing experimental conditions that
include or do not include intervention strategies focused on craving reduction and PBS. As a result of this
process, individual and/or combined components that lead to improved outcomes will be retained in a
subsequent randomized controlled trial, while ineffective components will be eliminated."

Pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) are the only radiographically identifiable precursor to deadly pancreatic
carcinoma and they are detected in a million people annually in the U.S. Most patients with PCLs have
“indeterminate” cysts in which both the type and histologic grade are clinically and radiographically uncertain.
Currently used cyst fluid diagnostics suffer from poor accuracy and they typically require large volumes of
fluid that are unavailable in ~50% of cases, leading to both missed cancers and unnecessary major surgery.
In this proposal, we leverage our novel multiplex substrate profiling by mass spectrometry method combined
with proteomics to refine target proteins and then validate our two-tier classifier for the identification of
mucinous PCLs with high grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma, together considered advanced neoplasia
(AN). The final clinical assay requires only 5 µL of fluid. A micro-volumetric assay is expected to improve the
diagnostic yield of cyst fluid testing from ~50% to >90% for patients who undergo routine invasive testing. The
Tier-1 classifier identifies mucinous PCLs, which carry variable risk of malignant transformation, thereby
potentially removing ~25% of patients with non-mucinous PCLs from the need for further surveillance or
surgery. We will validate the Tier-1 classifier with PCL samples from the Early Detection Research Network
(EDRN), a histologically diverse, well- annotated biorepository + untested samples from UCSF and UCLA. We
will further test and refine our Tier-2 classifier for the identification of AN using untested banked mucinous
PCLs from UCSF, and then validate it using external samples from the EDRN and prospectively collected
samples from UCSF and UCLA to prioritize detection of AN while minimizing the burdens of overtreatment.
We will also use our radiology search engine, mPower, to improve capture of “missed” patients with incidental
clinically relevant PCLs, and we will thereby expand the racial and ethnic diversity of our Panc Cyst Registry.
Our registry is a prospective longitudinal research resource that uses patient-directed input and includes
demographic and lifestyle information. Together these novel tools are expected to make a significant impact
on the management of “indeterminate” PCLs and improve the detection of early-stage pancreatic cancer,
while reducing the burdens of overdiagnosis and overtreatment."
10866996,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The proposed research will use behavioral, neuroimaging, and naturalistic approaches to understand the
neurobiological mechanisms underlying daily life activity participation in older adults and its relationship to
cognition and emotional experience. There is a strong foundation of research demonstrating reliable age-
related decreases in many aspects of cognitive ability that are coupled with changes in the locus coeruleus-
norepinephrine system, with the locus coeruleus identified as one the earliest sites of Alzheimer’s disease
pathology. In parallel, engagement in a wide variety of activities and experiences in daily life has been
associated with the maintenance of cognitive function, emotional well-being, and brain structure and function.
Although there have been theoretical developments linking cognition, locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system
function, and exposure to environments enriched with variety and novelty, with resilience to Alzheimer’s
disease pathology, there have been no studies that have rigorously tested this construct in humans. The
current proposal provides a novel perspective on this issue, by employing a multilevel, multi-modal framework
to study the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms underlying age-related shifts in activity participation,
and to directly link these changes with in vivo measurements of the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system
and Alzheimer’s disease pathology. The project directly tests the hypothesis that varied and diverse activity
participation in daily life contexts is associated with cognition and emotional experience by using the
combination of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and novel passive sensing approaches involving
repeated sampling of daily life activities, experiences, and locations/contexts across the adult life span.
Further, these rich naturalistic observations of daily life activities are coupled with ultra-high-resolution imaging
measures of locus coeruleus structural integrity to test for the relationship between the integrity of the locus
coeruleus-norepinephrine system and daily life activities and experiences in older adults. Finally, the project
will feature the first-ever assessment of the relationship between in vivo markers of Alzheimer’s disease
pathology and daily life activity participation in older adults, using state-of-the-art tau PET and intensively
sampled daily life activity participation assessed with both EMA and cutting-edge passive sensing methods. A
key component of the project is its exploration of mobile technologies as a means to monitor older adult activity
participation during daily life, and their potential utility as a tool to enhance cognitive and brain health. As such,
the proposed work represents an essential first step in developing both behavioral and biological targets for
motivational interventions that promote the maintenance of cognitive health and resilience to pathology in older
adulthood."

Despite significant advances in secondary prevention, recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) remains a major
cause of morbidity and mortality. In the U.S., nearly 1 million adults have an MI each year, approximately 1/3 of
which are recurrent. Patients surviving their first MI are at a high risk of recurrent events. In those who do develop
recurrent MI, the annual mortality rate increases to 10%, two-fold higher than after their first MI. While much work
has been done to identify common genetic variation for incident coronary artery disease, there is a large gap in
the literature as to what variants contribute to recurrent MI. While overlap likely exists, there are distinct biological
features between the development of atherosclerosis and recurrent MI. In Dr. Marston’s preliminary work, he
tested a validated incident CAD genome-wide polygenic risk score in a post-MI population and found that it did
not predict recurrent MI. This finding formed his central hypothesis that genetic predictors for recurrent MI differ
from those that predict incident CAD. Until recently, datasets did not exist to test this hypothesis. However, large
amounts of genotyped and sequenced data from randomized clinical trials in post-MI patients are now available,
allowing both discovery and clinical application of germline and somatic mutations associated with recurrent MI.
In this proposal, Dr. Marston will leverage 9 cardiovascular clinical trials from the TIMI Study Group to test his
hypothesis in three specific aims. First, Dr. Marston will define the role of common genetic variation and develop
a polygenic risk score for predicting recurrent MI using 14K cases of recurrent MI and 69K MI controls. Novel
variants for recurrent MI will be identified through large-scale genome-wide association studies and validated for
their ability to predict risk in patients following their first MI. Second, Dr. Marston will determine whether rare
genetic variation or clonal hematopoiesis is associated with recurrent MI using exome sequencing data in 9K
recurrent MI cases and 39K MI controls. Third, Dr. Marston will use randomized clinical trial data to test for gene
x treatment interactions across 5 secondary prevention therapies with a polygenic risk score and across 2
secondary prevention therapies with CHIP. The presence of a gene x treatment interaction can be used to inform
therapeutic decision making and tailored therapy. This work will take place in the Division of Cardiovascular
Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a core teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School. Dr. Marston
will perform the research under the mentorship of Dr. Marc Sabatine, Chairman of the TIMI Study Group, and
Dr. Patrick Ellinor, Director of the Cardiovascular Disease Initiative at the Broad Institute. Dr. Marston’s goal is
to become a genetic epidemiologist and clinical trialist with the ability to build large important datasets and use
state of the art computational approaches to identify novel insights into the prevention and treatment of CAD. He
is dedicated to becoming an independent investigator and using his K08 work as a foundation for an R01, in
which he will apply genetic risk markers to improve clinical trial design and optimize precision in cardiovascular
care."

As the older population increases, it is also becoming more diverse, reflecting U.S. demographic changes as a
whole. There is a disproportionate burden of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) disparities
among racial and ethnic minority populations and the lack of an evidence base to effectively prevent and reduce
these disparities. There is urgent need to cultivate a cadre of health disparities researchers who can advance
translational research in aging and ADRD disparities in both clinical practices and community-based settings.
My overarching aim with this K07 award is to provide training and mentorship opportunities in participatory
research principles, health disparities research methods, systems science approaches, and dissemination and
implementation research methods while convening a network of transdisciplinary faculty andcommunity advisors
that supports mentored career development opportunities for aging and ADRD disparities research. With this
proposal I seek to: 1) Establish a research training program to build academic capacity and leadership to advance
the science of aging and ADRD health disparities; 2) Advance innovative participatory, systems science, and
implementation science frameworks and methods for aging and ADRD research in minority and health disparity
populations through curriculum development, pilot awards, and applied training opportunities; and 3) Mentor
junior scientists in applying multi-level, community-engaged frameworks and rigorous methods to advance the
science of aging and ADRD health disparities research. Approximately 50 faculty and postdoctoral fellows from
NYU will participate in various K07 trainings, collaborative courses, and pilot projects for aging and ADRD
disparities research. In addition, I will mentor approximately 12 mentees in aging and ADRD research. This K07
award will provide necessary support and time for me to: 1) develop and formalize a robust training and
mentorship program that would provide the foundation for securing a T32 or similar training mechanisms to build
the research workforce pipeline for aging and ADRD disparities research; 2) institutionalize a rigorous training
program on fundamental and cutting-edge health disparities research methods into existing infrastructures to
ensure long-term program sustainability; and 3) deepen my expertise and leadership in system science
approaches and its integration with participatory research and implementation science frameworks relevant to
aging and ADRD research. The impact of this K07 award will both accelerate the science of aging and ADRD
disparities research and promote the training and career development of the next generation of aging and ADRD
researchers to address NIA priorities."

Enteroviruses are human pathogens that replicate in multiple organs and cause a variety of diseases,
including gastroenteritis, pneumonia, myocarditis, and encephalitis. Currently, little is known about how
enteroviruses alter the biology of infected cells. This proposed project, which is founded on our recent
publication documenting the cellular proteins that enteroviral proteases target for cleavage, will elucidate
the role of enteroviral proteases in changing the host cell enviornment during infection.
The initial investigations of a subset of cleavage targets have so far yielded two candidate proteins,
LSM14A and IRF2BP2, which activated innate immune signaling and inhibited viral replication in cultured
cells. Our mechanistic studies have begun to reveal the molecular details of how these proteins limit virus
infection and whether their innate immune functions are required for viral inhibition. These preliminary
findings have built the foundation to characterize other host targets and determine their ability to regulate
enterovirus infection.
We have established a toolkit of novel methodologies and reagents that will enable the proposed work.
For example, we have implemented an innovative experimental system that consists of human induced
pluripotent stem cell-derived mesenchyme-free intestinal epithelial cells, which are highly susceptible to
enteroviruses and respond to infection by triggering a robust innate immune program. Similarly, we have
generated human cell lines containing interferon-stimulated genes tagged at their endogenous loci with
fluorescent proteins, allowing real-time monitoring of immune induction in response to viral infections.
We will employ these and other tools to investigate the molecular details of how the host target LSM14A
activates innate immune signaling and inhibit viral infections (Aim 1); dissect the function of IRF2BP2 in
the enterovirus lifecycle (Aim 2); and generate a comprehensive list of functionally important target
proteins that have roles in enterovirus infection and/or antiviral innate immunity (Aim 3).
Completion of these aims will reveal host restriction factors against enteroviral replication as well as their
mechanisms of action. More broadly, this project will advance the understanding of enteroviral
pathogenesis and potentially inform the design of broadly acting preventive and therapeutic strategies
against enteroviral infections."
10867715,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Metabolic dysfunction is a prominent contributor to the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD),
evidenced by brain glucose hypometabolism observed decades prior to the development of AD symptoms.
Despite occurring early in disease and prior to or exceeding to brain volume changes, reduced metabolic
demand is often assumed to be due to the loss of neurons. However, recent studies indicate that complex
alterations to mitochondrial function in both neurons and glial cells may be the culprit.
 Mitochondria is the powerhouse in cells to generate energy and keep metabolic cycles turning through
oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which is driven by the electron transport chain (ETC) consisting of five
enzyme complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane. As the gateway to the ETC, mitochondrial complex-I
(MC-1) is responsible for recycling NAD and translocating protons to produce ATP down the ETC. In murine
models of AD, disruption of mitochondrial activities caused by tau and Ab pathogenic aggregates have been
identified much earlier than the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques. Recent study in early
AD patients showed that MC-1 related energy failure may precede glycolysis related hypometabolism in
regions with pathologically confirmed early neurodegeneration in AD. The MC-1 dysfunction in early AD
presents an opportunity for the development of new therapies at early entry points during AD progression.
Indeed, partial inhibition of MC-1 has been exploited as a novel strategy for AD in many clinical trials, as
emerging data suggest that in response to environmental stress, mitochondria initiate an integrated stress
response shown to be beneficial for healthy aging and neuroprotection. This strategy is counterintuitive from
the conventional remedies of enhancing mitochondrial function to aid in healthy aging. Regardless of the
treatment strategies, a non-invasively technique to monitor response to metabolic-targeting therapies is an
unmet need. [18F]FDG PET only measures glucose uptake and does not differentiate glucose phosphorylation
vs. OXPHOS. Methods to non-invasively image both the MC-1 availability and metabolic function in vivo will
revolutionize how we study mitochondrial health in AD.
 In this exploratory study, we will evaluate the feasibility of two novel scanning techniques in AD models to
1) image the availability of MC-1 using 1[18F]BCPP-EF PET tracer which specifically binds to MC1 receptors
and to 2) assess the MC-1 metabolic activity using hyperpolarized MR spectroscopy to observe the metabolic
conversion of [2-13C]pyruvate to [5-13C]glutamate, a process occurring in mitochondria that utilizes NAD
regenerated by MC-1. The success of these techniques will represent a significant departure from the current
approach of ex vivo analyses. By completing the proposed study, we will have obtained important feasibility
data for future development of a Hyper-PET imaging technique to assess both the availability and metabolic
function of MC-1 simultaneously and non-invasively in AD animal models and AD patients in the future."

Unhealthy alcohol use has increased significantly among aging women, raising their risk of serious alcohol
related adverse consequences. At the same time, they are less likely than men to access treatment, and this is
exacerbated among racial/ethnic minority women. Health care providers and systems will face an increasing
number of aging women with alcohol problems, often with co-occurring health conditions that would improve
with reduced drinking. Currently, there is limited research on the growing needs of this aging population,
including on how racial/ethnic minority women may be disproportionately impacted by unhealthy alcohol use
and on how to develop effective interventions. To understand these critical gaps and inform a holistic approach
to alcohol-related healthcare, we propose a mixed-method study of over one million (1,298,009) aging women
(≥age 50) in a diverse health care delivery system of over 4.5 million members. We leverage unique
longitudinal electronic health record (EHR) data from a universal alcohol screening program in primary care,
with an estimated 784,794 aging women regularly screened for unhealthy alcohol use at multiple primary care
visits between 2014-2022. We integrate screening data with a NIAAA-funded alcohol registry that contains
medical and psychiatric diagnoses, self-report health behaviors (e.g. tobacco, exercise, interpersonal violence
screening), and health service encounters across clinical settings. Our approach is guided by a conceptual
model that incorporates Intersectionality Theory and the Andersen’s Model of Health Services Utilization. We
first identify trends and predictors of unhealthy alcohol use (defined as exceeding guidelines or alcohol use
disorder) among aging women overall and by age and race/ethnicity. Second, we test whether health services
utilization (e.g., routine primary care visits, brief alcohol interventions, medications, and addiction and/or
psychiatry treatment) is associated with reductions in alcohol use over time among all aging women who report
unhealthy alcohol use and among subsets with co-occurring health conditions (e.g., chronic pain,
depression/anxiety, diabetes and hypertension) and medication use (e.g., opioids). Across each aim, we
examine racial/ethnic differences to identify potential disparities. We use advanced causal modeling
approaches to analyze hypothesized relationships, and to appropriately control for potential confounding and
biases. For a deeper understanding of these vulnerable patients’ needs and potential barriers to care, we
conduct qualitative interviews with aging women who report unhealthy alcohol use and with providers who care
for them in different medical settings (e.g. primary care, geriatrics, addiction medicine), which we triangulate
with the quantitative data. Findings will provide urgently needed evidence on how health services can impact
unhealthy alcohol use, so that health care systems can better identify and treat this vulnerable population
through targeted interventions."

analysis, and reporting of high-quality, high-impact clinical trials - including complex, multicomponent, and
multiphase treatments (Didactic Interactions); 2) to support interdisciplinary research collaborations that promote
innovation and excellence in conducting multi-site clinical trials (Mentored Collaborative Opportunities); 3) to
develop critically needed techniques in measurement and understanding of neurobiological mechanisms and
biobehavioral outcomes in pediatric medical rehabilitation (Techniques Development); 4) to fund pilot studies via
partnerships with leading national organizations to yield data for informing competitive NIH applications in
pediatric medical rehabilitation (Pilot Studies); and 5) to promote PedRehab Ctr expertise by advertising and
coordinating with major associations and to prepare a much-needed comprehensive, interdisciplinary reference
manual (online and dynamically updated) addressing issues inherent in pediatric medical rehabilitation research
(Promoting Center Expertise). Our analysis of critical gaps, obstacles, and opportunities in pediatric rehabilitation
research informs the strategies we propose to achieve these aims.
 The administrative organization and operational plan for PedRehab Ctr will realize efficiencies, leverage
resources, and ensure broad outreach through partnerships with leading organizations, research networks, and
special interest groups. PedRehab Ctr will convene a National Advisory Group with patient/parent representation
to assist in plans for and evaluation of PedRehab Ctr activities. PedRehab Ctr proposes approaches to increase
diversity in the pediatric rehabilitation workforce and research. Our PedRehab Ctr core team at Virginia Tech,
The Ohio State University, and Nationwide Children's Hospital has deep expertise and unique labs that support
developmental science, neuroimaging, pediatric neurology, occupational therapy, physical therapy, medical
rehabilitation science, bioengineering, research design and regulations, and Implementation Science. PedRehab
Ctr activities will build on our leadership roles in NIH multisite randomized controlled trials (Phase II and III), our
Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSAs), NIH research networks, NIH training programs in
translational biomedical and implementation science, and national organizations. Collectively, PedRehab Ctr has
the potential to increase the number of scientifically rigorous, productive, and high-impact clinical trials in
pediatric medical rehabilitation. In turn, the expansion and effective implementation of scientific findings from
these trials will likely produce widespread and enduring improvements in functional outcomes, health, and
productivity of individuals affected by childhood-onset disorders and disabilities."

Cerebrovascular diseases remain a leading cause of serious long-term disability. Many of these diseases
originate, at least in part, from genetic defects that impact the development and maturation of blood vessels in
the central nervous system (CNS) and meninges. Despite substantial progress in our understanding of CNS
angiogenesis and barriergenesis, our knowledge of the highly permeable, or fenestrated, microvasculature
formed in the choroid plexus (CP) and circumventricular organs remains limited. The overall goal of this
proposal is to fill this gap in scientific knowledge by understanding the molecular genetic mechanisms of
fenestrated brain vascular development, specifically focusing on the CP. We recently found that CP
vascularization in zebrafish requires a unique angiogenic mechanism whereby zebrafish vascular endothelial
growth factor (Vegf) orthologs, specifically Vegfab and Vegfc, play a functionally redundant role. Surprisingly,
this mechanism is specific to CP vascularization, since the neighboring non-fenestrated brain vasculature is
not affected in the vegfab;vegfc double mutants. These results led us to formulate a paradigm-shifting
hypothesis that fenestrated CP and non-fenestrated brain vascular development requires distinct sets of the
Vegf/Vegfr codes and signaling. Given the critical roles for Vegfs in diverse pathophysiological processes and
also the fact that no molecular cue that drives CP vascularization has been reported in any vertebrate species,
the results of this study will have a significant positive impact on the fields of CP physiology and vascular
biology beyond CP vascularization. Our further genetic, pharmacological, and expression data propose a
model in which paracrine Vegfab from CP epithelial cells and autocrine Vegfc from the endothelium together
controls CP vascularization via PI3K and ERK signaling pathways. The following two Specific Aims are
proposed to test our hypotheses. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that fenestrated CP and non-fenestrated brain
vascular development requires distinct Vegf/Vegfr codes and signaling. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that the
spatiotemporal coordination of paracrine Vegfab from CP epithelial cells and autocrine Vegfc from the
endothelium together drives fenestrated CP vascular development. We will pursue these aims by combining
novel zebrafish molecular genetic tools with advanced imaging technologies and genetic mosaic analyses. The
proposed work is an innovative molecular genetics study in this field because it exploits various strengths of
the zebrafish model to overcome technical limitations and address the following fundamental processes: 1) the
cellular and molecular basis of fenestrated CP vascular development; and 2) the developmental mechanisms
behind the formation of heterogeneous brain vascular networks. Mechanistic information gleaned from this
work will shed new light on potential molecular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of CP vascular
malformations and also help to design therapeutics for preventing or treating CNS vascular diseases."

10870133,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The overarching goal of my research program is to understand how the human genome is faithfully
replicated when it is constantly damaged by covalent modifications that can alter its coding properties. A focus
is on translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), the predominant DNA damage tolerance (DDT) pathway utilized in
humans to replicate damaged DNA. TLS utilizes specialized DNA polymerases that can accommodate an
array of DNA damages, albeit with lowered fidelities, and promotes cell survival in the face of DNA damage by
allowing replication of a damaged genome to continue. However, tight regulation is critical as aberrant TLS can
selectively propagate cells with increased mutagenesis and chromosomal rearrangements, which can lead to
cancer. Furthermore, because TLS promotes cell survival after exposure to DNA damaging agents, aberrant
TLS can also afford cancer cells the ability to overcome common chemotherapies that aim to trigger cell death
by acutely damaging DNA. Hence, TLS is a promising candidate for targeted cancer co-therapy. Despite the
established links between human health and TLS, the progression and regulation of TLS is unclear and many
key gaps persist in our fundamental knowledge that cloud our understanding of the contribution of TLS to
genetic inheritance and carcinogenesis. For example, human DDT can occur by at least three pathways but
what is the interplay between TLS and other DDT pathways? My long-standing interests and vast expertise in
human DNA damage repair and replication and my established ability to utilize a multi-faceted approach
integrating molecular biology, biochemistry, and biophysics provide a unique opportunity to fill these gaps. This
proposal will address the progression and regulation of TLS by tackling two broad areas that are each a
cornerstone of our fundamental understanding of TLS and DDT in general; 1) Activation of TLS and; 2) The
interplay between DDT pathways. To do so, we design and apply unique, quantitative approaches that utilize
kinetic techniques and can be adapted to many biological scenarios.
 The PCNA sliding clamp is an essential DNA replication factor and is monoubiquitinated at sites of DNA
damage by the Rad6(Rad18)2 complex. PCNA monoubiquitination is imperative for human TLS and activates
this critical pathway by recruiting TLS factors. Area 1 will investigate how the activity of the human
Rad6(Rad18)2 complex is regulated to efficiently monoubiquitinate PCNA at DNA damage sites, activating
TLS. Human DDT can occur by at least three pathways including TLS and all emanate from a common
intermediate. Area 2 will investigate the interplay between TLS and other DDT pathways and decipher
functional relationships between key events in each pathway. This proposal investigates TLS in broad contexts
that consider the complexities and dynamics of cellular environments and will significantly advance our
fundamental understanding of how the human genome is faithfully replicated in the face of DNA damage and
inspire new avenues of research in cancer etiology and treatment."

Our long-term goal to establish sustainable, patient-centered interventions at the patient level to engage patients
in safety and prevention by offsetting barriers such as physical and sensory limitations that prohibit them from
actively helping themselves. Unfortunately, older adults are at highest risk for infections and yet while hand
hygiene is the single most important way to prevent the spread of infection, mechanisms for older adults to
minimize their own risk for infections is often overlooked. Many contamination elements exist in hospital
settings and for older adults they will encounter high-touch surfaces and medical devices that harbor pathogens
that lead to infections. However, without assistance, hand-hygiene practice rates are poor among hospitalized
older adults’ due to frailty, limited dexterity and mobility, cognitive limitations, and risk of falling, which
prohibits their independent use of visible hand- hygiene products (e.g., wall dispensers, towelettes, in-room
sinks). New solutions are necessary. Therefore, in this proposal, we have updated our investigator-developed,
technology-enhanced patient hand hygiene system. Clean Hands Accessible and Manageable for Patients
(CHAMPs), our investigator-developed and pilot tested bed rail-affixed hand-sanitizing dispenser, which
features verbal, auditory and visual reminders to remind patients to clean their hands. The safe and easily
accessible motion-sensing system with usage tracking requires very little physical effort, as users need only to be
able to freely move their upper extremities and reach over to the bed rail to clean their hands when prompted
(e.g. before meal times). Our pilot results among both a small group of older adults and in a high-tech simulated
environment demonstrated both efficacy and feasibility of the intervention. In this 4-year project, we propose a
large heterogeneous randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing two groups of hospitalized adults ≥ 65 years
in two public hospitals, one group receives CHAMPs (n=125) and the other is the usual-care (UC) group (n=125).
Our research team consists of early and late stage investigators who have a successful record of working together
and are ready to address the following aims: (1) to determine the effect of CHAMPs as a method to improve hand-
hygiene behavior and reduce patients’ hand contamination, (2) assess the implementation of our intervention,
(3) examine factors that influence outcomes associated with our intervention and (4) costs and cost-effectiveness
of CHAMPs. The primary outcome is hand contamination as measured by presence, type, and quantity of colony-
forming units located on participants’ hands. Our preliminary results offer promise that the CHAMPs
technology-enhanced intervention may be an effective approach to engage patients in infection prevention as a
solution to reduce colonization and infection rates among older adults. Our proposal aligns with all four goals of
NIH/NIA’s 2020-2025 strategic plan, which is to improve the health, well-being, and independence of adults as
they age and to prevent or reduce the burden of age-related diseases, disorders, and disabilities."
10868054,"Abstract/Summary
Microfold (M) cells are specialized cells of the intestinal epithelium that are concentrated in the epithelium lying
over the lymph follicles, called the follicle associated epithelium (FAE). M cells are designed to deliver antigens
to underlying lymph tissues. Their specialized function is facilitated both by a host of receptors on their apical
surface that bind to antigens and particles and their ability to rapidly transcytose these bound antigens from the
apical surface to the basolateral surface where they are captured by immune cells within the Peyer’s patches.
M cells are also exploited as cellular portals by many enteric bacterial and viral pathogens to gain access to
the lymph system, including the bacterial pathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (Yptb). In our previous work,
we established a differentiated human ileum organoid model system on Transwells and induced M cell
development in order to study molecular mechanistic interactions between Yptb and M cells. We found that
Yptb that are not expressing the type III secretion system (T3SS) are internalized by M cells and found in the
basolateral chamber in high numbers. By contrast, Yptb that are expressing the T3SS remained bound on the
extracellular surface of M cells and induced M cell extrusion from the monolayer. Strikingly, YopE, a T3SS
effector protein, caused extrusion of M cell from the monolayer. Thus, we hypothesize that oral infection of
mice with Yptb leads to transient M cell depletion due to the YopE RhoA-GAP activity and this M cell depletion
limits superinfection by other pathogens and re-infection by Yptb. The objectives of this application are two-
fold. (1) We will use our expertise in murine infection models and determine if infection with WT-Yptb and a
type III secretion mutant, yscNU, impacts the numbers and functions of M cells in the follicle associated
epithelium. (2) We will build murine organoid/enteroid cell lines that express Cas9 only in developing M cells
and then exploit CRISPR-Cas9 techniques to selectively delete RhoA and other putative Yop targets in M cells.
This will permit us to evaluate the roles of the proteins targeted for inactivation by Yops in M cell homeostasis
and functions. By building these tools and establishing that Yptb infection depletes M cells, we will have a firm
basis to investigate the molecular mechanistic and immunological implications of Yptb-M cell interactions in a
planned R01 proposal."

The overall goal of this Northwell Roybal Coordinating Center to Accelerate Translational Aging Research
(RCC) is to provide strategic leadership, efficient coordination, effective training, and proactive dissemination
for the Edward R. Roybal Centers. We will support Roybal program scientists as they conduct translational
behavioral and social intervention development research relevant to aging and AD/ADRD. Roybal scientists will
advance progress on translational research priorities through the conduct of clinical trials in Stages 0 through V
of the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development. We will provide critical infrastructure for Roybal
Centers to conduct and disseminate scalable, principle-defined behavioral interventions that promote healthy
aging and address the burden of AD/ADRD at multiple societal levels. We will serve as the hub to facilitate and
coordinate trans-Roybal activities, and reinforce the goals of the NIH Stage Model by: 1) providing centralized
administrative support; 2) creating mechanisms for maintaining actively engaged sites; 3) promoting
educational and training opportunities; 4) disseminating scientific advances to all stakeholders; and 5)
evaluating the success of the Roybal program in achieving its agreed-upon goals.
The RCC will serve as the central resource to: 1) share best practices, and ensure scientific integrity and patient
safety for Roybal trials through a centralized Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB); 2) coordinate a
centralized annual Roybal national competition for new trials; 3) host annual meetings; 4) identify joint activities;
5) disseminate study findings and accomplishments to broad and diverse audiences; and 6) evaluate metrics in
achieving program goals. This will be accomplished through a close collaboration with NIA program officers,
Roybal Centers, and other NIA-supported centers and programs. We will leverage and expand upon existing
resources, data management systems, and partnerships to conduct activities that enhance the reach and
impact of the Roybal Centers. Our primary long-term objective is the realization of Roybal scientists’ scientific
productivity, as operationalized by the number of peer-reviewed publications and by the number of
independent grants and contract awards funding NIH stage-informed trials that result from Roybal initial
funding. Our secondary outcome is the visibility of our Roybal scientists’ impact. We will measure visibility
through publication citations, mainstream media impressions, website visits, and social media shares. We
intend that the products of these efforts will offer critical research infrastructure to advance progress on
translational research priorities in accordance with the NIH Stage Model, foster collaboration, and
disseminate to a broad and diverse audience the impact of Roybal scientists."
10863703,"Background: Social isolation is a global public health threat and a negative social determinant of health
(SDoH) that affects 1 in 5 adults in the U.S. and contributes to $6.7 billion in annual healthcare spending.
Significance: Affecting roughly 43% of Veterans, social isolation is highly prevalent among Veterans,
particularly those with a history of mental illness. Social isolation contributes to cardiovascular diseases,
dementia, depression, suicidal ideation, and premature death. To date, social isolation remains largely
unaddressed as a negative SDoH in healthcare systems. Current efforts to address social isolation are limited
by lack of diverse participant samples, rigorous methodologies, and involvement of healthcare systems to
systematically assess and reduce social isolation.
Innovation and Impact: To address these gaps, the proposed project will test a novel and feasible program to
intervene on social isolation among diverse Veteran populations in the VHA healthcare system. We propose to
test the effects of the Increasing Veterans’ Social Engagement and Connectedness (CONNECTED)
intervention on social isolation among Veterans. CONNECTED uses an innovative approach by integrating two
existing evidence-based care models: peer services and patient navigation to address social isolation among
Veterans in VHA primary care clinics. CONNECTED involves three key services delivered by peer specialists
via telehealth over 8 weeks: 1) peer support, which includes person-centered assessment of factors driving
social isolation; 2) psychosocial interventions to address Veterans’ social isolation (e.g., goal setting,
supportive therapy, and group-based social engagement activities); and 3) navigation (i.e., connecting
Veterans to social resources in the community and the VHA) to help expand their social networks. Because
prior social isolation studies have not prioritized inclusion of younger and racially/ethnically diverse samples,
we will oversample these groups using stratified random sampling.
Specific Aims: We aim for a randomized controlled clinical trial comparing CONNECTED to an attention
control group. Aim1: Test the effects of CONNECTED on social isolation at 2-, 4-, and 8-months from baseline
compared to the control group; Aim2: Test the effects of CONNECTED on secondary, health-related
outcomes; and Aim 3: Conduct formative and pre-implementation evaluations to inform future implementation
processes.
Methodology: Aims 1 and 2 involve delivering the intervention to (N=264) Veterans in VHA primary care
clinics. Data from Aims 1 and 2 will be analyzed using general linear models. In Aim 3, we will describe
Veterans (n=20) and providers’ experiences (N=10) with the intervention using semi-structured interviews to
identify barriers and facilitators to CONNECTED’s future implementation. We will also survey peers and peer
supervisors (n=20) from VISN10 VA facilities (n=13) and interview a subgroup of survey completers (n=8) to
evaluate factors that may affect potential adoption of CONNECTED in VHA and to identify future
implementation strategies. Qualitative data from Aim 3 will be analyzed using an inductive/deductive approach.
Next Steps & Implementation: Should this trial be successful we will work with our operational partners to
implement CONNECTED in the VHA. Our next step will also involve the evaluation of CONNECTED’s core
elements and its implementation in diverse VHA facilities."

Leptomeningeal disease (LMD) is the metastasis of cancer cells into the pia arachnoid and cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF), and is a devastating disease with survival rates of 4 months after diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (LP) with
cytology is the gold standard for confirming the diagnosis of LMD; however, it has a low sensitivity with the first
LP, requiring multiple additional samples to capture circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Flow cytometry and the
CellSearch Assay are alternative methods for detection of CTCs in CSF, and they have demonstrated higher
sensitivities with the first LP. These approaches detect CTCs and leukocytes as they both express epithelial cell
adhesion molecule (EpCAM), and with additional labeled antibodies, such as those for CD45, they are able to
distinguish between the two cell types. Although these approaches have significantly improved sensitivity and
are quantitative, they unfortunately require liquid handling steps, costly equipment, and trained personnel.
Samples therefore need to be sent to a central lab which is expensive and can take 1-2 weeks for results, which
is unacceptable considering the low survival rates. Additionally, one LMD treatment corresponds to placing a
CSF reservoir in the brain and injecting chemotherapeutics directly into the ventricle/CSF space, which can occur
2-3 times a week. Since LP with cytology is not quantitative, it currently takes months to know if such a treatment
has failed, and by then, it is too late. Flow cytometry and the CellSearch Assay can quantify the concentration of
CTCs, but they cannot be used for real-time monitoring of CTCs during treatment.
An inexpensive, rapid, equipment-free, and user-friendly assay that can be used at the point of care (POC) is
the lateral-flow immunoassay (LFA), which has been used to detect pregnancy and COVID-19. Although the
LFA has many advantages, it unfortunately is limited to a yes/no answer and is not quantitative. We therefore
propose to develop two types of next generation paper-based quantitative POC devices to allow the
detection and quantification of CTCs during the LP and therefore eliminate delays in diagnosing LMD.
Specifically, these devices will be able to determine the concentration of cells expressing EpCAM. Since these
cells include both CTCs and leukocytes, our devices will also simultaneously determine the concentration of
leukocytes through CD45. Similar to flow cytometry and the CellSearch Assay, the concentration of cells
expressing CD45 (leukocytes) will be subtracted from the concentration of cells expressing EpCAM to estimate
the concentration of CTCs. Such devices could also be easily integrated with treatment procedures, such
as the one described above for injection of chemotherapeutics, to assess treatment efficacy. Our devices
will be tested with synthetic CSF containing varying concentrations of human breast cancer cells and T-cells.
Subsequently, a preliminary validation of the two types of devices will be conducted with clinical samples from
approximately 25 LMD positive and 25 LMD negative patients at UCLA."

proposal builds on his early experience with additional training in genomic and primary prospective recruitment
of study participants, as well transcriptional analysis. This grant will allow hands-on experience enrolling
participants, obtaining biospecimens and wet lab processing, as well as genomic and transcriptional analysis of
existing datasets. This experience will be supplemented with structured coursework focused on genomic and
transcriptional analytic techniques and in aggregate, will accelerate development of an independent career
path. Dr. Tejwani will benefit from a multidisciplinary team of mentors, including Dr. James K. Stoller, a world
authority on alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, Drs. Joe Zein and Victor Ortega, experts in genomic analyses and
particularly the SERPINA1 gene which encodes for the alpha-1 antitrypsin protein, and Dr. Mitchell A. Olman,
who will provide wet lab mentorship and resources. In aggregate, this mentorship team and institutional
commitment to his research career will provide Dr. Tejwani the multidisciplinary training and guidance to
develop into an independent investigator.
 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly variable disease with limited therapies, in
part given prior studies do not account for disease heterogeneity with differential therapeutic responses. A
deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), the protein encoded for by the SERPINA1 gene, remains the best
described COPD endotype. However, the heterozygous state with one wild-type allele (M) and one Z variant
allele (rs28929474), known as PI*MZ, is an understudied and highly prevalent potential phenotype (affecting
more than 35,000,000 globally). Epidemiologic studies demonstrate PI*MZ individuals have a wide array of
disease burden among PI*MZ individuals and there is very little understanding of biologic correlates that might
uniquely contribute to or be associated with disease development. Dr. Tejwani’s proposal addresses this gap
through a multiomics approach with single center recruitment strengthened by analysis of existing
biospecimens and genomic data from multicenter studies. He proposes to assess airway leukotriene B4 and
interleukin-8 and its association with baseline disease severity, as well as longitudinal outcomes. He will also
conduct for the first time, a gene-gene interaction, to see if variants in genes encoding for leukotriene B4- and
interleukin-8-related genes are associated with COPD in those alpha-1 heterozygotes. Results from this study
will generate preliminary data to compete for an R01-level award to conduct a trial of leukotriene- or IL-8-
modifying agents on respiratory health among PI*MZ individuals utilizing leukotriene B4 and interleukin-8
airway inflammation or genotypic variants as inclusion criteria or effect modifiers."
10863628,"Project Summary/ Abstract
Huntington’s Disease (HD) is a devastating neurological disease with no available disease modifying therapies.
Accordingly, there is a dire need to identify new therapeutic targets that can slow down disease progression
and improve symptoms. HD is an inherited autosomal disease caused by expansion of the CAG repeat
sequence in the Huntingtin gene, resulting in structural atrophy of the striatum and cortex. Approaches to
reduce the levels of mutant Huntingtin protein in the brains of patients have so far been unsuccessful in clinical
trials, so it is essential to identify new therapeutic targets. Studies have found genetic variants of multiple DNA
damage repair proteins that affect the age of onset of HD. This, combined with the accumulation of DNA
damage seen in HD brains and models, implicates defective DNA damage repair as a critical driver of the
pathology of HD.
Wild-type Huntingtin protein is part of a transcription coupled DNA damage repair complex in neurons, termed
the transcription coupled non-homologous end joining (TC-NHEJ) complex. This complex is recruited to genes
being actively transcribed, so that DNA double strand breaks can be quickly repaired, preserving genomic
integrity and neuronal survival. Huntingtin interacts with numerous DNA damage repair proteins in this complex
including PNKP, and DNA-PK. Interestingly, our preliminary data also show TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-
43) is associated with Huntingtin TC-NHEJ complex, and this interaction increases after DNA damage. TDP-43
is expelled from the nucleus and phosphorylated TDP-43 accumulates in the cytosol in several neurological
diseases including HD. Another hallmark of HD is the increased level of protein SUMOylation. DNA damage
repair proteins are also often regulated by SUMO, so it is important to learn how post translational
modifications affect TC-NHEJ activity in unaffected and HD cells.
The working hypothesis of this proposal is that incorporation of mutant Huntington into the TC-NHEJ DNA
repair complex disrupts critical protein-protein interactions and promotes excess SUMOylation, resulting in
decreased DNA damage repair and accumulation of DNA damage. Identifying critical protein interactions and
post-translational modifications to boost DNA damage repair in HD will provide a new spectrum of potential
therapeutic targets. To accomplish this, I will define the relationship between the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS1 and
PNKP (Aim 1). I will identify the interface between these two proteins and design mutant iPSC lines to
determine if disrupting binding between these two proteins improves DNA damage repair in HD lines. I will
investigate whether TDP-43 is essential for activity of the TC-NHEJ complex (Aim 2), and how its
phosphorylation and expulsion from the nucleus affects DNA damage repair. I will identify the E3 SUMO ligase
for TDP-43 (Aim 3) to enable studies which modulate TDP-43 SUMOylation."

 The overall goal of the proposal is to determine the role of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in visual perception
and working memory. Although it is well established that the MTL is critical for long term episodic memory, recent work
has indicated that it also plays a critical role in visual perception and working memory, and that damage or age-related
changes to this brain region can disrupt our ability to accurately perceive the visual world around us, particularly when
encountering complex scenes such as when driving a car. However, the specific role that the MTL plays in supporting
visual perception is just beginning to be fully understood, and there is now a growing debate about when these deficits
will be observed, and which underlying brain processes are responsible. Answering these questions will have a
transformative effect on our understanding of visual cognition, and advance our knowledge about how various diseases
influence the human brain. In addition, they have important translational implications for a variety of populations
suffering from damage to different regions within the MTL such as patients with Alzheimer’s Disease, Schizophrenia,
depression, and even in healthy aged individuals.
 The current proposal will address these questions using a unique combination of psychophysical methods, novel
eye tracking approaches, studies of patients with focal MTL lesions, and high-resolution brain imaging methods in
healthy subjects. Psychophysical methods will be used in ‘same/different’, ‘change-detection’ and ‘flicker’ visual
discrimination tasks for scenes and objects in order to separate the processes involved during initial feature sampling
and those involved in supporting subsequent change detection, as well as allowing us to track how these processes
change as more information is sampled from the environment. The series of studies is designed to directly test the
predictions of competing theories, and, when possible, we pit the predictions of these different accounts against one
another. We will examine performance in healthy controls and in patients with focal MTL lesions in order to determine
whether regions in the MTL such as the hippocampus play a critical role in various perception conditions. Moreover, we
will utilize high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify the role of hippocampal subfields as well as
the broader brain networks involved in perception. Importantly, these methods will be combined with novel analytic
approaches to quantifying eye movements to determine how the visual system samples information from the
environment (e.g., examining saccadic dispersion, visual resampling, as well as meaning- and salience-sampling), and
using novel fixation-related brain imaging methods to identify the neural circuitry that is critical for accurate visual
perception."

Endoscopy plays a vital role in the diagnosis and treatment of various medical conditions and is regularly
performed millions of times every year. However, endoscopy is challenging in the context of narrow and
winding pathways within the body, resulting in incomplete surveys with several ‘blind spots’, and patient
discomfort. Researchers have explored various techniques that can assist physicians to perform more efficient
endoscopies by enabling better visualization, guidance back to unsurveyed regions, and semi-autonomous
procedures. However, these techniques are still clinically infeasible since the required 3D organ reconstructions
and endoscope localization is still far from solved. Post-procedure analysis of endoscopic videos to extract and
detect meaningful geometric properties, e.g. time-varying measurement of upper-airway cross-sectional area, is
also challenging and time-consuming for physicians to perform, and can be automated with 3D reconstruction.
Existing approaches for 3D reconstruction from endoscopy videos are primarily based on Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques, which are unreliable when faced with typical characteristics of
internal organs, such as lack of geometric features, mucus layer reflections, and deformable surfaces. Existing
approaches have success rates as low as 40-50% for static shapes. Even these low success rates mostly only
apply to easy axial frames and 3D reconstructions may completely fail for deformable surfaces.
The goal of the proposed project is to develop a novel 3D reconstruction and localization system that can
effectively handle axial and non-axial frames for static and dynamic organs. We propose to develop deep neural
network-based computer vision algorithms that can generate 3D meshes from endoscopy videos and determine
the position and orientation of the endoscope in near-real time. Our proposed methodology leverages the
reflection of the endoscope's light to help recover an organ's shape, along with camera motion (Aim 1), and
models time-varying organ deformations (Aim 2). Our focus will be on reconstructing the respiratory tract and
colons. However, our approach is entirely general and will apply to other endoscopy reconstructions. We will
evaluate our approach on synthetic and real data, validating the results by working with clinical collaborators.
In summary, our proposed next-generation 3D modeling system aims to revolutionize endoscopy by providing
accurate 3D reconstructions and localization of both static and deformable organs. This advancement has the
potential to enhance patient comfort, improve diagnosis accuracy, and enable a wide range of downstream
applications in the field of endoscopy, e.g. semi-autonomous maneuvering, guidance to unsurveyed regions,
accurate geometric measurements, and better visualization."

Background. High blood pressure is common in adults, and – despite the fact it can be controlled – 40% of
those with high blood pressure do not have it controlled and remain at high risk for heart attack, strokes, and
kidney failure. Controlling high blood pressure can be achieved through medications and changes in behavior
and lifestyle, including losing weight, changing diets, increasing activity, reducing alcohol intake, and stopping
tobacco use. These require self-management and monitoring of blood pressure; new tools such as web
applications can help provide this support, but need standardized approaches to reflect recommendations for
blood pressure control and to better engage those with high blood pressure. Our innovation will combine
social cognitive theory and behavioral economics with a standards based CDS tool to improve blood
pressure control.
Goal. The goal of the proposal is to implement sharable, interoperable, and scalable patient-facing clinical
decision support for high blood pressure. Our objectives are to refine and implement a patient-facing,
adaptable Collaboration Oriented Approach to Controlling High blood pressure (COACH CDS system in 3
diverse settings, using implementation science and patient engagement to maximize effectiveness. Then, we
will perform a mixed methods study including a randomized controlled trial using implementation science and
social cognitive theory to test effectiveness of the application at lowering blood pressure; and finally to develop
robust, sharable, interoperable mechanisms to aid in further dissemination and implementations of patient-
facing CDS. Our methods will be to implement existing, interoperable CDS into 3 different sites and then
perform a randomized controlled trial with qualitative and quantitative components to understand effectiveness
and implementation issues. We will collaborate with a broad number of groups – including patients – to further
disseminate our work."

Apicomplexan parasites have major impacts on human health e.g. Plasmodium falciparum causes malaria
whereas Toxoplasma gondii and Babesia spp. cause opportunistic infections. Although this close-knit group
shares their obligate intracellular life styles, they display a wide variety of asexual cell division modes. These
differ between parasites as well as between different life stages within a single parasite species, but the start-
and end-point is always a host cell invasion competent ‘zoite’. The number of zoites made per division round
varies dramatically (from 2-90,000) and can unfold in several different ways by reshuffling the functional modules
of 1) mother cytoskeleton disassembly, 2) DNA synthesis and chromosome segregation (D&S), 3) karyokinesis,
and 4) zoite assembly (budding). Distinct cell division modes across Apicomplexa arise from variations in the
order and sequence of the modules as well as the number of module repetitions. In the current model, cell
division progresses in transcriptional waves mediated transcription factors that act on target genes that in turn
bundle into the functional modules. However, little is known of the composition, regulators and wiring of the
different modules, and how this leads to the diversity of cell division modes in Apicomplexa. The research team
hypothesizes that these questions can be answered by a comparative systems biology approach, starting with
parasites representing different diverse and ‘exotic’ division cell division modes wherein particular modules are
amplified, or combined differently: Babesia divergens binary fission, P. falciparum schizogony, Sarcocystis
neurona endopolygeny without karyokinesis, T. gondii asexual endodyogeny and T. gondii pre-sexual
endopolygeny with karyokinesis in the definitive host. This approach takes advantage of the single cell
sequencing revolution combined with computational network analysis approaches. Firstly, single cell
transcriptomic and epigenomic maps of the five cell division modes will be generated and analyzed to define the
effectors contained in each specific module. A subset of uncharacterized effectors in the poorly characterized
karyokinesis and cytoskeleton disassembly modules will be experimentally validated by gene knock-downs.
Secondly, chemical and genetic perturbations combined with single cell sequencing will enable the assembly of
causal gene regulatory networks (GRNs) across all division modes. Candidate module controllers in these GRNs
will be validated by reprogramming and/or genetic perturbation experiments: changing (parts of) the division
mode in specific parasites. This work will answer elusive questions regarding apicomplexan specific biology
within barely studied functional modules, as well as how apicomplexan cell division flexibility is wired. Thirdly,
the proposed work will produce extensive community resources comprising single expression and chromatin
accessibility atlases across five different cell division modes and parasite species. Moreover, data sets will be
searchable across systems in real time for any biological feature of interest by web-based Apps that will be
incorporated in VEuPathDB and enable querying the data for biological questions beyond cell division."

Seasonal influenza epidemics, caused by influenza A and B viruses, result in 3–5 million severe cases and
300,000–500,000 deaths globally each year - especially in high-risk groups such as young children, pregnant
women, obese individuals, individuals with a compromised immune system, and indigenous populations. The
burden of influenza can vary widely between seasons, in part due to characteristics of the circulating viruses,
the existing immunity in the population, and the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccines against the
circulating virus strains. Disease morbidity and mortality increase when a new influenza strain reasserts or
jumps the host and becomes capable of infecting humans. In this case, there is no (or minimal) pre-existing
antibody-mediated immunity to the new viral strain at the population level, leading to millions of infections and
a rapid global spread of the virus. In the absence of antibodies, the severity of the disease can be ameliorated
by broadly cross-reactive cellular immunity. However, the precise mechanism of how immune cells mediate
recovery in some individuals, but not others is far from clear. NIAID has made significant investments in the
generation of data to improve our understanding of infectious diseases, their progression, risk, and severity as
well as treatment and prevention. Not only subject of specific programs, such as CEIRS (Centers of Excellence
for Influenza Research and Surveillance) and the ongoing efforts in CIVICs (Collaborative Influenza Vaccine
Innovation Centers), but in particular, omics-related programs have generated high-throughput genomic,
proteomic, and integrated ""omic"" data sets, and provided other related resources to the scientific community to
promote basic and applied research in infectious diseases. We will make use of these open access datasets
and resources available via the Bioinformatics Resource Centers (BRCs) in this application. In particular, we
will utilize immune epitope, viral sequence and antiviral drug information from the Influenza Research
Database (IRD) and combine these data with other public information from studies of human cohorts infected
with the influenza virus. Single-cell data will provide sufficient cellular detail and will serve as “scaffold” in the
case that only bulk data is available. In our view, a comprehensive and truly predictive model of these complex
relationships can only be achieved through the systematic, integrative, and multi-dimensional OMICS approach
that we offer. Host response to vaccination and to influenza infection is the result of complex traits that involve
a combination of host factors along with entire networks of transcripts, proteins, glycans and metabolites.
Together these responses impact cellular, tissue, and whole organism behaviors. Thus, the host responses to
vaccination and infection are an emergent property of molecular networks. The goal of this integrated systems
biology approach is to understand mechanisms of heterogeneous response to Influenza by determining how
the interactions among biological components compare between high-risk and lower risk populations. Such
findings will significantly improve therapeutic options in the fight against these threatening infectious diseases.
All the models and the software tools developed through this project will be shared with the community."

Almost 800,000 critically ill patients require mechanical ventilation every year and three quarters of the survivors
suffer from persistent disability, which poses a major public health problem as critical care becomes more widely
utilized and available. Although early mobilization, which engages patients in physical activity during mechanical
ventilation, is a promising evidence-based intervention that may prevent disability, less than ten percent of pa-
tients ever get out of bed. This proposal aims to apply precision medicine to identify patients who are most likely
to benefit from early mobilization and elucidate how it can be implemented successfully to extend the benefits of
early mobilization to critical care survivors at greatest risk for long-term disability. I hypothesize that this re-
source-intensive intervention can be applied with greater precision to a subset of patients most likely to bene-
fit, and that implementation science strategies can be devised to successfully drive adoption of this interven-
tion beyond a clinical trial setting. I will test my hypothesis in three aims: Aim 1) I will identify the optimal critical
illness phenotype for implementation of early mobilization by using cutting-edge machine learning methods; Aim
2) I will determine the effect of early mobilization on long-term functional disability to incentivize adoption of this
practice; Aim 3) I will determine the barriers and facilitators of implementation of early mobilization across five
institutions to identify the contextual features associated with successful implementation to inform strategies
that can bridge the gap between evidence base and clinical practice. My long-term goal is to mitigate the com-
plications of critical illness with clinical trials using precision-based methods to identify at-risk and yet apt-to-
benefit populations paired with implementation science methodologies to illuminate how to bring these interven-
tions to the bedside. To accomplish this, I have assembled an exceptional interdisciplinary team of mentors (Drs.
Vineet Arora, Matthew Churpek, and John Kress) and advisors (Drs. Shyam Prabhakaran, Donald Hedeker,
Laura Damschroder, and Matthias Eikermann) who have a track record of NIH-funding and successful mentor-
ship of post-doctoral candidates. I intend to build on my foundation as an accomplished clinical trialist and have
formulated an in-depth career development plan to gain expertise in machine learning methods to identify differ-
ential treatment effects (Churpek and Prabhakaran), longitudinal data analysis, (Arora and Hedeker), and imple-
mentation science methods (Arora, Prabhakaran, and Damschroder) to craft strategies that bring complex mul-
tidisciplinary interventions from clinical trials (Kress and Eikermann) to everyday ICU care. Completion of this
proposal will train me to fill an unmet need defined by a recent National Academy of Medicine publication which
indicated that identification of differential treatment effects must be paired with rigorous implementation to help
transition evidence base to routine clinical care. Equipped with advanced statistical skills and implementation
science approaches, I will be able to design hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials to target and implement
complex multidisciplinary interventions to vulnerable populations in future R01 level applications."
10873241,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is an increasingly prevalent progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
leads to disabling motor, speech, and cognitive symptoms that reduce quality of life for patients and their
families. As the prevalence of PD increases, so too does the use of deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a
surgical treatment option when medications fail to control motor fluctuations or side effects from
medications limit their efficacy. As many as 15% of the more than 1 million American PD patients are felt
to be candidates for DBS.
 The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is the most common target utilized for DBS and limb motor outcomes
after STN-DBS show reliable and consistent improvement in properly selected patients. On the other
hand speech motor outcomes after STN-DBS are unpredictable and more patients experience
deterioration of speech than those that notice improved speech. An estimated 40% of STN-DBS patients
notice worsened speech and with declines significant enough to reduce quality of life. Furthermore, few
effective treatments exist to provide sustained improvement in speech performance for those with
impaired speech.
 In order to optimize and develop better treatments for those living with PD, it is necessary to better
understand the role of STN in speech as contemporary mechanistic models of human speech production
omit STN. Here we study 80 PD patients undergoing bilateral STN-DBS along with 40 non-surgical PD
control subjects to address existing critical knowledge gaps. We will document speech performance of
both groups through functional communication ability (i.e. objective measures of intelligibility and a
validated survey tool for quantifying communication participation) and instrumental speech (i.e. acoustic)
measures pre-surgery, 6- and 12-months post-surgery with all subjects off PD medications and with the
STN-DBS subjects evaluated with stimulation ON & OFF at both post-operative timepoints. Direct
neuronal recordings will be obtained during DBS implantation surgery during both speech and limb motor
tasks to define speech-specific STN neurophysiology. In addition, we will perform regression analyses
using baseline patient factors and intraoperative physiology findings to identify factors leading to the
speech outcomes we will document, and test the feasibility of low frequency DBS in reversing DBS-
induced speech declines.
 To our knowledge, this data will be the first of its kind to evaluate patients before, during, and after
surgery with the goals of both directly defining the role of STN in speech and predicting speech outcome
after STN-DBS. Such knowledge will provide mechanistic insights that cannot be obtained using other
techniques and will guide development of new treatments of impaired speech in PD."

 Regenerative capacity is widespread throughout almost all animal phyla, but the distributing pattern
appears to be inexplicable. This diverse regenerative distribution raises questions of how animals evolve toward
loss or gain of regenerative capacity and of what cellular and molecular mechanisms control regenerative ability.
One feature of regeneration is that innervation is essential for peripheral tissue regeneration. Previous studies
have shown that nerves are involved in multiple regeneration processes from early to late regenerative events
and that distinct neuronal subtypes, such as cholinergic and sensory neurons, play different roles during tissue
regeneration. However, whether neuronal excitation is required for tissue regeneration and which neuronal
subtypes are associated with these processes remains poorly known. Obtaining a genetically amenable animal
model will uniquely permit the identification of the essential neuronal subtypes and establishing their roles in
tissue regeneration. Through forward genetic screening to discover novel regeneration-associated genes, we
recently discovered a new zebrafish mutant exhibiting locomotion disorder and impaired fin regeneration in a
temperature-dependent manner. Whole-exome sequencing and further fine genetic mapping analysis identified
a missense mutation in the scn8a gene, which encodes the major neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel
Nav1.6. We will develop a new paradigm for ion channel-regulated tissue regeneration. We will take advantage
of the temperature sensitivity of scn8a mutation to define how scn8a mutation influences locomotion behavior
and multiple regenerative processes. We will elucidate principles for neurons as essential drivers of tissue
regeneration. We will address the challenge of whether neuronal Scn8a is required for locomotion and tissue
regeneration and which Scn8a expressing neuronal subtypes are associated with fin regenerative processes. In
addition to scn8a mutant, we will investigate the other two mutants, each of which exhibits either fin re-growth
defects or impaired re-patterning, to uncover unidentified regeneration-associated genes and underlying
mechanisms. The proposed study will construct genetic models for tissue regeneration, leading to the discovery
of valuable genes regulating tissue regeneration and establishment of regenerative networks."

 The intersection between alcohol and other drug (AOD) use among young African American women at
risk for HIV is a public health issue. Recent epidemiological data highlight increases in alcohol misuse
among young African American women, especially since COVID-19. These issues are coupled with
persistent disparities in HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) for young African American
women. Eliminating persistent disparities in HIV acquisition is key to ending the HIV epidemic, particularly in
the U.S. South. Consequently, there is a critical need to decrease alcohol use and impaired sex and to
increase pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake as prevention for this key population.
 The proposed study builds on decades of research of a best-evidence woman-focused intervention,
including collaboration with health departments to address AOD use, sexual risk, and violence prevention.
Most recently, the study team found the delivery of the intervention via mobile health (mHealth) had findings
comparable with face-to-face delivery, with reduced odds of heavy alcohol use and impaired sex, suggesting
that scalability via mHealth is a viable option. The next logical step is to add and test a virtual group
component, as recent participant feedback across several studies with African American women in North
Carolina has shown additional group engagement and support is highly desired. Consequently, in response
to RFA-AA-21-016: HIV Prevention and Alcohol, this application addresses the following specific aims:
Aim 1. To modify an evidence-based mHealth AOD use and sexual risk reduction intervention to
include a virtual group component and information about PrEP for utilization. Initial research activities
include focus group discussions with 24 African American young women who misuse alcohol and 16 service
providers, as well as pretesting of the virtual group component. This brief iterative process will include
modifications and refinements based on content (PrEP) and technology (from tablet to smartphone) and will
include review from our Community Collaborative Board.
Aim 2. To test the modified mHealth intervention (with the group component) relative to the mHealth
intervention in a two-arm randomized trial with young African American women (aged 18 to 30) who
misuse alcohol. A total of 500 participants who are HIV-negative who engage in heavy alcohol use will be
enrolled across two North Carolina counties and referred to their local health departments for PrEP. Primary
biobehavioral outcomes assessed will include reduced alcohol use (self-reported and biological, including
PEth), increased PrEP uptake (self-reported and biological), and reduced sexual risk (self-reported
condomless sex and impaired sex and biological testing for HIV/STIs) at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-ups.
Aim 3. To assess acceptability, adoption, and cost of the virtual group component as a strategy to
increase engagement with the mHealth intervention and PrEP utilization. Acceptability will be assessed
via satisfaction surveys and post-study interviews, adoption via data analytics measuring engagement in the
group and examined as a meditator of intervention outcomes, and cost via data collected about time and
resources of implementing the group component."

Initiating excessive alcohol drinking during adolescence is known to disturb typical neurodevelopmental
patterns, increase the risk of developing alcohol use disorder (AUD), and accelerate involutional processes in
adulthood. In response to RFA-AA-21-007, this application proposes a Research Project Site of the National
Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence - Adulthood (NCANDA-A) to follow for the next
5 years a diverse community sample of male and female participants recruited in three age bands (12-14, 15-
17, 18-21 years old) when most were no-to-low drinkers and tracked over the last 8 years across 5 sites
(N=831; 93% retention rate). Monitoring has involved annually acquired multimodal neuroimaging (MRI, DTI,
resting state fMRI, task fMRI), cognitive, clinical, behavioral, and biological data, collected in person or
remotely by computer and our mobile app. These measures will now be complemented with new advanced
neuroimaging and sleep and physical activity tracking. This cohort sequential design uniquely positions
NCANDA-A to quantify transient or enduring alcohol-related disturbances in specific adolescent and early adult
neural system growth trajectories and functional concomitants.
NCANDA-A proposes four consortium-wide specific aims and two specialty project aims. In Aim 1, NCANDA-A
will investigate the impact of excessive alcohol drinking during adolescence and emerging adulthood on
subsequent developmental trajectories of cognitive performance, brain structure and function, and
psychopathology. Aim 2 analyses will identify neurodevelopment patterns describing the extent to which
alcohol’s effects on brain structure and function resolve or persist during desistance after binge drinking. Aim 3
will deploy data-driven analysis to identify adolescent biological, environmental, and behavioral factors (e.g.,
age of drinking onset) that forecast excessive drinking during early adulthood. In Aim 4, NCANDA-A will
quantify the impact of the COVID pandemic on life stress and social, emotional, and economic wellbeing and
their relations with alcohol use patterns. In Aim 5, the SRI and Pittsburgh sites will identify interactions among
patterns of alcohol use, sleep, and cardiac function. In Aim 6, the UCSD, Duke and OHSU sites will determine
the extent to which short-term (i.e., 4 weeks) alcohol use discontinuation results in acute improvement in
cognition, affect, sleep and resting heart rate, and reversal of the adverse structural and functional brain effects
of frequent binge alcohol use. For each aim, sex differences in development, alcohol use patterns and history,
impact of alcohol use on the brain, and sex-differentiating psychosocial factors will be tested.
With the longitudinal data collected into early adulthood during this renewal, NCANDA-A will provide novel
information to the public on the enduring and transient effects of adolescent drinking on adult functioning by
discovering elements and mechanisms linking these dynamic processes and identifying modifiable risk factors."

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is currently at the forefront of biotechnological innovation. scRNA-seq
experiments enable gene expression measurement at a single-cell resolution, and provide an opportunity to
characterize the molecular signatures of diverse cell types, states, and structures in tissue development and
disease progression. However, it remains a substantive challenge to construct a comprehensive view of single-
cell transcriptomes in health and disease, due to the knowledge gap in properly modeling the high-dimensional,
sparse, and noisy scRNA-seq data. While the development of new data science methods, including our recent
work, has facilitated the design and analysis in scRNA-seq studies to identify and annotate distinct cell
populations, there is a critical need for computational methods that can accurately evaluate biological
hypotheses for these diverse cell populations. To address this knowledge gap and critical need and thereby
enable a systematic understanding of transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms across biological
scales (from cells to genes to RNA molecules), the objective of our MIRA research program is to develop novel
statistical methods and bioinformatics software for multiscale analysis of single-cell transcriptomes. We will
pursue three parallel but complementary research directions: (1) to develop novel statistical methods for
quantifying and comparing gene regulatory associations from single-cell gene expression data; (2) to develop
the first statistically principled methods for identifying, quantifying, and comparing alternative polyadenylation
usage from 3’-end scRNA-seq data; and (3) to develop a novel statistical model for jointly analyzing and
comparing scRNA-seq data from heterogeneous biological samples, such as multiple patients, developmental
stages, or related species. The proposed research will be built on the foundations of our recent studies in
developing interpretable statistical methods and user-friendly software for quantifying, denoising, integrating,
and comparing genomic data at various biological scales. Throughout the program, we will work closely with
experimental biologists at Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey and Wistar Institute, and use our proposed
methods to identify and study transcriptional mechanisms in intestinal biology, neurobiology, and cancer biology.
Together, this concerted effort will provide efficient and broadly applicable statistical and bioinformatics tools for
generating substantial insights into identifying key cells, pathways, gene interactions, and RNA transcripts
associated with various biological contexts, including human disease. The proposed program also aligns with
my team’s long-term goal to develop a statistically principled understanding of transcriptional and post-
transcriptional regulation in single cells, thus improving our ability to define, interpret, and predict cellular
commitment and functionality in health and disease."

To decrease the worldwide burden of mental illness, it is essential to understand how precise mechanisms
underlying treatments influence transdiagnostic symptoms of psychopathology. The goal of this R15 AREA
award is to specifically target distress intolerance, a transdiagnostic vulnerability factor for psychopathology
that tends to improve with psychotherapy. A critical barrier to understanding how psychotherapy improves
distress tolerance (and subsequent symptoms of psychopathology) is the lack of knowledge of how specific
treatment elements influence thoughts, feelings and emotion regulation behaviors used during distressing
states. The objective of this R15 AREA grant is to evaluate and intervene on self-efficacy for withstanding
distress and willingness to experience distress, which are the components theoretically proposed as core to
distress tolerance, to see how they influence emotion regulation behaviors used in daily life, and how they
ultimately reduce symptoms of psychopathology. To accomplish this, we will (Aim 1) use ecological momentary
assessment (EMA) to evaluate associations between willingness, self-efficacy, use of engagement-based
emotion regulation (i.e., labeling, processing, curiously exploring, sharing emotions) and use of
disengagement-based emotion regulation (i.e., distraction, avoidance, procrastination, denial, thought
suppression, expressive suppression) in daily life. We will then randomly assign participants to one of four
single session in-person interventions: (1) willingness, where participants will link their core values to
experiencing emotion; (2) self-efficacy, where participants will engage in an emotional exposure using self-
compassionate self-talk, (3) a combined condition, or (4) a psychoeducational control. The effects of the
intervention will be assessed on (Aim 2a) a second week of EMA in which participants will be reminded to use
their new skill when they report distress, (Aim 2b) a third week of EMA when reminders are removed, and on
(Aim 3) transdiagnostic symptoms of psychopathology assessed between each week of EMA and after a one
month followup. The central hypothesis is that greater momentary willingness and self-efficacy influence
greater use of engagement and lower use of disengagement behaviors, and together changes in these
components of distress tolerance underlie transdiagnostic symptom improvement. The proposed research is
significant because it explores how specific treatment elements influence daily functioning, thus revealing how
psychotherapy enacts symptom change. The proposed research is innovative because it combines several
established but underused methods (EMA, single session interventions, just-in-time intervention) in an
experimental therapeutics framework to examine how distress tolerance contributes to improved mental health.
This grant will form the foundation of a series of future directions in exploring the importance of treating
distress tolerance and assessing treatment effects on real-world, dynamic psychological processes."

Epilepsy, the 4th most prevalent neurological disorder after stroke, Alzheimer’s and migraine, is often
accompanied by cognitive deficits. Cognitive comorbidities substantially reduce quality of life in people with
epilepsy. Although a number of anti-seizure drugs are available, no approved drugs mitigate either the cognition
problems or progression of the disease. Inflammation is a component of all chronic diseases including epilepsy,
and is the consequence of several broad signaling cascades including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). We have
shown that activation of the EP2 receptor for prostaglandin E2 is responsible for blood-brain barrier leakage and
much of the inflammatory reaction, neuronal injury and cognitive deficit that follows seizure-provoked COX-2
induction in brain. We have earlier synthesized and tested >500 compounds as competitive antagonists of the
human EP2 receptor, and demonstrated in vivo efficacy with two research lead compounds in three animal
models of epilepsy. In a recent UG3 project, we investigated the candidate development activities on a lead EP2
antagonist BPN30343 (TG11-77.HCl). However, it showed two weaknesses in ADMET assays. Therefore, we
now propose to conduct additional discovery phase lead-optimization studies to identify an EP2 antagonist
candidate to promote for IND-enabling studies. In specific aim 1 (UG3), we will test recently synthesized 13 novel
EP2 antagonists for key ADMET tests to select up to 3 compounds that have requisite pharmacokinetics in dogs.
If shortcomings are found in Aim 1, we will do lead-optimization studies in Aim 2 (UH3 phase) on backup EP2
antagonist scaffolds to develop 3 novel compounds for efficacy and preclinical testing. In Aim 3, we confirm the
efficacy of the lead EP2 antagonist in rat model of status epilepticus and identify formulation that allows us to
conduct DRF-pharmacokinetic and DRF-toxicokinetic studies in rat and dog. The deliverable of the UH3 phase
is a development candidate compound and its backup (s) for the clinical test of the hypothesis that EP2 receptor
modulation after seizures can provide the first preventive treatment for one of the chief comorbidities of epilepsy."

The COVID-19 pandemic has had an alarming impact on already unacceptably high childhood obesity rates,
and emerging evidence shows that traditional approaches to pediatric weight management have been
markedly less effective since the onset of the pandemic. As obesity during childhood is much more likely to be
sustained during adulthood, and children with obesity and other chronic conditions are more likely to have
severe forms of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization, this alarming increase in childhood obesity rates is poised
to have a broad and long-term impact on population health unless effective interventions are implemented. Yet,
we know very little about the unique drivers of this dramatic increase in childhood obesity and whether BMI
increases will persist and become lifelong. We know even less about the protective factors that mitigate this
risk, as some youth will not develop obesity/worsening cardiometabolic health or may recover quickly despite
risk exposures. Our goals are to uncover the biobehavioral pathways through which pandemic-related
stressors drive childhood obesity and cardiometabolic risk, and to identify protective factors and intervention
targets to mitigate the long-term impact of the pandemic on children’s health. The proposed research offers a
unique, time-sensitive opportunity to prospectively examine the impact of multilevel stressors brought on by the
pandemic to identify factors influencing BMI and cardiometabolic health trajectories. We will leverage an
established longitudinal cohort of racially/ethnically diverse children (60% Latino) from predominantly low-
income households, who were enrolled at 2-4 years of age (U01HD068890) and followed annually through
ages 7-11 (R01HD090059). Underscoring the timeliness, uniqueness, and significance of this cohort, body
composition, cardiovascular and metabolic functioning, neuroendocrine, oxidative stress, and inflammatory
biomarkers, and health behaviors were obtained just prior to the onset of the pandemic (n=338). Drawing on a
rich history of longitudinal data over 5 previous timepoints including immediately prior to the pandemic, we
propose to add two new waves of data collection (7- and 8-years after inception of the cohort, 2-3 years post-
onset of the pandemic) when children will be 10-14 years of age, an important developmental window of
obesity and cardiometabolic imprinting. Multiple levels of pandemic-related stressors will be measured,
alongside gold standard biological measures of stress activation, adiposity and cardiometabolic health,
objective health behavior measures, and parent-child surveys. Our specific aims focus on identifying the
pathways, parent-child factors, and neighborhood/community contexts needed to guide effective childhood
obesity interventions in the aftermath of the pandemic and reduce adverse health consequences among
vulnerable and understudied populations."
10877958,"Summary. Prostate cancer (PCa) treatment management is currently heavily reliant upon slide-based
histology of prostate biopsies and surgical specimens (prostatectomies). In particular, Gleason grading of
histology sections provides a basis for stratifying patients for clinical management, and can result in dramatically
different treatment paths. However, prognostication via Gleason grading suffers from several shortcomings,
including subjective visual interpretation of complex 3D glandular morphologies based on 2D images, and
analysis of a limited amount of tissue (~1% of the biopsy). These shortcomings contribute to poor inter-observer
concordance amongst pathologists and poor stratification of patients with indolent vs. lethal disease. For the
clinical management of PCa, two major challenges faced by urologists and oncologists, respectively, are: (1)
correctly identifying men with low-risk PCa for active surveillance and (2) identifying men who are likely to have
disease recurrence and metastasis after curative therapy (surgery or radiation), and hence would benefit from
adjuvant therapy. With our open-top light-sheet (OTLS) microscope technologies, our team at the University of
Washington (Liu group) has demonstrated the technical feasibility of achieving high-throughput slide-free 3D
histology of biopsy and surgical specimens in a nondestructive and reversible manner that does not interfere
with current histology methods. Potential benefits over traditional pathology include: (1) comprehensive imaging
of specimens (biopsies and surgical bread loafs) rather than sparse sampling of thin sections on glass slides;
(2) volumetric imaging of 3D structures that are prognostic; and (3) non-destructive imaging, which allows
valuable biopsy specimens to be used for downstream assays. Our team at Case Western Reserve University
(Madabhushi group) has also developed computational pathology classifiers, based on intuitive and interpretable
“hand-crafted features,” for characterization of PCa aggressiveness based on 2D whole-slide imaging (WSI). In
this R01 project, we seek to combine nondestructive 3D pathology with 3D computational pathology approaches
to develop a novel prognostic assay, Prostate cancer Image Risk Score via 3D pathology (ProsIRiS3D), for
discriminating between indolent and aggressive PCa. In Aim 1, we will develop the core technologies (hardware
and software) for ProsIRiS3D. In particular, the goal of Aim 1a is to develop a “4th-generation” OTLS microscopy
system capable of achieving sub-nuclear-resolution to explore the added prognostic benefit provided by such
high-resolution features. In Aim 1b, computational imaging tools will be developed for extraction of novel 3D
quantitative histomorphometric features for PCa prognostication. Our clinical validation studies will show that
ProsIRiS3D is superior to analogous 2D approaches for urologists (Aim 2), to determine which newly biopsied
patients should be placed on active surveillance vs. curative therapy, as well as for oncologists (Aim 3), to
determine which prostatectomy patients have aggressive disease that may warrant adjuvant therapies."

 ROLE OF SERPINB3 IN GLIOBLASTOMA CANCER STEM CELLS
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive primary malignant brain tumor, with a median survival of 18-20
months. Despite therapeutic interventions including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, multiple clones of
chemo- and radiotherapy-resistant cells repopulate the tumor, resulting in recurrence and a high rate of patient
mortality. These cells are referred to as cancer stem cells (CSCs) due to their ability to self-renew and generate
the cellular heterogeneity present in the tumor. Our lab identified junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) on
CSCs and, through functional studies, demonstrated that JAM-A is both necessary and sufficient for self-renewal
and tumor growth. We determined that JAM-A signals via Akt in GBM CSCs to sustain pluripotency transcription
factor activity; however, the intermediate signaling network is yet to be fully elucidated. To further delineate this
pathway, we immunoprecipitated JAM-A from GBM CSCs and performed mass spectrometry to determine the
proteins to which JAM-A directly binds. This analysis led to the identification of the serine/cysteine protease
inhibitor SerpinB3 as a binding partner. Interestingly, SerpinB3 does not contain the conserved PDZ domain that
is present on nearly every other known JAM-A binding partner. Although multiple pro-tumorigenic mechanisms,
including regulation of TGF-β1 and inhibition of apoptosis, have been proposed for SerpinB3 in the context of
other cancers, very little is known about the function of the protein in GBM CSCs, and its relationship to JAM-A
is yet to be elucidated. Using in vitro CSC functional assays, I have accumulated evidence that SerpinB3 is
necessary for the maintenance of CSCs and that reduction of SerpinB3 attenuates TGF-β1 expression. Based
on these observations, I hypothesize that SerpinB3 interaction with JAM-A is essential for the maintenance of
GBM CSCs through regulation of TGF-β1 and inhibition of apoptosis. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that SerpinB3
maintains the CSC state through inhibition of apoptosis and upregulation of TGF-β1. I will disrupt the lysosomal
membrane with siramesine to elucidate the role of SerpinB3 in the inhibition of apoptosis. Additionally, I will
investigate the role of SerpinB3 in the regulation of TGF-β1 signaling in CSCs. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that
targeting the JAM-A/SerpinB3 interaction will compromise self-renewal and GBM growth. I will utilize DSSO
crosslinking to determine the region of interaction between the two proteins. Finally, I will determine the
consequence of disrupting the JAM-A/SerpinB3 interaction on the CSC state with small interfering peptides.
Successful completion of this project will advance our understanding of how the CSCs state is maintained in
GBM via specific JAM-A intracellular binding domains, bridging cellular communication and cell signaling. The
studies outlined in this fellowship will provide me an opportunity to gain experience in brain tumor research and
allow me to continue my training though scientific meetings and mentorship opportunities, preparing for a career
as a physician scientist."
10878802,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
While effective immunotherapies exist for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), therapies for
progressive MS are limited. In part, this relates to the fact that progressive MS is caused by gradual loss of
central nervous system neurons rather than by immune-mediated injury to the myelin around them. However,
therapeutic development has also been hampered by the lack of quality outcome measures of clinical disability
progression in MS. The inadequacies of the gold standard, the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS),
inflate the sample size and length requirements of progressive MS trials. Further, while clinicians may suspect
that a person with RRMS has transitioned to a progressive course (secondary progressive MS), it often takes
years to confirm using the EDSS. Thus, these patients, perhaps the most informative with much function to
lose, are excluded from progressive MS trials. Phase 2 progressive MS trials often rely on whole brain atrophy,
measured by brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as the primary outcome, which also has limitations.
Considering several neurodegeneration measures concomitantly may improve the efficiency of such trials.
Wearable tri-axial actigraphs are non-invasive, inexpensive devices that measure activity patterns in a home-
based, real-world setting. Using our sophisticated analytic approach that incorporates multiple dimensions of
activity, we are able to distinguish even small numbers of people with MS based on EDSS score. We
propose a longitudinal study of 255 MS patients with confirmed, suspected, or no evident progression,
tracking EDSS and actigraphy-derived data for up to 4 years. We will obtain baseline and subsequent brain
MRIs and other outcomes traditionally used in progressive MS trials to conduct the following aims:
Aim 1. To evaluate if actigraphy-derived measures reliably predict subsequent EDSS-confirmed disability
progression in established progressive MS patients.
Aim 2. To evaluate if actigraphy-derived measures distinguish RRMS patients with and without suspected
progression and predict subsequent risk of EDSS-confirmed disability progression.
Aim 3. To evaluate the relative contribution of actigraphy-derived measures, when combined with traditional
imaging metrics of neurodegeneration, in predicting subsequent clinical disability change.
Corresponding directly to the goal of PA-18-145, this project uses cutting-edge, home-based technology to
predict MS patient trajectories. We anticipate that actigraphy measures will predict subsequent worsening on
EDSS, particularly in those with definite or suspected MS progression, and that adding actigraphy-based
measures to imaging measures of neurodegeneration will improve the prediction of subsequent, EDSS-
confirmed disability progression. If correct, actigraphy will revolutionize the conduct of therapeutic trials for
progressive MS, a critical step for arresting disability accumulation in this common, devastating disease."
10878803,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mutations in the PHEX gene cause X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH), the most common form of hereditary
rickets. In XLH, elevated fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) causes renal phosphate (Pi) wasting,
hypophosphatemia, reduced 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D), and secondary hyperparathyroidism, all
contributing to mineralization disturbances in the skeleton and dentition. Yet current treatments lack efficacy and
no treatments are available to specifically improve associated dentoalveolar defects that substantially affect oral
health and quality of life in individuals with XLH. Limited efficacy of treatments to date is in part related to the
complex etiology of mineralization defects in XLH, including local perturbations that have been overlooked and
gone unaddressed. Conventional therapy for XLH, consisting of oral 1,25D and Pi, shows limited improvement
of skeletal and dental defects. A recent FGF23-neutralizing antibody (FGF23Ab) treatment targeting excess
FGF23 is poised to become standard-of-care. Neither preclinical nor clinical trials of FGF23Ab evaluated
dentoalveolar effects. In a pilot study, we found FGF23Ab made limited improvements similar to 1,25D in the
Hyp mouse model of XLH. The inability of FGF23Ab and 1,25D therapies to resolve XLH mineralization defects
reflects gaps in knowledge about functions of PHEX and pathological mechanisms of XLH, preventing effective
treatments. Two mineralization regulators disturbed in XLH are not addressed by current treatments and likely
contribute to persistent defects by acting locally in bone and tooth extracellular matrices. PHEX cleaves and
inactivates mineralization inhibitor, osteopontin (OPN). Increased OPN in bones and teeth in XLH inhibits
mineralization. Additionally, increased production of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), a potent mineralization
inhibitor, occurs in Hyp mice in association with increased ANK and ENPP1, and decreased tissue-nonspecific
alkaline phosphatase (TNAP). Thus, disruptions at both systemic (high FGF23, low 1,25D and Pi) and local
(increased OPN and PPi) levels contribute to XLH-associated mineralization disorders. Local factors have not
been targeted by treatments to date. TNAP promotes mineralization in local ECM by both reducing PPi and
dephosphorylating and inactivating OPN. This project is designed to provide new insights into local mineralization
defects in dentoalveolar tissues using a mouse model of XLH, and to test novel treatment approaches to prevent
and ameliorate those defects. We hypothesize that correction of OPN and/or PPi in XLH is required to effectively
normalize dentoalveolar mineralization and improve oral health. We will test this hypothesis by three aims: (1)
To establish the contribution of OPN to dentoalveolar mineralization defects in XLH; (2) To determine the
pathogenic role of PPi in dentoalveolar mineralization defects in XLH; (3) To define effects of combined OPN
and PPi reduction on Hyp mouse dentoalveolar healing. Expected outcomes include new insights into
dentoalveolar mineralization defects in XLH, positively impacting how these may be targeted for improving
treatment effects in XLH and other pathological conditions the future."

10879077,"SUMMARY
HIV-related service delivery gaps remain in many regions of the world, and HIV-related stigma constitutes
a major barrier to filling them. Latin America is no exception. In addition to high levels of stigma toward
and among PLWH, there is pervasive stigma against the key populations in which HIV is concentrated:
young men who have sex with men (MSM) and young transgender women (TGW). Mitigating HIV-related
stigma as well as other stigmas that intersect with HIV-related stigma will be critical to meeting testing and
treatment targets, and improving health outcomes in Latin America.
We will evaluate the feasibility of a social marketing public health strategy for reducing HIV-related stigma,
and associated intersectional stigma, among young people in an urban Latin American setting. We will
conduct focus groups with key stake holders to learn which messages they perceive to be most important
for stigma reduction, which types of intersectional stigma should be considered and what they would like
to see changed as a result of the intervention. Then, drawing on theory-based approaches for stigma
reduction, information dissemination, and health communication, we will create a series of locally tailored
multimedia content (e.g., short videos, music videos, and memes). To evaluate potential efficacy we will
conduct a randomized online social marketing study in which we assign users to view our HIV-related
content or a control product and measure changes in stigmatizing opinions related to HIV and
intersectional stigmas. Finally, we will recruit societal influencers to transmit our content through their
social media networks and examine whether young people exposed to the social media content
experience a greater reduction in perceived stigma relative to controls who are not exposed to the
intervention."

Project summary Using technical language, briefly describe the research design and rationale for achieving the stated goals
 Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an inherited disease predisposing affected individuals to
benign Schwann cell tumors called plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs). Currently, prevention of PNFs is
not possible, partly because the molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis are not fully understood.
Surgery remains the mainstay of therapy for PNFs. The FDA approved cytostatic MEK inhibitor,
Selumetinib (Koselugo), shrinks tumor in 70% of individuals but tumors regrow after stopping drug
treatment. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies and targets for the treatment of neurofibroma are
urgently needed. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response pathways play pivotal roles in
tumor growth and therapy in several cancers but remain unstudied in neurofibroma. Targeting these
ER stress pathways might provide a novel therapy for PNF patients.
 Our new preliminary data show that: a) All three ER stress signaling pathways are activated in
both mouse and human PNFs compared to controls. b) Knock down of protein kinase RNA-like
endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) by shRNA decreases neurofibroma like tumor number in a cell
transplantation model in nude mice. c) Pharmacological inhibition of valosin-containing protein (VCP)
together with a MEK inhibitor (MEKi) decreases cell proliferation, increases cell apoptosis and
induces protein ubiquitination. Our central hypothesis is that loss of Nf1 in SC/SCPs leads to PNF
formation by driving Runx- and VCP-regulated proteostasis to adapt to ER stress signaling, so that
targeting proteostasis provides cytotoxic therapy for PNF patients. Two specific aims are proposed:
In aim 1, we will determine if and how Runx and VCP regulate protein synthesis and degradation to
maintain proteostasis so that Nf1-/- SC/SCPs adapt to ER stress, thereby driving PNF initiation and
growth. In aim 2, we will test whether overwhelming irresolvable ER stress by targeting VCP (alone or
in combination with MEKi) provides cytotoxic and, thus, durable control of PNF growth, and determine
the mechanism of action.
 Overall, this proposal will provide mechanistic evidence of Runx1/3 and possible VCP-
dependent proteostasis and adaptive ER stress signaling functions as oncogene on PNF formation
and provide pre-clinical rationale for MEK-independent clinical trials."

CANDIDATE: Daniel H. Craighead, PhD, is a postdoctoral fellow training in integrative physiology at the
University of Colorado (CU) Boulder. In this K01 application, Dr. Craighead aims to determine the efficacy of
high-resistance inspiratory muscle strength training (IMST), a novel and time-efficient lifestyle intervention, for
lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) and improving endothelial, cerebrovascular, and cognitive function. His
immediate goal is to acquire the research training and professional skills necessary to transition to an
independent, extramurally funded investigator. His long-term goal is to establish his own research program
with a focus on identifying novel, evidence-based lifestyle interventions that lower blood pressure and prevent
or delay the development of blood pressure-associated comorbidities and chronic diseases. CAREER
DEVELOPMENT PLAN: Dr. Craighead's career development plan consists of: 1) acquiring new skills to
assess cerebrovascular and cognitive function to support his proposed research plan; 2) train in new cellular
and molecular techniques to assess changes in oxidative stress and nitric oxide-bioavailability; and 3)
professional skill development through coursework; attendance/presentations at weekly journal clubs, CU
seminars, and national scientific meetings; and regular interactions with his mentor team. ENVIRONMENT:
The environment for Dr. Craighead's training plan will be outstanding. Dr. Craighead's primary mentor, Dr.
Douglas Seals, and co-mentor, Dr. Michel Chonchol, are internationally recognized, NIH-funded scientists with
strong records of successful mentoring in translational biomedical research. Co-mentor, Dr. Fiona Bailey,
performed the pioneering work on high-resistance IMST, making her the foremost expert of this novel lifestyle
intervention. Consulting mentor Dr. Zhiying You is Senior Biostatistician in the Department of Medicine at the
CU Anschutz Medical Campus and regularly provides mentoring/consulting to trainees and faculty conducting
clinical trials. Consulting mentor Dr. Philip Ainslie is the Canada Research Chair in Cerebrovascular Physiology
with extensive experience assessing cerebrovascular function. Consulting mentor Dr. Brianne Bettcher is an
Assistant Professor at the CU Anschutz Medical Campus and expert in assessing cognitive function.
RESEARCH: Above-normal SBP is a highly prevalent condition, afflicting the majority of adults over age 50.
Above-normal SBP increases the risk for developing cardiovascular diseases, stroke, cognitive decline, and
other chronic conditions. This increased risk is largely attributable to the development of vascular dysfunction
in the peripheral and cerebral arteries, secondary to an increase in oxidative stress and consequent reduction
in nitric oxide-bioavailability. Healthy lifestyle practices are first-line therapies to lower SBP and decrease
disease risk; however, adherence to these practices is poor due to their time-intensive nature. The proposed
research will test the efficacy of time-efficient, high-resistance IMST for promoting adherence, lowering SBP,
and improving endothelial, cerebrovascular, and cognitive function in adults with above-normal SBP."
10879653,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Disparities in cancer outcomes in certain patient populations such as Hispanic/Latino (H/L) patients, are rooted
in part in the lack of understanding of biologic factors and mechanisms of response or resistance to novel
therapeutics. Although most patients express a willingness to participate in clinical research, only approximately
8% of adult cancer patients enroll in cancer clinical trials, and the percentage of minorities participating in clinical
trials, overall, is much lower when compared to the general population of the U.S. H/L’s, and other minority
groups, for example, continue to be under-represented in clinical trials. The under-representation of minority
groups in cancer research contributes to disparities in cancer care and outcomes by failing to provide the evidence
that clinicians and scientists need to safely treat and discover new treatments for minority patients with cancer.
This project enables an integrative analysis of demographic, and clinical data combined with multi-omics
approaches using blood samples and tissue from breast cancer patients to elucidate the differences in immune
response to breast cancer in patients of H/L race. Immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) is a type of immunotherapy
that has revolutionized treatment for many patients with breast cancer. However, complex immunosuppressive
tumor microenvironments (TMEs) within breast cancers render them less responsive to ICIs and present
therapeutic obstacles. Specifically, recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) prohibit T-cell
activation and infiltration which leads to successful treatment with this class of therapeutics. We aim to
characterize differences in the suppressive TME by race and tumor subtype. Understanding these differences will
affect development of novel treatment combinations & strategies. The identification of patient populations with
higher risk disease, most likely to benefit from ICIs is of equal importance to understanding of scientific
mechanisms. H/L patients have a higher percentage of young women (<50 years old) diagnosed with breast cancer
and often with more aggressive subtypes as compared to Non-Hispanic White (NHW) patients. These differences
persist even when correcting for socioeconomic factors. Overall, this work will help provide insight about
differences in the immune TME in H/L patients with breast cancer and we will also try to determine if use of
organoids could help screen for differences in efficacy with regard to development of one of our one clinical trials
in development. We are investigating the promising therapeutic combination of a histone deacetylase inhibitor
entinostat, combined with ICIs as this targets MDSCs. If we can determine a differential response to this treatment
in H/L patient derived organoids this would provide a potential paradigm changing stratification of H/L patients
with breast cancer who stand to benefit from the effects of this novel therapy."
10881759,"Despite progress in the treatment of primary breast tumors, metastatic disease remains incurable. While
metastatic breast tumors can metastasize to multiple organs, approximately 70% of women that die from
metastatic breast cancer experience serious complications from bone metastases. Once established in the bone,
tumors disrupt normal bone homeostasis leading to increased pain, fracture, and general morbidity.
Unfortunately, Veterans that develop breast cancer are at higher risk for metastatic disease and more aggressive
tumors. Our research has identified the transcription factor, Gli2, as a driver of the tumor-produced protein
parathyroid hormone related protein (PTHrP), which drives osteoclast mediated bone destruction. Inhibition of
Gli2 reduces tumor-induced bone destruction but has limited efficacy for eliminating tumors. Other studies by
our group have identified bone marrow myeloid progenitor population that expand when tumors are established
in bone. These myeloid progenitor cells differentiate into the pro-tumor/anti-immune, tumor-associated
macrophages (TAMs) and osteoclasts. Our preliminary data suggest a potential role of Gli2 in the expansion of
TAMs, demonstrating Gli2 as a potential target to inhibit myeloid expansion and improve anti-tumor immune
responses. In this application, we hypothesize that tumor expression of Gli2 induces the transcription of
cytokines leading to increased pro-tumor macrophage recruitment and increased tumor growth and
bone destruction. To address this hypothesis, we will use mouse mammary tumor models with alterations in
Gli2 expression (over expressed or inhibited) to investigate how Gli2 alters tumor-produced cytokines and
macrophage responses. In subsequent aims, we will use mouse models with macrophage alteration in NFkB
and IL-4 signaling to investigate how macrophage signaling drives tumor and bone interactions and potentially
alters pro-tumor immune responses to drive anti-tumor, immune stimulating responses that result in reduced
tumor and bone destruction. Finally, in our third aim, we will investigate pre-clinical inhibitors of Gli2 and IL-4Rα
as potential therapies for tumor-induced bone disease. These therapies will be compared to standard-of-care
therapies, including paclitaxel and zoledronic acid, for efficacy and toxicity. These studies will improve our
understanding of immune responses in tumor-induced bone disease and will help identify therapeutic
approaches to reduce pro-tumor macrophage recruitment. Improving anti-tumor immune responses will reduce
tumor burden in bone and osteoclast-mediated bone destruction. Importantly, we will investigate potential
toxicities associated with these therapies in comparison to standard-of-care approaches. Based on our
preliminary data, we expect to identify a promising therapeutic strategy from this study that can be rapidly move
to early clinical studies for patients with bone metastatic disease. This study could have high potential impact to
identify innovative strategies to improve outcomes of patients with bone metastatic breast cancer."
10881761,"In lung cancer, tumor immunity is fueled by antigen presenting cells (APCs). We found that targeting glycans
on dendritic immune cells (DCs, as “professional” APCs) boosts CD8+ T cell influx and tumor cytolysis, likely
via augmented presentation of tumor antigens (Ag) on DCs. Augmenting continuous tumor Ag sensing via this
“endogenous” tumor microenvironment (TME) system may improve the specificity and magnitude of anti-tumor
immunity. In Merit work, we discovered how genetic targeting of unique DC glycans boosts anti-tumor T cell
responses, at least in part via Ag presentation mechanisms. We here build on initial insights. An advantage to
facilitating this process is that the “epicenter” for tumor Ag recognition (i.e., MHC/Ag - T-cell receptor axis) may
respond to dynamic Ag changes (including new mutations) to sustain tumor-cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in the TME.
Current immune-checkpoint therapy in advanced-stage lung cancer shows durable remissions that are limited
(<25%), and autoimmune toxicity poses serious challenges. We hypothesize that altering glycan fine structure
(proteoglycan under-sulfation or sialic acid inhibition) on the APC glycocalyx will boost Ag presentation and
augment anti-tumor T cell responses. To study this, with novel inhibitor strategies, we propose Aims as follows:
Study how targeting glycocalyx composition on key APCs from the TME augments anti-tumor T cell responses,
and test how genetic under-sulfation and under-sialylation of the lung APC glycocalyx affects tumor growth
inhibition and specific anti-tumor T-cell responses, including in vivo T cell proliferation and infiltration (Aim 1).
This will involve altering the fine structure of heparan sulfate or inhibiting sialic acid glycans that repress APC
effector functions in the TME. We will examine CD8+ T cell proliferation, activation, and tumor cytolysis in the
setting of APC-targeted glycan inhibition in tumor models with Ag-responsive T cell reporting systems. Studies
will include characterizing how mutation affects tolerance/exhaustion signatures in DCs purified from the lung
TME. We also study lymphatic glycan targeting to transform lymphatic endothelium into a novel APC platform.
Discover mechanisms by which glycan structural changes promote spatial and temporal display of MHC/Ag on
tumor DCs, and study how this augments engagement with the T cell receptor (TcR) using model Ag and
transgenic T cells (Aim 2). We will study how DC glycocalyx mutations in the fine structure of heparan sulfate
and sialic acid affect Ag presentation by tumor-Ag sensitized DCs or ex-vivo marrow DCs pulsed with model
Ag. We will also study how such mutations on model Ag systems affect TcR interactions with DC MHC-I/Ag
using novel proximity ligation technology. Beyond these approaches, we will measure MHC-I/Ag internalization
on the DC surface in the setting of glycocalyx targeting strategies. We will include parallel studies on tumor
lymphatic endothelial cells as unique APCs in Ag-presentation/TcR engagement studies using similar methods.
We will develop glycan-specific inhibitors that augment APC-mediated tumor-kill responses and tumor antigen
responsiveness when applied to mouse as well as human lung carcinomas, and complement this with studies
of real-time tumor regression using inhibitors in spontaneous lung cancer models (Aim 3). We will study anti-
tumor T-cell responses using adoptive therapeutic approaches with glycan-targeted DCs, including antisense
oligonucleotide (ASO) approaches to inhibit tumor-APC glycan fine structure, and examine anti-tumor CD8+ T
cell responses in ASO targeted spontaneous lung cancer models. We include immune technology to study T
cell responses to unique model tumor antigens as well as non-biased responses to high neo-antigen tumor
loads in the system. We will also assess how APC glycocalyx targeting affects immune checkpoint pathways in
tumor CD8+ T cells, and study how pairing inhibitors with low-level checkpoint blockade potentiates responses."
10881762,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Herein, a group of collaborative merit review applications (CMA) aim to advance the precision
management of bladder cancer (BCa), especially focused on the early stage initiation of urothelium as
a model of dynamic epithelial changes in response to smoking and deployment-related carcinogens.
Malignancies are the second most common cause of death among Veterans and BCa is the fourth
most common cancer in the VA. Among tumor types, 70% of BCa is confined to the superficial part of
the bladder (Stages T1, Ta, and CIS), with the remainder invasive of the muscle or metastatic. If BCas
are identified at an earlier stage, nearly all of these tumors are treatable with a combination of surgery
and intracavitary therapy. Yet, there are currently no validated or recommended screening procedures
to identify asymptomatic BCas and there are no methods to identify at-risk patients at an earlier and
more curable stage. The proposed CMAs aim to address these limitations and to significantly disrupt
BCa prevention, detection, risk stratification and precision treatment by dissecting the genetic and
molecular foundations of early stage BCa. The projects include the following: CMA1 aims to determine
the genetic and immune-suppressive landscape of CIS to identify new therapeutics and
immunotherapies. CMA2 investigates the plasticity of the urothelium to determine how PPAR can
direct epithelial differentiation as a possible modulator of CIS. CMA3 will examine the epigenetic basis
of urothelial differentiation and the role of LSD1-inhibitor, Methysticin, as a chemopreventative agent to
restore the epigenetic imbalance of the urothelium. Finally, CMA4 will develop artificial intelligence
algorithms for enhanced cystoscopy imaging technologies or BCa detection and risk stratification.
These CMAs are linked both intrinsically among each other and extrinsically with all contributors already
supported by VA R&D with Merit Awards focused on BCa to maximize synergy and ensure success.
Rationale: More than 80% of Veterans report a history of tobacco smoking with 90% of Veterans with
BCa self-reported smokers. Unlike lung, prostate or colorectal cancer, there are no screening protocols
recommended for Veterans at risk for BCa. There is no primary care recommendation for uniform
evaluation of blood in the urine, and no urinary tests have a high negative predictive value that can
replace cystoscopy. Almost all patients with BCa develop blood in the urine at some time, but there is
often delays in pursuing an evaluation by months to years that lead to tumor progression due to lack of
referrals to urologic surgery for evaluation. Once diagnosed, the urothelium is often challenging to follow
and up 20% of invasive tumors will progress to higher stage cancer. Treatment for early stage invasive
bladder cancer is dependent on BCG immunotherapy, but BCG is frequently unavailable and
underutilized for maintenance and 30% of BCas become BCG unresponsive. Therefore, the three major
challenges for improving survival for patients with BCa are 1) early detection of high-risk tumors 2)
identification of progression to higher stage cancer and 3) treatment resistance to BCG immunotherapy.
Our preliminary data suggest that the urothelium has plasticity in early stage BCa that, if understood at
the genetic, epigenetic and molecular level, could be treated and driven to a more indolent cancer.
Based on our preliminary studies and the gaps in diagnosis and treatment we hypothesize that the
urothelium can be influenced by the state of epithelial differentiation and driven towards a more stable
state if detected at early time point."
10889977,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating event in terms of a person’s health, physical function, costs (direct and
indirect), and life expectancy. It has been conventionally thought that individuals with severe SCIs, with no motor
function below the level of injury, will not recover the ability to functionally move their lower extremities or
voluntarily walk. However, spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has emerged as a promising intervention challenging
this long-held assumption. While spinal cord stimulation allows for restored voluntary movement after severe
SCI, there is a lack of mechanistic understanding regarding how it works and why some individuals respond
better than others. Thus, the overall objective of this proposal is to apply neuroimaging biomarkers to generate
fundamental knowledge regarding responsiveness to spinal cord stimulation (SCS).
Aim 1: Use neuroimaging biomarkers to understand responsiveness to epidural SCS in participants with
severe SCI, during volitional movement and standing tasks. Using high-resolution MRI in a prospective
design, the applicant hypothesizes that the laterality of cord damage, detected prior to surgical implantation, will
predict ipsilateral lower extremity muscle responsiveness to epidural SCS prior to any training.
Aim 2: Use neuroimaging biomarkers to understand responsiveness to transcutaneous SCS in
participants with severe SCI, during volitional movement tasks and sensory examination. Using high-
resolution MRI in a prospective design, the applicant hypothesizes that total spinal cord spared tissue will predict
bilateral lower extremity muscle responsiveness to transcutaneous SCS prior to any training, and that posterior
cord spared tissue will predict light touch sensory recovery prior to any training.
Significance: Successful completion of these Aims will advance the NIH/NICHD NCMRR aim: “to enhance the
health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of people with physical disabilities.” One important problem
in the field of SCS is a lack of foundational knowledge on why the intervention works. Neuroimaging holds
pronounced potential to address this problem. Neuroimaging biomarkers will not only improve the understanding
of responsiveness to this intervention after SCI, but will also help drive individualized approaches for using SCS,
selection of epidural versus transcutaneous SCS, prognosis for improvement using SCS, and the identification
of who is likely to optimally respond before activity-based recovery training. Completion of the proposed aims
will lead to the high likelihood of sustained, powerful influence on the SCS field, laying a vital foundation for using
MRI biomarkers to guide SCS intervention, ultimately improving the clinical management of persons with SCI."

 Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and often devastating complication of cardiac surgery, critical
illness, and other clinical settings. No pharmacologic therapy reliably prevents or treats AKI. Abundant data
from both animal models and humans indicates that iron plays a key role in the pathogenesis of AKI,
particularly in the setting of cardiac surgery. We propose a phase II, double-blind, randomized controlled trial
to test whether administration of the iron chelating agent, deferoxamine (DFO), prevents AKI following cardiac
surgery. We will enroll 300 adult patients at high risk of AKI following cardiac surgery at three major academic
medical centers in Boston. Patients will be randomly assigned, in a 1:1 fashion (n=150/group), to receive DFO
(30 mg/kg) or an equal volume of normal saline. DFO (or normal saline) will be administered as a continuous
24-hour intravenous infusion beginning immediately prior to surgery.
 In Aim 1 we will test the effects of DFO compared to placebo on the incidence of postoperative AKI
(primary endpoint). AKI will be defined by changes in serum creatinine and urine output, according to the
KDIGO criteria. As secondary endpoints, we will assess longitudinal changes in urinary tubular injury markers,
NGAL and KIM-1. We will also test the effects of DFO on the incidence of the following common and
biologically plausible extrarenal postoperative endpoints: myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, delirium,
prolonged mechanical ventilation, and sepsis.
 In Aim 2 we will tests the effects of DFO compared to placebo on longitudinal measures of circulating
iron and oxidative stress, and the inflammatory phenotype of monocytes. Serum iron parameters will include
catalytic iron – a toxic, non-physiologic iron species – as well as transferrin saturation and ferritin. Plasma
markers of oxidative stress will include F(2)-isoprostane and myeloperoxidase. We will also assess the effect
of DFO versus placebo on monocyte (CD14+) expression of IL-6, TNFα, and other markers of inflammation
using flow cytometry. In exploratory analyses, we will use next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to
assess the effect of DFO on the transcriptome of monocytes, which will facilitate discovery of novel transcripts
influenced by DFO. We will also determine the extent to which the effect of DFO on renal and extrarenal acute
organ injury (assessed in Aim 1) varies depending on the preoperative expression of key parameters
measured in Aim 2.
 In aggregate, the studies proposed here will test a novel and promising therapeutic strategy for AKI
prevention. These studies have strong potential to improve clinical outcomes in patients at risk for AKI.
Further, the translational studies proposed here will yield important scientific insights into the role of iron
metabolism in the pathophysiology of AKI."

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has presented unprecedented challenges due to its rapid
spread, mutability, high death rate, and long-term complications. Vaccines have shown efficacy but wane over
time, and new variants emerge. Antiviral drugs offer an effective alternative, but their success has been variable,
and the development of drug resistance is a concern. Hence, there is a continued need to identify novel antiviral
drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 and its post-COVID complications.
 Through a comprehensive genome-wide study utilizing a surrogate fission yeast system, we have identified
the ORF3a protein as a promising therapeutic target. ORF3a is known to play a significant role in viral
pathogenesis, contributing to cellular damage in the lungs and kidneys, induction of the NLRP3 inflammasome
and cytokine storm, and the severity of COVID-19. Specifically, our research demonstrates that ORF3a
expression in lung and kidney epithelial cells induces innate cellular oxidative stress and proinflammatory
immune responses, leading to NF-kB-mediated cytokine production of TNFα and IL-6, ultimately resulting in
apoptotic cell death. We refer to these effects collectively as ""the cytopathic ORF3a effects.""
 Consistent with clinical observations linking the emergence of ORF3a mutants to COVID-19 severity, we have
also observed distinct variations in the cytopathic activities of emerging ORF3a mutants. As oxidative stress and
inflammation contribute to cell death, tissue damage, and the severity of COVID-19, and ORF3a triggers cytokine
storm and upregulation of TNFα and IL-6, which are strong predictors of COVID-19 severity, targeting ORF3a's
cytopathic effects becomes crucial for mitigating the impact of the disease.
 The objective of our study is to develop an integrated system utilizing fission yeast and human cells to identify
human suppressive cellular proteins (hSCPs) and small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) that specifically target ORF3a.
Our approach consists of two main aims: (1) conducting a genome-wide search to identify hSCPs capable of
suppressing ORF3a, and (2) employing a fission yeast cell-based high-throughput screening (HTS) system to
rapidly identify SMIs with therapeutic potential. We hypothesize that direct inhibition of ORF3a using an SMI
will effectively counteract its cytopathic effects, mitigate tissue damage, and reduce the severity of COVID-19.
 Our research team comprises experts in yeast biology, virology, viral infection in BSL-3 containment, HTS drug
discovery, and medicinal chemistry. The novelty of our project lies in the absence of known inhibitors targeting
ORF3a, underscoring the significance of this study. In our preliminary HTS runs, we have identified a SMI S3080,
an FDA-approved antiviral drug Etravirine, as an inhibitor of ORF3a in both fission yeast and mammalian cells,
thereby supporting the feasibility of our proposed HTS study. Successful completion of this research will enable
the identification of hSCPs and SMIs capable of inhibiting the cytopathic effects of ORF3a, thereby laying the
foundation for the development of effective antiviral drugs against COVID-19."

PLUS was designed to exert a sustained, powerful influence on bladder health research. The Loyola Clinical
Center (LCC) was a robust contributor to PLUS research activities in the first funding cycle, due to our significant
expertise in Community Engagement, including partnerships with cohorts that are poorly represeted in health
research. In this renewal application, the LCC brings additional, rare expertise in evaluation of the urinary
microbiome (urobiome), which is related to the bioregulatory function of the healthy bladder. Based on the
foundational research accomplished in the first funding period, our investigators are eager to utilize our resources
and our growing expertise to advance the PLUS mission, and continue our collaborative work. Our trans-
disciplinary team of researchers will work collaboratively toward the our over-arching goal of advancing bladder
health. In this renewal application, through three specific aims, we plan to conduct high-impact research that
challenge existing paradigms and improve research approaches in bladder health, with a focus on
musculoskeletal interventions and urobiome research. These aims include (SA1) To determine the relationship
of musculoskeletal and bladder health across the life stages, (SA2) Through strategic collection, analysis and
evidence-based storage of urine biospecimens, assess validity of self-collection and shipping from potential
participants, assess the baseline and longitudinal urobiome characteristics, with focus on characteristics that are
associated with bladder health and LUTS development over time and establish a high-quality urobiome
biorepository for subsequent analysis, once novel promoters and risk factors for bladder health have been
identified and (SA3) enhance PLUS Consortium community engaged research by integrating community
stakeholders as co-investigators and designing processes that facilitate this integration. In addition, the LLC will
contribute to the final design, conduct and analysis of a large, US population-based observational cohort of
women across the life-span, using the Bladder Health Instrument which PLUS developed and validated. Within
this study, the LCC proposes investigation of the bioregulatory functions of the healthy bladder through collection
and anaysis of urine speciments, focusing on urinary microbiome (urobiome) health. The LCC has been active
in the dissemination of PLUS work to the community, other researchers, and – when appropriate - clinicians, and
patients. In addition to generating novel data and research tools, we anticipate establishing a repository of
biological samples for future studies. As an integral component of the PLUS Research Consortium, we expect
rapid improvements in scientific knowledge and LUTS prevention strategies as the aims of our Center are
achieved. These improvements will benefit and support the broader research community with particular impact
on the broader urology community and women’s health. Our continued work will further advance exising
foundational evidence for LUTS prevention and bladder health to improve human health."
10890615,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 The prevalence of obesity is on the rise and a better understanding of the drivers of this epidemic is
crucial. As novel insights implicate bone in regulating energy metabolism, it is crucial to understand how
diseases of positive energy balance, like obesity, affect the different functions of bone. While obesity is known
to impact the structural function of bone causing increased fragility, it is unclear how the metabolic function of
bone is compromised in obesity. Filling this gap in our knowledge is critical for developing therapeutics that can
reestablish energy metabolism while maintaining musculoskeletal health in obesity.
 In this proposal, we explore the effects of obesity on bone regulated energy metabolism and focus
particularly on osteocytes, that constitute 95% of cells in bone. Our compelling preliminary data puts forth the
premise that TGFβ signaling is a key modulator of osteocyte-intrinsic energy metabolism (cellular). Thus, we
test the hypothesis that obesity impacts osteocytic TGFβ signaling that in turn contributes to deregulated
systemic energy metabolism. Furthermore, our data suggest that osteocytic TGFβ signaling also coordinates
the activities of epigenetic factors to shape the transcriptome of osteocytes. These epigenetic factors have
previously been implicated in obesity; however, their relation to TGFβ signaling and cellular energy metabolism
of osteocytes remains unexplored. Together, these findings motivate my central hypothesis, that osteocytic
TGFβ signaling drives metabolic dysfunction in obesity through an epigenetic mechanism. My aims to test this
hypothesis are to: 1) determine if obesity induces metabolic reprogramming in osteocytes in a TGFβ-
dependent manner, 2) determine if ablation of osteocytic TGFβ rescues metabolic dysfunction in
obesity, and 3) identify the function of TGFβ responsive epigenetic factors in regulating osteocyte
driven energy metabolism during obesity.
 Using hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia (in vitro) and DIO (diet-induced obesity, in vivo) to model
obesity, we will monitor the link between osteocytic TGFβ signaling, cellular- and systemic- energy
metabolism, and study its role in regulating the obesity-induced metabolic dysfunction. For combining ChIP-
Seq, ATAC-Seq, and RNA-Seq approaches, we will generate a network landscape connecting epigenetic
marks, modifiers, chromatin accessibility patterns, and corresponding molecular pathways that are impacted by
obesity in osteocytes. In the future, this landscape of molecular and epigenetic networks will serve as a
blueprint that can be used to interpret osteocyte function in metabolism in response to distinct nutrient cues.
Such a blueprint will be particularly informative in devising or predicting outcomes of pharmacologic
interventions and will lay the foundation for my independent research that dissects the intricacies behind the
crosstalk between bone function and energy metabolism.

10890693,"PROPOSAL SUMMARY
Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are childhood exposures to potentially traumatic family and community
experiences that can have lasting, negative impact on health, are a driver of health disparities, and have
potential intergenerational transmission of effects. Preliminary data from the parent study for this proposed
study indicate that ACEs are highly prevalent in low-income, urban parents, with 54.7% of 139 parent
participants reporting 4 or more ACEs. Positive childhood experiences (PCEs) are relational experiences that
confer a sense of safety and nurturance during childhood, such as feeling safe with at least one adult in the
home. PCEs are associated with improved physical and mental health. PCEs have the potential to promote
positive outcomes even when ACEs are high. Current neighborhood violence is expected to compound the
impact of ACEs on parenting practices due to ongoing or recurrent activation of neurobehavioral responses to
threat. The purpose of this convergent mixed methods study is to understand how parents' exposures to ACEs
and PCEs impact their parenting practices, particularly in the context of living in unsafe neighborhoods by
addressing the following specific aims: 1: Test the associations among parents' ACEs, PCEs, and more
positive parenting practices in a sample of parents (n=200) raising young children (2-8 years old) in Baltimore.
2: Examine contextual effects of current neighborhood safety (violent crime rate and parent perception) by
testing the interactions between threat-type ACEs and neighborhood safety variables, controlling for other
neighborhood-level SES characteristics. 3: Understand how parents' own childhood experiences (ACEs and
PCEs) influence their parenting practices in the context of low versus moderate to high neighborhood safety.
The proposed study will be nested within an ongoing parent study in Baltimore City Public Schools. The
proposed study will use baseline data only for a cross-sectional quantitative arm, followed by a qualitative arm
that integrates with the quantitative data. Multivariate regression, multilevel modeling, and conditional process
modeling will be used to test associations among ACEs, PCEs, and parenting, and then to test these
associations and the association with neighborhood safety. In the qualitative phase, indvidual interviews will
use an interpretive phenomenological approach to gain a better understanding of the processes and contextual
factors that contribute to participants' parenting in the context of neighborhood safety. This design integrates
the analysis of associations between ACEs, PCEs, parenting practices, and neighborhood safety with analysis
of parents' perspectives on the impact of their childhood experiences on parenting, role of neighborhood
safety, and other contextual variables. This research will identify protective factors in the intergenerational
transmission of ACEs and uses geospatial data to explore how neighborhoods influence the impact of ACEs
and PCEs. It will inform future research on family- and neighborhood-level interventions to promote safe,
stable, nurturing relationships in families and neighborhoods to reduce the rate and impact of ACEs."
10890546,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The immune system is a significant barrier to successful clinical organ transplantation, requiring life-long
immunosuppression to prevent allograft rejection. Current immunosuppressive strategies rely primarily on broad
pharmacologic inhibition of lymphocyte function. This approach is limited by susceptibility to breakthrough
immune responses causing acute rejection episodes, with simultaneous unwanted impairment of protective
immune responses against infection and tumors. Thus, new approaches for specific and durable allograft-
specific immunosuppression are critically needed. We propose to utilize a pMHCII-based allogeneic 5-module
chimeric antigen receptor-cytotoxic T cell (5MCAR-CTL) system to target and eliminate alloreactive CD4+ T cells.
These investigations represent a conceptual advance in proposing to utilize cutting-edge cellular engineering
with 5MCAR technology to develop a novel approach aimed at specific and durable immunosuppression in
transplantation. Successful completion of the proposed experiments will generate tools and data to support
refinement and development of this clinically-translatable cell engineering approach."
10865841,"Complex diseases are heterogeneous in their etiology and clinical manifestation. This heterogeneity hampers
understanding of their causes, and requires new precision medicine strategies to apply targeted interventions
in homogeneous disease subgroups. While statistical genetics methods have provided key insights into
disease etiology in recent years, they are not optimized to expose the mechanisms underlying the
heterogeneity observed among patients. Therefore, novel strategies to identify and understand disease
heterogeneity are needed. In this K99/R00 proposal, we introduce PATHFINDER: a comprehensive research
program to reveal the mechanisms leading to heterogeneity in complex diseases. This research program
will be prototyped for schizophrenia, inflammatory bowel disease and coronary artery disease, selected for
their high heritability, availability of powerful GWASs, and the rich functional genomic and clinical individual-
level data available. These diseases provide, thus, excellent templates for extending this approach to a range
of complex diseases. To achieve the program objectives, the following analytical strategy is proposed:
- In Aim 1 (K99 phase), the context in which putative causal genes act will be determined. This involves
identification of tissues and cell types with the highest gene expression and specificity, and identification of
other genes functionally related to the genes of interest (e.g. based on metrics such as gene co-expression).
- In Aim 2 (K99 phase), our recently developed PRSet software and tool will be utilized to compute pathway-
based polygenic risk scores (PRSs), identifying, for each individual, the biological pathways with the highest
genetic risk to disease. This will enable the identification of shared and distinct genetic profiles across patients.
- In Aim 3 (R00 phase), Dr. García-González will apply the techniques and knowledge gained from Aims 1 and
2 to develop a precision medicine framework for stratifying patients from large biobanks. In Aim 3.1, PRSs
associated with clinical factors and disease symptoms will be identified. In Aim 3.2, statistical and machine
learning methods will be used to stratify patients into more genetically and clinically homogeneous subgroups.
This research program is expected to have a significant translational impact by identifying more homogeneous
disease subgroups that will inform mechanistic hypotheses, ultimately leading to more etiology-specific
interventions and treatments. Furthermore, the training during the K99 phase will be crucial for Dr. García-
González’s scientific development and to set the foundations of her independent research program.
The combination of: (i) Dr. García-González’s background in experimental research and statistical genetics, (ii)
the expertise of the mentoring team in PRSs methods development, functional genomics and experimental
validation approaches, and (iii) the world-leading research performed on medical genetics and genomics at the
Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, provides an ideal lever for Dr. García-González to
climb the academic career ladder and to become an independent investigator."
10865842,"Abstract
Bone damage and loss resulting from combat associated penetrating fragment projectiles, gunshot wounds and
improvised explosive devices are some of the most common injuries US Military personnel experience and
contribute to increasing Veterans’ health care costs. Yet, there are few viable options to consistently regenerate
functional craniofacial bone for soldiers and veterans. Therefore, there is a significant need for the development
of innovative therapeutic approaches to address this problem. Cell-laden biomaterial scaffold-based strategies
face several challenges, such as limited cell-cell interactions, potential immune and/or inflammatory reaction,
and unsynchronized scaffold degradation rate with new tissue formation. Promising new scaffold-free cellular
condensation strategies can address these issues. To date, however, their formation has still required in vitro
culture prior to implantation. To overcome this issue, we have engineered a new technology: immediately
implantable, biodegradable and photocrosslinkable high-density hMSC-laden core-shell microgels enabling cell
condensations and subsequent generation of functional tissues in vivo without in vitro culture. Using this system
and 3D bioprinting, it is now possible to precisely engineer the architecture of osteogenic cell condensations for
bone regeneration to match patient-specific defects. Recently, we have also engineered technology capable of
3D printing an individual cell-only bioink and maintaining the printed structures. By using the in situ bioprinted
osteogenic core-shell microparticles as a support slurry bath, it is now possible to print defined 3D patterns of
prevascular individual cell-only bioink into the slurry to generate a tissue construct composed of osteogenic
hMSC condensations with an incorporated spatially patterned prevascular network of cell condensations. The
rapid degradation of the microgel hydrogel shell layer will enable fusion of the osteogenic condensations with
each other, the forming prevascular network and the surrounding host tissue. Locally delivered growth factor
from incorporated microparticles will drive the local formation of the two different tissue types to promote the
growth of functional vascularized bone tissue. We hypothesize that multi-tissue cell condensations can be
fabricated directly in vivo in complex architectures using osteogenic core-shell microgel and individual cell-based
prevasculogenic bioinks and 3D bioprinting technology to form patterned prevascularized bone constructs for
healing critical-sized cranial defects without in vitro processing and culturing. Specifically, we aim to (1) examine
the role of physical properties of the core-shell microgel bioink and printing parameters on the resolution and
shape fidelity of the 3D bioprinted constructs, (2) engineer and evaluate 3D bioprinted prevasculature patterned
high cell-density bone constructs, and (3) determine the preclinical potential of in situ 3D bioprinted
prevasculature patterned osteogenic cell condensation constructs to heal critical-sized rat calvarial bone defects.
This platform strategy has the potential to greatly enhance the lives of military personnel and veterans suffering
from bone defects and may enable the engineering of other complex tissues in the body."

older, and other at-risk populations. Multidisciplinary Long COVID clinics provide clinical care and offer
infrastructure for evaluating promising interventions to improve Long COVID outcomes. The Johns Hopkins
Post-Acute COVID-19 Team (JH PACT) is among the country's first and largest Long COVID programs. Via
this AHRQ U18 proposal, JH PACT proposes the following Aims: (1) To deliver a comprehensive,
multidisciplinary program (Supporting Patients Recovering from COVID, “SPaRC”) to patients with Long
COVID, with an expanded focus on underserved populations. The SPaRC program will expand on the existing
expertise of the JH PACT multidisciplinary Long COVID outpatient program to increase capacity and decrease
wait times, with expanded services to underserved patient populations, including older adult, minority
race/ethnicity, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and geographically distant and rural populations via
enhanced partnerships with key existing organizations (e.g., Medicine for Greater Good, Center for Clinical
Global Health Education). (2) To iteratively evaluate and refine the SPaRC Long COVID program to increase
access and improve patient-centered, evidence-based care. The SPaRC program will be evaluated and
iteratively refined in quarterly cycles via mixed methods evaluation (via patient data from electronic medical
records and semi-structured qualitative interviews of patients/caregivers and staff/clinicians) to inform
implementation strategies based on the “Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change” (ERIC)
framework within a learning health system. In each review cycle, the implementation team and key SPaRC
internal and external stakeholders will evaluate the program and outcomes and select goals for refinement and
advancement for the next quarterly review cycle. An external Stakeholder Advisory Council, led by an
independent Chair, will provide ongoing feedback via quarterly meetings throughout the project. (3) Partner
with regional Long COVID stakeholders, including primary care providers (PCPs), to create and expand access
to comprehensive, patient-centered, coordinated Long COVID care across the mid-Atlantic region. We will
build a multi-disciplinary Long COVID provider-to-provider e-consult service, customized educational
curriculum (delivered via both live and on-demand electronic formats), and continuing education toolkit for
PCPs, in conjunction with key stakeholders (e.g., patients, caregivers, community leaders, and PCPs). JH
PACT and the SPaRC Team include internationally-recognized experts in Long COVID care, patient outcomes
assessment, implementation science, stakeholder/community engagement, and primary care education. JH
PACT is ideally positioned to create a Long COVID Center of Excellence, leveraging the outstanding expertise
available via Johns Hopkins Medicine, and to optimally engage with the AHRQ Learning Community."
10865920,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Dementia family caregivers frequently experience persistent musculoskeletal pain. Pain is often made worse
by performing caregiving tasks, impairing dementia family caregivers’ ability to provide care. Dementia family
caregivers’ who have pain often have co-existing emotional and psychological health challenges, such as high
negative emotions and/or comorbid depression, which makes managing their pain and their caregiving tasks
more difficult. The objective of this K99/R00 proposal is to develop Dr. Shelbie Turner’s capacity to conduct
translational research to support dementia family caregivers’ health and well-being through improved
management of their own persistent pain. Dr. Turner will work towards five training objectives in the K99 phase
of the project. Doing so will allow her to develop and transition to an independent investigator who designs,
adapts, evaluates, and disseminates innovative, evidence-based interventions to prevent or mitigate dementia
family caregivers’ negative health outcomes, with a focus on the problem of persistent pain and associated
symptoms (e.g., negative emotions) and comorbidities (e.g., depression). First, she will add to and extend her
knowledge in core substantive areas to include pain, negative emotions, dementia caregiving, and health
behavior change. Second, she will improve her ability to develop, implement, and disseminate behavioral
interventions with an emphasis on both pain management interventions and caregiver interventions. Third, she
will gain experience needed to design and conduct clinical trials, including conventional, pragmatic, and
adaptive clinical trials with dementia family caregivers. Finally, she will pursue professional development
opportunities in grant writing (fourth training objective) and leadership and collaboration (fifth training
objective). The three research aims of this application will progress as follows. Aim 1 adapts an evidence-
based pain self-management intervention, Problem Adaptation Therapy for Pain in Primary Care (PATH-Pain),
for use by dementia family caregivers with persistent pain. Aim 2 tests the usability of the adapted intervention
with dementia family caregivers, and Aim 3 examines the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of
the intervention through a pilot randomized controlled trial. The adapted intervention will be the first evidence-
based pain self-management program customized specifically for dementia family caregivers. The proposed
project is consistent with NIA’s mission to conduct behavioral research on aging and foster the development of
research scientists in aging. It is aligned with NIA’s special interests in dementia caregiver intervention
research and pain management research. Dr. Turner proposes to pursue her developmental goals and begin
the proposed research with the support of the Division of Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine at Weill Cornell
Medical College of Cornell University, which provides an ideal environment of research support and resources
to help her achieve her training and research goals."
10865581,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Advances in our understanding of disease biology and development of new technologies have made
individualized treatment a reality for many patients with cancer. Such improvements have been elusive for
adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with sarcomas. Treatments for these diverse sarcomas often include
intensive multiagent chemotherapy, surgery and radiation, yet many patients still suffer relapse and die of
disease. Survivors are left with debilitating late effects including infertility, heart disease, and secondary cancers.
Outcomes in other cancers have been vastly improved using biomarkers to delineate disease sub-groups,
evaluate response to therapy, and detect relapse, maximizing chance of cure and minimizing late effects. In
contrast, there are no validated biomarkers in AYA sarcomas to facilitate testing of risk-stratified therapy. This
scientific gap presents a major barrier to improving outcomes.
My long-term objective is to improve outcomes for AYAs with sarcomas through biomarker-informed clinical
trials. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is an exciting candidate biomarker for this purpose and holds the potential
for broad application across the majority of AYAs with sarcomas. I have demonstrated that elevated ctDNA
burden at diagnosis is associated with an increased risk of disease relapse and death for patients with the two
most common bone sarcomas affecting this population: Ewing sarcoma (EWS) and osteosarcoma. Broadly, all
high-grade sarcomas can be divided into fusion-positive sarcomas like EWS or fusion-negative sarcomas with a
high level of aneuploidy like osteosarcoma. ctDNA holds the potential to be paradigm shifting for the treatment
of AYA sarcomas by leveraging these genomic characteristics to inform risk-stratification. We have assembled
large patient cohorts (n>700) of two fusion-positive sarcomas (EWS and synovial sarcoma) and two fusion-
negative sarcomas [osteosarcoma and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS)] to perform validation
studies to establish ctDNA prognostic thresholds at diagnosis and following initial therapy. To assess the clinical
impact of return of results on clinicians, I have launched a pilot study using commercial liquid biopsy testing for
fusion detection during disease surveillance for patients with EWS.
I will evaluate the central hypothesis that ctDNA burden is clinically informative in sarcomas affecting AYAs and
can inform trials of risk-adapted therapy in the near future by addressing the following aims: (1) Determine
ctDNA-based prognostic thresholds for risk of relapse in fusion-negative sarcomas at baseline; (2)
Determine ctDNA-based prognostic thresholds for risk of relapse in fusion-positive sarcomas at baseline
and following initial treatment; and (3) Evaluate the clinical impact of ctDNA testing for disease
surveillance in EWS. At the conclusion of this project, we will have validated ctDNA as a prognostic biomarker
in multiple clinical settings and positioned this biomarker for immediate integration into prospective trials. The
ultimate goal is to improve outcomes for AYAs with sarcomas through development of risk-stratified therapy."
10864592,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall long-term objectives for this K01 proposal are to (1) develop and evaluate a nature-based culturally
grounded (NBCG) substance misuse intervention tailored to Native American teenage mothers and their young
children that live in a tribal community (2) while also advancing my research and professional capacity to
become an independent research investigator.
Although Native Americans (NA) demonstrate high abstinence rates from alcohol, the generations of trauma
and oppression, ongoing discrimination, COVID-19 pandemic-related consequences, and drug companies
disproportionately targeting Black, Indigenous, people of color (BIPOC) communities have contributed to NAs
experiencing the highest mortality rates from overdose, suicide and alcoholic liver disease (deaths of despair)
as of 2020. NA young women experience heightened risk of interpersonal violence that places them at risk for
substance use disorder (SUD) and other risk-taking behaviors, which can result in unplanned pregnancies.
Their children are then placed in the cycle of addiction as these children are at heightened risk for early
problem emotional and behavioral development, partly due to impaired sleeping, which has demonstrated
increased risk for later substance misuse. These alarming statistics warrant investigation of a promising
culturally grounded substance misuse intervention that targets both young mothers and their children with the
goal of breaking the cycle of addiction by way of restoring our traditional and ceremonial knowledges and
practices with the land. To do this work, we need Indigenous frameworks. The traditional ecological knowledge
(TEK) framework is the theoretical underpinning for the proposed study. Due to the close relational ties NAs
and other Indigenous people have to our land and water, TEK posits additional cultural and spiritual
mechanisms between the natural environment and human health and wellbeing.
The proposed specific aims of this study are to: 1) develop NBCG programming to enhance an evidence-
based home-visiting model to fit the needs of the local context; 2) test the NBCG intervention to determine
feasibility and acceptability; and, 3) evaluate the NBCG intervention for effectiveness and efficiency and refine
modules to maximize fit to the local context to set the stage for a future R01 fully powered Hybrid Type II trial
examining implementation and program effectiveness against maternal substance misuse and child negative
child emotional and behavioral development, risk factors for later substance misuse. This K01 incorporates a
community-engaged exploratory mixed methods sequential study design to inform, evaluate and refine the
NBCG intervention. This study will shed light on proposed theoretical mechanisms (e.g., sleep quality, sense of
connectedness) between nature-based culturally grounded experiential learning (i.e., NBCG intervention) and
resilience and resistance against addiction (NIDA Objective 2.1)."
10868709,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – PROJECT 4 DETECTION
STEEP II Project 4–Detection and Remediation (P4-Detection), will further develop, validate, field-test and
deploy passive sampling tools for per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) in water, biota, air and dust.
The field-validation and applications of passive samplers offer several key advances for the detection of PFAS
including (i) assessment of relevant human exposure via time-weighted average concentrations, (ii) aiding in
identifying the extent of site contamination, and (iii) remediation via simple adsorbents and reliable monitoring
tools that can be deployed before, during, and following remediation to verify success.
 P4–Detection offers several innovative research components to address knowledge gaps surrounding
environmental exposure to legacy and novel PFAS, and to provide novel tools to stakeholders. For example,
P4–Detection will develop a simple, but effective filter for PFAS in groundwater, and use its passive samplers
to monitor a field-based ex situ remediation trial for PFAS in groundwater on Cape Cod (Aim 1). P4–Detection
will simultaneously characterize PFAS bioaccumulation in wildlife and field-test passive samplers in the Delaware
River (Aim 2), while using passive samplers to measure the biotransformation and bioaccumulation of PFAS in
controlled laboratory exposures. P4–Detection will also contribute unique tools and data on PFAS in outdoor
and indoor air, and dust to inform STEEP II’s PFAS exposure assessment (Aim 3). P4–Detection will collaborate
with P1–Exposure to assess the importance of atmospheric transport of PFAS, another research gap and
significant need for STEEP’s stakeholders (Aim 3). P4–Detection will thereby address the SRP mandates of
developing “methods to reduce the amount and toxicity of hazardous substances” and “methods and
technologies to detect hazardous substances in the environment.”
 The work of P4–Detection is well-integrated with the other STEEP II research projects and cores: it will
maintain strong links with P1–Exposure, with a joint focus on bioaccumulation, and the use of passive samplers
for indoor and outdoor air sampling of PFAS; continue work with P3–Mechanisms on chemical analysis of PFAS
and share mixture profiles of PFAS in cell assays and rodent models; work with P2–Critical Effects to assess
the contribution of indoor air and dust to PFAS exposure in the Faroe Islands relative to seafood consumption
as part of PI Lohmann’s Fulbright Arctic Initiative fellowship; and exchange samples with P1–Exposure to
compare the results of extractable organofluorine (EOF) analysis and perform non-target analysis for the other
projects. Lastly, P4–Detection will work with STEEP II’s research translation team, states, and U.S. EPA to
disseminate results and applications of passive samplers for PFASs to state and federal agencies; with the
DMAC on adhering to FAIR data principles and statistical analysis of the results; with the CEC on indoor air,
dust, fish/shellfish and local grown food analysis on Cape Cod; and with the RETCC and the trainee action teams
on joint research exchanges, activities, and policy initiatives."

(SRP) Center is focused on innovative research to determine: the ubiquity of emerging poly- and perfluorinated
alkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water (Cape Cod study site); the suitability of current federal regulatory
standards; the significance of adverse health impacts, e.g., immune dysfunction and metabolic abnormalities
during early development and possibly beyond (Faroe Islands); the predictors of vulnerability to health impacts;
the development of novel detection tools (passive samplers) to test for the presence of precursors and
concentrations of PFAS in groundwater and private wells; the implications of the presence of PFAS with regard
to bioaccumulation in humans, the food web, and the environment; the engagement of affected communities
with the presence and dangers of PFAS; and the dissemination of findings through state, regional, national, and
international stakeholders.
 The STEEP II Administrative Core (AC) will continue its successful operation of the STEEP SRP Center by
integrating advice from both the Internal Advisory Committee (IAC) and the External Advisory Committee (EAC)
through regular retreats and joint video calls with the STEEP team. With the STEEP Coordinator's oversight and
coordination skills, the AC will keep STEEP on target with respect to finances, reporting requirements,
supplemental funding, data management, mission, and aims. The AC will further foster the integration of cores
and projects by leading and organizing core and project specific cross-cutting meetings, workshops, retreats,
and seminars for the STEEP team.
 As host institution, URI remains committed to the success of the STEEP Center and pledges $100k per
annum toward STEEP II’s operation, including the STEEP Coordinator’s compensation, in addition to teaching
relief and funding two additional minority graduate student assistantships. The AC research translation team will
continue to serve in its central and well-integrated role of connecting intra-STEEP researchers to promote regular
communication and collaboration by working toward goals in a coordinated and interdisciplinary manner that
extends to the participating institutions. Beyond sharing data with interested parties external to the SRP Center,
a main goal of the STEEP II AC is facilitating data and knowledge-sharing between and among projects and
cores. The AC will ensure the success of the STEEP II Center through the following Aims:
 Specific Aim 1: Ensure the efficient integration of STEEP II's projects and centers
 Specific Aim 2: Provide leadership for STEEP II's mission and goals
 Specific Aim 3: Ensure that STEEP II provides relevant and timely research translation, technology
transfer, and tools for stakeholders and communities
 Specific Aim 4: Identify and work with new stakeholders and collaborators"
10868715,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – DATA MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS CORE (DMAC)
To understand the link between PFAS exposure and disease, there is a need for data integration from a broad
range of scientific disciplines and for researchers to acknowledge the importance of the entire lifecycle of the
data in a context beyond their immediate research objective. The long-term goal is to establish a data science
infrastructure that promotes best practice, i.e., high-quality data that are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and
Reusable (FAIR), and that will be easily applicable to other interdisciplinary team projects. DMAC’s overall
objective is to work closely with all STEEP project members and equip them with low-cost, user-friendly, FAIR-
integrated processes, as well as cutting-edge statistical and computing methods. Guided by the team’s
experience, DMAC will pursue four specific aims: (i) develop, coordinate, and monitor a user-friendly, easily-
accessible infrastructure and processes for creating, storing, and sharing data and metadata, irrespective of
size, both internally and publicly, (ii) address metadata needs across all STEEP research data products, (iii)
provide integrative methodological and computational support, as well as develop mission-oriented methods,
and (iv) develop standards for and provide data quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) across STEEP
projects. The approach is innovative because it departs from the status quo by providing: (i) an easy-to-
implement, modern, and integrative data management infrastructure that is compliant with all FAIR principles
and QA/QC, (ii) cutting-edge statistical methods (e.g., causal inference, Bayesian, and time series models) to
draw mathematically-precise inferences from complex data structures (e.g., non-randomized, longitudinal), and
(iii) high-performance computing resources. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to
advance and expand the use of FAIR-compliant research in the field of environmental health. Ultimately, such
practice has the potential to inform policy makers with precise and reliable findings and help reduce the
reproducibility crisis. STEEP’s DMAC will pursue these goals via these Specific Aims:
 Specific Aim 1: Develop and support infrastructure and processes for sharing data and metadata
 Specific Aim 2: Address metadata needs across all STEEP research data products:
 Specific Aim 3: Provide integrative statistical support
 Specific Aim 4: Develop standards for and provide data quality assurance and quality control
(QA/QC) across STEEP research projects"
10868717,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CORE (CEC)
The STEEP Community Engagement Core (CEC) will address community concerns about per- and polyfluoro-
alkyl substances (PFAS), with a goal of developing intervention strategies to reduce exposures and prevent
adverse health outcomes. CEC activities will center on Cape Cod, MA, where the sole source aquifer, which
provides drinking water to 200000 year-round and 500000 summer residents, has been contaminated by
aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) use at a municipal fire training academy, military base, airport, and other
locations. Initial findings from STEEP’s private wells study suggest domestic wastewater entering groundwater
from septic systems also can be a source of PFAS to private wells on Cape Cod. While public and private drinking
water wells with PFAS levels above health guidelines are now being treated for PFAS, environmental exposures
may remain elevated from consumption of locally grown produce in areas with historical drinking water
contamination and consumption of fish and shellfish in areas with contaminated surface waters.
 CEC will strengthen and extend existing bidirectional connections throughout Cape Cod to address local
concerns, increase public awareness, and develop intervention strategies to reduce PFAS exposures. CEC will
continue to engage with town and county health officials, water suppliers, environmental NGOs, and residents.
Bidirectional approaches will include holding focus groups with target communities, hosting STEEP community
update events, participating in community events throughout Cape Cod, and serving as a resource to inform
decision making processes. CEC will work with the Administrative Core (AC) on research translation to develop
informational materials and continue to engage with local media to reach a broad audience. CEC will extend its
partnership with the Mashpee-Wampanoag Tribe to evaluate exposures among tribal members and develop
culturally specific risk reduction strategies. STEEP trainees will connect with high school teachers to educate
students about PFAS and other pollutants and inspire their interest in protecting water quality.
Aim 1: Address community concerns about PFAS exposures from environmental sources by offering a testing
program for homegrown produce and locally caught fish and shellfish and supporting STEEP’s extended
exposure assessment in Hyannis.
Aim 2: Collaborate with the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe to collect fish, shellfish, and well water for PFAS
analysis, develop identity-based messaging strategies to communicate PFAS risks with tribal members, and
evaluate the effectiveness of various messages and delivery channels to reduce PFAS exposures.
Aim 3: Connect STEEP trainees with high schools on Cape Cod to enhance understanding of PFAS and other
water quality issues through supplemental curriculum and Cape-wide high school water quality summits.
Aim 4: Collaborate with community organizations on Cape Cod and more broadly to educate and empower
communities affected by PFAS contamination."
10868719,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - RESEARCH EXPERIENCE AND TRAINING COORDINATION CORE
The major scientific theme of the University of Rhode Island (URI)-led STEEP (Sources, Transport, Exposure
and Effects of PFAS) Center is to provide solutions to aid the NIH Superfund Research Program (SRP) in
addressing emerging per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS), reducing human exposure, training, and
engaging affected communities. The STEEP Research Experience and Training Coordination Core (RETCC)
will provide pre- and post-doctoral level trainees with resources and opportunities to become skilled
scientists/engineers, equipped to address various aspects of emerging contaminants, specifically the scientific,
remediation, community, and translational facets of PFAS. To do so, STEEP has assembled a competent group
of scientists, engineers, and professionals from URI, Harvard University, and Silent Spring Institute. RETCC will
capitalize on the multi-institutional strengths of the STEEP team, centered on emerging contaminants, and
proposes innovative and interdisciplinary training activities. In STEEP II, all trainees will participate in at least
one of four new Trainee Action Centered Teams In Communities (TACTIC), focused on: (i) high-school
pedagogy, (ii) research translation; (iii) science-policy support; and (iv) community engagement and outreach.
The four STEEP research projects involve seven PIs/senior investigators and RETCC will maintain 10-12 fully
supported graduate students as primary STEEP predoctoral trainees throughout the grant cycle. Additional
graduate students will be supported as secondary STEEP trainees using Center funds for a total of 25 graduate
trainees. In addition, two STEEP fellowships supporting students from underrepresented groups will be added
through the URI Graduate School Minority Program (see “Institutional Commitment”). These graduate trainees
are expected to be engaged fully in our rigorous and engaging interdisciplinary training activities (see “Proposed
Training”). STEEP II also expects to support 4-6 postdoctoral trainees over the entire five-year funding period.
Overall, STEEP II will provide a rich interdisciplinary training experience that brings together trainees from
diverse scientific fields, including oceanography, public health, pharmacy, engineering, biostatistics, and
computer science, empowering them to be change makers and problem-solvers. STEEP II trainees will be the
next generation of scientists in hazardous substance research who can advance public policy, regulatory
science, chemistry safety, and human health protection."

10866100,"Abstract
Extremely preterm infants born at 23 to 26 weeks gestation have the highest incidence of thrombocytopenia
and bleeding and the highest mortality among neonates admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).
Approximately 20% of extremely preterm infants develop a severe intracranial hemorrhage, almost always in
the first week of life, which is the highest risk period for bleeding. Platelet transfusions are frequently
administered to extremely preterm neonates at higher platelet count thresholds than those used in older
children and adults to decrease the risk of bleeding. Paradoxically, a recent multicenter randomized trial of
infants <34 weeks gestation conducted in Europe (PlaNeT-2) found that neonates randomized to a lower
platelet transfusion threshold of 25x10^9/L, compared to 50x10^9/L, had a significantly lower risk of death or
serious bleeding. However, 39% of infants received one or more platelet transfusions before enrollment, and
the median age at recruitment was 7-8 days, suggesting that a high proportion of thrombocytopenic infants in
the first week of life were not randomized before being transfused. This likely contributed to the persistent
uncertainty regarding optimal platelet transfusion thresholds, specifically in the most immature preterm infants
in the first week of life. In a recent survey, 57% of responding European NICUs continued to use thresholds
above 25x10^9/L in infants <28 weeks' gestation and <7 days old. Another question raised by PlaNeT-2 was
whether thresholds lower than 25x10^9/L can be safely applied to extremely preterm infants after the first week
of life, when the risk of bleeding is much lower. The Neonatal Platelet Transfusion Threshold (NeoPlaTT) trial
was specifically designed to address these critical questions and will test the hypothesis that, among extremely
preterm infants born at 23 to 26 weeks gestation, a low platelet transfusion threshold, compared to a high
threshold, will improve survival without major or severe bleeding up to 40 weeks postmenstrual age. The
Specific Aims will (1) determine the comparative effectiveness of low platelet transfusion thresholds
(25x10^9/L in the 1st week of life, 20x10^9/L thereafter), compared to high thresholds (50x10^9/L in the 1st
week, 35x10^9/L thereafter), on the risks of death or major/severe bleeding for infants born at 23 to 26 weeks
gestation; (2) determine the comparative effectiveness of high vs. low thresholds on mortality as a key
secondary outcome, along with serious morbidities and need for platelet transfusion. Importantly, the trial will
be conducted in the NICHD Neonatal Research Network, which is a consortium of NICUs with established site
research infrastructure and extensive experience conducting multicenter clinical trials with early recruitment of
high-risk neonates. If our hypothesis is confirmed, this trial will change the current paradigm regarding the
liberal use of platelet transfusions to prevent bleeding towards the avoidance of unnecessary platelet
transfusions in this population. Most importantly, knowledge generated from the NeoPlaTT trial may improve
outcomes in our most vulnerable patients, while also decreasing costs and conserving resources."
10865631,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The broad goal of this proposal is to define a five-year scientific training and career development plan to
prepare the candidate to become an independent physician-scientist in the domain of primary immune
regulatory disorders (PIRD). The field of primary immune deficiency is rapidly growing, now recognizing around
500 monogenic inborn errors of immunity, of which at least 10% result in immune dysregulation. An increasing
number of these disorders are caused by mutations in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, a signaling cascade
that is also a frequent therapeutic target in disorders of the immune system and malignancy. To deliver
effective diagnostic, treatment, and management decisions, an in-depth understanding of cell-specific
aberrations in these pathways is needed. STAT3 gain-of-function (GOF) syndrome is a PIRD with multi-organ
involvement and early onset autoimmunity. We recently demonstrated T cell dysregulation with inherent Th1-
skewing and an isolated defect in peripheral Treg cell generation in a model of STAT3 GOF syndrome—
findings that challenge current hypotheses regarding disease pathogenesis. The primary scientific goal of this
research project is to study the mechanisms contributing to T cell dysregulation in STAT3 GOF syndrome. To
achieve this, we will study critical interactions between T and B cells as well as the development, polarization,
and function of these cells. Immunophenotyping and transcriptional analysis will be done using a murine model
of STAT3 GOF syndrome and viral infection models. In addition, we will establish the impact of STAT3 GOF on
antigen-specific responses and mucosal tolerance using a TCR transgenic mouse system and a viral infection
model. Furthermore, we plan to utilize a series of in vitro assays to define the impact of STAT3 GOF on T cell
polarization in patients. The proposed career development plan incorporates training in technical expertise,
grant and scientific writing, responsible conduct of research, as well as mentorship through individualized
instruction, didactic courses, University-sponsored seminars, and presentation and attendance at national
conferences. Washington University School of Medicine is the ideal training environment given its rich scientific
and collaborative culture, and commitment to training physician-scientists. The training will occur under the
guidance of the candidate's primary mentor, Dr. Megan Cooper, and the scientific advisory committee, along
with a strong group of collaborators. The proposed career development plan and research aims outlined in this
application will provide the candidate with the necessary skills and knowledge to become an independent
physician-scientist and make significant contributions to the field of primary immune regulatory disorders.
Results from these studies have the potential to uncover new biomarkers, targetable cellular pathways, and
further insight into disease pathogenesis and human immunology."
10865996,"Abstract
Nonsense Mediated mRNA Decay (NMD) degrades both aberrant transcripts containing Premature Termination
Codons (PTCs) and “normal” transcripts with other specific features. Regulation by NMD is pervasive and
estimated to impact around 10% of the transcriptome. UPF3 is a central NMD factor that bridges the mRNA
bound Exon Junction Complex (EJC) with the rest of the NMD machinery and aids in PTC recognition. In
mammals, there are two paralogs of UPF3, UPF3A and UPF3B, that have been documented to have both distinct
biological roles and functions. We and others previously found that UPF3A can compensate for UPF3B in NMD,
but is a weaker activator; moreover, this difference in activity is conferred by the “mid” domain. Moreover,
overexpression of UPF3A, but not UPF3B stabilizes an NMD reporter mRNA. To understand the different
propensities of UPF3 paralogs to stimulate NMD, we performed immunoprecipitation followed by mass
spectrometry to identify their associated factors. In addition EJC and NMD components, we identified
transcriptional regulators and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling factors to be among some of the most enriched factors
in UPF3A and UPF3B immunoprecipitation. We also identified members of the nuclear transcription regulating
Little/Super Elongation Complex (LEC/SEC); the LEC was previously identified as an NMD factor that promotes
UPF3B association with the EJC. UPF3 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, but its nuclear functions are
unknown. For the K99 phase, I will investigate the impact of these nuclear functions on UPF3 deposition and
NMD activity. I hypothesize that nuclear import is required for UPF3 function in NMD, and the LEC/SEC mediate
nuclear UPF3 deposition onto nascent mRNPs. I will also investigate the functional differences between the
UPF3 paralogs in human cells and in zebrafish development; I hypothesize that differential nuclear deposition
underlies some of the functional differences between UPF3A and UPF3B, and their distinct roles in vivo arise
from these functional, rather than expression differences. In zebrafish, Upf3a was implicated in the poorly
characterized Genetic Compensation Response (GCR) via interaction with nuclear histone modifiers, and we
found that this interaction is conserved in human cells. For the R00 phase, I will characterize the mechanism of
GCR initiation from NMD-targeted mRNAs. I hypothesize UPF3A/Upf3a-stimulated NMD is required for GCR
and UPF3A/Upf3a presence at these genomic loci determines GCR. Importantly, I have assembled a strong
mentoring committee that will contribute their expertise to both my research training and professional
development. This work will elucidate how the nuclear functions of the UPF3 paralogs impact NMD and how
their functions contribute to developmental outcomes. Taken together, this work will deepen our understanding
of how events in the nucleus and cytoplasm are coordinated to regulate cytoplasmic mRNA decay and its
feedback to transcriptional regulation."
10879605,"Detecting Genetic Susceptibility for Fatty Liver Disease in Lean vs. Non-lean Individuals: Use of a Deep
Learning Algorithm
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Fatty liver disease (FLD) is the most common liver disease in the world, affecting nearly 1 billion people.
Although it commonly occurs among overweight and obese (non-lean) individuals, a quarter of those affected
are lean. Paradoxically, although lean individuals with FLD are less likely to have cardiometabolic risk factors
(e.g., diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia), they have a two-fold increased risk of cardiovascular and
liver-related mortality. Metabolic dysfunction and alcohol use are the most common causes of FLD. However,
they have overlapping genetic risk factors and cannot be distinguished by medical imaging or histopathology.
To date, it remains unknown if there are any lean-specific genetic variants for FLD. Current thresholds of
alcohol consumption associated with FLD are arbitrary, and it is also unclear if alcohol consumption accounts
for the difference in outcomes observed between lean and non-lean individuals with FLD. With the unique
clinical and imaging data available within the Veterans’ Affairs (VA) system, combined with large-scale genetic
data available in the Million Veteran Program (MVP), the goal of this project is to identify convergent and
divergent features of lean and non-lean FLD by comparing associated clinical and genetic risk factors in those
with and without substantial alcohol exposure. We have established a cohort of over 81,000 veterans in the
MVP with genetic data who underwent non-contrast abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging for any
indication in the context of clinical care between 2011 to 2023. Our preliminary study of 45 lean and 72 non-
lean individuals shows that Automatic Liver Attenuation Region-of-interest-based Measurement (ALARM), a
deep learning tool was accurate in identifying hepatic steatosis in both lean and non-lean individuals compared
to blinded expert radiology read. The central hypothesis to be tested is that application of the ALARM tool to
non-contrast abdominal CT scans will accurately classify lean FLD and improve the identification of new
genetic variants for non-alcoholic and alcohol-related FLD in lean individuals. This hypothesis will be tested
through three specific aims: (1) We will assess the accuracy of ALARM in phenotyping lean FLD; (2) We will
characterize lean and non-lean FLD by level of alcohol consumption in the MVP cohort; and (3) Identify genetic
variants associated with lean FLD.
The proposed project will assemble the largest ever multi-ancestry cohort of persons with FLD based on the
application of artificial intelligence methods to clinically obtained non-contrast abdominal CT scans. The
proposed research will improve our understanding of the clinical and genetic underpinnings of FLD in lean
individuals and how alcohol consumption impacts these clinical and genetic risk factors. We expect to identify
distinct and potentially novel lean-specific genetic variants associated with FLD. The findings from this
proposed study will lay the foundation for developing efficient and cost-effective screening guidelines to move
precision medicine into clinical practice and possibly change screening guidelines for lean FLD in the general
VA population. The candidate has clinical expertise in hepatology and will take advantage of the resources
provided by his expert mentorship team to become an independent VA-funded physician-scientist specializing
in the genetics of fatty liver disease."
10879621,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Pediatric, adolescent, and young adult (AYA) brain cancer is the most lethal form of childhood cancer,
with limited treatment options. Through national efforts in the last several years, extensive data on molecular
profiles and outcomes of these cancers have been documented, creating a large repository as part of the
Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI). These data provide a unique opportunity to better understand the
etiology and molecular mechanisms of pediatric and AYA cancers, especially within the brain, and will enable
the identification of new therapeutic avenues. To achieve these results with these public datasets, innovative
tools and approaches are required to take advantage of the incredible resource provided.
 Importantly, as these data have been collected, parallel efforts have been underway through the BRAIN
Initiative and other atlas-scale consortia to similarly characterize the cell types that exist in the brain, with a
new focus on the human brain. We have been involved in the creation of atlas scale datasets through the brain
initiative that specifically characterize human brain development. All brain cancers, but especially those that
impact children and AYAs, reactivate cell types and developmental trajectories from normal development. As
such, now is an exceptional time to leverage the existing normal data from the developing human brain and to
integrate it with pediatric and AYA brain cancer data in order to identify what cell types are similar and different,
what gene programs the cancers leverage, and how the cancers interact with normal brain cells to drive their
expansion. Thus, we propose a two pronged approach here to (1) explore characteristics inherent within the
brain cancer transcriptional datasets in the CCDI and to (2) characterize relevant to cell – cell interactions that
could be promoting tumor growth. To do this, we will use novel tools that have enabled us to identify previously
unknown regulators of human brain development to similarly identify core regulators of pediatric and AYA brain
cancer states. With these network based methods, we will also perform robust comparisons between brain
cancers and developmental cell types and states, in the hopes of identifying novel targets that can drive cancer
cell differentiation as opposed to tumor progression. We will additionally apply a novel class of informatic tools
that enable the discovery of cell – cell communication to identify how these pediatric and AYA tumors are
communicating with the rest of the brain; these types of tumor – normal crosstalk have been recently
discovered as key drivers of pediatric brain tumors. This approach may identify additional targets in the
microenvironment that can be addressed therapeutically. Both approaches will provide orthogonal methods of
validating the FDA Relevant Molecular Target List and will provide resources for additional research into these
cancers. As such, all analysis from this project will be shared widely through easily accessible public data
browsers, and we will enthusiastically engage in consortium meetings to share ideas and results."
10869861,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The global pandemic that we are currently facing has further underscored the importance of harnessing
information from heterogeneous data sources and turning them into actionable knowledge. Building a
diverse, intellectually dynamic and socially progressive workforce in data science is more important than
ever. We propose a six-week long undergraduate summer institute in Biostatistics and Data Science:
“Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data” to be held in person at the Department of
Biostatistics, University of Michigan (U-M), Ann Arbor, with a group of approximately 30 undergraduate
students from 2022-2026. The program builds on the success of our existing Big Data Summer Institute (BDSI)
supported by a NIH BD2K Courses and Skills grant award (2016-2018) and a SIBS award from NHLBI (2019-
2021). Over the past five years we have trained 204 undergraduate students. Of the students who have
finished their undergraduate degree, approximately 52% have pursued graduate education in a
relevant discipline and 32 have already enrolled in a relevant graduate program at the University of
Michigan. Our past cohort contains approximately 52% women and 17% underrepresented minority students.
We plan to expose program students to diverse techniques, skills and problems at the intersection of Big Data
and Human Health. We primarily focus on four genres of health Big Data arising in Electronic Health Records,
Genomics, Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Imaging. The mentored research projects will be defined
primarily in cardiovascular and infectious diseases in collaboration with clinicians and public health scientists.
The trainees will be taught and mentored by a team of interdisciplinary faculty from Biostatistics, Statistics,
Computer Science and Engineering, Epidemiology and Medicine, reflecting the shared intellectual landscape
needed for Big Data research. At the conclusion of the program there will be a capstone symposium
showcasing the research of the students via poster and oral presentation. There will be lectures by U-M
researchers, outside guests and a professional development workshop to prepare the students for graduate
school. There will be a series of panel discussions, focus groups and workshops on the importance of diversity,
equity, inclusion and ethics in data science and interactive programming that discuss the role of data science
in reducing health disparities. Along the way students are expected to form lasting bonds over shared research
experiences and social activities. The program has strong institutional support from multiple units and centers
on campus and leverages the cross-disciplinary intellectual richness of the University of Michigan.
The resources developed for the summer institute, including lectures, assignments, projects, template codes
and datasets will be freely available through a Wiki page and a YouTube channel so that this format can be
replicated anywhere in the world. This democratic dissemination plan will lead to access of teaching and
training material in this new field of health data science across the world. The overarching goal of our summer
institute in big data is to recruit and train the next generation of data scientists using a non-traditional, active
learning paradigm and engage them in influential research related to human health. We aspire to teach,
mentor, grow undergraduate trainees in ways that will shape their vision for a career in data science. Our goal
is to create an inspiring educational experience that will have a transformative impact on the future career
trajectories of our trainees. Our long-term objective is to create a skilled and diverse research workforce to
handle some of the pressing challenges in biomedical big data."
10869867,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Immediately after fertilization, metabolism in the early embryo undergoes drastic remodeling. While studies
have thoroughly characterized pre-implantation embryonic development, measurements of metabolism in the
embryo post-implantation, from gastrulation to birth have been limited by scarcity of tissue and inaccessibility
of the embryo. in vitro differentiation of human embryonic stem cells provides an unlimited source of tissue and
a platform to study the metabolic transitions that occur within the rapidly expanding embryo. Using directed
differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into pancreatic epithelium, this proposal aims to combine
metabolic interrogation of cell proliferation and biomass accumulation with developmental biology. These
studies will blend recent conceptual advances in cancer metabolism with an in vitro differentiation platform to
understand how metabolism instructs and directs cell fate decisions in the developing fetus.
 Experiments will first focus on cellular redox state, testing whether changes in NAD+/NADH ratio as human
embryonic stem cells undergo differentiation into pancreatic epithelium are necessary to support differentiation
into the pancreatic lineage. Then, kinetic tracing studies using isotopically labeled nutrient sources will quantify
rates of metabolic flux to determine how changes in overall metabolism contribute to differentiation. Finally,
metabolites that have been identified to undergo large fluctuations in abundance throughout differentiation will
be studied to determine whether their accumulation is necessary for successful pancreatic differentiation.
 This proposal is designed to explain the roles of metabolism in the developing pancreas as it continuously
differentiates and expands in a changing nutrient environment. Results from each of these aims can be used to
improve in vitro differentiation of stem cells by providing new mechanisms to guide successful differentiation
into a desired cell type. By providing new insight into metabolic regulation of stem cell fate, this work will
enhance the ability to generate curative stem cell-based therapies for patients suffering from lost or dysfunctional
tissues, especially type 1 diabetes. These therapies hold great promise for improving health and quality of life for
millions of patients.
 These experiments will be carried out in the laboratory of Professor Matthew Vander Heiden within the Koch
Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Training under this
fellowship will include presentation of this data at institutional and public conferences, publication of this work
in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and regular meetings with professor Vander Heiden to prepare the applicant
for success as a tenure track research faculty member."
10869999,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The human body is home to a complex community of microorganisms (“microbiome”) that differs in composition
between people, with numerous correlates to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Any two people will harbor different
strains of a given species, which can be more genetically different than a human and chimpanzee with <60% of
their genes shared. Even within a single person, each microbiome species may be a complex mixture of strains
with different genomes and functional capabilities. This striking within-species genetic diversity has functional
consequences for CVD, because gene loss and gain modify how strains process our diet, metabolize drugs, and
stimulate inflammation. Hence, a population genetic approach is essential for revealing causal links between the
microbiome and CVD.
We have compiled a deeply phenotyped cohort of ~50,000 individuals with metagenomic sequencing of their gut
microbiomes. This dataset includes ~8,000 people with atherosclerosis, thousands with measurements of heart
function and metabolic health, and hundreds with acute coronary syndrome. This cohort is a unique and ideal
setting to perform a well-powered CVD metagenome-wide association study (MWAS).
Several barriers must be overcome before MWAS can be deployed at this scale. First, we must reduce the
infeasible computational cost of genotyping thousands of microbiome species across ~50,000 people. Second,
to ensure that statistical tests for associations do not have high false positive rates we need statistical models
that adjust for microbial population structure within and across hosts. The goal of this proposal is to create a
research toolbox to address these challenges as well as to identify putative mechanistic links between
microbiome and CVD. We will develop data structures and query algorithms for accelerated genotype estimation
and mixed effects models for accurate association tests. All code and methods will be open source and designed
to be easily extended to other microbiome cohorts.
Applying these tools to our cohort, we aim to identify specific microbial genes and pathways responsible for
known associations between microbes and CVD. We also expect to discover new associations that were missed
because cohorts were too small or they were analyzed with methods that ignore differences in gene content
across strains. These findings will be used to identify microbial biomarkers for CVD diagnosis and personalized
treatments or to design microbiome targeted drugs, prebiotics, and probiotics to treat heart disease."

Public Health Nutrition. Our overall goal is to incorporate concepts, approaches, and scientific
tools from both basic and applied science so that trainees are able to transcend conventional
specialty boundaries. This Training Program is designed both for individuals who have recently
completed their master's or undergraduate degree and are entering a formal doctoral program,
and for physicians and graduates of other doctoral programs who will enter an intensive
research training program with options to obtain formal degrees. In this renewal application, we
propose to work closely with the MD/PhD program to identify and encourage Harvard medical
students to apply to our training program as part of their joint degree requirements. Regardless
of track, all degree candidates must successfully complete didactic coursework involving both
basic biochemical and molecular concepts and advanced training in quantitative sciences,
including epidemiology and biostatistics. All trainees participate in demanding hands-on
preceptor-guided nutritional science research guided by well-funded nutrition scientists.
Trainees of this program, of whom 33% are under-represented minorities, have established a
strong record of publication and success in obtaining grants and faculty positions. Over the next
five years, we propose that this program support 4 predoctoral and 4 postdoctoral trainees
annually in the academic environment of HSPH and HMS."

The Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) is a member of the eukaryotic Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) domain protein
family that regulates adaptive and toxic responses to a variety of chemical pollutants, including polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated dioxins, most notably 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD).
We recently showed that female, but not male liver-specific AhR conditional knockout mice are protected from
high fat diet-induced obesity and exhibited improved metabolic homeostasis. The sexually dimorphic
phenotype was attributed to increased hepatic expression of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in females.
FGF21 is a circulating hepatokine that affects carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and induces thermogenesis
in white and brown fat deposits by uncoupling mitochondrial respiration from the electron transport chain.
These properties have motivated research into the development of FGF21-based therapeutics to combat
metabolic disorders and obesity, but with little success to date. Hence, understanding how AhR activity
controls Fgf21 expression may point to novel strategies or targets for the development of clinical interventions.
Hepatic Fgf21 expression is also under the control of sex steroids and is subject to circadian rhythms. The
latter observation is of note because both the AhR and its partner protein, the AhR Nuclear Translocator
(ARNT), belong to the same PAS protein family as several of the circadian rhythm (clock) proteins, including
brain and muscle ARNT-like 1 (BMAL1). Hepatic AhR expression exhibits a 24 h periodicity in phase with
BMAL1 oscillations, suggestive of co-regulation of these proteins. Moreover, ARNT shares considerable
sequence similarity to BMAL1, and an AhR-BMAL1 interaction has been reported, implying that interactions
between circadian rhythmicity and AhR signaling are reciprocal and significant. The central premise of this
application is, that hepatic Fgf21 expression represents a nexus where AhR signaling and the molecular events
underlying sexual dimorphism and circadian rhythmicity, coalesce. We hypothesize that a comprehensive
assessment of how these physiologically disparate signaling processes are integrated is required to fully
understand AhR regulated Fgf21 expression, and its impact on diet-induced obesity. To test the hypothesis,
we propose experimental strategies that preserve the physiological context and genomic milieu. Specific Aim 1
will examine Fgf21 promoter functionality from the standpoint of AhR, ARNT, and BMAL1 activity as a function
of circadian rhythmicity. Specific Aim 2 will use single-cell transcriptomics to identify diurnal changes in liver
gene expression due to AhR, ARNT, and BMAL1 activity. Specific Aim 3 will interrogate sexually dimorphic
Fgf21 expression as a function of estrogenicity. The Specific Aims constitute distinct yet integrated endeavors
to mechanistically understand how the AhR regulates Fgf21 expression in the liver, under experimental
conditions that preserve the physiological processes responsible for the sexual dimorphism and circadian
rhythmicity in the context of a native genomic milieu that retains normal chromatin architecture."

 The complex life cycle processes of encystation and excystation in Entamoeba represent potential targets
for therapeutic intervention but have not been studied directly in the human pathogen Entamoeba histolytica
because of an inability to produce cysts in a laboratory setting. Instead, scientists have been forced to rely on
studies with the distantly related reptile pathogen Entamoeba invadens. Our lab has established a method for
reproducible encystation of E. histolytica in laboratory culture and in this project we propose to develop
reproducible, high efficiency excystation as well. E. histolytica causes amoebic dysentery in ~100 million
people each year worldwide, although as many as 1 billion people may be infected each year as only ~10% of
infections result in symptomatic disease. The inability to study encystation and excystation in the laboratory
has greatly hindered investigation of the life cycle and infection process. The long-term goal of our research
program is to determine how E. histolytica senses and adapts to different environments it encounters during
infection. Encystation and excystation are the two key adaptations, allowing Entamoeba to continue the
disease process through dissemination of infectious cysts. Having established a reproducible system for
encystation of E. histolytica in culture, we are now able to do the same for excystation, thus allowing us to
study these critical processes in the lab to pursue an understanding of how E. histolytica senses and responds
to environmental cues that signal conversion from motile trophozoite to infectious cyst and back. As part of our
long-term goal, the overall objective of this proposal is to develop a reproducible method for high efficiency
excystation of E. histolytica in vitro cysts. To this end, we will use two approaches: (1) increase excystation
efficiency with standard in vitro cysts; and (2) produce in vitro cysts that exhibit high efficiency excystation. We
will apply these two approaches iteratively, such that we will identify the optimal combination of conditions for
both encystation and excystation that leads to reproducible, high efficiency excystation. This research will have
a significant impact by laying an important foundation for future studies on excystation of the human pathogen
such that we can identify and characterize the roles of key genes required for this essential disease process."

Ventricular arrhythmias (VT/VF) due to cardiac disease and myocardial infarction (MI) lead to sudden cardiac
death. To prevent sudden cardiac death, implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICD) are used. Although
defibrillators save lives by aborting dangerous arrhythmias, they neither prevent recurrence of VT/VF nor
progression of the underly disease. Recurrent ICD shocks are associated with increased mortality and
hospitalizations, and decreased quality of life. Despite our current therapies, including catheter ablation, 60-
75% of patients have recurrence of their VT/ICD shocks at 2 years. Additional therapies are desperately
needed. Chronic sympathetic activation and reduced parasympathetic function increase risk of VT/VF and
recurrent ICD shocks. MI leads to amplification of sympathetic afferent signaling, which increases sympathetic
outflow to the heart and causes release of not only, norepinephrine, but several co-transmitters, including
neuropeptide Y and galanin. These neuropeptides have much longer half-lives than norepinephrine, and
elevated sympathetic neuropeptide levels in MI and heart failure are associated with increased mortality. It has
also been known for decades that MI reduces parasympathetic function, the body's own anti-arrhythmic drug,
increasing risk of VT/VF. However, clinical trials that attempted to increase vagal outflow by stimulating mixed
nerves (vagal nerve stimulation, spinal cord stimulation) have had disappointing results, likely because the
reasons behind chronic parasympathetic “withdrawal” remain unknown. In order develop new targeted
therapies, it is critical to understand mechanisms underlying parasympathetic dysfunction and sympathetic and
parasympathetic interactions that occur in the setting of cardiac disease. In this proposal, we aim to test the
novel hypotheses that (1) persistent efferent sympathetic activation due to MI inhibits parasympathetic
function at the nerve-myocyte interface (the neuro-effector junction) due to release of sympathetic co-
transmitters and (2) sympathetic afferent activation reduces central vagal tone. In specific aim 1, we will
test whether inhibition of sympathetic neuropeptides, neuropeptide Y and galanin, improves vagal tone and
prove anti-arrhythmic. In aim 2, we will test whether sympathetic afferent blockade improves parasympathetic
function and decreases ventricular arrhythmias. For aims 1 and 2, we will utilize hemodynamic and multi-
electrode array neural recordings simultaneously with high-density electrophysiological mapping and direct
interstitial norepinephrine measurements in a large animal model. Aim 3 will evaluate whether disruptions of
sympathetic signaling via cardiac sympathetic denervation, the only current therapy that interrupts sympathetic
afferent fibers and potentially reduces co-transmitters levels, will improve parasympathetic function in patients
with scar-mediated VT. Understanding these fundamental autonomic pathways has the potential to accelerate
development of disease-modifying targeted therapies for ventricular arrhythmias in the U.S. and worldwide."

Candidate: I am a headache specialist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). I have a PhD in
visual systems neuroscience that focused on studying properties of neuronal adaptation in the visual cortex.
More recently, I have begun clinical research related to pediatric headache disorders and the study of
photophobia in migraine. My long-term goal is to elucidate the pathophysiology of concussion and headache,
identify relevant biomarkers, and improve the treatment of these conditions in young people. This grant will
enable me to build skills in concussion biomarker development to become an independent, translational
neuroscientist dedicated to improving the care of concussion and headache in children.
Research: Concussion is a major health concern, affecting 20% of youth in the United States. Headache is the
most common symptom following concussion and is associated with longer recovery times and greater
disability. However, there are no accepted guidelines on how or when to treat post-traumatic headache (PTH),
and there are no early biomarkers to identify youth at risk for prolonged PTH. PTH and migraine share many
clinical features and may have overlapping pathophysiology. The goal of this proposal is to determine if
pathophysiologic substrates of migraine are present early in PTH. I will examine electrophysiologic and blood
candidate biomarkers associated with trigeminovascular pathway sensitization (central to migraine
pathogenesis) at multiple time points in youth with PTH lasting longer than 1 month. These measures will be
compared to youth with symptom resolution.
Environment and Career Development: CHOP and University of Pennsylvania (Penn) offer a rich
environment for me to develop as an independent investigator. My mentorship team has diverse expertise and
will provide me with a unique set of skills to support biomarker development in pediatric concussion. My
primary mentor, Dr. Geoffrey K Aguirre, is an accomplished vision neuroscientist with expertise in the visual
system in migraine. He will provide the mentorship needed to develop advanced techniques in signal
processing for electrophysiologic biomarkers. My co-mentor, Dr. Ramon Diaz-Arrastia, is a leader in traumatic
brain injury biomarker research. He will provide guidance and support on study design for blood biomarker
development including the use of biomarkers in clinical trials. My second co-mentor, Dr. Christina Master, is an
expert in pediatric concussion who has built the Frontier Minds Matter concussion program at CHOP. This
program provides an extensive and well-integrated clinical and research infrastructure for longitudinal
concussion studies in youth, which will provide crucial support to the proposed studies."

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a major socioeconomic problem in the modern world. Acute and chronic alcohol
exposure is known to lead to system-wide changes in gene expression throughout multiple brain-regions and
cell-types. The mammalian genome is comprised of both protein-coding and non-protein-coding transcripts,
with less than 2% being protein-coding. Despite outnumbering protein-coding genes, the biological function of
most non-coding transcripts remains largely unknown. The largest class of non-coding transcripts are long
non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are operationally defined as transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides in
length that do not encode for proteins. Most studies conducted to-date for lncRNAs have shown a critical role
of lncRNAs in regulation of gene expression. Additionally, lncRNAs are important for alternative splicing of
protein-coding transcripts, a biological process necessary for achieving cellular and molecular diversity of
proteins. Alternative splicing is crucial for mounting context-dependent responses of the immune system.
Chronic alcohol exposure has been previously shown to activate the neuroimmune system, altering CNS
plasticity and behavior. Astrocytes are a specialized glial cell-type, outnumbering neurons, and other glial cells
in the central nervous system (CNS). Astrocytes contiguously tile the entire CNS, playing a key role in
numerous biological functions including responding to CNS insults, activation of neuroimmune pathways, and
modulating behavior. Astrocytes are known to be involved in ethanol sensitivity and consumption; however, the
contribution of lncRNAs to regulation of neuroimmune pathways in astrocytes and ethanol-related behaviors is
unknown. This research proposal will test the overall hypothesis that the expression of lncRNAs in astrocytes
is important for coordinating ethanol-induced neuroimmune activation, alternative splicing, and ethanol-related
behaviors. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches this proposal will use advanced genomic
approaches to determine the causal relationship of lncRNAs in mediating astrocyte activation and ethanol-
related behaviors. Overall, our studies will establish novel molecular mechanisms for regulating gene
expression in response to excessive alcohol exposure and contribute to a better understanding of the
pathogenesis of AUD."

Intracellular membrane-bound organelles are a hallmark of all eukaryotic cells. Understanding how cells
generate different organelles remains one of the central problems in cell biology. Some organelles, like the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, are self-generating whereas other organelles can be
generated de novo. The ER plays a central role in organelle biogenesis. Even though the ER is a single
continuous membrane that extends from the outer nuclear envelope into the periphery of the cell, there are
discrete regions in the ER membrane called ER subdomains. Nascent peroxisomes and lipid droplets (LDs)
form at specialized ER subdomains. Remarkably, little is known about these ER subdomains and their role
in regulating organelle biogenesis. The goal of our research is to determine the mechanisms of peroxisome
and LD biogenesis by detailed characterization of the discrete ER subdomains using S. cerevisiae and
mammalian cell culture. Previously, we identified a family of reticulon-like ER membrane tubulating proteins,
Pex30 in yeasts and multiple C2 domains containing transmembrane proteins, MCTP1 and MCTP2, in
higher eukaryotes. We demonstrated that both Pex30 and MCTPs are localized at discrete ER subdomains
where nascent pre-peroxisomal vesicles and LDs are formed. Based on these findings, we proposed to
identify the proteins and lipids enriched at the specialized ER subdomains using unbiased as well as
candidate-based approaches. We will then test the effects of modulating the functions of candidate proteins
and lipids on the formation, abundance, morphology, and distribution of peroxisomes and LDs. Investigating
the mechanistic details of peroxisomes and LDs biogenesis from these ER subdomains is not only
important for understanding basic principles of cell biology but also has critical medical implications. Several
life-threatening neurological disorders including Zellweger syndrome associated with peroxisomal defects
and metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease caused due to LD defects have no
cure. Determining the mechanisms of organelle biogenesis will have implications in understanding the
pathophysiology of these disorders and provide us hints for potential therapeutic targets."

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent and progressive neurological disorder impacting more than 1 million
Americans with a well-known prodromal period in which individuals experience non-specific symptoms before
receiving a diagnosis. Critically, this diagnosis often occurs after widespread, irreversible neurodegeneration has
already occurred. Those with PD then encounter an escalating burden of disability and symptom severity,
resulting in substantial direct medical expenses related to pharmaceutical treatments, hospitalizations, and
skilled nursing care. Despite the significant disease burden associated with PD, there is a scarcity of effective
preventive measures or risk reduction strategies, and limited understanding of factors that influence the rate at
which clinical PD develops or ‘phenoconversion’ for those with prodromal symptoms. Inflammation is an
emerging key disease process contributing to PD risk and may play a key pathogenic role during the prodromal
period. Conditions characterized by chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction, including several
autoimmune disorders, are considered potential risk factors for PD; certain immune agents used to treat these
conditions have also been associated with a lower risk of PD, offering a novel approach to reduce PD risk by
targeting immune processes. However, the results of existing are inconsistent, potentially due to inadequate
control for confounding or bias related to reverse causation; few have also assessed the impact of immune
factors on the rate of phenoconversion to clinical PD. The goals of this proposal are to evaluate whether long-
term exposure to immune therapies is a strategy to reduce PD risk and phenoconversion rates. For this study,
we will leverage genetic and risk factor information and detailed follow-up available as a part of three large-scale
biobanks in which we will consider comprehensive array of therapeutic agents used to treat a range of
autoimmune diseases (AIDs) as they relate to PD. Specifically, we will utilize the well-characterized effects of
genetic variation in influencing the expression or function of individual AID therapeutic targets as instruments to
help to understand the downstream effects of AID treatment on PD risk and phenoconversion. This epidemiologic
framework will be embedded within a comprehensive bioinformatic pipeline in which extensive differential
expression and epigenetic remodeling-based analyses at the single-cell level will further refine and characterize
novel immune-associated therapeutic targets in the context of PD. Our central hypothesis is that inflammatory
mechanisms contribute to both PD and AIDs, and that certain therapies approved to target immune processes
in AIDs may be novel strategies to mitigate PD risk and phenoconversion. The collective results of this project
will (1) help to improve risk stratification; (2) unravel new mechanisms contributing to disease risk and
progression in PD’s early stages; and (3) aid in the design of future trials testing novel therapeutic targets for
which there are existing agents with a strong biological foundation."

Periodontitis is a polymicrobial-driven and prevalent inflammatory disease of the tissues supporting the teeth
in adults with adverse effects on overall human health. Studies have revealed that cobalamin (vitamin B12)
transporters are highly active in the periodontal microbiome associated with the periodontal pockets of
individuals with periodontitis. Yet, the functional correlation between cobalamin utilization and the pathogenic
potential of periodontal pathogens remains largely unknown. Our studies have elucidated an interconnection
between cobalamin utilization, stress responses, and the virulence potential of Porphyromonas gingivalis
(Pg), a key periodontal pathogen in periodontitis disease. As a potent redox sensor, cobalamin promotes cellular
homeostasis under redox-changing stresses caused by nutritional limitation and reactive oxygen species (ROS).
These stressors represent intrinsic attributes of the inflammatory mechanisms to eliminate infections. Based on
our findings and that cobalamin plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis under redox-
changing stresses, we hypothesize that cobalamin acts as a key redox-active mediator orchestrating
genomic and metabolic adaptations, thereby enabling the pathogen to overcome diverse stresses
and foster pathogenicity. To investigate this hypothesis, we propose two specific aims. Specific Aim 1. The
impact of cobalamin on the genomic-metabolic adaptations in Pg strain 381 under stress conditions. This aim
will investigate; i) the impact of cobalamin on the gene expression profile of Pg under two separate biologically
relevant stresses, including iron limitation and ROS availability. To this end we will perform RNA sequencing,
followed by RT-qPCR-based validation; and ii) the impact of cobalamin on the metabolic profile of Pg cells
grown under the stress conditions by performing untargeted and targeted metabolomic analyses. Overall, this
aim will greatly inform about the intricate connections between cobalamin utilization and the genomic-metabolic
adaptations in Pg under biologically relevant stress conditions. Specific Aim 2. To understand cobalamin-
regulated virulence potential and survival of Pg strain 381 in the presence of host defense mechanisms. We will
determine: i) the effect of cobalamin on the virulence potential of Pg cells mediated by proteases, known as
gingipains; and ii) the impact of cobalamin on the survival of Pg and its immunostimulatory potential using
whole blood killing and neutrophil assays. This aim will enable us to determine the impact of cobalamin on Pg's
ability to survive within the host and modulate its pathogenic potential. Upon completion of the proposed
studies, for the first time, we will uncover the biological significance of cobalamin utilization in Pg's survival
and pathogenesis during infection. Understanding the role of cobalamin in the pathogenesis of periodontal
pathogens has the potential to open new avenues for therapeutic interventions in periodontal disease."

We are requesting funds to acquire a Thermo Fisher Scientific integrated Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-
EM) imaging system (Imaging Energy Filter/Direct Electron Detector) that will upgrade cryo-EM capabilities
at the University of Colorado Anschutz School of Medicine Cryo-Electron Microscopy Facility (AnCEM).
AnCEM, established in 2016 to enable cryo-EM research on the Anschutz campus and beyond, is backed by
strong institutional support from the Anschutz School of Medicine, the Colorado University Cancer Center
(UCCC), and the Colorado Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (CCTSI). The centerpiece of the
facility is a Thermo Fisher Scientific 200kV Talos Arctica transmission electron microscope (TEM) equipped
with an X-FEG electron source, a phase contrast plate and a Gatan K3 Summit direct electron detector (DED).
The facility also counts with a Talos L120C TEM used for cryo-screening and imaging of stained specimens,
and with all ancillary equipment required to carry out biomolecular cryo-EM studies. A total of ~50 cryo-EM
scientist from ~20 NIH-supported research groups on campus depend on AnCEM for cryo-EM specimen
preparation, optimization and screening, and for high-resolution data collection. Over the last 6 years,
AnCEM has generated preliminary data for ~20 current NIH-funded grants and generated data included in
many peer-reviewed publications.
AnCEM’s current imaging capabilities are limited by the lack of an imaging energy filter and by sub-optimal
integration of our DED with the Talos Arctica TEM. This has a direct, negative impact on cryo-EM data quality
and data collection efficiency, and severely limits our options for selecting automated imaging software on
which all data collection depends. These limitations hinder AnCEM’s ability to support cryo-EM research on
campus and beyond and compromise the facility’s long-range viability. The proposed imaging system
upgrade will allow AnCEM to deliver considerably better cryo-EM data at a much faster rate (effectively
reducing data collection time and cost about 3-fold) and allow AnCEM to continue to drive cryo-EM research
in Denver and the surrounding area, and to provide essential support to a large number of NIH-funded
projects.
Regional institutional facilities like AnCEM play an essential role in enabling cryo-EM research, but they must
keep up with technological developments to remain relevant and properly fulfill their essential role in getting
cryo-EM projects off the ground and complementing data collection resources offered by larger national
Cryo-EM facilities. The capabilities of 200kV TEMs have been re-evaluated over the last few years and it is
now widely acknowledged that these instruments, which are comparatively cheaper to install and maintain,
can be used to determine structures of well-behaved biomolecules at better than 2Å resolution, and to
deliver high-quality cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET) data. The optics and intrinsic imaging capabilities of
our Talos Arctica are comparable to those of the newest 200kV TEMs. Therefore, upgrading the imaging
capabilities of our Talos Arctica will address imaging limitations, and dramatically enhance services offered
by AnCEM in the most rational and economically-efficient way. The proposed imaging upgrade is essential to
support the specific aims of NIH-funded research, and to meet evolving needs of cryo-EM researchers in the
CU Anschutz Medical School and beyond. The proposed upgrade will also set the stage for future
implementation of large-scale 3D imaging and Cryo-ET on the Anschutz campus."

In recognition of race/ethnic-based discrepancies in suspensions and expulsions for Black and Hispanic
children relative to White children, many districts, states, and publicly-funded preschool programs have begun
to implement suspension and expulsion bans. Although such bans may reduce racial/ethnic differences in
exclusionary disciplinary rates, it does not address the underlying biases in teacher judgment that led to these
discrepancies in the first place. Thus, there is a need for research that moves beyond examining
proportionalities in suspensions and expulsions towards a better understanding of the ways in which teachers
evaluate children’s behaviors that serve as the basis for these disciplinary decisions. It may be particularly
important to examine teachers’ behavioral assessments at preschool because the effects of exclusionary
disciplinary actions are believed to be cumulative over time, but the vast majority of research on teachers’
behavioral assessments has been conducted at the K-12 level. Furthermore, the existing studies that have
examined potential biases in preschool teachers’ behavioral assessments have been stymied by small sample
sizes and methodological limitations. Using a large-scale dataset, this study addresses the following research
questions:
 1. Do Black and Hispanic children with similar demographics and comparable levels of social-emotional
 regulation as White children receive harsher behavioral assessments? What types of behaviors are more
 likely to elicit differential assessments?
 2. Is teacher-child racial/ethnic match related to teachers’ ratings of children’s behaviors?
 3. Are teachers’ behavioral assessments of children at preschool predictive of children’s social-emotional,
 suspension, attendance, and achievement outcomes at elementary school?"

Combined, the preventable diseases of obesity and drug addiction impact an enormous number of people and
cost billions to treat. Physiological need (e.g. thirst, hunger), its hormonal signals and related central circuits,
modulate seeking for and consumption of both nutritive and drug stimuli and thus may serve as risk factors for
overeating and drug relapse. Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons and dopamine release in the
nucleus accumbens play critical roles in reinforcement. This mesolimbic system also integrates physiological
state with primary reward and environmental cues to tune approach and consumption. Indeed, the parent
grant of this competitive renewal determined that deviations from homeostasis potentiate phasic mesolimbic
signaling evoked by cues predictive of restorative stimuli. It also determined that gut hormones signaling
deviations from homeostasis act centrally to modulate phasic mesolimbic signaling in the context of both food
and drug reward. Peripheral signals act on central “first order” hypothalamic sites (e.g. subfornical nucleus
(SFO), arcuate nucleus (ARC)) that have a permeable blood-brain barrier. Modulation of discrete populations
of the SFO or ARC is sufficient to induce negative affect and modulate consummatory behavior for restorative
stimuli in a manner consistent with negative reinforcement. How first order hypothalamic neurons
communicate with the mesolimbic system for reinforcement and to bias approach and consummatory behavior
is unknown. We hypothesize that parallel circuits for thirst and hunger access the VTA via lateral hypothalamic
area (LHA) orexin neurons. As LHA orexin neurons are recruited during morphine withdrawal and orexin
receptor blockade reduces negative affect associated with morphine withdrawal, we also hypothesize that
aberrant activity in first order thirst and hunger circuits during morphine withdrawal are excellent targets for
the treatment of negative affect and to break the cycle of addiction. While hypothalamic signals clearly
modulate aspects of psychostimulant seeking and taking, their role in modulating responses to other classes of
drugs – chiefly opioids – has received little attention. In light of the obesity and opioid epidemics and their co-
morbidity, these are critical gaps in knowledge which will be addressed here. We will measure VTA dopamine
cell body activity or nucleus accumbens dopamine release using in vivo fiber photometry in behaving rats while
selectively modulating first and second order hypothalamic neurons. The aims of the proposal are: 1) to
determine the mechanism by which first order thirst neurons (SFO) modulate phasic mesolimbic signaling to
cues that predict water and drive approach; 2) to determine the mechanism by which first order hunger/satiety
neurons (ARC) modulate phasic mesolimbic signaling to cues that predict food and drive approach; and 3) to
intervene at the level of first order thirst and hunger neurons to modulate the aberrant dopamine signaling that
contributes to the negative affective state of morphine withdrawal. Results will identify novel therapeutic
targets for treating disorders of motivation, including obesity and opioid dependence."

Research: Contrary to children in the US with sickle cell anemia (SCA) who develop dysfunctional, atrophic
spleens by 5 years old, children with SCA in sub-Saharan Africa often have splenomegaly, but its functional
status and clinical consequences are unknown. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the
etiology, pathophysiology, and clinical consequences of splenomegaly in children with SCA in sub-Saharan
Africa. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the etiology and clinical effects of splenomegaly both before
and after hydroxyurea treatment in a large cohort of children with SCA, enrolled in a prospective treatment trial
(SPHERE, NCT03948867). The candidate's ancillary trial will collect serial measurements of both splenic
volume (3-dimensional ultrasound) and splenic function (Howell Jolly bodies, pitted red blood cells, and
specific viral serologies) in both the observation and the treatment groups of the SPHERE cohort and address
these specific aims: 1) identify factors associated with splenomegaly prior to treatment and correlate anatomy
(3-dimensional volume) with physiology (filtrative and immunological functions) and 2) investigate changes in
splenic volume and function during hydroxyurea treatment as well as laboratory and clinical effects of
hydroxyurea compared to untreated participants. These aims will test the following hypotheses: 1A)
baseline splenomegaly will be present in 10-20% and associated with alpha thalassemia and previous malaria
infections; 1B) pre-treatment splenic size will not correlate with function; 2A) incidence of splenomegaly will
double in children receiving hydroxyurea compared to untreated children and be predicted by pre-treatment
splenic volume, HbF response, and new malarial infections; 2B) splenomegaly with hydroxyurea treatment will
be associated with improved splenic filtrative function and preserved immunological function.
Career Development Plan: Dr. Smart's long-term goal is to become an independent investigator focused on
improving outcomes for persons with sickle cell disease in the US and globally. He will pursue the following
objectives during his K23 training: 1) obtain mentorship in the implementation of rigorous clinical trials in low-
resource settings by conducting a prospective clinical trial among children with SCA in Tanzania; 2)
understand the significance of splenic dysfunction in SCA through educational seminars and laboratory
experience that includes quantitative and qualitative assessments of spleen anatomy and physiology; and 3)
gain experience in clinical trial design and advanced statistical methods through coursework and data analysis.
Environment: The proposed research will be conducted at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center
(Cincinnati, Ohio) and Bugando Medical Centre (Mwanza, Tanzania) who have a longstanding partnership that
provides a strong collaborative environment with infrastructure for clinical and translational research,
outstanding mentorship, and an excellent team of collaborators with expertise in sickle cell disease,
immunology, hydroxyurea therapy, biostatistics, and clinical trials in low-resource settings."

Sepsis is a life-threatening systemic inflammatory condition with dysregulated host responses to an infection.
Although key hyperinflammation-based organ dysfunctions that drive disease pathology have been discovered,
the syndrome is often difficult to recognize, and current published prognostic criteria poorly identify those
destined to die with the condition. Continued failure of our efforts in improving disease prognosis in sepsis is
mainly due to substantial heterogeneity in the patient response. Even with similar age, sex, and medical
comorbidities, there is a substantial heterogeneity in the patient mortality despite excellent supportive efforts.
Here, (1) we discovered that a subpopulation of CD49c+ neutrophil arising in critically ill patients independently
predicts mortality from sepsis. (2) We further found that the neutrophil subpopulation associated with septic
fatality dramatically upregulated gene expression of the complement component C1q. (3) Importantly,
neutrophils from septic survivors expressed higher levels of C1q protein, while deceased patients failed to
maintain C1q expression in their neutrophils. (4) In mouse sepsis models, blocking C1q with neutralizing
antibodies or conditionally knocking out C1q in neutrophils led to a significant increase in septic mortality. (5)
Treatment of septic mice with C1q drastically increased the survival. Based on these preliminary observations,
our overarching hypothesis is that neutrophil C1q is a reliable prognostic biomarker of septic mortality. It
is hypothesized further that apoptotic neutrophils release C1q to control their own clearance in critically
injured organs during sepsis. Thus, C1q is a druggable target for attenuation of inflammatory damage
to septic patients with resulting improvement in survival. In Aim 1, we will determine the correlation between
C1q expression in peripheral blood neutrophils and sepsis mortality in ICU patients. Aim 2 will investigate the
mechanisms by which C1q regulates the resolution of sepsis, including C1q-dependent phagocytosis of
apoptotic neutrophils and differentiation of macrophages. Aim 3 will investigate mechanisms underlying the
heterogenous C1q expression. Aim 4 will determine the effects of recombinant C1q and its mutant variants on
the survival of septic mice. Taken together, this proposal addresses mechanisms regarding how the dysregulated
host response threatens patient survival and offers a molecular target for dampening the destructive arms of the
hyperinflammatory response while promoting disease resolution and tissue recovery."

US postsecondary students face disproportionately high food insecurity rates, two to eight times higher than
the 2021 rate for US households. Food insecurity among college students not only threatens educational
attainment but perpetuates health disparities, particularly among lower-income, racial/ethnic minority, and first-
generation students due to historical discrimination. Food insecurity has been associated with poorer physical
and mental health outcomes, leading to decreased academic performance, retention, and graduation rates.
Existing solutions to the problem are limited, and research is scarce. Food pantries, though the most
commonly used approach, often fall short due to their reliance on donations, inability to improve students'
nutritional behaviors or environments, and associated stigma. Students report shame, embarrassment, and
fear of judgment as common barriers. This research proposes an innovative shift from merely providing
emergency food assistance to promoting nutrition security. It plans to adapt the Veggie Van —an evidence-
based approach to increasing access to healthy food in underserved communities— to a college context.
Veggie Van is a mobile produce market intervention supported by over ten years of efficacy, effectiveness, and
implementation research. The adapted intervention will be tested at the University at Buffalo, the largest
university in the State University of New York (SUNY) system, known for its diverse student population. The
study will utilize implementation science adaptation frameworks to assess needs, engage stakeholders,
monitor and document adaptations, and evaluate the effects of adaptations. In Aim 1, a campus-wide online
survey will assess students' nutrition security status. Complementing this, a series of in-depth interviews will be
conducted to identify barriers and facilitators to nutrition insecurity among students experiencing food
insecurity. We will further invite students to join an advisory board to review the survey and interview findings
and guide preliminary adaptations to the Veggie Van model. In Aim 2, the adapted Campus Veggie Van will be
piloted to explore its effect on fruit and vegetable consumption and nutrition security among food-insecure
students using a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design. For Aim 3, semistructured interviews with
stakeholders and focus groups with Veggie Van customers will be used to identify adaptations to the Campus
Veggie Van necessary for increasing program feasibility, acceptability, and usage in a campus setting.
Findings from this study will be used to develop an adaptable model that targets the needs of students facing
nutrition insecurity and provides consistent access to fresh fruits and vegetables and support for healthy
eating. Ultimately, aligning with the National Strategy on Hunger and Nutrition, and focusing on student dignity
and participation, this model can be used to enhance campus nutrition security nationwide. The model will be
tested in a future cluster randomized trial, and disseminated through our existing Veggie Van Training Center,
providing training, assistance, monitoring, and evaluation for new campus Veggie Vans."

Despite significant gains in the control of Plasmodium falciparum (PF) globally, Plasmodium ovale (PO) and
Plasmodium vivax (PV) may be expanding to fill the niche left behind. These malaria species are more difficult
to control due to early commitment to transmissible life cycle stages (gametocytes), allowing transmission prior
to treatment, and by the formation of dormant liver stages (hypnozoites) which are resistant to blood stage
antimalarial drugs and can cause recurrent infection at a later date (relapse). PO and PV are more prevalent in
Africa than previously recognized. PO, known to be endemic, is a rising cause of malaria infections in multiple
countries. PV, long thought absent from Africa, has persisted despite the dogma that the lack of Duffy protein,
the main red cell (RBC) invasion ligand, renders Africans immune to infection. Despite the growing evidence of
their increased burden, almost nothing is known about key biologic parameters that govern PO and PV
transmission in Africa. Largely due to the lack of field diagnostics and molecular tools, studies of PO and PV in
most of Africa have almost exclusively been limited to cross-sectional prevalence surveys or convenience
sampling from clinics, without any attempt to gain a deeper understanding of the basic transmission biology
and relapse patterns of these species. This proposal leverages technical advances in the field, including field
deployable molecular diagnostics, high throughput genotyping and single cell sequencing, to provide the first
robust studies of these fundamental knowledge gaps in PO and PV biology in Africa. Through community and
clinic-based surveillance, we will identify PO and PV infected individuals in Dschang Cameroon, a site co-
endemic for all 4 major species of human malaria in Africa and which has the most extensive epidemiologic
data concerning PV infection in Central Africa. By combining human, vector and genomic studies, the proposal
will provide key information about transmission biology (Aim 1), relapse patterns (Aim 2) and, for PV, the
ability to overcome the mechanisms that restrict RBC invasion (Aim 3). Filling in these gaps will lead to the
design of more appropriate interventions for relapsing malaria by defining the infectious reservoir and the
contribution of relapse to the reservoir (Aim 1A, 2A and 2B), as well as defining vectors for targeted
intervention (Aim 1B). This work will provide insight into the mechanisms by which PV and PO in Africa may
prove resilient in the face of continued elimination efforts targeting PF and at the same time generate tools
(e.g. point-of-care diagnostics and diversity markers) to track these species. Together, these findings will help
shape the design of new malaria control strategies for relapsing malarias."

Work under previous support has continued to advance basic knowledge in the field of hemostasis and
thrombosis with significant contributions to the structural understanding of thrombin dynamics and prothrombin
activation. Unraveling the architecture of coagulation factors and their complexes remains a challenging task
because of the difficulty of obtaining high resolution structures for proteins containing multiple domains. We have
addressed this challenge by being among the pioneers of using cryo-EM in the field of hemostasis and
thrombosis. We have solved the structures of factors V, Va, V short and most notably that of the prothrombin-
prothrombinase complex that has documented, for the first time, the initial step of prothrombin activation along
the meizothrombin pathway. We will build upon the progress made under previous support and address the
structural basis of prothrombin activation, that remains an important unresolved issue in the field. Using cryo-
EM, we will dissect the entire kinetic scheme that defines how prothrombinase activates prothrombin along the
meizothrombin (cleavage at R320 first) and prethrombin-2 (cleavage at R271 first) pathways. We will
characterize the interaction of prothrombinase with prothrombin and meizothrombin (aim 1), and solve the
structures of prothrombin, meizothrombin, and fXa in the free form (aim 2). These studies will unravel the nature
of conformational changes and underlying mechanism leading to assembly of the various complexes in the
kinetic scheme of activation. We will test the hypothesis that cleavage at R320 takes place with prothrombin in
the collapsed closed form whilst cleavage at R271 requires meizothrombin or prothrombin to switch to the
elongated open form. We also hypothesize that prothrombinase cleaves R320 and R271 in two different
conformations. The proposal is supported by solid preliminary cryo-EM data of the prothrombin-prothrombinase
complex on nanodiscs, the meizothrombin-prothrombinase complex, as well as of prothrombin, meizothrombin,
and fXa in the free form. Success of the project will significantly advance basic knowledge on the most important
step of the coagulation response and provide a strategy for the study of other interactions of biological relevance
to blood physiopathology."
10874288,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The long-term objective of this research is to use vibrational reporters and infrared (IR)
spectroscopy to study protein and nucleic acid structure and dynamics. A full understanding of these
requires a sensitive, site-specific, and relatively non-invasive methodology with sufficient spatial and
temporal resolution. Nitrile (CN) and azide (N3) vibrational reporters satisfy these requirements when
coupled with IR spectroscopy.
 The vibrational reporter unnatural amino acid (UAA) 4-cyano-L-phenylalanine (CNPhe) will
be site-specifically genetically incorporated, individually into numerous sites in adenylate kinase (AK).
The local environments of the nitrile group of CNPhe will then be assessed upon thermal unfolding of
the protein with temperature-dependent linear IR spectroscopy. The molecular interpretation of these
spectroscopic results will be aided by X-ray crystallography in collaboration with Christine Phillips-
Piro (F&M). The aggregation mechanism and kinetics of AK will also be explored with CNPhe and IR
spectroscopy.
 The ability to potentially enhance the effectiveness of the nitrile reporter of CNPhe and 5-
cyano-2'-deoxyuridine (CNdU) will be explored by correlating the temperature-dependent nitrile
symmetric stretch frequency with either the temperature-dependent 13C or 15N NMR chemical shifts
of isotopically labeled variants of these molecules. The goal will be to gain a better understanding of
the hydration and electrostatic effects impacting the nitrile symmetric stretching frequency. This
method will then be extended to superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP).
 The further development of a method to extract the geometric orientation between two
vibrational reporters using 2D IR spectroscopy in biomolecules will also be pursued. In collaboration
with Matthew Tucker (University of Nevada, Reno), the anharmonic coupling between the vibrational
reporter pairs, measured by 2D IR spectroscopy, will be correlated to the distance and angle between
these reporters in several systems including: a nucleoside based hydrogen-bonded dimer system, a
RNA tetraloop hairpin (prepared in collaboration with Ronald Micura, University of Innsbruck,
Austria), sfGFP, and adenylate kinase (AK) constructs, where each system contains either two nitrile
reporters or one nitrile and one azide reporter.
 Franklin & Marshall College undergraduate students will play an integral role in this
biomedical health-related research."

Our overarching hypothesis is that the pathogenesis of ME/CFS entails gene-environment interactions
between the immune system and infectious agents. Many individuals with ME/CFS have a prodrome
consistent with systemic infection. Although there are instances where disease is clearly linked to
infection, no agent or agents have been consistently implicated.
The strategic plan for the second cycle of the Center reflects insights we and others have gained into
the pathogenesis of ME/CFS and other disorders, including Post Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC),
and the evolution of experimental methods since the initiation of our Center. It includes three
complementary projects: Project 1, Molecular Correlates of Symptom Severity in ME/CFS, leverages
advances in technology to create a smart phone app to track the course of illness and correlate with
biological manifestations. Project 2, Genotypic Analysis in ME/CFS, builds on the UK-based Decode
ME project, investments by the research advocacy organization Solve ME in identifying ME/CFS cases
in the US, and the investments made in genotyping 400,000 control subjects in the Kaiser Permanente
Research Bank (KPRB) to identify genotypic differences using Genome Wide Association Studies
(GWAS) in the US. Project 3, Pathogen Discovery through Longitudinal Serological Surveillance in
ME/CFS, will search for evidence of exposure to infectious agents prior to and after ME/CFS diagnosis,
using the unique resource of the Department of Defense Serum Repository and a new phage display
method based on short peptides, that provides the granularity required to differentiate exposure to
different viral agents as well as to differentiate acute, persistent, re-activated infections."

 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL)’s world-renowned postgraduate course and workshop program
has trained investigators and influenced research in fields ranging from proteomics to yeast biology, from ion
channel analysis to high throughput neuroanatomy. This proposal seeks support to continue two advanced
postgraduate ~two-week residential courses on complementary techniques in structural biology, X-ray
crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, which together represent twin methodological pillars in the
atomic and near-atomic resolution of macromolecular structures and complexes.
 X-ray crystallography and related methods have been the cornerstone of structural biology for half a
century, and remain the techniques of choice for atomic resolution understanding of macromolecules and for
structure guided drug discovery. CSHL’s Macromolecular Crystallography course was initiated in 1988 and
combines laboratory and computational instruction to train course participants in the major techniques used to
determine three-dimensional structures. It is designed for scientists with a working knowledge of protein
structure and function, but who are new to macromolecular crystallography or who wish to increase their in-
depth knowledge of macromolecular crystallography. Alumni of the course, including two alumni who went on
to win Nobel prizes, have gone on to make major contributions in their fields.
 Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is an emerging technique in structural biology where the biological
sample of interest is prepared under cryogenic (deep-freeze) conditions. The utility of cryo-EM stems from the
fact that it allows the observation of specimens that have not been stained or fixed in any way, showing them in
their ""native"" environment. The resolution of cryo-EM maps is improving steadily, and in recent years near-
atomic resolution of some structures had been obtained, including those of viruses, ribosomes, mitochondrial
protein complexes, ion channels, and enzyme complexes. CSHL’s course on Cryo-Electron Microscopy was
initiated in 2018 and covers the theory, practice, and application of single particle cryo-EM. Participants in the
course will learn to perform all steps involved in solving high resolution cryo-EM structures, including sample
preparation, microscope alignment, data collection, image processing, and model building.
 Both courses will teach participants through extensive hands-on experiments along with lectures and
informal discussions on the theory behind the techniques and the latest developments in automating
experimental and computational procedures, from world leaders in methods development, taking advantage of
the outstanding learning environment of the Laboratory’s course program. Applications are open to a wide
range of students including scientists from universities and medical schools, as well as Ph.D. and M.D.
scientists from industry, aiming to allow students to learn techniques that can be immediately incorporated into
their own research, and also enabling translational approaches including rational drug design.
 Trainees accepted into the course program will include advanced graduate students, postdoctoral
trainees, senior scientists and principal investigators; across the program, trainees are diverse and balanced
with respect to gender, with 70% coming from US labs, of whom 15-20% are from under-represented
minorities."

Unhealthy diet is a key behavioral risk factor for several chronic diseases, particularly type-2 diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, and some cancers. Long-term measures of diet are typically self-reported and subject
to known sources of error and bias. A recognized population-level determinant of diet is access to and use of
food retailing, particularly consuming food away from home (FAFH) from quick-service or “fast food” outlets.
Currently, there are few methods to objectively measure long-term patterns of FAFH in health research or to
understand how built environments shape these behaviors. However, the pervasive use of smartphones provides
an emerging opportunity to address these questions. We will use Google Location History Timeline (GTL) data,
which includes high-resolution geographic location data collected passively on smartphones with Google Apps,
to develop new measures of long-term patterns of food retailer utilization, especially use of FAFH outlets. We
will use data from 500 adults from the Washington State Twin Registry who are contributing their GTL data for
another NIH-funded study on built environments and active travel (R21 ES031226-01A1). These data include
daily time-activity patterns from 2012 to present. We will evaluate these measures against objective measures
of contemporaneous food outlet utilization and detailed dietary intake measures in a subset of twins who have
previously completed additional surveys, including food frequency questionnaires and travel diaries. Finally, we
will measure how metrics of FAFH use relate to health outcomes, particularly weight status, weight change, and
self-rated overall health, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. New measures of food access behaviors
associated with diet and health outcomes can be used in epidemiological research and advance the field of built
environment influences on human health."

Women living with HIV, (WLWH), in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have a six-fold increased risk of
developing cervical cancer (CC) compared to their uninfected counterparts. Our studies in Ghana show that self-
sampling is acceptable, easy to use, and efficacious in detecting precancer lesions among WLWH. However,
this screening mechanism has not been translated to healthcare practice in Ghana.
Systematic adaptation and implementation toolkits are needed to translate self-sampling into healthcare
practices. We develop a Home-based self-collected sampling for the cervical cancer Prevention Education
(HOPE) toolkits to promote cervical cancer screening in Ghana. HOPE toolkit core components such as (a) self-
sample HPV testing kits and (b) the 3R (Reframe, Reprioritize, and Reform) communication model will not
change as they are evidence-based. The content and the intervention delivery modalities of HOPE will go through
the cultural adaptation iterative processes.
This R21 resubmission seeks to develop contextually appropriate adaptation and implementation toolkits in
Ghana. A three-step approach will be used for the adaption process and evaluation of the toolkit. First, we will
organize focus group discussions to identify contextual factors affecting the toolkit adaptation and nominal group
techniques to determine the different compositions of the toolkits and select the final toolkit. A sample of 35
stakeholder advisory board members representing three organizational levels: potential intervention participants
(i.e., WLWH), community leaders, and healthcare workers (e.g., doctors, nurses, administrators) will participate
in the FGDs and NGTs. Second, we will recruit 45 participants including WLWH and healthcare workers to
evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and adoptability of the selected toolkit. Third, we will test
the preliminary efficacy of HOPE on cervical cancer screening defined as cervical cancer screening uptake
among WLWH in the intervention arm (n=54) and control arm (n = 54). Participants will be recruited from the
Cape Coast Teaching Hospital (CCTH). Specific aims of HOPE are:
Aim I: Develop and adapt the HOPE toolkit: Hypothesis: Stakeholders will identify and prioritize community
needs and translate findings into a culturally adapted toolkit. Aim II: Evaluate the characteristics of the HOPE
toolkit: Hypothesis: We hypothesize that 80% of participants will find HOPE toolkits feasible, acceptable,
appropriate, and adoptable. Aim III: Assess the efficacy of HOPE on CCS. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that
CCS behavior will increase significantly among women in the intervention group compared to those in the control
group. Aim IV: Identify actionable factors and implementation costs that influence the adoption of the toolkit.
Hypothesis: The Actionable factors and implementation costs will significantly influence the toolkit adoption."

 2 Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanoscale balloon-like particles found in the body that play crucial roles in cell communication
 3 and can be used as diagnostic markers for complex diseases. However, the lack of reliable methods to purify, analyze, and
 4 manipulate EVs has hindered their widespread use in research and clinical settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose
 5 the development of a groundbreaking system called STEADI (System for Translational Exosome Analysis and Diagnostics
 6 through Integrating electroporation and single-molecule detection) to enable comprehensive analysis of EVs.
 7 STEADI integrates a microfluidic electroporator with a high-throughput size-based particle sorting method and a highly sensitive
 8 optical molecular detection technique. By utilizing microbeads of different sizes associated with specific EV surface proteins,
 9 STEADI allows precise sorting of EVs based on their surface profiles after efficient loading of molecules into the EVs using
10 electroporation. The loaded and sorted EVs are then released from the carrier microbeads and subjected to detailed analysis
11 using a highly sensitive single-molecule detection technique, enabling accurate quantification and characterization of the diverse
12 contents inside the EVs. The primary objective of STEADI is to provide a user-friendly platform for comprehensive exosome
13 analysis and effective preparation of EVs for research and clinical applications. By combining microfluidic electroporation with
14 a multi-laser cylindrical illumination confocal spectroscopy (CICS) system, STEADI allows for the rapid production of precisely
15 loaded EVs and quantitative profiling of their internal contents.
16 STEADI offers several advantages over existing methods. Firstly, it eliminates laborious pre- and post-purification steps of EVs
17 for molecular loading, molecular detection, and downstream assays, thereby streamlining the process. Secondly, the system
18 enables clean and efficient loading of molecules into EVs, preserving their molecular concentrations and membrane integrity
19 and facilitating the detection of lowly expressed molecules that would otherwise be undetectable. Thirdly, the integration of
20 CICS with microfluidic devices provides enhanced single-molecule detection capabilities, allowing for detailed characterization
21 of exosomal contents with single-EV and single-molecular resolution.
22 The STEADI system has broad applications in biological and clinical research. It facilitates the study of exosome biology and
23 their roles in various physiological and pathological processes. Additionally, it opens doors to exploring EVs' diagnostic and
24 therapeutic potential. Accurately quantifying the molecular properties of rare biomolecules within EVs is crucial for advancing
25 our understanding of disease mechanisms and developing targeted therapies.
26 In conclusion, the STEADI system stands as a remarkable leap forward in EV research, elevating its potential for seamless
27 translation into clinical applications. By providing a comprehensive and user-friendly platform that combines microfluidic
28 electroporation with CICS, it offers new avenues for studying the biology of EVs and their applications in research and medicine.
29 This innovative system has the potential to enhance our understanding of exosome functions and contribute to the development
30 of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies across various fields."

Brain malformations comprise a group of genetic developmental brain disorders that present in
childhood with epilepsy, intellectual, and other neurologic features, causing substantial morbidity,
mortality, and health care costs. To date, mutations in hundreds of genes have been linked to
brain malformations. The long-term goal of this project is to create a resource of well-categorized
and expertly curated genes and variants responsible for causing brain malformations, to help
clinicians navigate diagnosis and inform management. To this end, we have assembled an expert
panel of clinician-investigators with broad, complementary expertise in brain malformations in the
domains of gene discovery, neurobiology, clinical phenotype, radiographic presentation, and
treatment. This panel will survey the literature to curate genes and variants associated with brain
malformations, assess the strength of the evidence for these associations using ClinGen criteria,
and organize them into biologically and clinically useful groups. They will work together with the
ClinGen infrastructure and partner with biocurators from the Broad Institute to curate brain
malformation genes through the Brain Malformations Gene Curation Expert Panel and variants in
these genes through the Brain Malformations Variant Curation Expert Panel.
A special focus of this group is the development of rigorous approaches to assess brain
malformations caused by somatic mutations, a molecularly and clinically distinct subgroup of
disorders (including those associated with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), hemimegalencephaly
(HME), and polymicrogyria (PMG) with megalencephaly, all recently associated with de novo
germline or post-zygotic variants that result in activation of the mTOR-PI3K-AKT pathway) for
which there are potentially important implications for treatment. Having created a blueprint for
mosaic variant curation with recently published curation rules, this project will foster best practices
in the clinical application of genomics to the care of patients with brain malformations: selecting
appropriate diagnostic testing, interpreting variants, and ultimately choosing appropriate
management."
10865167,"Acute kidney injury is diagnosed in over 50% of patients with sepsis. Sepsis-associated AKI
(sAKI) contributes to high mortality, the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-

treatment of sepsis and associated kidney injury, we remain without diagnostic tools to stratify
human AKI etiology and stage, which we seek to address in this proposal. The overall goal of
our project is to test the hypothesis that murine blood transcriptomics can be used to diagnose
and stage human sAKI. We will first identify murine blood-based biomarkers(miRNA and
mRNA) reflective of sAKI tissue injury. We will then use the murine biomarkers to stratify human
AKI according to sAKI diagnosis and molecular stage. The immediate outcome of this work will
be the development of a liquid biopsy to diagnose and stage human sAKI. Indiana University
houses the Biobank Cohort of Indiana and is an established tissue interrogation site for the
Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP), thus, my interdisciplinary mentoring team and I are
well-positioned to undertake this highly translatable work. The current proposal will develop a
number of skills required to be a successful, independent translational researcher.
While my long-term goal is treatment of sAKI, the implementation of this necessitates solid basic
science and computational skill sets. This will allow for future work focused on the treatment of
sAKI. If these studies show efficacy in the diagnosis and staging of human AKI, these strategies
may be rapidly translated into the clinical setting."
10865569,"Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in childhood and is
associated with increased morbidity and mortality in neonates and young infants. Additionally, young children
diagnosed with HMPV bronchiolitis are at increased risk of developing asthma, which is the most common
chronic condition of childhood. Asthma in childhood is largely mediated by a subset of CD4+ T cells, known as
Th2 cells, which contribute to mucus production, eosinophil recruitment, and airway hyperresponsiveness.
However, the mechanistic connection between early life viral infection and the subsequent development of Th2-
driven asthma is unknown, thus limiting therapeutic and preventative strategy development. One contributing
factor to the acute and long-term pathology of respiratory viral infection could be underlying differences in the
developing neonatal immune system. The neonatal immune system is regulated differently than adults, as
neonates generally mount anti-inflammatory and tolerogenic responses. Prior literature has also demonstrated
that neonatal CD4+ T cell differentiation tends to favor development of Th2 cells when compared to adults. We
developed a new neonatal HMPV mouse model to evaluate neonatal CD4+ T cell responses. Neonatal mice
infected with HMPV intranasally on day of life 4-6 mounted an increased Th2 response compared to adults, while
adult mice exhibited a robust antiviral Th1 CD4+ response. Moreover, Th2 cells generated following neonatal
infection persisted as tissue resident memory (TRM) cells. In a late re-challenge model, mice initially exposed to
HMPV as neonates mounted a strong Th2 response to re-infection in adulthood characterized by eosinophil
recruitment, mucus production, and airway hyperresponsiveness consistent with asthma. Using an adoptive
transfer model with neonatal recipients, our preliminary studies suggest that Th1 differentiation is extrinsically
suppressed by a lymphocyte population in the neonate, which we hypothesize to be regulatory T cells (Tregs).
Additionally, preliminary single cell RNA sequencing experiments suggest that neonatal CD4+ T cells use different
metabolic pathways compared to adults; cell metabolism has been connected to T cell differentiation. Collectively,
our preliminary data demonstrate that neonates mount a Th2-dominant response, exhibit increased Treg activity,
and demonstrate altered T cell metabolism compared to adults. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that
extrinsic suppression of Th1 differentiation by Tregs and intrinsic metabolic preferences promoting Th2 formation
lead to preferential differentiation of neonatal CD4+ T cells into Th2s that persist and contribute to asthma
pathogenesis. We propose three Specific Aims: 1) To evaluate tissue resident memory (TRM) CD4+ T cell
contributions to asthma pathology following neonatal HMPV infection; 2) To determine the role of regulatory T
cells in Th1 suppression in the neonatal lung following primary HMPV infection; and 3) To define the role of
altered neonatal CD4+ T cell metabolism on differentiation/skewing. This proposal will mechanistically evaluate
the altered neonatal CD4+ T cell responses to HMPV and their role in asthma development."
10865570,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 The proposed research will assess the impact adolescent friendship networks have on the psychosocial
health of immigrant youth (i.e., the 1st and 2nd generation). Immigrant youth are a vulnerable population, with
disproportionately high prevalence of adverse psychosocial health outcomes, including higher rates of mental
health disorders, and lower sense of belonging, self-esteem, and wellbeing. Adolescence is a critical
developmental stage, marked by the ascension in the complexity and importance of peer friendships. Although
immigrant youth’s friendship networks look different from non-immigrant youth’s networks in a variety of ways,
very little research have examined whether and how these friendship patterns and processes may explain the
immigrant-based disparities in psychosocial health. This proposed research will bring more contemporary data
to the forefront of research on immigrant youth’s school friendships, generate new and rare data on immigrant
youth’s non-school friendships, and use advanced social network analytical methods to provide a more
comprehensive examination of the impacts adolescent friendship networks have on the psychosocial health of
immigrant youth. During the K99 phase, Dr. Khuu will focus on friendships developed in school, a major peer
context shared by both immigrant and nonimmigrant youth. AIM 1 is to identify and understand differences in
friendship patterns and processes between immigrant and nonimmigrant youth. AIM 2 is to compare measures
of psychosocial health between these two groups and test whether differential friendship patterns and
processes explain differences in psychosocial health. During the R00 phase, Dr. Khuu will leverage her training
in survey design and network sampling methods as well as in adolescent development and psychosocial
health to lead a new data collection effort on immigrant youth’s friendship networks extending beyond school.
AIM 3 is to understand how the social contexts of friendships shape friendship patterns and composition. AIM 4
is to test the relationship between immigrant youth’s psychosocial health and these friendship measures. As a
sub aim, Dr. Khuu will also take the opportunity to examine heterogeneity among immigrant youth, focusing
particularly on the distinctions between refugee and non-refugee youth. Dr. Khuu’s career goal is to become a
leading research authority on the friendships, health, and critical life outcomes of immigrant youth. The training
and findings of the proposed research will position her favorably to pursue an R01 grant, enabling her to
propose a more expansive, longitudinal study that explores the social integration and health of immigrant
youth, with a specific focus on refugee youth, who have resettled in a diversity of new immigrant destinations in
the United States."

region of Lyp/PEP and disrupts binding. In myeloid cells, N-terminal mutations rendering eenzymatically 
deadf Lyp/PEP compared to the health-relevant mutation in the C-terminal binding domain (rs24760010) 
can have different biological impact. We have previously shown that mice harboring this PEP Arg¨Trp Cterminal 
mutation have enhanced anti-viral immunity and can clear persistent virus infection. Now, we aim 
to therapeutically target PEP to achieve a comparable phenotype. This project utilizes the use of multiple 
CoBRE funded and non-CoBRE funded cores at the University of Kansas (KU). In brief, we will employ the 
protein production group to purify full length, N-terminal, and C- Terminal region of PEP. Then, the 
Infectious Disease Assay Development (IDAD) core will screen a compound library against these various 
PEP constructs. After identifying the compound of interest, this data will be submitted to the Computational 
Chemical Biology (CCB) core to computationally define these potential inhibitors. Further, the CCB core will 
work to rationally design a peptide based on the available structure of the P1 binding domain of PEP to 
binding partner Csk. Alongside these computational analyses, my lab will biologically validate the 
compounds evaluating anti-viral function in various immune cells, such as cytokine production, using 
spectral flow cytometry in the new Immunology Core. We will also molecularly assess the binding capacity 
of PEP to common protein partners. Future studies will submit the top compound(s) to the Synthetic 
Chemical Biology (SCB) core to be chemically stabilized and modified for in vivo experiments addressing 
anti-viral immunity. Discovery of such compounds results in a novel tool to further understand the role of 
Lyp/PEP during disease and potentially lead to a new therapeutic to better treat individualfs suffering from 
chronic infectious diseases."
10870122,"The role of the Leadership Administrative Core (LAC) is to integrate and unify the multiple, interdisciplinary
components of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital/Harvard Medical School (Brigham/Harvard) Center
for Stress and Neural Regulation of Reproductive Aging Health Outcomes. The Brigham/Harvard SCORE
LAC will provide scientific, administrative, and fiscal oversight of our SCORE Projects, Career Enhancement
Core, and Sleep Resource Core, and will catalyze progress and innovation in women’s health and sex-
differences research across the Brigham/Harvard SCORE environment. The LAC will be co-led by Hadine
Joffe, MD, MSc, and JoAnn Manson, MD, DrPH, who serve as Executive Director and Scientific Advisor,
respectively, for the Connors Center for Women’s Health and Gender Biology. The Connors Center is the
leading women’s health research center at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) and Harvard Medical
School (HMS), responsible for coordinating interdisciplinary and cross-departmental women’s health and sex-
differences investigation. Drs. Joffe and Manson, both internationally recognized leaders in women’s health,
are long-time collaborators whose complementary scientific expertise covers the reproductive aging health
outcomes highlighted in this proposal: vasomotor symptoms (VMS), sleep disturbance, cardiometabolic,
cognitive, and other characteristics of the menopause transition that may influence dementia susceptibility in
aging women. A strength of this proposal is that it builds on and expands the research focus, lead
investigators’ interdisciplinary collaborations, and career enhancement programs that are foundational to the
Connors Center. The LAC will draw upon the wealth of resources from existing collaborations and scientifically
aligned women’s health programs at BWH and HMS, specifically those focused on sex differences, sleep,
cardiometabolism, and brain health, including dementia, in women. By leveraging both the robust infrastructure
of the Connors Center and that of other BWH and HMS research programs and initiatives, we expect a rapid
and seamless initiation and implementation of our Center’s scientific and programmatic activities. Fortified by
the guidance of key External and Internal Advisory Boards, an Expert Scientific Panel and a Steering
Committee, the Brigham/Harvard SCORE LAC will provide dynamic scientific and administrative oversight,
internal coordination, and external engagement with the broader SCORE research consortium necessary for
productivity to flourish, leading to a fully-integrated, translational program of women’s health and sex-difference
research."
10870123,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overarching goal of the proposed Brigham/Harvard Center for Stress and Neural Regulation of Reproductive
Aging Health Outcomes is to investigate the role of stress and its neural mechanisms in reproductive aging
health outcomes that confer susceptibility to cardiovascular disease and dementia in aging women, and to
catalyze growth of interdisciplinary and translational women’s health and sex-differences research. Within this
framework, the proposed Career Enhancement Core (CEC) will be responsible for the integration of cross-Center
and Harvard-wide expertise to provide a rich research and learning environment for training the next generation
of investigators in women’s health and sex differences in stress, sleep, cognitive decline, cardiometabolic
disease and neural regulation research. The CEC is uniquely placed to leverage strong existing institutional
programs and infrastructure in addition to developing an interdisciplinary training and mentorship program. The
specific aims of the CEC are: 1) To fund cutting-edge SCORE Scholars and Pilot Projects to promising early-
career investigators or established investigators who are gaining new skills in stress, neural regulation, and
sleep, to foster sex/gender and women’s health research in reproductive aging health outcomes relevant to
cardiovascular disease and dementia in postmenopausal women; 2) To train CEC participants in a robust
educational program in sex-differences research methods, transparency, and rigor, as well as support Travel
Exchange Fellowships to foster learning and collaboration with the national SCORE research network; and 3)
To disseminate knowledge from these educational programs and research methods to the local and wider
national community through webinars, publications, and online educational forums. Achieving these aims will not
only advance the mission of our SCORE but will also promote the development of a new cadre of investigators
in the field. The CEC will work closely with all the Brigham/Harvard SCORE Projects, SRC, and LAC to leverage
robust existing research infrastructure in women’s health, sleep medicine, neuroscience, stress science, and
cardiometabolic disease to meet career enhancement needs for participants. Additionally, the CEC will build a
robust educational resource for the Brigham/Harvard community and the larger SCORE community."
10870126,"Timing, content, and duration of sleep are important for multiple physiological functions, including response to
stress; body composition; neurological, cardiovascular, reproductive, and metabolic function; cognition; and
mental health. Poor sleep can be both a cause and an outcome of disease: for example, poor sleep adversely
affects health, particularly cardiometabolic health and cognitive processing, and many diseases/syndromes
disrupt sleep. These potentially bidirectional associations are particularly salient in women, in whom insomnia
prevalence rises with age, and in whom vasomotor “hot flashes” can disturb the sleep of peri- and
postmenopausal women, thereby exacerbating stress and adverse health and cognitive outcomes, including
susceptibility to dementia. A full understanding of women’s health therefore requires consideration of sleep as
potential modifying and mediating factors, especially since there are wide inter-individual variations in self-
selected sleep timing and duration. One innovation of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital/Harvard Medical
School Center for Stress and Neural Regulation of Reproductive Aging Health Outcomes program is to
include objective sleep metrics from complementary modalities in all experimental projects, including relevant
projects funded through the Career Enhancement Core (CEC), thereby promoting interdisciplinary, collaborative,
synergistic, and translational work. Building on our experience as national resources for many other NIH-
supported research grants, the Sleep Resource Core (SRC) will collaborate with and be integrated into all
Projects and the CEC by providing sleep-related expertise, equipment, and analyses. For human experimental
studies, we will use wrist actigraphy and an online diary with questionnaires administered once or twice a day.
The SRC will purchase, calibrate, and maintain actigraphy devices, as well as download, store, and process
actigraphy data. We will manually clean and score actigraphy data and apply validated algorithms to extract
quantitative measures. The online diary includes algorithms that perform real-time error checking, thereby
increasing accuracy and decreasing data inconsistencies and data cleaning efforts. For mouse projects, the SRC
will perform the surgeries and conduct and score polysomnographic sleep recordings. These objective and
subjective sleep data will be used by each project to address their specific aims.
The SRC will also (i) train and support staff in human and animal projects (including CEC Scholars and Pilot
projects), ensuring high quality data collection; (ii) work actively with the CEC to provide data and expertise for
CEC projects and train early investigators in sleep science; (iii) assist with the interpretation and integration of
both subjective and objective sleep metrics with other exposures and covariates for all projects; and (iv)
participate in manuscript preparation and results dissemination. Sleep data and analysis tools will be made
available on the National Sleep Research Resource website. The SRC will be an integral and synergistic SCORE
component by providing resources, equipment, expertise, and sleep data to all Projects and Cores."
10870130,"The broad goal of Project 1 of the Brigham/Harvard SCORE Center for Stress and Neural Regulation of
Reproductive Aging Health Outcomes is to advance the health of postmenopausal women by determining stress
responsivity in vasomotor symptoms (VMS) occurrence and persistence and to characterize neural processes
and neurobiological mechanisms linking VMS with stress responsivity. VMS are the most common symptoms
during and after menopause, occurring in up to 85% of women, lasting 7.4–9.0 years on average, and persisting
for 10+ years in 33–40% of postmenopausal women. Investigations of stress mechanisms underlying VMS have
important public health significance due to their high prevalence, impact on quality of life, and adverse health
correlates. VMS disrupt sleep and are associated with cardiometabolic disease, which, together with risks of
hormone therapy used to treat VMS, increase susceptibility to dementia in aging women. We propose a novel
conceptualization of VMS as a chronic stress condition based on our preliminary data and that of others indicating
associations of stress responsivity with VMS. Differences in responsivity to evoked stress tasks in women with
VMS suggest underlying disruptions in stress-related neural networks (e.g., anterior cingulate cortex,
hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, insula) and in the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid
(GABA), which regulates stress networks, as is seen in chronic stress conditions (e.g., anxiety, pain).
Dysregulated stress responses may reflect neural processes through which stress mediates VMS. Project 1 will
innovatively combine the robust methodology of an evoked stress paradigm with state-of-the-art functional
magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy to cross-sectionally investigate acute stress
responsivity, neural network function, and GABA concentrations in women with and without VMS referred by
Project 2 (Project Viva cohort). We will determine longitudinally whether dysregulation of neural stress networks
and GABA predict persistence of VMS over a 2-year follow-up period. In conjunction with the Sleep Resource
Core (SRC), we will examine whether sleep disruption comorbid with VMS further blunts acute stress
responsivity. Similarly, we will test whether perceived stress contributes differentially to stress response
dysregulation in those with VMS. Project 1 is integrated within the Brigham/Harvard SCORE, through enrolling
participants and obtaining relevant longitudinal data from the Project 2 cohort, examining mechanistic neural
stress processes underlying VMS in parallel with Project 3, utilizing sleep metrics obtained by the SRC, and
teaching and mentoring junior faculty and trainees through the Career Enhancement Core. Leveraging these
synergistic SCORE and extensive Brigham/Harvard institutional resources, our study will make major
contributions to the health of aging women by identifying neural stress mechanisms linked to VMS—potentially
pointing to novel treatments for VMS that may also improve sleep and cardiometabolic health, with downstream
implications for dementia susceptibility in aging women."
10890937,"There is a lack of effective treatment for dementia, the way forward is the rigorous investigation of modifiable
preventive factors such as diet that impact brain aging and disease. Diet plays a pivotal role in the regulation of
systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, two causal pathways leading to dementia. The Mediterranean-DASH
Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet can be modified to eating patterns across the world
and is designed to investigate as a brain healthy diet rich in anti-inflammatory/anti-oxidative dietary factors in
relation to neurodegenerative disease outcomes. However, these findings do not give us information at the
individual level. Therefore, we will use the personalized nutrition framework to test the effect of omics signatures
of the MIND diet on the brain. This is the first study to investigate omics signatures of the MIND diet in relation
positron-emission tomography (PET)-imaging biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease dementia (AD) and incident all-
cause dementia and AD. We aim to conduct (1a) metabolic profiling (using metabolomics) to identify (individual
and composite score) metabolic signatures of the MIND diet among participants in the Offspring (GEN2, n~2300)
and Generation 3 (GEN3, n~1220) cohorts of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS); (1b) biological pathway over
representation analysis of the omics signatures of the MIND diet; (1c) and we will investigate genetic
determinants associated with the newly identified omics biomarkers associated with the MIND diet. Secondly,
we will investigate (2a) the MIND diet in relation to amyloid (i.e. precuneus and fronto-lateral-retrosplenial), and
tau PET-imaging (i.e. entorhinal, inferotemporal and rhinal cortex, global weighted averaged and global cortical
composites weighted averaged) among participants in FHS GEN2 and GEN3 (n=350); (2b) We will investigate
the newly identified omics signatures of the MIND diet individually and as a score in relation to incident all-cause
dementia and AD (n~800), and PET-imaging markers of AD (n~200); (2c) We will investigate the associations
among subgroups (sex differences, Apolipoprotein e4 carriers vs. non-carriers, and age). Sample for aim 1 will
include GEN2 (exams 5, 8 or 9) and GEN3 (exam 2) participants who have plasma metabolomic levels, filled
out the FFQ, and have covariate data. Sample for aim 2 will include GEN2 (exams 5 up to 9) and GEN3 (exams
1 up to 4) participants who have plasma metabolomic levels, filled out the FFQ, who underwent beta-amyloid
and Tau PET scans (GEN2 between exams 9 and 10; GEN3 between exams 3 and 4), who have dementia
surveillance and covariate data. We will relate the metabolomic signatures of the MIND diet to the MIND diet as
well as PET-imaging biomarkers of AD using multivariable linear regression and incident all-cause dementia and
AD using Cox proportional hazard models. When significant associations are found (Aim 2), we will perform
stratified analyses to investigate subgroups. We will adjust for age, sex, metabolomics/diet exam to PET scan
exam and PET scan camera (Aim 2), Apolipoprotein e4, BMI, smoking, physical activity index, total energy
intake, lipid lowering medication, diabetes and cardiovascular disease status, total to HDL cholesterol ratio."
10891222,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Chronic kidney disease (CKD), characterized by chronic inflammation and progressive fibrosis, is
prevalent and can eventually lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), necessitating renal replacement therapy
(hemodialysis or transplant). CKD is also a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Further, the costs
incurred by the Nation’s health system in caring for CKD patients are enormous.
 Current treatments to slow CKD are limited and non-specific. An ideal medicine would reverse tissue
scarring and restore kidney function, but even the more modest goal of slowing fibrotic progression is beyond
therapeutic reach currently. Thus, new experimental therapy strategies are needed.
 CKD involves endothelial dysfunction resulting in vascular rarefication and subsequent hypoxia.
Inhibition of either sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) synthesis at the level of sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2) or
transport (via Spns2) opposes these pathologies. By virtue of inhibiting S1P clearance from blood, SphK2
inhibitors drive an increase in blood and plasma S1P. The steepening of the plasma: tissue S1P gradient
maintains endothelial barrier function while the rise in erythrocyte S1P drives an increase in 2,3-
bisphosphoglycerate, which results in increased oxygen delivery. SphK2 inhibition is also anti-inflammatory,
although the mechanism remains uncertain. SphK2 deficiency, whether accomplished via genetic
manipulation of Sphk2 alleles or administration of SphK2 inhibitors, consistently results in substantially reduced
renal fibrosis in multiple animal models. Spns2, which transports S1P to the extracellular environment,
generates a local extracellular S1P gradient at the kidney pericyte, where SphK2 is the major source of S1P.
Like SphK2 inhibition, Spns2 inhibition suppresses inflammatory signaling in pericytes in vitro and ameliorates
renal fibrosis in mice.
 These results, although encouraging, are preliminary in that the inhibitors used are suboptimal. We will
rectify the deficiencies by making our SphK2 inhibitors orally available (Aim 1). Likewise, we will improve our
Spns2 inhibitors regarding potency, selectivity, and oral bioavailability (Aim 2). When drug-like compounds are
realized, we will validate their efficacy in multiple models of renal fibrosis (Aim 3). These studies will determine
whether there is synergism in blocking both SphK2 and Spns2 in vivo.
 In sum, our studies will serve to increase the fundamental understanding as to the effects of systemic
SphK2 and Spns2 inhibition in vivo and to validate inhibitors of S1P signaling as potential therapies for
retarding progression of CKD to ESRD. Further, if successful, we will have facilitated translation of SphK2
and/or Spns2 inhibitors into clinical trials for a CKD indication."
10891277,"Studying eye movements has been central to understanding active vision, attention, and cognition.
Computational models have helped advance the field by assessing the visual features and computations
guiding eye movements and have helped understand human visual and cognitive dysfunctions. However,
even with 20 years of computational models, we are still far from adequately modeling eye movements and
decisions in natural tasks with real-world images. Models often miss incorporating how our vision degrades
towards the visual periphery, do not incorporate a human’s intention (task), and critically do not have a learned
understanding of scenes and objects nor language to guide the fixations. Our goal is to combine
developments in powerful vision Transformer models with computational models of human vision to create a
Foveated Search Transformer Model (FST) that can understand simple linguistic instructions to execute eye
movements that gather information for the task with an understanding of other objects in the scene. Our work
will focus on visual search for objects in real-world scenes “never seen” by the model. We hypothesize that the
developed FST model will reach human accuracy levels and will capture some of the landmark eye movement
behaviors such as manipulations of context (location, size, and semantic relationship of the target object to the
surrounding scene). ). We also hypothesize that the model will predict human behavior and fixations better
than baseline models such as Saliency, Deep Gaze, and a version of the FST model with disabled contextual
understanding. To achieve our goal, we propose two specific aims. SA1. To develop a Foveated Transformer
Search (FST) model that learns eye movements that are task-optimizing, understands scene semantics, and
captures landmark contextual effects of human search; SA2. To develop a visual-language Foveated Search
Transformer (FST-L) model that can interpret language and search for specific targets with descriptive details
provided in a sentence. The developed FST models will be compared to human eye movements and search
decisions as well as baseline models. If successful, the newly developed model will open many new avenues
of research on eye movements with more naturalistic tasks and allow prediction of the functional impact of
visual disorders in eye movements and subsequent perceptual decisions. The model will also provide a tool to
expand current investigations of search-related neural activity using computational models."
10892050,"Project Summary
 Ischemic cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Underlying
pathophysiology of these diseases is associated with loss or dysfunction of blood vessels and/or impaired new
vessel formation (neovascularization). While cell therapy has emerged as a promising option to form blood
vessels, the effects of adult stem cells are uncertain and embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cells
(ESCs/iPSCs) are potentially tumorigenic. To avoid these problems, a new approach has been developed using
lineage- or cell-type specific transcription factors (TFs) for direct conversion or reprogramming of somatic cells
into other lineage cells. We have attempted this direct reprogramming toward endothelial cells (ECs) using
combinations of seven TFs and found for the first time that ETV2, alone, is sufficient to convert human fibroblasts
into ECs. However, since we used a lentiviral vector, these reprogrammed ECs (rECs) have limited clinical
applicability.
 The direct reprogramming approach allows two therapeutic strategies: cell-based therapy or direct in vivo
reprogramming. For clinical application, both approaches require a safer delivery vector to minimize the
possibility of genomic integration. Thus, we developed an adenoviral-ETV2 (Ad-ETV2) vector and generated
rECs (Adeno-rECs). Another important barrier for cell therapy is short-term survival of the transplanted cells. To
overcome this problem, we have been investigating bioengineered cell therapy.
 In this study, first, we will generate an optimal construct combining these Adeno-rECs with novel
biomaterials. We have developed a novel biodegradable hybrid copolymer consisting of gelatin and poly glycerol
sebacate (PGS), which was further made into a microbead form with alginate. We refer to this co-polymer as
AlGPM. This hybrid polymer is biodegradable and elicits minimal inflammatory response. Furthermore, its
microbead form promotes wide distribution of encapsulated cells after injection. The composition of AlGPM will
be optimized to promote cell survival and maximize function of rECs. We will then determine the
neovascularization and therapeutic effects of the selected AlGPM microbeads encapsulating rECs using
ischemic animal models. Second, we will determine whether local injection of viral particles of ETV2 into animal
models can directly reprogram somatic cells into endothelial cells and promote vascular regeneration and tissue
repair in vivo. Moreover, by using various transgenic mice, we will genetically track the fate of somatic cells
toward ECs in vivo. Together, the goal of this project is to develop clinically applicable vascular regenerative
therapy using direct reprogramming approaches and bioengineering technologies."

Patients' exposure to cancer misinformation has grown tremendously. Research has shown that up to 30% of
popular social media posts contain inaccurate information. Medical professionals warn that 77% of such posts
could potentially lead patients toward harmful and ineffective therapies. The type of misinformation that
exaggerated complementary or alternative therapies (CAM) safety and effectiveness in addressing cancer is
particularly concerning. Research indicates that patients who use CAM tend to exhibit lower adherence rates,
potentially impacting their overall survival. The prevalence of interest in CAM is substantial, with up to 70% of
patients in the US incorporating CAM into their cancer care. Some patients may be misinformed when they
engage with CAM, as up to 30% of them expect CAM to play a substantial role in controlling cancer progression.
Despite the widespread dissemination of CAM misinformation and its prevalent use, 20-77% of patients with
cancer make CAM-related decisions without consulting their physicians. The lack of open conversations about
CAM undermines opportunities for open information exchange and building trust in patient-provider relationships,
which are essential for promoting adherence to standard therapies. To facilitate open conversations about CAM,
we propose a multilevel intervention. Unlike most previous studies that focused on providers or patients only, the
proposed intervention targets both parties of the conversation. Informed by the Theory of Planned Behavior, the
multilevel intervention provides patients with a question prompt list (CAM-QPL) and equips physicians with
effective conversation strategies through a workshop to facilitate positive and effective CAM conversations. The
research will be complemented by focused training for Dr. Fridman in qualitative research, stakeholder
engagement methodology, and evaluating multilevel interventions. Dr. Fridman's training goals will be supported
by formal training and her collaborations with an expert in qualitative research and multilevel interventions, Dr.
Elston Lafata, an expert in stakeholder engagement research, Dr. Smith, MD, the Director of the Urologic
Oncology at UNC Lineberger Cancer Center, and Assistant Professor Johnson, MD an expert in studying the
negative impact of cancer CAM misinformation. The training will enable Dr. Fridman to undertake the following
steps: (1) in Aim 1, she will engage providers and patients and use qualitative methods to develop the CAM-
QPL. (2) In Aim 2, she will estimate the initial efficacy of the CAM-QPL implemented as a multilevel intervention
with a physician-facing workshop developed by experts in health communication and misinformation. (3) In Aim
3, Dr. Fridman will conduct a qualitative exploration of patient and provider experiences with the multilevel
intervention and its revision. This proposal addresses the urgent need for a multilevel intervention to tackle
communication barriers about CAM. By engaging in open conversations with providers, patients will be
empowered to navigate the increasing volume of cancer-related information and misinformation and build
trusting relationships with providers that will support their adherence to evidence-based treatment options."
10864336,"Project Summary/Abstract
Given the high mortality of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) as a result of relapse after androgen
deprivation therapy (ADT), novel treatment strategies are urgently needed. Tumor suppressor gene-
phosphatase and tensin homolog (
PTEN) is mutated in approximately 20% of primary prostate cancers, and in
as many as 40~60% of CRPC. In addition to activation of PI3K oncogenic signaling pathway, loss of PTEN is
also associated with cytokine and chemokine signaling that creates an immunosuppressive microenvironment.
Both defects in antigen presentation in tumor cells and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME)
have been implicated in CRPC progression after ADT and therapeutic resistance in prostate cancer in the clinic.
Genetic or pharmacologic inactivation of β isoform of PI3K (p110β) in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer has been
reported to significantly inhibit tumor growth and progression. Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR)
exhibits essential functions in controlling DNA replication stress and DNA damage response in cancer cells.
PTEN-deficient cells have been reported to be more sensitive to ATR inhibition. PI3Kβ is also functionally
associated with DNA damage response and genomic integrity in tumor growth. By using a syngeneic genetically
engineered mouse model of CRPC driven by co-deletion of PTEN and TP53 (PP-CRPC), we found that addition
of p110β inhibitor significantly reduces the viability of ATR inhibitor-treated PP-CRPC cells. Moreover, our
preliminary data show that inhibition of p110β or ATR alone significantly increases MHC class I antigen
presentation in mouse or human CRPC cells. Based on these novel preliminary data, we hypothesize that p110β
inhibitor in combination with ATR inhibitor will show promising anti-tumor activity in PTEN-deficient CRPC via
inducing cell death in cancer cells and anti-tumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment. We also hypothesize
that inhibition of p110β will increase DNA replication stress and sensitize PTEN-deficient CRPC cells to ATR
inhibition. In this study, we will
1)
evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and antitumor immune responses of combined
ATR inhibition and p110β
inhibition i
n syngeneic PTEN-deficient CRPC mouse models; 2) investigate the
molecular mechanisms of the combined effect of ATR inhibitor and p110β
inhibitor in replication stress and DNA
damage-induced cell death in PTEN-deficient CRPC cells.
Our study will not only provide fundamental
information for translational research of p110β inhibitors and ATR inhibitors in cancer treatment, but also provide
a novel treatment strategy for patients with PTEN-deficient advanced CRPC."
10864493,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Roughly 90,000 adolescents and young adults (AYAs: 15–39) are diagnosed with cancer in the United States
each year. Disparities in cancer mortality exist among AYAs with Ewing sarcoma (EWS) and osteosarcoma
(OS), which may be partially due to unequal access to evidenced-based, standardized care (guideline
concordant care; GCC). Many AYAs with cancer do not receive GCC, especially those with who are older and
with limited resources.
My prior research demonstrated 50% of AYAs with OS in California received guideline concordant care and the
absence of such care negatively impacted survival. Increasing delivery of guideline concordant care in this
patient population could markedly improve survival, especially in traditionally underserved patients (e.g., those
with public insurance, other than White race/ethnicity). The barriers to the delivery of guideline concordant care
are not clearly identified in AYAs. To fill this critical gap and gain essential training, I will employ an
implementation mapping process to develop strategies that increase adoption of evidence-based practices,
identify barriers and facilitators to the delivery of guideline concordant care, and develop an implementation
blueprint to pilot an intervention to improve delivery of GCC in AYAs with EWS and OS.
The specific aims are: 1) Identify barriers and facilitators to delivery of GCC for AYA patients with EWS and
OS, 2) Systematically develop a tailored implementation blueprint for delivery of GCC care for AYA patients
with EWS and OS, and 3) Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a cancer care delivery implementation
blueprint to improve delivery of GCC in a pilot trial.
The long-term goal of my research program is to improve cancer health equity for AYA patients with cancer.
The proposed research and training plan supports my need to: (1) Expand skills in qualitative methods (i.e.,
thematic analysis); (2) Develop skills in implementation science methods; (3) Gain experience conducting a
cancer care delivery pilot trial; and (4) Obtain preliminary data for an R01 proposal for a refined and expanded
R01 cancer care delivery trial. This proposal is supported by an outstanding mentorship team and scientific/
content advisory committee, with substantial expertise in cancer care delivery research, qualitative research,
implementation science, AYA oncology, and treatment of sarcomas. Formal training will be sought in
qualitative methods and implementation science methods, while concurrently building essential skills in
leadership. Collectively, this research proposal and career development plan will firmly secure my position as
an independent physician-scientist and national leader as an AYA cancer care delivery researcher."
10865478,"Abstract
The United States ranks among the worst of all developed countries in perinatal health, including high rates of
maternal and infant mortality and pervasive disparities among women who are racial/ethnic minorities, have
lower SES, and reside in rural regions. Perinatal outcomes are influenced by an interplay of clinical, individual,
and social factors, but the role of social and structural determinants has been increasingly investigated as a
driver of maternal and child health (MCH) disparities. Social determinants of health (SDOH), the social,
economic, and physical conditions outside the medical system that shape health, have been widely explored
particularly through a multitude of place-based SDOH measures. However, these measures fail to
comprehensively capture the structural drivers of MCH- the policies, macroeconomic forces, institutions and
systems, and culture that generate socioeconomic inequalities across places and populations. In addition,
despite evidence that structural drivers vary widely across regions in the US and that the health of
marginalized groups is more sensitive to place-based factors, the geospatial patterning of structural drivers and
their association with MCH disparities is also poorly understood. Understanding the spatial patterning of
structural drivers and their association to MCH disparities would inform the development of tailored, place-
based, policies and multilevel interventions. The candidate, Dr. Martinez-Cardoso, is applying for this K01
award in order to develop advanced methodological training to address these research gaps. Dr. Martinez-
Cardoso is a well-trained public health researcher with complementary expertise in quantitative data analysis
and health disparities. The training component of the award includes formal/informal training in big data
science, geospatial analytics, and causal inference, paired with a high-caliber mentor and advisory committee.
This training will be applied to research characterizing county-level typologies of structural drivers using data
science and machine-learning approaches (Aim1). Aim 2 will investigate the association between structural
drivers and racial/ethnic health disparities among women of reproductive age using causal inference methods
and multilevel modeling. Aim 3 will explore associations between structural drivers and racial/ethnic perinatal
health disparities using spatial multilevel models. Ultimately, this research seeks to contribute to a
comprehensive understanding of the structural drivers shaping MCH outcomes to effectively reduce disparities
and promote equitable MCH across diverse geographic regions and racial/ethnic groups in the United States.
The award will also catalyze the candidate’s long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator focused
on improving MCH using novel data science tools and innovative multilevel interventions and policies."
10866170,"PROPOSAL SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 My long-term career goal is to broaden our understandings of molecular and cellular mechanisms
governing hematopoietic cell fate decisions both in normal and pathogenic conditions as an independent
investigator. A central question of my research is how broadly expressed transcription factors regulate a distinct
set of genes in different developmental programs, as transcription factors’ ability to provide precisely required
functional inputs in each cellular context is essential for life-long production of healthy blood cells. To address
this, I propose to determine molecular mechanisms driving dynamic functions of Runx transcription factors in
early thymic T cell development and megakaryocyte differentiation, two vastly different programs relying on Runx
activities. Also, I aim to exploit a novel cell culture technique recapitulating the connection between bone marrow
progenitor stages and early thymic progenitor stages. This will establish a new opportunity to define the roles of
transcription factors in this developmental window, which was previously challenging due to lack of in vitro system.
 My preliminary studies suggest that Runx factors possess notable ability to switch their DNA binding sites
in a context-specific fashion both within the same developmental trajectory at different stages as well as across
different cell types. These dynamic Runx binding sites are closely associated with the genes that are sensitive
to Runx functions. Importantly, redistribution of Runx factors occurs across large genomic domains and multiple
peaks appear and disappear coordinately. Also, cell type-specific Runx binding sites harbor distinct sets of other
transcription factor motifs, suggesting that a unique ensemble of collaborators may be present in each cellular
context. Thus, I hypothesize that 3D chromatin reconfiguration responds to or causes context-specific Runx
binding site choices, and these dynamic Runx functions are driven by distinct co-factors in each program.
To address this, I will determine whether developmental changes of 3D chromatin structure require or
instruct Runx functions during early T cell development (AIM 1, mentored phase). Also, I will define which
functional collaborators physically interact with Runx factors in early T cell development and megakaryocyte
development and test which co-factors are necessary to guide cell type-specific Runx DNA binding (AIM 2A).
Additionally, I will define the impact of cell type-specific partners on Runx functions independently of chromatin
state by experimentally introducing mismatched-co-factors to non-native developmental context (AIM 2B). Finally,
I will establish a novel in vitro system recapitulating the developmental transition from bone marrow progenitor
phases to early thymic progenitor stages. I will exploit this system to test whether the principles underlying
dynamic Runx functions apply to the activities of another multilineage-expressed transcription factor, c-Myb.
Together, the studies in this proposal will show how globally expressed transcription factors execute context-
specific functions in different developmental pathways in normal hematopoiesis, and how malfunction of these
principles can cause hematologic pathologies, such as leukemia.

10866226,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although identified over 50 years ago, there are a limited number of interventions for fetal alcohol spectrum
disorders (FASD), the leading known preventable neurodevelopment disorders in the U.S. Neuropathology
associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) alters behavioral, cognitive, and emotional functions that
persistent in childhood and can persist throughout life. Basic science animal models have been instrumental in
understanding the mechanisms of alcohol's teratogenic effects as well as essential to investigating potential
interventions. However, despite robust preclinical evidence, there are a limited number of interventions identified
in basic science models being translated to clinical use. One such intervention is physical activity, which mitigates
ethanol-induced behavioral, cognitive, and molecular alterations in animal models of PAE. Moreover, physical
activity has been associated with improved cognitive function and neurobehavioral measures in children with
other, less prominent neurodevelopmental disorders. Despite the large body of research that supports physical
activity as a potential therapeutic for FASD, limited clinical studies have been conducted in this population.
Therefore, the primary aim of this K01 proposal is to provide translational research training and experience to
bridge the gap between basic and clinical science and accelerate intervention research for FASD. Specifically,
the candidate will begin to characterize physical activity in children and adolescents with a history of PAE and
will determine the relationship between physical activity, neurocognition, and mental health. Data from two
independent NIH-funded research programs will be leveraged to meet these aims, including the Adolescent
Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study and the Chambers' Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol
Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) U01 project. These distinct cohorts provide a rare opportunity for acceleration of
learning opportunities as well as the opportunity to identify factors that modulate the relationship between
physical activity and outcome. In addition to the clinical research aims, this project will assess the ability of
exercise to mitigate behavioral and cognitive alterations and immune and neurotrophic activity in a rodent model
of PAE, which will better our understanding of physical activity as an intervention for FASD. Thus, this project
will improve our understanding of physical activity in individuals with FASD and begin to explore physical activity
as a potential intervention to lessen the cognitive and emotional challenges experienced by children and
adolescents with FASD, as in line with NIAAA strategic plan. With guidance from a strong mentorship team, this
highly proposal is highly innovative by bridging basic and clinical science, and addressing issues that range from
identification of the relationship of exercise and clinical outcome to mechanistic studies evaluating the
effectiveness of exercise as an intervention. At the conclusion of this award, the candidate will meet her goal of
career independence as a bidirectional translational investigator with expertise investigating potential
interventions for symptoms of FASD with both preclinical and clinical research."
10866279,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Millions of children throughout the world suffer from neurological diseases, including epilepsy, depression, and
infections. Pharmacotherapy is a mainstay of treatment efforts, but optimal dosing is virtually unknown
because of the difficulty in measuring drug concentrations in the brain. The extent of brain exposure depends
on drug properties and the permeability of the blood brain barrier (BBB). BBB permeability is affected by age
and disease and may change over time. In order to adequately characterize exposure, multiple concentration
measurements are needed over time. However, serial lumbar punctures in children are rarely advised or
indicated. Consequently, the exposure in the brain of most drugs to treat neurological diseases in children is
unknown. This lack of data to guide therapy risks toxicity and treatment failure in children. We have developed
an approach that combines sophisticated pharmacokinetic modeling with opportunistic, non-invasive, serial
drug concentration measurements in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to determine optimal dosing. The work of
this proposal will provide a platform to optimize dosing of drugs that treat neurological diseases across the
pediatric age spectrum. This platform combines: 1) In vitro models of the BBB; 2) Opportunistic plasma and
CSF pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in children with external ventricular drains (EVDs). EVDs therapeutically
remove CSF from the patient and permit non-invasive, serial CSF sampling to measure drug concentrations; 3)
Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling (PBPK) to predict plasma and CSF drug exposure in children.
PBPK models can be modified to reflect differences in age and disease state. The principal investigator (PI)
has a background in chemical and biomolecular engineering, in vitro systems, and modeling and simulation,
and is conducting an ongoing plasma and CSF PK study in children with EVDs. To elucidate mechanisms of
drug passage into the CSF and to optimize CNS drug dosing in children, the PI will pursue training through the
K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award mechanism at the University of Utah. To guide this training, an
experienced mentorship team will provide expertise in clinical trials, in vitro models, membrane transporters,
and sophisticated pharmacometric methods. In the mentored phase, in vitro BBB models will measure BBB
permeability of five drugs commonly used in children in the context of age and disease. These measurements
and information from the literature will inform pediatric CNS-PBPK models of these drugs in children. Then,
CNS-PBPK models will be optimized using serial plasma and CSF PK measurements from children with EVDs
across disease states and the pediatric age spectrum, and optimal dosing regimens will be determined. In the
independent phase, the PI will conduct a prospective PK and safety trial to validate optimal, patient-specific
dosing regimens for two drugs targeting the CNS in children. This work will create a platform to define and
design optimal CNS pharmacotherapy for children."
10866281,"Many blast-exposed Veterans have trouble in challenging listening situations (e.g., understanding speech in
background noise) despite normal or near-normal peripheral hearing as measured by the pure-tone audiogram,
which we refer to as “functional hearing difficulty” (FHD). Until recently, it was unclear whether FHDs can arise
from direct trauma to the central auditory system. Preliminary studies from the PI’s Career Development Award-
2 show that blast exposure: (i) damages auditory-cortical white matter tracts resulting in poorer scores on
speech-in-noise tests; and (ii) produces a shift in the cortical response to speech such that background
interference leads to more activation in brain regions associated with effortful listening. These findings strongly
suggest a central contribution to blast related FHDs. In the past decade, VA audiologists have increasingly used
low-gain hearing aids to treat FHDs, but this is problematic because conventional hearing aid fitting relies mostly
on the audiogram. Thus, conventional approaches require clinical intuition to adapt the treatment to the unique
needs of Veterans with FHDs. This problem also applies to sensorineural hearing loss, which has consequences
beyond the peripheral structures assessed by the audiogram. This study proposes a novel data-driven approach
to hearing aid fitting called speech-based audiometry (SBA). Briefly, SBA uses “Learning Machines” to structure
patient-audiologist interactions toward selection of an optimal hearing-aid gain profile based on the patient’s
subjective responses to aided speech. By efficiently searching a space of possible gain profiles for the optimum
solution, SBA combines assessment, gain prescription, and fit refinement in a single procedure, without
appealing to the audiogram. Sixty blast-exposed Veterans with FHDs will be recruited into an early-stage clinical
trial and fitted for low-gain hearing aids using either the conventional approach or SBA (N = 30 per group). They
will be followed for six weeks, with each group further divided into subgroups (N = 15) assigned to use their
hearing aids daily or only during laboratory assessments. In Specific Aim 1, aided listening benefit will be
assessed at the beginning and end of the study period using a traditional speech-in-noise instrument, the
modified Quick Speech-in-Noise test. To track the effects of acclimatization to aided listening, participants will
also complete a modified Digits in Noise (DIN) test once per week. Performance on the DIN will be measured
traditionally (threshold signal-to-noise ratio) and in terms of “intraindividual variability,” which is inferred from
response times at higher signal-to-noise ratios and reflects cognitive effort. In Specific Aim 2, participants will
complete a speech-in-noise fMRI task at the beginning and end of the study period. The task will be completed
with and without amplification using a simulated hearing aid to match each participant’s true gain prescription.
Aided listening benefit will be characterized as reductions in activation in brain regions associated with effortful
listening. For both aims, we hypothesize: (i) a significant aided listening benefit across all outcomes; (ii) a larger
aided listening benefit in participants fitted with SBA vs. conventionally, potentially best captured by
intraindividual variability and fMRI; and (iii) larger aided listening benefits in participants allowed to acclimatize
via daily use of their hearing aids. In a second study, 112 current Veteran hearing aid users will be assessed
using SBA. Specific Aim 3 will measure the difference between selected SBA gain profiles and participants’
actual prescribed gain profiles. A linear regression will be employed to determine if factors such as pure-tone
thresholds, age, hearing aid experience, and history of noise or blast exposure are associated with this
difference. We hypothesize that SBA will be more likely to converge with prescribed gain profiles in Veterans
with higher pure-tone thresholds, more hearing aid experience, and less noise and/or blast exposure. The long-
term goal of this research program is to develop SBA as an alternative hearing aid fitting approach to deliver
improvements in aided listening and concrete protocols to address the needs of Veterans with deficits not
adequately captured by the audiogram."
10880238,"This is a renewal application for five years of continuing support from an established T32 (AA07453) that was
first funded in 1982. This application seeks continued support for three postdoctoral fellows per year. The
Developmental Alcohol Research Training Program (DART) at the University of Pittsburgh has as its focus
training in the investigation of alcohol use and addiction from a developmental perspective from gestation to
through adulthood. This emphasis addresses the NIAAA strategic plan objective to prioritize research on
alcohol use disorders as developmental in nature. The DART Program is a small, strong, and consistently
productive T32 that has trained 44 postdoctoral fellows, 85% of whom are in academic or research positions.
The trainees have exceptional success obtaining research funding compared to the national average. Their
scholarly output addresses areas of central importance in alcohol research such as onset of alcohol use among
children and ontogeny of risk factors for alcohol use disorder, long-term effects of prenatal alcohol exposure,
health inequities with respect to heavy alcohol consumption and associated precursors, consequences, and
treatment, effectiveness of prevention/interventions for dually-diagnosed patients, psychopharmacological efficacy
in the treatment of alcohol dependence, and the relation between alcohol abuse and the natural history of AIDS.
The DART Program is unique in the NIAAA training portfolio in its focus on development and the large number
of resources available to trainees. The DART faculty are highly experienced, multidisciplinary, and
collaborative and offer direction and mentorship in areas of high priority to NIAAA such as the developmental
stages of alcohol use and abuse, timing and consequences of alcohol use, racial and gender differences, and
the effects of health disparities on the development of alcohol use and misuse. The faculty have expertise in
developmental, epidemiological, clinical, and neurobiological approaches and advanced quantitative methods.
A significant strength of the Program is access to an unusually large number of NIH-funded research projects
that include large, longitudinal cohorts and allow analyses across multiple developmental phases. Supporting
faculty who are not specifically alcohol researchers, but who have expertise in fields such as behavioral and
community health, psychology, pediatrics, and statistics, allow trainees to develop their research with novel
combinations of methods and expertise. Training involves active participation on research projects with
mentors and design of new studies, supplemented by courses in Addictive Behaviors, Developmental
Psychopathology, Epidemiology, and Advanced Quantitative Methods, and by the required Seminar on
Addictions Research (SOAR) and the Career and Research Development Seminar (CARD). The DART
program faculty are committed to training researchers to become independent investigators with the skills and
tools for collaborative, multidisciplinary research in developmental studies of alcohol use and abuse in order to
accomplish excellence and innovation in developmental alcoholism research."
10880272,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a heterogeneous group of phospholipid bilayer-enclosed particles with the
biomolecular contents mirroring those of their parental cells. Since EVs are present in circulation at a relatively
early stage of disease and persist across all disease stages, purification and characterization of tumor-derived
EVs are expected to offer an opportunity for early cancer diagnosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the
fourth most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, is in dire need of diagnostic and prognostic
biomarkers. Current clinical radiographic system and serum biomarkers (e.g., alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)) poorly
discriminate early-stage HCC (where potentially curative therapies are available) from at-risk liver cirrhosis
(where HCC surveillance is indicated). Moreover, sensitive biomarkers for HCC postoperative recurrence
(where timely salvage treatment interventions can suppress disease progression) after curative-intent liver
resection and liver transplantation remain a significant challenge for early-stage HCC. Therefore, exploiting the
diagnostic potential of HCC EVs and EV cargo profiling for HCC early detection and postoperative recurrence
holds great promise to significantly augment the ability of current diagnostic modalities.
Conventional methods for isolating EVs, such as ultracentrifugation, filtration, and precipitation, are incapable
of discriminating tumor-derived EVs from non-tumor-derived EVs. To address this unmet need, our team
developed “EV Click Chips” for HCC EV purification. The innovation of our devices includes i) the covalent
chemistry-mediated EV capture/release couples click chemistry-mediated EV capture and disulfide cleavage-
driven EV release, ii) an optimized multi-marker cocktail targeting HCC-associated surface markers was
adopted to overcome the heterogeneity of HCC EVs; iii) the incorporation of densely packed silicon nanowire
substrates (SiNWS) dramatically increases the device surface areas for contacting/interacting with EVs; and
iv) the microfluidic chaotic mixer facilitates repeated physical contact between SiNWS and the flow-through
EVs, further enhancing the performance of EV purification. The purified HCC EVs can be characterized by
quantifying a panel of 10 well-validated HCC-specific mRNA markers by incorporating Droplet Digital PCR
(ddPCR) technology. The proposed research will conduct: i) an exploratory development and optimization of
EV Click Chips for HCC EV purification, and ii) clinical validations of EV Click Chips for HCC early detection
and postoperative recurrence using patient blood samples. Our long-term goal is to develop a new HCC EV
purification system (i.e., EV Click Chips) by synergistically integrating four very powerful approaches, including
covalent chemistry-mediated EV capture/release, multimarker antibody cocktails, nanostructured substrates,
and microfluidic chaotic mixers. The purified HCC EVs will readily allow for quantitative cargo profiling to
augment current HCC diagnostic algorithms."
10867912,"PROJECT SUMMARY
High-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is a known cause of >95% of cervical cancer and cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Prophylactic vaccines are available against the most carcinogenic types and are
highly effective, but the number of people receiving the vaccine is low, and vaccines are ineffective in women
who have already developed CIN. Initial infection of HPV results in low-grade CIN (CIN1) and is mostly cleared
by the immune system. However, failure of the immune system to clear HPV can lead to chronic infection and
risk of high-grade CIN (CIN2 or CIN3) or invasive cervical cancer. There is emerging evidence that the vaginal
microbiome plays an important role in this process however the mechanisms linking vaginal bacteria with host
responses to HPV infection and cervical neoplasia progression are underexplored.
Antibody binding to microbes can alter the structure and function of the microbiome, however this has not been
comprehensively characterized in the female reproductive tract. Our overall hypothesis is that the proportion,
abundance and/or functional profiles of antibody bound and unbound vaginal bacteria will differ between women
with and without HPV infection, as well as those with normal cervical pathology, low-grade cervical lesions, and
high-grade cervical lesions. Our overall goal is to define the associations between the proportion and
abundance of antibody bound and unbound bacteria and their functions in these comparison groups. In this
proposal we will utilize vaginal samples already collected from a comprehensive observational cohort (THRIVE
HPV) that is specifically recruiting women with an abnormal pap smear test and following them longitudinally for
2-3 years to determine HPV status and regression or progression of cervical dysplasia. We will sort bacterial
cells from vaginal swab samples at baseline enrollment into antibody bound and unbound fractions, then perform
metagenomics to determine the abundance, species/genera, and functions of bacteria that are associated with
antibody bound or unbound bacteria in each comparison group. A unique feature of this proposal is having
access to longitudinal samples from a diverse (>50% African American) cohort for this and future studies to
determine antibody bound and unbound bacterial stability over time, with comprehensive medical and
pathological information.
To the best of our knowledge, our work will be the first to define antibody bound and unbound vaginal
bacterial populations at the species/strain level in women with or without HPV infection or different
cervical pathologies. We anticipate this study will reveal antibody bound bacterial populations that are
associated with a healthy or diseased microenvironment that can be identified as high-risk profiles needing to
be monitored for treatment or targeted for novel immunological therapeutics."
10867171,"Abstract:
For the more than 40,000 children undergoing treatment for cancer each year, there is an urgent need to establish scalable complementary health interventions to treat symptoms not controlled by conventional supportive care. Complementary health interventions have been associated with decreased distress, anxiety, pain, and improved quality of life (QOL) in children with cancer. Creative arts therapy and art-making are mind-body interventions that have been related to improved QOL in adults and children with cancer, but foundational evidence lacks rigor and reproducibility. To address this gap, we will use art focus groups with children with cancer to develop a standardized creative arts intervention based on what we learned from our pilot studies. We will then establish feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial in 60 children ages 8-13 years in the first year of cancer treatment. This study will occur in two phases. Phase 1 will define and refine the intervention using art groups with participants who represent the future study population. Phase 2 will assess feasibility and acceptability of a 12-week two-arm trial. The intervention arms will consist of four 30-minute sessions of either creative arts or video watching during scheduled cancer treatment every 2-3 weeks over 12-weeks. Patient-reported QOL and symptom outcomes showed significant change in our preliminary work, but we will advance the measures for scalability with the standardized questionnaires: Pediatric PROMIS, Pediatric Patient Reported Outcomes Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE), and Faces scale. Timepoints for data capture will occur at baseline, pre-/post- each session, and after the total 12-week intervention. Our multidisciplinary study team contributes congruent areas of expertise in clinical research among children with cancer, creative arts intervention development, pediatric symptom assessment, behavioral clinical trial implementation, and feasibility data analysis. This research has the potential to promote the integration of creative arts into conventional cancer care for children and transform the future of symptom management. The outcomes will strengthen the design and overcome methodological challenges in the clinical study of an innovative mind-body intervention for addressing QOL and symptom burden to improve the whole person health of children with cancer."
10870150,"Spread of neuroinvasive herpesviruses from sensory neurons to the eye, brain or from mother to newborn, are significant causes of morbidity and mortality. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and pseudorabies virus (PRV) are representative members of the two genuses of mammalian neuroinvasive herpesviruses (Simplexviruses & Varicelloviruses). These viruses are dependent upon spread to the nervous system to establish life-long latent infections, yet very little is known regarding the neuroinvasive mechanism that underlies this remarkable trait. We propose to study the virus neuroinvasive machinery with the intent to: (i) decipher how these viruses invade the nervous system, (ii) understand the intrinsic barriers to neural infection that these viruses evade, and (iii) produce and characterize viruses lacking the neuroinvasive property as potential vaccines. These studies are designed to decode the virus tactics used to establish neural infections and our corresponding nervous system’s defenses that keep most pathogens at bay."
10867113,"The impact of the Uniform Accident and Sickness Policy Provision Law on alcohol consumption
and alcohol consumption related outcomes
Project Summary
The Uniform Accident and Sickness Policy Provision Law (UPPL) in many U.S. states’ insurance
codes are intended to discourage problem drinking by permitting insurance companies to deny
claims for injuries resulting from alcohol impairment or the use of non-prescribed narcotics.
Although the primary intention behind UPPLs was to discourage excessive drinking and
substance use, evidence suggests that these laws have unintended consequences, as they
crease a disincentive for physicians to test the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels of
injured patients due to concerns about potential insurance reimbursement denials. Recognizing
this, a major stakeholder, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), changed
its stance in 2001 to support health insurance coverage regardless of intoxication status.
However, despite this shift, many states still retain their UPPLs. The existing literature on the
impact the UPPL on alcohol consumption and alcohol consumption related outcomes is mostly
descriptive and studies that provide a credible estimation methodology focus on the effects of
UPPLs on a very limited number of outcomes. Furthermore, existing studies focus on the effects
of the repeal of UPPLs. However, repeal of the UPPL does not guarantee that insurance
companies cannot deny claims resulting from alcohol impairment unless the repeal of the UPPL
was simultaneously occurred with the introduction of another law that explicitly prohibited the
denial of claims due to intoxication. Some states either did not have a UPPL law to begin with or
did not introduce any law that prohibits denial of insurance claims due to alcohol involvement
following the repeal of the UPPL. In these states, without the existence of any law that explicitly
prohibits denials, courts have ruled that insurance companies can still deny claims due to
alcohol involvement. Therefore, a more accurate assessment of the effectiveness of the UPPLs
should rely on separate comparison of the outcomes of the states where denial is explicitly
permitted with those where denial is prohibited and those where no UPPL related law exists.
The proposed project will be the first to provide a comprehensive analysis of the effects of the
UPPLs on alcohol consumption both at the intensive and extensive margin. In addition to its
effects on alcohol consumption, the proposed project will also be the first to provide evidence
on the spillover effects of these laws on alcohol related outcomes such as drunk driving
behavior, alcohol and drug related traffic fatalities, driving under influence (DUI) arrests,
number of emergency department (ED) visits, and out-of-pocket healthcare expenses for alcohol
and drug related ED visits. We will exploit the variation in UPPLs across different states and over
time to conduct event study and difference-in-differences (DID) analyses of the effect of the
policy on alcohol consumption and related outcomes. The results from this study will provide
policy makers with new, important information about the effectiveness of UPPLs and contribute
to the recent policy discussion on whether these laws should be repealed."
10868380,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The proposed study will develop and evaluate a transdiagnostic gender-affirmative CBT-based digital mental
health intervention for transgender and nonbinary (TNB) adolescents. TNB adolescents are at profound mental
health risk. Compared to cisgender (non-TNB) adolescents, TNB adolescents have a two- to three-fold increased
risk for depression, anxiety, and suicidality. Moreover, TNB adolescents experience unique stressors related to
their gender minority identities that contribute to the development of psychological distress, including depression
and anxiety. Yet very little research has focused on adapting evidence-based interventions that are known to be
effective in treating depression and anxiety for TNB adolescents by incorporating minority stress considerations,
and none have been developed specifically for mobile delivery. Leveraging technology to deliver culturally
tailored, evidence-based mental health interventions to TNB adolescents holds great promise to reduce health
disparities and improve mental health outcomes in this health disparity population with documented barriers
accessing competent mental health care."

 Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprised of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, contributes to
significant morbidity and mortality in the United States. The inflammation in IBD is initiated by a breakdown in
the mucous layer and intestinal epithelial cells that act as a barrier in the gastrointestinal tract. Current
therapeutics are inadequate in that they largely target systemic immunosuppression which have been
associated with increased infection and malignancy risk as well as being efficacious in a minority of patients.
These problems result in many IBD patients having active and debilitating disease. We have previously
identified a key role for creatine, an energetic regulator, in intestinal epithelial cell barrier function and wound
healing. This is significant in that IBD patients have decreased expression of the creatine transporter (CRT)
which brings creatine into cells. More recently we have identified dysregulation of intestinal epithelial cell
differentiation in cells that are deficient for CRT. Loss of creatine results in decreased goblet cell marker
expression in CRT deficient organoids and decreased mucous containing goblet cells in the colon of
CrtFloxVillinCre mice. This deficiency decreases mucous layer formation, which is expected as goblet cells are
the major producers of the protective mucous layer which serves to protect the intestinal mucosa. In the follow
proposal we aim to evaluate the hypothesis that the creatine pathway is integral to goblet cell function and
dysregulation identified in CRT deficient epithelial cells will impact the microbiome and metabolism of the
colonic lumen as well as contribute to increased colitis susceptibility.
 In Specific Aim 1, we propose to evaluate the contribution of glycolysis on goblet cell differentiation and
activity in CRT deficient intestinal epithelial cells. We will also determine the cause of the dysregulation by
evaluating key goblet cell signaling pathways. This aim is vital in that identifying the mechanism of goblet cell
loss may provide options for therapeutic intervention. In Specific Aim 2 we will identify changes in microbiome
that could be impacted by the decrease in mucous and other goblet cell produced factors as well as changes
to the creatine content in the lumen. We will determine if these changes may contribute to a stressed
metabolic colonic lumen environment. We believe that alteration to the microbiome may contribute to the
inflammatory mucosal environment. Specific Aim 3 will assess for colitis disease susceptibility due to epithelial
CRT loss in CrtFloxVillinCre mice. We will conduct salmonella colitis and TNBS colitis experiments which cause
ulcerative colitis like inflammation in CrtFloxVillinCre mice and compare disease susceptibility. We will make use
of findings in the prior aims to determine if there are interventions to prevent increased susceptibility in
CrtFloxVillinCre mice including stimulation of differentiation pathways and alteration of the metabolic or microbial
environment. The findings from this proposal will clarify the contribution of CRT loss in goblet cell activity and
contribution to colitis which will provide potential mucosal specific IBD therapeutic targets."
10866378,"Project Summary / Abstract
Capsaspora owczarzaki is a protozoan that may control a neglected tropical disease and reveal the earliest
animal cell-cell signaling mechanisms. However, little is known about this organism at a chemical level. Capsas-
pora lives inside Biomphalaria snails (the vectors that transmit schistosome worms that cause schistosomiasis).
Capsaspora hunts and kills schistosomes, making it a promising biocontrol agent. However, no one knows which
molecules Capsaspora senses to colonize its snail host, nor how it senses its schistosome prey. Furthermore,
Capsaspora is one of the closest living relatives of animals, with which it shares signaling and adhesion genes.
It exhibits reversible aggregation and chemotaxis, reminiscent of human neural crest cells, immune cells, and
metastatic cancer cells. Therefore, it is a phylogenetically relevant model to study how multicellular phenotypes
in animals evolved and act in healthy and disease states. However, no one has found which molecules regulate
Capsaspora’s adhesion and chemotaxis phenotypes to determine if its mechanisms are conserved with those in
animals. For Capsaspora to reach its potential as a biocontrol agent and to reveal insight into the evolution of
animal multicellularity, its mechanisms of chemical signaling must be uncovered.
The proposed research program will discover the molecular mechanisms that regulate two phenotypes, each of
which is relevant both to killing schistosomes and to understanding the evolution of multicellular traits in animals.
First, Capsaspora forms aggregates in response to snail serum, which is notable for two reasons: (1) it is the
only Capsaspora response to a snail host factor, presumably enabling Capsaspora to recognize its snail host
environment, and (2) it is the only regulated cell-cell adhesion process in Capsaspora, which is the only non-
animal with complete integrin and cadherin adhesion complexes. Therefore, discovery of the mechanism of se-
rum-induced aggregation may reveal both how Capsaspora colonizes its host and whether or not regulated
animal cellular adhesion mechanisms were active in animals’ common ancestor. Second, Capsaspora migrates
toward schistosome prey, which is notable for two reasons: (1) it is the only known avenue by which Capsaspora
senses schistosomes, and (2) it is the only reported chemotaxis behavior in the closest relatives of animals (the
holozoans). Therefore, discovery of the chemoattractant and response may reveal how Capsaspora hunts schis-
tosomes and whether or not animal chemotaxis mechanisms were active in animals’ common ancestor.
In both projects, the cue molecule and the Capsaspora receptor will be identified. Subsequent work will decipher
how the signal is transduced. Finally, the significance of these phenotypes for snail colonization and schistosome
killing will be tested in vivo, and the evolutionary conservation of these signaling mechanisms with present-day
animals will be examined. Discovery of the signals and mechanisms that trigger Capsaspora aggregation and
chemotaxis may reveal essential traits for Capsaspora to decrease schistosomiasis infections. Furthermore, this
work may reveal the most fundamental mechanisms of regulated multicellularity in animals."
10866440,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) currently affect >1.6 million Americans. IBD is characterized by disruption
to the intestinal epithelium and a high inflammatory environment. Available treatments target the inflammation
through biological agents, however, fewer efforts have focused on epithelium healing and there are no broadly
applicable therapies to repair intestinal epithelium. Human intestinal organoids (HIOs) are three-dimensional (3D)
multicellular structures, derived from either adult intestinal stem cells or human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs),
that recapitulate human intestinal tissue architecture. HIOs are a promising cell source for intestinal epithelium
repair, disease modeling, and drug screening. Previous work has demonstrated that HIOs engraft to the injured
intestinal wall in vivo, however, these approaches are significantly limited by the lack of an appropriate delivery
vehicle to drive HIO engraftment. HIO generation from hPSCs is multi-stage directed differentiation process
comprising three stages: (I) differentiation into a definitive endoderm monolayer, (II) hindgut and primitive tube
differentiation into free-floating, self-organized 3D aggregates (human intestinal spheroids, HIS), and (III)
intestinal specification into HIOs within a 3D extracellular matrix. This in vitro culture process spans a 2D growth
substrate (stage I and II) to a 3D matrix (stage III). Stage III requires culture within Matrigel, a murine tumor-
derived basement membrane extract with ill-defined composition, lot-to-lot variability, and limited clinical
translation potential. Another roadblock to HIO technologies is the low yield and consistency of HIS differentiation
in HIOs. The objectives of this project are to (1) engineer a synthetic hydrogel platform with independent control
of the biochemical and biophysical cues guiding the entire in vitro differentiation of hPSCs into HIOs, and (2)
deliver HIOs in a synthetic coating to intestinal injuries in vivo. The central hypothesis is that an engineered
synthetic matrix with appropriate biophysical and biochemical cues will support the HIO self-organization, growth,
and differentiation process and enhance HIO engraftment and healing of intestinal wounds. Aim 1: Engineer a
2D synthetic matrix promoting spheroid generation from hPSCs. Aim 2: Evaluate the maturation of HIOs from
the generated spheroids within synthetic niches. Aim 3: Engineer a clinically translatable therapeutic delivery
material for HIOs to injured intestinal tissue. The results of this study will increase the clinical relevance the
generated HIOs and will provide a scalable and translatable synthetic material for the differentiation and delivery
of HIOs."

LRRK2 is a dual enzyme multidomain protein of unknown function. Mutations in LRRK2 has been associated
several different diseases including Parkinson’s disease, inflammatory bowel disease, tuberculosis leprosy,
and Alzheimer’s disease.
The objective of this research program is to determine the molecular mechanisms of action of LRRK2 by using
biochemical, biophysical, and chemical biology methods. We have shown that ROC of LRRK2 is a bona fide
GTPase, PD-associated mutations trap it in a persistently activated state by impairing GTPase activity, it
undergoes nucleotide-dependent conformational changes that is impaired by disease-associated mutations.
The proposed studies seek to understand how these conformational changes in the ROC domain regulate the
overall structure and activity of LRRK2. The three aims are:
Aim 1: To determine the structures of LRRK2 and its conformational dynamics.
a) Determine the structural changes in LRRK2 caused by ROC in different nucleotide-bound states and those
carrying PD-associated mutations using cryo-EM. Our preliminary single-particle data reveals 2 conformations
which may represent the ‘on’ and ‘off’ states. We will define these structures in the proposed studies. b) Define
the atomic structures and interactions of LRRK2 by using X-ray crystallography, which is ideal for defining atoms
and bonds. Conditions yielding diffracting crystals of full-length LRRK2 have been identified. c) Define the
dynamic interactions of residue R1398 in ROC with the γ-phosphate of GTP using NMR, which is key in regulating
mechanism of LRRK2 activity.

Research: The induction of autoantibody and autoimmunity in patients treated with TNF inhibitors (TNFi) is well-
known; however, the mechanism by which TNFi induce breach of B cell tolerance is yet to be determined. In
humans, TNFi affect B and T cell homeostasis via disruption of germinal center (GC) formation which is pivotal
for high affinity antigen-specific antibody production and negative selection of autoreactive B cells. Similarly, in
mice, TNF signaling deficiency prevents GC formation, induces TFH and CD4+IL-17 producing cell expansion,
and alters autoantibody profiles. This study proposes that TNF deficiency, together with a second inducing
stimulus, compromises GC B cell selection via reduction of negative GC B cell signaling and enhancement of T
effector cell activities. To test this hypothesis, the first aim utilizes TNF deficient mice of 2 different backgrounds,
autoreactive Sle1.TNF-/- mice induced with a TLR9 agonist and NZM2328.TNFR1/2 double deficient mice, to
determine the mechanism for the signaling defect in GC B cells that alters B cell selection, and how T cells help
to enhance this process. The second aim will address similar questions in TNFi treated patients using a novel
fluorescent reagent to detect and isolate ANA reactive B cells combined with next generation sequencing
technology. A combination of phenotyping and functional studies is used to determine T cells' influences. The
results from this study will elucidate the effects of TNFi on regulating B cell tolerance and improve our
understanding of how the immune system regulates B cell tolerance when GC formation is abnormal."
10866558,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Schizophrenia is a devastating and burdensome illness the mechanisms of which remain elusive. Contributing
to their elusiveness are a highly complex set of genetic factors, proposed etiological and pathophysiological
pathways, and phenotypic manifestations. To address this complexity, we propose a hybrid method combining
data-driven approaches to large-scale multimodal datasets and theory-driven computational approaches in
order to provide a theoretically constrained framework bridging genetics, development, circuit function,
cognition, and phenomenology of schizophrenia. To that end, and in response to ‘Notice of Special Interest
regarding the Use of Human Connectome Data (HCP) for Secondary Analysis’, we will use data from up to
64,000 individuals, including healthy individuals and patients with schizophrenia and other disorders, from
various HCP-related projects as well as the UK Biobank. We specifically propose measuring intrinsic neural
timescales (INT) from resting-state fMRI data as a theory-driven index of excitation/inhibition (E/I) imbalance in
cortical microcircuits. First, extending our prior work we aim to confirm and further characterize INT alterations
in schizophrenia (widespread trait-like INT reductions and local hierarchy-dependent INT modulations in
relation to psychotic symptoms) and to test their specificity relative to other disorders. Second, we will evaluate
the developmental trajectories of INT and characterize the genetic profile of this fMRI measure and its overlap
with the genetic profile for schizophrenia risk. Third, given the role of E/I ratio in cortical microcircuits in
supporting working-memory computations, we will examine the relationship between INT and working-memory
activation and performance. We will further seek to establish INT as a circuit-level mediator of polygenic risk for
schizophrenia on cognitive deficits. Throughout, we will use well-powered, rigorous, state-of-the-art fMRI and
statistical data-driven methods suitable for large-scale studies and HCP-style fMRI sequences, including cross-
validation and tests of generalizability. Together with a strong theoretical foundation and using biophysical
modeling to complement fMRI analyses, this hybrid—theory- and data-driven—approach will facilitate an
integrated understanding of the circuit-level mechanisms bridging distal genetic-risk factors and proximal
manifestations of schizophrenia. In particular, the combination of cutting-edge cell-type enrichment analyses of
GWAS (which in schizophrenia have suggested converging enrichment in excitatory and inhibitory cortical
cells) and biophysical modeling at the level of cortical microcircuits of interacting excitatory and inhibitory
cellular populations will provide an interpretation of disparate data in terms of convergent cell- and circuit-level
pathways. In doing so, this project will validate a theoretically informative, interpretable, translatable, and
scalable resting-state fMRI measure—INT—that may be relevant across several disorders and, which
additionally owing to its high reliability and ease of acquisition, has high potential as a candidate biomarker."
10869190,"Mechanism of dual NaV1.7 and NaV1.8 block by a NaV inhibitory peptide aptamer
Summary/Abstract: Multiple sensory neuronal sodium channels (NaVs) contribute to pain pathogenesis,
indicating that development of a strategy for specific block of multiple NaVs in the pathological sensory neurons
would be more effective for inhibiting pain signals than inhibiting only single NaV subtype. We discovered a
polyacidic peptide from NaV1.7 intracellular segment and voltage-clamp recording shows that this peptide
potently inhibits sodium currents conducted by both NaV1.7 and NaV1.8 (NaV1.7/1.8) channels. This dual
NaV1.7/1.8 inhibitory peptide aptamer (named 1.7/1.8iPA, 38mer) contains a conserved Ankyrin (AnkG) binding
domain and a multi-PDZ-domain protein
class I binding domain (Pdzd2-I) between NaV1.7 and NaV1.8,
suggesting that either AnkG or Pdzd2-I domain or both within 1.7/1.8iPA may contribute to its dual NaV1.7/1.8
inhibition. The overall goal of this proposal is to investigate 1) whether AnkG and/or Pdzd2-I domains in
1.7/1.8iPA is responsible for its dual NaV1.7/1.8 inhibition, and 2) whether expression of sequence defined
1.7/1.8iPA in the primary sensory neurons (PSN) will suppress PSN excitability, supporting 1.7/1.8iPA as a
potential analgesic lead. Two specific aims will be investigated to test the hypothesis that
1.7/1.8iPA elicits
dual
block of NaV1.7/1.8 currents via a combined effects of AnkG and Pdzd2-I domains, leading to suppression of
PSN action potential firing. Specific aim 1 will investigate and determine
ion channel selectivity of 1.7/1.8iPA by
in vitro of cell-based voltage-clamp recordings using HEK cells stably expressing various NaV subtypes and
NG108-15 neuronal cells that naturally express potassium channels KV7.2/7.3 (both containing conserved AnkG
binding domain). Specific aim 2 will
determine electrogenesis and biological activity (neurotoxicity and animal
behaviors) of 1.7/1.8iPA expression in the rat PSNs. Successful completion of this application will provide
sufficient data
to determine whether 1.7/1.8iPA is a potential analgesic lead to be further developed for AAV-
mediated, PSN-specific dual NaV1.7/1.8 inhibition to treat chronic pain."
10869316,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is increasing interest in promoting the use of information and communication technology to engage
patients in their own healthcare. Patient portals, for example, can provide patients with secure access to lab test
results, doctors’ notes, and medication lists, as well as facilitate communication with healthcare providers. Use
of patient-facing tools like portals has been found to improve the overall quality of preventive or follow-up care,
improve medication adherence and compliance with treatments, as well as reduce caregiver burden. Patients
with the highest healthcare needs, such as older adults with multiple chronic conditions, stand to benefit the most
from patient portals. However, multiple factors have been found to hinder older adults’ ability to fully optimize
their use of these tools and their ability to retrieve and understand health information provided. Viewing lab test
results is one of the most used features of patient portals, but older adult patients with limited health literacy and
technology skills encounter the most problems locating and interpreting lab results. In this project, we will employ
a user-centered approach to develop and evaluate a working prototype of LabGenie, a web-based patient
engagement tool, specifically designed to improve older adults’ comprehension of lab results, and engagement
in managing and acting upon their lab test results. LabGenie will provide visual representations of lab results
and generate question prompts tailored and contextualized based on patients’ medical information. In Aim 1, we
will use an iterative and user-centered approach focused on rapid prototyping and usability testing as guided by
the patient engagement framework to design and test different prototypes of the LabGenie interface. In Aim 2,
we will develop and incorporate in the full version of LabGenie, an AI-powered question prompt generation
module that can automatically generate tailored question prompts based on personal health information from
electronic health records and a lab test knowledge graph. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the effectiveness of
LabGenie-generated question prompts in improving patient engagement and perceived self-efficacy and
intentions to participate in shared decision making. In Aim 4, we will conduct an explanatory sequential mixed
methods research on the full prototype to evaluate the effectiveness of the system in improving patient
engagement, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, accessibility, and self-efficacy in shared decision
making. We will also interview healthcare providers to elicit their perceptions about the potential impact of
LabGenie on clinical workflow and burden in primary care settings. Our long-term goal is to apply these novel
technologies and approaches in the design of patient decision aids or patient portals to improve patient
engagement and shared decision making among at risk populations, with the ultimate goal of improving health
outcomes."
10869161,"A developing body of preclinical evidence suggests that the integrity and composition of the tumor immune
microenvironment (TIME) is highly plastic and is modulated by host lifestyle exposures. Unhealthful exposures
including obesity, inactivity and a high fat diet can lead to a loss of CD8+ T cell effector function and tumor
progression in preclinical breast tumor models, while healthful exposures, such as voluntary wheel running, can
offset tumor growth and dysregulated conditions in the TIME leading to increased trafficking and enhanced func-
tion of CD8+ T cells. Although emerging pre-clinical evidence is compelling, several gaps in epidemiological
knowledge regarding the link among lifestyle factors, tumor immunity and BC outcomes remain.
 First, despite a suggestion to adhere to The American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) and The Ameri-
can Cancer Society (ACS) cancer prevention lifestyle guidelines after a cancer diagnosis, which lifestyle factors
and whether they work together to impact BC outcomes has not been well established. Second, research on the
role of lifestyles and immunity in BC patients has primarily focused on immune cell subsets in the circulating
peripheral blood. To our knowledge, whether lifestyles are associated with distinct immune cell phenotypes in
the breast TIME, the site most relevant for treatment response and BC prognosis, has remained uninvestigated.
 Building off the extant preclinical evidence and multiple lines of published and preliminary evidence from our
group, we designed the current study to address these critical gaps in knowledge. Leveraging data from 1160
primary invasive BC patients enrolled in the Data Bank and BioRepository (DBBR) at Roswell Park, we devel-
oped a composite lifestyle index score (LIS) reflecting adherence to seven cancer prevention recommendations
from The AICR and The ACS including: 1) maintaining a healthy weight; 2) being physically active; 3) eating a
variety of fruits and vegetables; 4) limiting red and processed meats; 5) limiting or avoiding sugar-sweetened
beverages; 6) limiting or avoiding alcohol consumption; and 7) avoiding smoking. Our preliminary analyses re-
veals that patients with the highest versus lowest LIS (e.g., tertiles) experience striking survival advantages.
Based on these and other preliminary data, we formulated our central hypothesis that CD8+ T cell composition
in the breast TIME mediates the observed association between the LIS and BC outcomes. To test this hypothesis,
we will link detailed lifestyle data with multispectral immunohistochemical immune profiling from 1160 BC patients
enrolled in DBBR with available FFPE tumor tissue to execute formal mediation pathway analyses via three
Specific Aims. In aim 1, we will define associations of the LIS with CD8+ T cell composition in the breast TIME
(cell densities, ratios and clusters of total CD8+ T cells, exhausted CD8+ T cells and activated CD8+ T cells).
Next, in aim 2, we will identify associations of CD8+ T cell composition in the breast TIME with BC outcomes. In
aim 3, we will delineate the contributions of CD8+ T cells in the TIME as biological intermediaries underlying the
observed association between the LIS and BC outcomes."
10869005,"Project Summary/Abstract
Habits make up an essential part of humans' everyday behavior. Habits enable us to perform routine activities,
such as driving to work, in an automated, effortless way, freeing up our cognitive resources for more effortful
concomitant tasks, such as conversing with our passenger. Successfully establishing good habits, such as
regular hand washing, sleep times, or exercise, is essential for a healthy lifestyle. However, because they are
automated and inﬂexible, habits can also lead us astray, causing us to inadvertently drive to work when we meant
to go to the doctor or eat snacks when we're not hungry, and in extreme cases, promoting drug seeking behavior
and addiction. Overcoming habits when they are not appropriate for our current goal requires goal-directed
control.
 While the balance between habits and goal-directed control has been well-studied in non-human animals,
cognitive neuroscientists have struggled to translate the standard approaches in this domain into human ex-
perimental research. Speciﬁcally, humans are more efﬁcient than non-human animals at exerting control that
overrides habits, making it difﬁcult to reveal habits in lab experiments, even after thousands of training trials.
Furthermore, it has proven difﬁcult to attribute habit-like behavioral patterns (such as “slips of action” like go-
ing to work instead of going to the doctor) to the strength of the habit, as opposed to the weakness of control
processes.
 This project will develop a new human protocol that will allow researchers to 1) induce habits in hundreds of
trials, making it a practical, single-session task for future research, 2) disengage control enough to reveal habit
behavior, and 3) reveal engagement of control in a way that is separable from the strength of habit expression.
To do so, our approach steps away from successful rodent task designs, and instead relies on the insight that
human decision-making is hierarchical. Speciﬁcally, we will leverage the hypothesis that humans make more
abstract choices (e.g. driving, vs. walking to work) in a controlled, goal-engaged way, then naturally disengage
control and execute their high-level decision with habitual routines. Aim 1 will develop and test the validity of the
protocol with regards to the three targets above; aim 2 will directly test the role of hierarchical decision-making
in expressing habits.
 If successful, this project will open the doors to a wealth of downstream research on habits and goal-directed
decision-making, including probing their neural substrates in functional imaging, and their role in individual dif-
ferences and clinical conditions. If someone is unusually prone to habit-like mistakes (e.g. ﬁnding themselves
at work when planning to go to the doctor), it is currently difﬁcult to attribute this to strong habit expression as
opposed to weak control. Our protocol will enable us to pull this apart, with important implications for the study
of psychiatric conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders, and addiction."
10873125,"ABSTRACT
There is growing evidence that breast cancer patients with adverse body composition (low muscle mass and
excess adiposity) have worse therapeutic responses and an increased risk of recurrence and death. Both low
muscle mass and excess adiposity promote systemic metabolic abnormalities like the metabolic syndrome.
While the impact of adverse body composition on the local tumor microenvironment remains unclear, data from
pre-clinical animal models and in vitro analyses suggest that adverse body composition could contribute to
impaired anti-tumor immunity and alterations in metabolic and proliferative signaling pathways. However, these
relationships have not been comprehensively studied in human breast cancer patients or within molecular
subtypes of breast cancer that have differing biology and prognosis. Developing and personalizing breast
cancer therapies will require understanding how systemic factors such as patient body composition and the
metabolic syndrome impact the local breast tumor microenvironment and therefore breast cancer survival. To
address this gap in knowledge, we propose a molecular epidemiologic study to determine if lower muscle
mass, excess adiposity and the metabolic syndrome impair the anti-tumor immune response by promoting T-
cell exhaustion (Aim 1) and/or by altering the activity of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways and proliferative signaling
(Aim 2) in the breast tumor microenvironment. We will further determine if alterations in these immune,
metabolic and proliferative signaling pathways mediate the association of adverse body composition with
breast cancer recurrence and breast cancer-specific mortality (Aim 3). To accomplish this, we will measure
gene expression levels in 1,400 archived clinical breast tumor samples selected from a unique cohort: more
than 4,000 stage II and III breast cancer patients with longitudinal follow-up and precise measures of muscle,
subcutaneous, and visceral adipose tissue. All these patients also have rich electronic medical record data on
cancer treatments and the metabolic syndrome. Since our sampling approach ensures representation across
each of four major clinicopathological categories defined by hormone receptor and human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 status, we will be able to examine associations overall, and separately within each breast
cancer subtype. Using this premier data resource, we will examine how differences in the breast tumor
microenvironment caused by adverse body composition and the metabolic syndrome may mediate differences
in long-term breast cancer outcomes. The proposed study will help personalize existing breast cancer
therapies and develop future intervention approaches that consider both the molecular features of the tumor
and patient body composition. Furthermore, this study will identify tumor biomarkers that are appropriate
targets to be measured in future trials to improve body composition and the metabolic syndrome through
pharmacologic or lifestyle intervention."

Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) are
surgical procedures used to correct refractive errors, with approximately 600,000 surgeries
performed in the United States each year. A proportion (10 - 20%) of individuals develop
persistent ocular pain after refractive surgery, which is a source of tremendous morbidity,
limiting the ability to work, impacting mental health, and leading to suicidal ideation in severe
cases. We hypothesize that proteins in the tear fluid modulate corneal nerve function,
increasing the risk of and contributing to persistent pain after refractive surgery. As such, our
studies will use proteomic analysis of tear fluid after surgery to identify diagnostic biomarkers for
persistent ocular pain. We will also examine tear proteins prior to surgery in an effort to identify
prognostic biomarkers that predict which individuals are likely to develop persistent pain after
surgery. R33 Phase studies will use an alternative proteomics platform for analytical validation,
and an additional new patient population for clinical validation. This knowledge can lead to
better preventative and therapeutic algorithms to combat this debilitating condition and thus
improve quality of life and decrease patient suffering."

 The lymphatic system maintains tissue fluid homeostasis and regulates local inflammatory
responses.1,2 The liver lymphatic system remains poorly understood. The goal of this proposed research is to
advance our understanding of the mechanisms of hepatic lymphangiogenesis (the formation of new lymphatic
vessels) and the role of lymphatic vessels in liver pathophysiology.
 Vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) is the major inducer of lymphangiogenesis. Our
preliminary studies have shown that enhanced hepatic lymphangiogenesis by VEGF-C overexpression
reduces liver fibrosis, suggesting a therapeutic potential. Additional data show that Schwann cells of hepatic
sympathetic nerves play a central role in hepatic lymphangiogenesis as a source of VEGF-C and as a recruiter
of macrophages, which may contribute to hepatic lymphangiogenesis by producing fibronectin-1 (FN1), a
substrate for integrins essential for VEGF-C/VEGF receptor 3 (VEGFR3) signaling. We thus hypothesize that
lymphatic ablation should increase inflammation and promote disease progression, and lymphangiogenesis
driven by Schwann cells and macrophages through VEGF-C signaling should alleviate inflammation and inhibit
disease progression. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following Specific Aims:
1. Determine the Schwann cell-driven mechanisms that promote hepatic lymphangiogenesis.
2. Determine Kupffer cells/macrophages-driven mechanisms that promote hepatic lymphangiogenesis.
3. Determine the role of lymphangiogenesis in the development of liver fibrosis.
 The proposed research will elucidate the regulation of lymphatic vessels visually and mechanistically
and their functional importance in liver fibrosis/cirrhosis. Further, the potential of VEGF-C overexpression and
subsequent induction of lymphangiogenesis for the prevention and treatment of liver fibrosis/cirrhosis as well
as portal hypertension and ascites will be evaluated. Furthermore, this research will significantly contribute to
the advancement of the study of the liver by exploring relatively underexamined areas of the hepatic lymphatic
system and nervous system."
10871138,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 Infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are problematic because of
associated high treatment failures and elevated mortality rates. Staphylococci including MRSA are the major
cause of medical device infections (MDIs) due to their strong capability to form biofilms. These bacterial biofilms
resist removal by the host immune system and lead to antibiotic-treatment failures due to bacterial tolerance,
development of antibiotic resistance, and limited antibiotic penetration. Vancomycin is the recommended therapy
for MRSA MDIs and the antibiotic daptomycin is the primary antibiotic alternative to vancomycin for these
infections; however, the development of daptomycin resistance especially post vancomycin therapy has been
reported with increasing frequency. Dalbavancin is the so called “last line antibiotic”, a new lipoglycopeptide
being used to treat MRSA infections. Our preliminary data furthermore have shown that neither daptomycin nor
dalbavancin monotherapies are effective in eradicating high MRSA bacterial loads. In this context, the first aim
of this project investigates the impact of a single dose of dalbavancin in combination with a single dose of
daptomycin in biofilm state (in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model with components of
prosthetic material for biofilm growth). This aim is particularly important for combating MRSA infections
associated with MDIs in out-patient settings.
 Bacteriophages (phages) have been found to readily serve as anti-biofilm agents, and in some cases can
also encode biofilm matrix hydrolyzing depolymerases. Therefore, the second aim proposes a single dose of
dalbavancin adjunctive to a single dose of daptomycin (day 1) and daily administration of bacteriophage Sb-1 to
eradicate MRSA infections in biofilm state (in vitro PK/PD models as stated in aim 1). We will use
pharmacokinetic monitoring to achieve dose de-escalation of antibiotics in antibiotic-phage treatment.
 Collectively, this proposal will apply pharmacokinetic measurements, such as area under the concentration-
time curve to achieve dose-de-escalation in phage-antibiotic treatment regimens. The proposed research is
significant in the context of preserving current and future antibiotics and provides critical information regarding
resistance prevention/re-sensitization using antibiotic-phage co-treatments. We will test our central hypotheses
by evaluating the susceptibility of biofilm embedded MRSA to the various proposed antibacterial combinations
and then perform in vitro two-compartment PK/PD biofilm models with humanized pharmacokinetics to optimize
these novel therapies. We expect that through optimizing therapy of MRSA-biofilm infections, we will improve
patient care and prolong the useful life of dalbavancin and daptomycin for the management of MRSA MDIs."

 Fracture-related infection (FRI) is a devastating complication of fracture surgery that can
lead to wound breakdown, implant failure, septic nonunion, and even loss of limb. Despite costly
interventions, failure to successfully treat infections can occur in up to 40% of cases. This stems
from the inability of conventional antibiotics to eradicate bacteria in metabolically reduced
phenotypes, occurring on orthopedic implants or on the bone itself. Consequently, novel
therapeutics are needed to improve the outcomes of patients with FRI. One such novel
therapeutic is bacteriophage therapy, which has innate anti-biofilm capabilities. However, many
aspects of bacteriophage therapy are not well understood, leading to poorly reproducible
protocols. The objective of this proposal is to address several gaps in knowledge to devise
bacteriophage treatment protocols for FRI. First, the PIs will evaluate whether S. aureus FRI are
clonal or polyclonal infections using whole genomic sequencing on S. aureus FRI clinical
isolates. Additionally, the PIs will evaluate the location of biofilm formation in FRI by visualizing
biofilm formation on explanted FRI implants. Finally, to determine an effective route of
bacteriophage therapy administration and to ensure phage treatment is effective at the locations
where biofilm forms on implants in vivo, the PIs will evaluate the efficacy of bacteriophage
therapy in reducing biofilm burden using different routes of bacteriophage administration in a
chronically infected rat femoral shaft fracture model. These will also be correlated with the
production of neutralizing antibody production. Our working hypotheses are that (1) FRI are
clonal infections, (2) biofilms on orthopedic hardware are located on bone-implant interface
where they are not assessable with debridement surgery and (3) the most effective mode of
administration will be intravenous administration, but this will come with a trade-off associated
with a higher degree of neutralizing antibody production compared to other modes of
administration. The expected outcome of this proposal is to gain an improved understanding of
FRI and how best to use bacteriophages in FRI. Additionally, this work will improve our
understanding of bacteriophage therapy to achieve our long-term goal to develop new, more
effective treatment strategies for FRI as well as to better enhance the use of bacteriophages in
other MSK infections."

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected over 690 million people worldwide and caused 6.9 million deaths.
Although the recent variants are less infectious and cause lower mortality than earlier ones, diagnosed active
cases are as high as 20 million worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is continuously accumulating mutations.
Our earlier published studies on its receptor-binding domain (RBD) showed that increased receptor binding
and escape from neutralizing antibodies direct the natural selection of mutations. However, mutations have
also been found in other regions of the spike protein, and the role of these non-RBD mutations is not well
understood. Computational models propose a long-range allosteric communication between different parts of
the spike protein. During this 2-year proposal period, we will design experiments to test the role of long-range
communication by probing the effect of distant mutations on RBD binding to ACE2 and to neutralizing
antibodies (Aim 1). Spike protein is a trimer and exists in multiple conformations with individual RBDs either
accessible or inaccessible to ACE2 and antibodies. We will probe the relative populations of the four
conformational states of the spike protein and the effect of mutations. In addition to SARS-CoV-2 emerged in
2019, two other coronaviruses (CoVs) have caused severe disease: SARS-CoV emerged in 2003 and MERS-
CoV in 2012. Though based on only three data points, the data suggests another COVID outbreak might be
imminent within the next ten years. Human coronaviruses (CoVs) are widely considered to have originated
from bats, and hence, multiple efforts worldwide have been focused on identifying bat CoVs capable of
infecting humans. So far, about 700 bat CoVs with unique spike proteins have been identified, and it is crucial
to determine which receptor pathways they might use to infect humans in order to develop effective therapies.
To begin with, we will examine which of these bat CoV spike proteins might use the ACE2 (SARS-CoV/SARS-
CoV-2) and DPP4 (MERS-CoV) pathways by combining bioinformatic sequence analysis and determining the
relative binding affinities (Aim 2). These assays will be further applied to determine which other receptor
pathways bat CoVs might use to infect the human respiratory system. The molecular knowledge gained during
this proposal will help us in predicting the evolution of the current SARS-CoV-2 virus and any future COVID
outbreaks, which will finally lead to developing effective therapeutics that can neutralize multiple CoVs."

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal pediatric neuromuscular disorder that affects 1/5000
boys globally. This rare disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the dystrophin protein, often
by disrupting the reading frame. Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapeutics target the dystrophin pre-
mRNA, induce exon skipping to restore the reading frame, and partially rescue dystrophin expression.
Four ASO drugs have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. However, their clinical
efficacies are dismally low due to significant barriers in activity and delivery. To address these problems,
we propose two innovative strategies for developing highly effective ASOs targeting dystrophin exons 44
and 45, which together could treat about 14% of DMD patients. Both strategies take advantage of the
fact that RNA tends to fold into structures. In the first strategy, we design ASOs with tertiary interactions
that dramatically expand the ASO-exon molecular interface, in addition to conventional Watson-Crick
base pairing. The tertiary contacts enable the ASO to recognize both the sequence and the structure of
the target exon, potentially driving higher affinity, specificity, and exon skipping activity. For exon 44 (Aim
1) we design the ASO sequence and backbone chemistry to generate tertiary contacts with a short hairpin
in the pre-mRNA, which enhances binding affinity. The crystal structure of the ASO-exon complex reveals
opportunities for creating additional interactions via chemically modified bases. In subsequent rounds of
design and testing, we will synthesize modified oligos, characterize them structurally and biochemically,
and measure exon-skipping activity in DMD patient-derived muscle cell culture. In the second strategy,
we develop a bifunctional cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) that recognizes a unique hairpin adjacent to the
binding site of existing ASO drug Casimersen in exon 45 (Aim 2). Conjugation of the CPP to Casimersen
should enhance both delivery and target RNA recognition. In preliminary studies, we solved a high-
resolution crystal structure of the exon 45 hairpin and discovered non-canonical base pairs that create
unusual structural features in the major groove. We will computationally design CPP sequences to
recognize the novel major groove conformation. We will co-crystallize candidate CPPs with the exon 45
hairpin and quantify their affinity and specificity. For promising leads, we will produce CPP-ASO
conjugates and measure cell penetrance and exon 45 skipping activity in patient cell lines. We anticipate
testing the best ASOs developed in this study in animal models in the future, with potential for clinical
trials. The structure-based strategies can drive development of more effective ASO drugs for skipping
other dystrophin exons, leading to increased access to precision therapies for this debilitating childhood
disease."

The sense of taste is mediated by multicellular taste buds that each house 50-100 rapidly renewing taste
receptor cells (TRCs). TRCs are categorized into three main types: type I glial-like cells, type II cells that detect
sweet, bitter or umami, and type III cells that detect sour. As TRCs renew, the three types are maintained in
relatively stable proportions, allowing the sense of taste to remain stable over time. However, rapid turnover of
taste cells makes the taste system prone to disruption by certain drugs and diseases. Cancer patients with
metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) being treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) often experience
taste dysfunction, or dysgeusia. The primary targets of TKIs used to treat mRCC are the receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTKs) VEGFR and PDGFRβ, which are not expressed in taste tissue. However, these TKIs also
inhibit many off-target RTKs like Met, Ret, PDGFRα, and c-Kit. According to our single-cell RNA sequencing
(scRNAseq) data, these RTKs are expressed in taste tissue in subsets of progenitors and differentiated taste
cells. This suggests inhibition of these off-target RTKs may be the cause of dysgeusia and that some or all of
these RTKs are necessary for proper TRC renewal and taste homeostasis. To test the role of off-target RTKs
in taste homeostasis, I treated lingual organoids with the TKIs Axitinib, Cabozantinib and Sunitinib, which
inhibit different combinations of off-target RTKs and frequently cause dysgeusia in patients. I found these
drugs did not affect progenitor cell proliferation but instead decreased the expression of certain differentiated
taste cell markers. Specifically, all three TKIs decreased expression of the sweet cell marker Tas1r2, and
Tas1r2 was the only marker affected by all three drugs. Importantly, the only off-target RTK inhibited by all
three drugs is c-Kit, which we find in our scRNAseq data to be most highly expressed in sweet-sensing type II
TRCs. These data strongly implicate c-Kit in sweet cell homeostasis. Further analysis of our scRNAseq data
reveals that c-Kit's ligand - stem cell factor (SCF), is expressed by type I and type III TRCs, raising the
possibility of c-Kit mediated crosstalk within taste buds. These data in sum lead me to my hypothesis that c-Kit
signaling, stimulated by crosstalk with other TRC types, is necessary for the differentiation and/or
survival of sweet-sensing type II TRCs. To test this hypothesis, my first aim is to determine if c-Kit inhibition
by TKI treatment leads to deficits in sweet taste in vivo by treating mice with Axitinib and performing
behavioral, electrophysiological and cellular assays. My second aim is to determine if c-Kit is necessary for
sweet cell differentiation or survival. I will use two genetic c-Kit knockout models under different Cre drivers to
knock out c-Kit expression at different points in TRC differentiation. Lastly, I will investigate c-Kit mediated
crosstalk by genetically knocking out SCF from within taste buds. Completion of this project will illuminate the
role of the previously unstudied RTK c-Kit in taste homeostasis."

 Clinical studies have demonstrated that drinking typically begins in adolescence and may lead to alcohol
use disorders (AUD). Both younger and older adults with heavy drinking/AUDs are twice as likely to have
insomnia that can last for several years. Yet the complex interactions between sleep, drinking, and
maintenance of sobriety remain poorly understood despite their profound clinical implications. We postulate
that cycles of binge drinking and withdrawal can lead to hyper-arousal states that disrupt sleep and may further
drive drinking. One barrier to progress in testing this hypothesis has been the lack of translatable animal
models that would allow the control necessary to investigate the long-term effects of alcohol on sleep and
daytime functioning. Studies from our laboratory, in rats, have demonstrated that moderate ethanol exposure,
either in adolescence or in adulthood, can produce long-term changes in the sleep/wake EEG that mirror the
human condition, as well as an enhancement of drinking in adulthood. Alcohol studies in human subjects have
recently focused not only on nighttime polysomnographic findings but also on daytime sleepiness and
disrupted activity levels, as measured by “fit bit” devices. We propose to further test a “fit bit” system that we
have developed in rats to monitor alcohol-induced sleep/wake disturbance, as well as use it to assess the
efficacy of potential therapeutic interventions, and to test mechanistic physiological hypotheses related to the
etiology of alcohol-induced disturbances of sleep and functional wakefulness. A prominent role of the
hypothalamic peptide hypocretin/ orexin (Hct/OX) in homeostatic control of both the sleep/wake cycle and
ethanol-seeking and drinking behaviors has been demonstrated. We have also shown partial pharmacological
reversal of alcohol-induced sleep pathology by Hct/OX antagonists, however, we do not know if they also
impact drinking. New pharmacological studies will test the specificity of the Hct/OX1 vs. Hct/OX2 receptor, vs.
dual receptor antagonism, to modify sleep vs. drinking following alcohol. We have also demonstrated that
alcohol exposure increases hypothalamic Hct/OX, and RNA-seq/ ATAC-seq studies show that the Hct/OX2
receptor gene is impacted in frontal cortex. The new mechanistic studies we propose will focus on the
hypothalamic Hct/OX system using siRNA-mediated hypocretin/ orexin OX1 and OX2 knockdown, gene
expression using RNA-seq, and epigenetic changes using ATAC-seq. Such studies could also inform
precision/personalized medicine decisions by adding evidenced-based data to the suggestion that Hct/OX1
antagonists could be used for individuals with AUD with enhanced craving and Hct/OX2 antagonists for those
with more profound sleep disturbances, and dual receptor antagonists for those with both."

The consequences of mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2 in cancer are unusual. Though
these mutations confer a loss of function of the normal activity of the NADP+-dependent conversion of isocitrate
to α-ketoglutarate (αKG), mutant IDH is more of an oncogene than tumor suppressor, as a neomorphic activity
is also conferred: the NADPH-dependent production of oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2HG) from αKG.
D2HG inhibits αKG-dependent enzymes like DNA and histone demethylases, and NADPH depletion results in
oxidative stress. A variety of point mutations affecting residue R132 in IDH1 can grant these catalytic properties,
causing prominent structural modifications that allow mutant IDH1 to be a bona fide drug target. Indeed, a se-
lective allosteric mutant IDH1 inhibitor is now in the clinic. Both mutant and WT IDH1 localize to the cytosol and
peroxisomes, while IDH2 is found in the mitochondria, raising the possibility of organelle-specific consequences
of IDH mutations, though this has not yet been explored. Interestingly, there is a communication pipeline between
the peroxisomes and mitochondria in that they share an interconnected role in lipid processing and mitigation of
oxidative stress, though the role of IDH in this communication is not yet known. To date, several limitations have
restricted the rigor of mutant IDH studies. First, the catalytic and inhibition profile for R132H IDH1 is extrapolated
to other disease-relevant IDH1 mutants, though we show several mutants have very unique profiles. Second,
the role of NADPH depletion, and thus oxidative stress, is often overlooked in favor of studying consequences
of D2HG. Third, studies focus on the global/cytosolic contributions of mutant IDH1, ignoring its role of sole
NADPH and αKG producer in this organelle. However, we report evidence of dysfunctional lipid biosynthetic
pathways in the peroxisomes upon introduction of cellular IDH1 mutations. The overall goal of our research
program is to determine the mechanisms of metabolic enzyme catalysis, regulation, inhibition, and cellular/orga-
nellular function in health and disease, from the chemical to the cellular levels. By leveraging kinetic, structural,
cellular, and -omics technologies, we can establish the unique consequences of disease-relevant mutational
variants in metabolic enzymes. Here, we have identified critical questions to illuminate the role of mutant IDH1
in disease: 1) How do protein dynamics affect IDH1 catalysis and inhibition? 2) What are the effects of oxidative
stress on IDH1 and IDH2? 3) What are the organelle-specific consequences of IDH1 mutations? 4) What are the
roles of IDH1 mutations in organelle crosstalk? Through this work, we will uncover fundamental catalytic and
regulatory strategies affecting WT and mutant IDH activity, determine the role of IDH1 in the peroxisomes and
identify the unique consequences of mutation at this location, and establish the role of mutant IDH1 in facilitating
peroxisomal/mitochondrial lipid biosynthesis and oxidative stress signalling. Upon completing this work we will
generate valuable new tools, and identify pathways or mechansims that may be therapeutically targetable."

 Lipids are important endocrine signals in the enterohepatic axis that control gene expression by activating
nuclear hormone receptors. Hepatic and intestinal lipid metabolism are key factors in establishing systemic
cholesterol and triglyceride homeostasis in mammals. Excess lipid accumulation in these tissues is linked to
diabetes, NASH, cancer and other diseases. Our long-term objective is to reveal fundamental mechanisms by
which lipid-activated nuclear receptors orchestrate cellular and systemic lipid homeostasis. In the current
application, we focus on regulation of a novel sterol-transport pathway by LXR and FXR. We have discovered
a family of mammalian proteins (Aster-A, -B and -C) that play an important role in cholesterol movement. The
3 Asters are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and are differentially regulated by nuclear receptors. Aster-
B is a target for regulation by sterol-activated LXRs, while Aster-C is regulated by the bile acid-activated FXR.
We hypothesize the Asters play key roles in lipid homeostasis in the enterohepatic axis, including dietary lipid
absorption, chylomicron production and reverse cholesterol transport. We further hypothesize that Asters are
important contributors to the pharmacological effects of LXR and FXR agonists. We will address these
hypotheses with the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will define the role of FXR-regulated Aster-C in
hepatic cholesterol transport. We will use a combination of cellular, biochemical, imaging, and in vivo studies
to define the pathway for Aster-C-dependent cholesterol transport in hepatocytes. We have generated liver-
specific Aster-C knockout mice, and preliminary analysis reveals them to have altered hepatic and plasma lipid
levels. We will perform metabolic analyses and in vivo cholesterol tracer studies to interrogate systemic
cholesterol flux. We will analyze how loss or overexpression of Aster proteins affects the movement of HDL-
cholesterol into bile and for systemic reverse cholesterol transport at baseline and in response to FXR
agonists. Specific Aim 2 will elucidate the role of Asters in intestinal cholesterol transport. We will analyze
mice lacking Aster-B, Aster-C, or both to test the importance of Asters in dietary cholesterol absorption and
chylomicron production. Preliminary analysis has revealed reduced uptake of dietary cholesterol and reduced
enterocyte cholesterol ester content in the absence of both Asters. We will further test whether Asters
contribute to trans-intestinal cholesterol excretion. Finally, we have discovered that the approved drug
ezetimibe, which inhibits intestinal cholesterol uptake, is a selective ligand for Aster-C, and we have solved the
crystal structure of the Aster-C–ezetimibe complex. Based on these findings we will determine whether the
Aster pathway contributes to the pharmacological effects of ezetimibe. Completion of our aims is expected to
provide fundamental insight into pathways governing lipid transport, and may identify new opportunities for
intervention in metabolic disease."

Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) affects up to 5% of live births in the US each year and results in life-
long physical, cognitive, and behavioral impairments. Alcohol exposure during neurulation, the formation and
closure of the neural tube (~ 4th week of pregnancy in humans, gestational days 8-10 in mice), is associated
with abnormal growth of midline structures, such as the cortex, septum, pituitary, and ventricles, and
neurofunctional changes later in life. My preliminary work suggested that neurulation-stage alcohol causes cell
cycle arrest or delayed cell cycle progression, resulting in disrupted proliferation and, ultimately, anomalous
tissue and organ development. Specifically, we performed whole transcriptome profiling of the rostroventral
neural tube 6 hr after alcohol exposure and found that many genes and gene networks related to cell cycle
regulation and cell proliferation were altered by alcohol. In addition, neurulation-stage alcohol caused
significant dysregulation of the sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway and cell cycle genes. These changes in
morphogenic signaling were concomitant with smaller rostral neural tube volumes and fewer actively dividing
cells in alcohol-exposed embryos. In this proposal, we use a well-characterized mouse model of FASD to test
the hypothesis that neurulation-stage alcohol exposure alters cell cycle regulation in the rostral neural tube
through disruption of processes that regulate cell cycle progression. Aim 1 analyzes cell cycle arrest and G1-
specific processes in the neural tube following prenatal alcohol. Preliminary data suggest dysregulation of
molecular mechanisms that control the successful transition between cell cycle stages and the DNA damage
response, possibly leading to impaired DNA integrity and replication errors. Aim 2 investigates pathways that
control protein degradation and trafficking during the cell cycle, following up on previous work showing
downregulation of genes encoding ubiquitylation enzymes by prenatal alcohol. Finally, Aim 3 examines
epigenetic marks associated with chromatin that regulate cell cycle progression, as pathways related to
chromatin modifications were found to altered by neurulation-stage alcohol in our preliminary studies. These
experiments will provide evidence that mechanisms of cell cycle progression represent an under-studied
pathway through which prenatal alcohol causes symptoms of FASD."

Mast cells, unlike microglia, are not unique to the brain but instead occupy a wide variety of niches throughout
the body where they subserve numerous functions, many of which are still being discovered and include
surprising roles as tissue remodelers. Mast cells in the brain remain poorly understood, particularly during

in the developing brain with common and divergent functions in health and disease. These populations
are found in the POA/hypothalamus and hippocampus and share the common feature of peaking in density

pronounced sex difference in the POA/hypothalamus with males having more mast cells than females but there
is no evidence to-date of the same in the hippocampus. We seek to understand the tissue origins, proliferative

For bacterial pathogens, the first studies that begin to define the microorganism’s functional genetic nature on
a genome-wide scale, frequently represent a landmark and highly impactful achievement. The major human
pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis is a bacterium for which such studies have not been performed, in large part
due to Chlamydia’s obligate intracellular nature and historical intractability to modern genetic manipulation.
With the development of two major genetic tools for Chlamydia by our group—transposon mutagenesis and
lateral gene transfer chimeras—functional genomic investigations in Chlamydia are now possible.
Our long term goal is to globally define and functionally characterize the genetic correlates to C. trachomatis
infection and pathogenesis. Using the complementary approaches of transposon mutagenesis and
interspecies chimeras, we propose to: (i) identify the major genetic determinants of Chlamydia infection using a
clinically relevant mouse model and in vitro assays; (ii) determine the Chlamydia genes associated with host
adaptation by exploiting interspecies lateral gene transfer within Chlamydia and the signature host tropisms of
the parental strains; (iii) characterize the mechanisms of host cell subversion by the secreted inclusion
membrane effector proteins IncU and IncS.
These efforts are essential for gaining a functional appreciation of the role that unique chlamydial genes play in
the organism’s growth and development, and also Chlamydia’s evolutionary adaptation to successfully
maintain infection and pathogenesis in complex mammalian hosts. We anticipate that Chlamydia will serve as
a model obligate intracellular bacterium, and, therefore, the knowledge obtained from this work will broadly
extend to other pathogens that have evolved an obligate intracellular niche in their mammalian hosts.
Identification of these loci is critical for our understanding of the mechanisms through which Chlamydia have
adapted to mammalian hosts, and represents an important step towards elucidating the major virulence

 The objective of this application is to highlight the San Diego Pelvic Floor Consortium (SDPFC) site
qualifications to continue in the next cycle of the Pelvic Floor Disorders Network (PFDN). The success of the
SDPFC in the PFDN has largely been due to our proven two-site model, which combines the strength of a
tertiary academic medical center (University of California San Diego – UCSD) and a large volume
community based health maintenance organization (Kaiser Permanente San Diego – Kaiser). Our site has
contributed meaningfully over the past three cycles by designing and selecting cutting edge clinical trials ideally
suited to this multi-centered, multi-disciplinary research network. We intend to continue to foster novel research
ideas and work collaboratively with the other clinical sites and the data-coordinating center to refine studies
ideally suited to clinical trials requiring large-scales and diverse populations. We boast a history of successful
concept development, experience in survey development and refinement, successful implementation and
recruitment for large-scale clinical trials, extensive experience in implementation of randomized trials of
behavioral and surgical interventions, and maintaining high retention rates and quality data. Our proposed
SMART design randomized trial of Transurethral Bulking Agent vs. Single Incision Sling (BASIS) represents an
innovative and timely study of novel treatment approaches for women with stress urinary incontinence. The 15
members of the SDPFC are a diverse group of urogynecologists and urologists with the depth and breadth of
scientific and clinical expertise necessary for the PFDN to continue advancing the field. Additionally, our site
has an established research institution, funded by the NIH sponsored Clinical & Translational Science Award,
with the full spectrum of resources and personnel available to conduct basic science, translational,
epidemiologic, behavioral, and clinical research across a diverse racial/ethnic community. The SDPFC is

10874832,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Current research proposes protein phase separation as a key mechanism underlying the
formation of liquid-like biomolecular condensates, which play an integral role in numerous cellular
processes and age-related disorders. The interior of a living cell is a highly crowded environment,
therefore, to fully comprehend the phase behaviors and biological functions of proteins, it is critical
to consider the densely populated environment of cells, where proteins coexist with a wide variety
of molecules possessing diverse physical and chemical properties. To this end, researchers have
utilized various molecules as crowding agents to study protein phase behavior in this context.
While the effects of crowding on proteins have been studied to some extent, many open questions
remain to be addressed. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to unravel the
mechanism underlying the phase separation of proteins in living cells. Our previous research
explored the impact of two types of crowding agents on a model protein/polymer system, revealing
that they lead to distinct phase-separated complexes due to their different effects on individual
protein and polymer molecules. Therefore, based on the previous results, our central hypothesis
is that the observed macroscopic crowding phenomena are directly linked to how the crowding
agents affect the conformation and behavior of individual protein and polymer molecules at the
molecular level. The overall objectives of this study are to enhance our understanding of the
changes in conformation and intermolecular interactions that regulate protein phase behavior in
crowded environments, and how these changes impact the properties of the phase separated
proteins. The central hypothesis and objectives of this application will be tested and attained by
pursuing four specific aims: 1) investigate the effects of crowing on the phase transition of a
model protein/polymer system; 2) characterize the physical properties of the phase separated
protein/polymer complexes; 3) measure the conformation of individual protein and polymer
molecules in different crowding environments; 4) probe the effects of crowding on the protein-
protein and protein-polymer interactions. The proposed research is anticipated to have a
significant positive impact, as a detailed understanding on the protein phase behavior in
crowded environments will shed light on the formation, function, and fate of biomolecular
condensates. The contribution is significant because it marks the first step in a series of
investigations expected to lead to a comprehensive understanding of protein phase behavior in
crowded environments at the molecular level."

Identification of interventions that extend mouse lifespan provides new insights into mechanisms
of longevity determination in mammals, and may lay the groundwork for eventual anti-aging
therapies in humans. The NIA Interventions Testing Program (ITP) evaluates agents proposed
to extend mouse lifespan by retardation of aging or postponement of late life diseases.
Interventions proposed by multiple collaborating scientists from the research community are
tested, in parallel, at three sites (Jackson Laboratories, University of Michigan and University of
Texas), using very similar, standardized protocols, and using sufficient numbers of genetically
heterogeneous mice to provide 80% power for detecting changes in lifespan of 10%, for either
sex, after pooling data from any two of the test sites. One hundred and two such lifespan
experiments, involving various doses of 66 distinct agents, have been initiated in the first twenty
years of the ITP. Thirty-six experiments have involved comparative tests of multiple doses of
effective agents, variable starting ages, or alternative dosing schedules. Statistically significant
effects on longevity, in one or both sexes, have been documented and then confirmed for
NDGA, rapamycin, acarbose, 17-α-estradiol (17aE2), and canagliflozin. Significant effects were
also noted for Protandim, glycine, meclizine, captopril, and astaxanthin. Lifespan trials are now
underway for 25 new agents. ITP survival results have also documented longevity benefits from
four agents started in middle-age: rapamycin, acarbose, 17aE2, and canagliflozin. A
Collaborative Interactions Program (CIP) has provided tissues from ITP drug-treated mice to an
open, growing, international network of scientific collaborators, meeting 26 requests from 17
distinct laboratories in the previous five-year period. Plans for the next five-year period include
additional lifespan (""Stage 1"") trials, detailed analyses (""Stage 2"") of agents found to increase
lifespan, transition from the CIP to an Interventions Biospecimens Repository, additional
diagnostic specificity in pathological assessments, inclusion of RNA-Seq data in all Stage 2
protocols, and comprehensive pharmacokinetic assessments of drugs found to increase
lifespan, as well as continued collaborative work with a network of scientists to study drug
effects on postulated aging mechanisms and links to disease. Site-specific studies at Michigan
will add a battery of tests for Aging Rate Indicators in fat, muscle, brain, plasma, and liver of
Stage 2 mice, and include tests of drug effects on learning and memory in Stage 2 protocols.
The work proposed should allow the ITP to continue to make major contributions to mammalian
aging biology."

Family separations due to disasters, armed conflict, and migration affect millions, are expected to increase,
and damage children’s health across the lifecourse. Given the extreme trauma of separations, reunifications
should occur quickly in the child’s best interest, when safe to do so. Young, pre-verbal children are unlikely to
be able to recount contact information of family members. DNA data can be powerful both for identification and
for kinship verification of children separated from their families, as DNA can quickly, accurately, and
inexpensively provide concrete evidence of genetic family ties. We propose to investigate strategies for (1)
protection of children’s DNA data; and (2) consent for children at varying developmental stages to inform
development of a U.S. family reunification DNA database strategy to serve as a scalable humanitarian
“techquity” intervention to be activated when needed to reconnect separated children with their families. Our
goal is to inform U.S.-relevant protocols, partnerships, and infrastructure for DNA-based family reunification
responses that can be activated following separations, including after a mass separation event such as a
natural disaster, while ensuring protections of children’s DNA data are in place. In the past, DNA data have
been successfully used for disaster victim identification and for limited, scenario-based family reunifications of
“disappeared” children abducted in war; however, no protocol exists for use of living children’s DNA to reunify
families. We can learn from past contexts to develop strategies for securing sensitive samples and data from
secondary misuse. We aim to define the scope of current and prior humanitarian use of children’s DNA data to
analyze: (a) the contexts in which children’s DNA data are or have been used; (b) the role of DNA in each
context; and (c) the extent to which DNA data advances or harms children’s interests. We will interview key
informants to capture nuanced scenarios within each context to record factors related to risks and benefits of
children’s DNA data use, and apply framework analyses to describe utilities and pitfalls of children’s DNA data
use. We also will identify and interview key allies and experts with expertise on age-appropriate consent
processes. Interview data will provide insight into principles of consenting children for DNA use for reunification
across developmental stages. Finally, we will host a one-day virtual summit among allies and experts that will
involve facilitated dialogue and visual mapping to identify and deliberate the contentious matters in consenting
for children’s DNA use for reunification. Based on the summit discussions, we will formulate and visualize a set
of informed consent principles for children’s DNA use for family reunification. Findings will have immediate
impact for informing protocols and policy, and can prompt further research, including the immediate next step
of conducting a modified-Delphi and implementation study to determine and test application of best practices
for children’s DNA data use for family reunification. Achieving these aims will contribute to structuring an
ethically sound DNA family reunification response that can be activated quickly when needed."

There is a vital need to understand the causes of depression in order to develop effective treatments for
the 11% of Americans who currently suffer from this debilitating disease. This project focuses on a new
target, T helper 17 (Th17) cells, which we recently linked to depression susceptibility in mouse models
and for which we identified feasible interventions. The overall objectives of this project are to identify
characterize, localize and identify mechanisms of action of Th17 cells after stress and test the potential
therapeutic impact of targeting Th17 cells to decrease vulnerability to depression, assessed by
measuring depression-like behaviors in mice. This research evolved from the now well-established link
between inflammation and depression. We reasoned that therapeutically targeting downstream, and
prolonged, outcomes of inflammation may be more feasible than attempting to neutralize the multitude
of cytokines that are transiently induced in the inflammatory response to stress. Inflammatory cytokines
associated with depression drive the production of Th17 cells, and Th17 cells are already well-
established to be toxic to the CNS. In mouse models, we found that Th17 cells are able to infiltrate
mouse brain parenchyma after stress, these infiltrating cells exhibited characteristics of pathogenic
(CCR6+ and IL-23R+) and follicular (CXCR5+) Th17 cells, and the presence of CCR6 on Th17 cells was
required for them to promote learned helplessness. We also identified the gut as a likely source of
infiltrating Th17 cells, as mice receiving CD4 cells from transgenic mice that express T cell receptor
(TCR) specific for Segmented Filamentous Bacterium are sufficient to promote learned helplessness,
whereas CD4 cells from wild-type mice are not. However, the mechanisms of action of Th17 cells in
depression remain unclear. In this project, Specific Aim 1 will determine the characteristics of Th17 cells
that promote depressive-like behaviors. We will identify factors associated with Th17 cell localization in
the brain after stress. Specific Aim 2 will will determine the actions of Th17 cells in the brain that
promote depressive-like behaviors. Using depleting approaches, we will identify the downstream cell
effectors of Th17 cells responsible for depressive-like behaviors. Specific Aim 3 will determine if Th17
cells can be targeted to induce antidepressant effects. We will test if blocking Th17 cells using
nanoparticles and engineered bacteria is sufficient to induce antidepressant actions. Altogether this
project will identify the localization, the source, the characteristics and the mechanisms of action of Th17
cells in depressive-like behaviors and determine targeted strategy by which Th17 cell production
following stress can be blocked in order to develop a new therapeutic strategy for depression, a
prevalent, debilitating, and inadequately treated disease."

genes putatively involved in disease pathogenesis. While GWAS efforts by numerous research groups have
been successful in discovering genomic variants robustly associated with bone mineral density (BMD) and
fracture, GWAS only reports signals associated with a given trait and not necessarily culprit genes.
In this proposal we utilize a computationally advanced, multi-step process that integrates genome level data to
identify novel osteoblast and osteoclast genes. This bioinformatically-driven `genome-wide variant to gene
mapping' effort combines RNA-seq, ATAC-seq and high-resolution chromatin conformation capture methods to
implicate culprit effector genes. We have already used this approach in osteoblast lineage cells and 30% of
osteoporosis-associated GWAS signals were shown to have direct physical contact with genes in these cells,
totaling 86 putative target genes. Several of these targets (ex. EPDR1, ING3) have already had extensive
functional follow-up. However, many more need functional follow-up and there are still 70% of osteoporosis
associated GWAS loci that remain unresolved. Importantly, our initial work focused only on discovering
osteoblast-associated genes, and thus genes that play a role in osteoclasts were not revealed. Furthermore,
our published work to date has only focused on one time-point during the osteoblast differentiation process,
thus genes that play roles at later points in cell differentiation have not been discovered.
This comprehensive application will functionalize GWAS findings, and in doing so, reveal novel genes involved
in regulating bone formation and resorption. Our established pipeline from gene discovery to gene validation
has been robustly tested and thus far, although our sampling has been small, we have had a 100% hit rate for
validating putative effector genes. Thus, it is our hypothesis that we can uncover many more BMD effector
genes by conducting high resolution `genome-wide variant to gene mapping' in osteoclasts and osteoblasts.
The relevance of genes will be validated using both in vitro and in vivo approaches in mouse models. Upon
completion, we will provide the bone community with new targets to pursue for understanding mechanism."

Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) guidelines draw on trials with few older patients, yet ~50,000 ICDs
are implanted annually in patients ≥65 years old. Half of older ICD recipients will either be dead or enrolled in
hospice within 5 years of implantation, and little evidence supports critical long-term decisions including (1)
whether to replace ICDs when the battery declines, or (2) timing of ICD deactivation to avoid painful shocks at
the end of life. There is therefore a pressing need for longitudinal data on patient health status and clinical
experiences in the years after ICD implantation to support patient-centered decisions. To extend our prior work
and further improve the care of patients living and dying with ICDs, we now propose the Prospective
Investigation of Palliative and End-of-Life ExpeRiences with ICDs (PIPER-ICD) Study, a rigorous, multi-
center cohort with the goal of defining patient-centered experiences of older ICD patients >5 years post
implantation. We will prospectively collect data on geriatric conditions and quality of life from 1200 patients at
5 sites, enriched with remote monitoring data on arrhythmias and physical activity, to evaluate clinical and
functional trajectories (Aim 1). This cohort will support novel application of a semi-competing risks approach to
personalizing individualized outcome profiles for death and ICD shocks (Aim 2). Lastly, we will apply mixed
methods to the decedent cohort (N~200) to quantify ICD shocks at the end of life and identify potential targets
for interventions to improve their care (Aim 3). This proposal is led by cardiac electrophysiologist with expertise
in geriatrics, outcomes research, and bioethics, supported by an experienced research team with a strong record
of collaboration. IMPACT: As the first comprehensive, prospective study of older ICD patients focused on long-
term and end-of-life experiences, PIPER-ICD will generate patient-centered and personalized data essential for
evidence-based guidance to serve a vulnerable population. PIPER-ICD will thus serve as a rich resource to
support decision-making for millions of patients considering replacement or deactivation of their ICDs."
10875686,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
 Ecologically-guided approaches have helped to reinvigorate natural products chemistry discovery efforts in
recent years. Such approaches take advantage of ecological relationships in which chemical defenses produced
by microbial symbionts benefit a host animal. These ecological relationships have recently been appreciated to
be ubiquitous and sampling of these systems has an impressive track record of delivering novel, active
compounds. However, generalized approaches for efficiently accessing novel chemical scaffolds and analogs of
promising compounds have not been developed. As such, the potential for chemical discovery from such
systems remains unrealized.
 The proposed project develops a host-associated biogeography framework for chemical discovery by tapping
into a completely unexplored ecological niche with outstanding discovery potential: bacterial symbionts of
Trachymyrmex ants in the American Southwest. In addition to uncovering novel antibiotic compounds, this work
will quantify chemical diversity across this niche and determine geographic, environmental, and biological factors
that predict the presence of active novel compounds. In Aim 1, a diverse library of 150 natural product extracts
will be assembled from cultures of symbiotic bacteria isolated from southwestern Trachymyrmex ants. These
ants will be systematically sampled from sites across the American Southwest such that the library captures
diversity across multiple biogeography variables: location, host ant species, and habitat. Aim 2 will establish how
these biogeography variables predict the distribution of antibiotic activity and chemical diversity across this
library. Antibiotic activity screening against both ecologically-relevant and clinically-relevant microbial pathogens
will establish correspondence between ecological and clinical activity. Metabolomics analysis of this library will
reveal how molecules are distributed as a function of biogeography variables. Aim 3 of this proposal will deliver
on ecologically-guided discovery from this unexplored niche by characterizing highly active novel compounds
from this library, with a particular focus on synergistic antibiotics. Through activity-guided fractionation and
detailed chemical characterization, this aim will yield 2-4 novel bioactive compounds. This proposal will lay the
groundwork for further chemical discovery from this and other ecological niches.
 Undergraduate researchers will be engaged in all components of this work through modular summer and
senior thesis research projects as well as a course-based research experience. This project will broaden
participation in science research at the Claremont Colleges by women and other groups underrepresented in
science. Additionally, the project will strengthen the research environment of multiple institutions at the
Claremont Colleges through enhanced research opportunities on significant research, through a variety of new
collaborations, as well as through bringing modern instrumentation to the Keck Science Department."

The overall goal of this project is to elucidate the role neutrophils, both peripheral and
meningeal, play in CNS homeostasis. Specifically, how neutrophil activity and location
may influence the molecular landscape of neurons in learning and memory. During the
mentored phase of this project, I will focus on characterizing the neutrophil population
within the meninges, the location of these cells in the meninges, and determine whether
the meninges act as a non-medullary source of neutrophils (Aim 1). During this period, I
will also determine the specific role these cells play in modulating learning and memory
in mice (Aim 2). The completion of these aims will help me develop skills in bioinformatics,
establishing slice cultures and gain a rudimentary working knowledge of
electrophysiological methods. These techniques will be of further use to me in the
independent phase of this grant. During the independence phase, I will investigate
elucidate the role of peripheral and meningeal neutrophils in different learning paradigms
(Aim 2). Upon completion, this project will elucidate new neuromodulatory function of
neutrophils and identify the meninges as a source of these cells within the CNS. These
results will greatly inform our understanding of the role these cells play in injury and
neurodegeneration."
10878961,"This study is part of the NIH’s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction. Neurodevelopmental processes are shaped by dynamic interactions between genes and environments. Maladaptive experiences early in life can alter developmental trajectories, leading to harmful and enduring developmental sequelae. Pre- and postnatal hazards include maternal substance exposure, toxicant exposures in pregnancy and early life, maternal health conditions, parental psychopathology, maltreatment, structural racism, and excessive stress. To elucidate how various environmental hazards impact child development, it is imperative that a normative template of developmental trajectories over the first 10 years of life be established
based on a sufficiently large and demographically diverse sample of the US population. To accomplish this, the Healthy Brain and Child Development National Consortium (HBCD-NC) has been formed to deploy a harmonized, optimized, and innovative set of neuroimaging (MRI, EEG) measures complemented by an extensive battery of behavioral, physiological, and psychological tools, and biospecimens to understand
neurodevelopmental trajectories in a sample of 7,500 mothers and infants enrolled at 24 sites across the United States (US). The HBCD-NC will carry out a common research protocol under direction of the HBCD-NC Administrative Core (HCAC) and will assemble and distribute a comprehensive and well-curated research dataset to the scientific community at large under the direction of the HBCD-NC Data Coordinating Center
(HDCC). The overarching goal of the HBCD-NC is to create a comprehensive, harmonized, and high-dimensional dataset that will characterize typical neurodevelopmental trajectories in US children and that will assess how biological and environmental exposures affect those trajectories. A special emphasis will be placed
on understanding the impact of pre- and postnatal exposure to opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco and/or other substances. To address these broad objectives, the sample of women enrolled will include: 1) a racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse cohort that is representative of the US population; 2) pregnant women
with use of targeted substances (opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco); and 3) demographically and behaviorally similar women without substance use in pregnancy to enable valid causal inferences. In addition, the HBCD-NC will identify key developmental windows during which both harmful and protective environments have the most
influence on later neurodevelopmental outcomes. The large, multi-modal, longitudinal, and generalizable dataset that will be produced for the first time by this study will provide novel insights into child development using state- of-the-art methods. The HBCD-NC study will inform public policy to improve the health and development of children across the nation."
10879076,"Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy-specific syndrome and several putative mechanisms have been implicated in
the pathogenesis of PE including complement (C) cascade activation. C activation byproducts in the circulation
are elevated with pregnancy in women and they are further elevated significantly in PE women. Placental
deposition of C activation byproducts is also significantly elevated in PE compared to normotensive women. The
semi-allogenic nature of fetus/placenta induces maternal C cascade activation. To understand the cause-and-
effect relation between C activation and pregnancy hypertension, it is essential to gain insight into the
mechanistic pathways that link placental C activation to pregnancy hypertension and fetal growth restriction with
the view of targeting these pathways for potential therapeutic discoveries. One possible mechanism is that C
activation may promote systemic antiangiogenic and proinflammatory milieu, maternal vascular dysfunction,
hypertension and renal pathological changes. Further, C activation may induce placental fibrin deposition due to
crosstalk with coagulation system, promoting fetal growth restriction. In this application we will determine the
mechanisms that link C activation to pregnancy hypertension and fetal growth restriction using a novel
complement activation-based mouse model. This transgenic mouse model allows us to downregulate Crry in
an inducible, conditional and placenta specific manner and study its effects on various maternal systems.
Specific aim 1. To assess if placenta specific C activation promotes systemic antiangiogenic
and proinflammatory milieu, hypertension, maternal vascular dysfunction, and renal pathology
through C3a-C3aR and/or C5a-C5aR, STAT3 and ERK pathways. Hypothesis: C activation during
pregnancy promotes increased systemic levels of antiangiogenic (sFLT1, sEng) and proinflammatory
molecules (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8), reduced relaxation and increased contractile responses (vascular
dysfunction) of maternal peripheral arteries, hypertension, defective uterine spiral artery (SA)
remodeling, and glomerular endotheliosis (renal pathology) through C3a-C3aR/C5a-C5aR, STAT3 and
ERK pathways. Further, inhibition of C activation using specific inhibitor CR2-Crry ameliorates these C
induced changes. Specific aim 2. To test the hypothesis that C activation induces placental fibrin
deposition through its crosstalk with coagulation system promoting fetal growth restriction.
Hypothesis: C activation promotes fetal growth restriction by reducing fetal blood supply due to
placental peri-villous fibrin deposition through the disruption of tissue factor (TF) and von Willebrand
factor (vWF) homeostasis. C activation directly through C5a-C5aR signaling and indirectly through
proinflammatory cytokines IL6, IL8 and TNF-α induces the upregulation of TF, plasminogen activator
inhibitor 1 and vWF by endothelial cells and downregulates the ADAMTS-13 in liver."

Disparities in cancer outcomes in certain patient populations such as Hispanic/Latino (H/L) patients, are rooted
in part in the lack of understanding of biologic factors and mechanisms of response or resistance to novel
therapeutics. Although most patients express a willingness to participate in clinical research, only approximately
8% of adult cancer patients enroll in cancer clinical trials, and the percentage of minorities participating in clinical
trials, overall, is much lower when compared to the general population of the U.S. H/L’s, and other minority
groups, for example, continue to be under-represented in clinical trials. The under-representation of minority
groups in cancer research contributes to disparities in cancer care and outcomes by failing to provide the evidence
that clinicians and scientists need to safely treat and discover new treatments for minority patients with cancer.
This project enables an integrative analysis of demographic, and clinical data combined with multi-omics
approaches using blood samples and tissue from breast cancer patients to elucidate the differences in immune
response to breast cancer in patients of H/L race. Immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) is a type of immunotherapy
that has revolutionized treatment for many patients with breast cancer. However, complex immunosuppressive
tumor microenvironments (TMEs) within breast cancers render them less responsive to ICIs and present
therapeutic obstacles. Specifically, recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) prohibit T-cell
activation and infiltration which leads to successful treatment with this class of therapeutics. We aim to
characterize differences in the suppressive TME by race and tumor subtype. Understanding these differences will
affect development of novel treatment combinations & strategies. The identification of patient populations with
higher risk disease, most likely to benefit from ICIs is of equal importance to understanding of scientific
mechanisms. H/L patients have a higher percentage of young women (<50 years old) diagnosed with breast cancer
and often with more aggressive subtypes as compared to Non-Hispanic White (NHW) patients. These differences
persist even when correcting for socioeconomic factors. Overall, this work will help provide insight about
differences in the immune TME in H/L patients with breast cancer and we will also try to determine if use of
organoids could help screen for differences in efficacy with regard to development of one of our one clinical trials
in development. We are investigating the promising therapeutic combination of a histone deacetylase inhibitor
entinostat, combined with ICIs as this targets MDSCs. If we can determine a differential response to this treatment
in H/L patient derived organoids this would provide a potential paradigm changing stratification of H/L patients
with breast cancer who stand to benefit from the effects of this novel therapy."

10889920,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Significant advances in global health have been achieved in recent decades. Yet, serious disparities in health
outcomes persist, especially among children, adolescents and their adult caregivers. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)
is one of the regions disproportionately burdened by multiple health threats, including endemic CDs; emerging
and re-emerging infectious diseases; increasing incidence of NCDs, and a set of exacerbating factors that have
contributed to poor public health and increased overall disease burden affecting children, adolescents and their
adult caregivers. Similar trends are documented in several other LMICs, including countries in Asia and Eastern
Europe. In light of widespread health inequities and gaps in the translation and uptake of scientific evidence in
real-world settings in LMICs, dissemination and implementation (D&I) science can advance timely and context-
specific public health solutions. Moreover, significant methodological advances in data science can create new
opportunities to more accurately identify at-risk populations, better understand patterns and mechanisms of
health burdens, and allow for more in-depth analysis of implementation gaps and disparities in healthcare
systems and across populations in LMICs. The proposed research training program, entitled “Addressing the
Research Capacity Gap in Global Child, Adolescent & Family Health Disparities Utilizing Implementation
and Data Sciences among Vulnerable Populations in Resource-limited Settings (ACHIEVE)”, focuses on
increasing D&I and data science capacity to address global health disparities affecting children, adolescents and
their adult caregivers. The program addresses the following specific aims: Aim 1: To provide a research training
program to five cohorts (~50 trainees) of health care professionals and post-doctoral trainees from the U.S., and
post-professional degree graduates from SSA that equips trainees with D&I and data science research skills and
knowledge through experiential learning, mentoring, “hands-on” immersion in global health implementation and
data science research and methodologies, individualized consultation, goal setting and monitoring and web-
based support across time; Aim 2: Bring together an interprofessional network of committed mentors from the
global north and the global south to promote equitable bi-directional learning and collaboration and ensure quality
training for promising new investigators committed to applying D&I and data science research methods to
address health disparities impacting children, adolescents, and their families in low-resource settings; Aim 3: To
examine the short-term and longitudinal outcomes of the ACHIEVE training program; and Aim 4. Delineate key
factors that underlie successful mentorship and training of new investigators– with potential implications for new
investigators who are focused on D&I and data science research that seek to address health disparities impacting
children, adolescents, and their adult caregivers. The four U.S. universities have each committed matching funds
totaling $600,000 to support the ACHIEVE program."

Obesity affects 2 out of 5 American adults and leads to high individual and societal costs. Behavioral
interventions focusing on diet and exercise can yield clinically significant weight loss of at least 5%. However,
the proportion of people who achieve this benchmark in behavioral weight loss trials is limited due to variable
and waning intervention adherence. One strategy to improve intervention adherence and weight loss is to
provide small monetary incentives for behaviors such as calorie logging or outcomes such as interim weight
loss. Current intervention structures are uniform, providing the same incentive timing and amount to all people.
Thus, some receive incentives even though they do not need them, while others do not receive enough
incentives to change their behavior. This uniform structure taxes limited budgets available for incentives. There
is an urgent need for a precision medicine approach that distributes incentives to people who respond to them.
To address this need, we apply reinforcement learning, a machine learning method, to create a precision
medicine intervention whereby each participant receives an individualized sequence of incentives to increase
the probability they achieve clinically significant weight loss. This novel approach takes data from cellular
scales and a dietary logging application to inform the prediction of participant behavior in response to incentive
amount. Using data from a previous incentives trial, we developed an algorithm with high predictive accuracy. We
plan to conduct a future randomized trial comparing the efficacy of this precision approach to a uniform approach on
weight loss. To prepare for the future trial, we will conduct a planning study with three aims: 1) Develop a digital
health platform to incorporate an existing commercial mathematical optimization modeling software for
prescriptive analytics to implement our algorithm. The platform will provide real-time analytics and deliver a
weekly incentive based on past behavior. We will develop a manual of procedures for detecting and resolving
errors for real-time data capture and processing.
2) Evaluate the feasibility of applying the algorithm
prospectively in a clinical trial. We will enroll two successive cohorts of adults with obesity in a single-arm
feasibility study and implement the personalized incentives intervention over six months. We will establish
logistical feasibility of executing the protocol and provide estimates of screening-to-enrollment, retention, and
incentives intervention response rates.
3) Characterize participant intervention acceptability as indicated by
intervention adherence rates, safety criteria, and feedback from qualitative interviews. Our findings will be used
to support a future, adequately powered randomized trial. If efficacious, our personalized intervention could
maximize return on investment for healthcare payers by optimally distributing a preset budget across a
population to maximize long-term, population-level weight loss in real-world settings."

We are pursuing the first anti-tumor small molecules that act specifically against human Sonic Hh protein
autoprocessing, a unique biosynthetic event that is necessary to drive oncogenic hedgehog (Hh) ligand
dependent cell/cell signaling. Sonic Hh protein autoprocessing involves a precursor form of Hh and is
responsible for liberating the mature Sonic Hh signaling ligand while also modifying the ligand’s terminal
carboxyl group with cholesterol. The long-standing challenge has been to discover small molecules that
specifically antagonize this key reaction within the tumor cell. To facilitate discovery, we have devised the
first in-cell assay system to screen for antagonists of human Hh autoprocessing at high throughput. Our
assay couples intracellular Sonic Hh autoprocessing to the extracellular secretion of a bioluminescent
reporter enzyme. We recently miniaturized this assay for 1536-well plates and in preliminary work,
completed a successful pilot screen against LOPAC. Here we propose a two-year high risk/gain strategy
that integrates: (AIM 1) In-cell quantitative high throughput screening in collaboration with the National
Center for Advancing Translational Science (NCATS) to discover the first bioactive drug-like antagonists
of human Sonic Hh autoprocessing; (AIM 2) Pre-clinical evaluation of the anti-tumor effects of those novel
Hh autoprocessing inhibitors toward human multiple myeloma and human colon cancer cells, which exhibit
Hh-ligand dependent growth. We hypothesize that specific antagonists of Sonic Hh autoprocessing will
deplete extracellular Sonic Hh ligand. Tumor apoptosis is the expected result of this ligand deprivation
strategy. In summary, using an innovative assay and novel anti-Hh approach, we are poised to address a
significant gap in the field of Hh signaling while pursuing a new class of cancer therapeutics."

Maintaining protein homeostasis– the delicate balance between protein synthesis, folding, and degradation–
is essential for cellular health. Over a third of the cellular proteome and most membrane proteins are inserted
into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to become resident in this organelle or to enter into the secretory pathway.
Quality control (QC) mechanisms constantly monitor the proteome across secretory compartments– such as the
ER and Golgi apparatus– and promptly recognize and degrade misfolded proteins. But within each compartment,
the mechanisms by which QC machineries detect misfolded substrates for degradation remain unknown.
Whether the mechanistic principles for substrate recognition are shared across compartments also remains an
unanswered question. In the ER, when a protein cannot reach its native folded state, it is retro-translocated into
the cytosol, polyubiquitinated, and degraded by the proteasome, a pathway termed ER-associated degradation
(ERAD). Degradation of membrane-spanning proteins (ERAD-M) is mediated by the ubiquitin ligase Hrd1 but
how substrates are recognized by Hrd1 inside the membrane is not well understood. In Aim 1 (K99), I will test
the hypothesis that Hrd1 locally thins the membrane to trap and select substrates for degradation. This model would
explain how Hrd1 can recognize a broad range of substrates that expose diverse hydrophilic residues to the
membrane – a hallmark of ERAD-M. The Hrd1 complex can also handle misfolded proteins in the ER lumen (ERAD-
L). During ERAD-L, the substrate completely traverses the ER membrane from lumen to the cytosol, but how
Hrd1 mediates this process is unclear. I will address this question in Aim 2 (K99) by “trapping” the substrate on
Hrd1 as it crosses the ER membrane and by visualizing the complex using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM).
This work will clarify important biological questions as ERAD exemplifies a unique protein translocation
mechanism that functions without the use of a signal sequence and a well-defined transmembrane channel.
Next, in the independent phase (Aim 3, R00), I will focus on the Tul1 ubiquitin ligase residing in Golgi membranes
and I will elucidate how it recognizes and handles its substrates. I will test the hypothesis that Tul1, like Hrd1,
thins the membrane to specifically recognize and select membrane-spanning substrates. I will address these
questions using expertise gained in the mentored phase, by visualizing the Tul1 complex in vitro by cryo-EM and
by employing novel degradation assays in cells. With continued guidance of my mentor Dr Tom Rapoport, the
Advisory Committee that will provide support in key aspects of my training, and the exceptional resources
provided by the Harvard Medical School, I am well positioned to successfully finish this work. The experience I
acquire during this award will fully equip me for career independence, where I will employ my skillsets to elucidate
the mechanistic principles of protein quality control in diverse cellular compartments."
10864411,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive cancer that has a poor prognosis and limited
treatment due to the high propensity for metastatic progression and absence of specific targeted treatments.
Although the immune checkpoint inhibition represents a breakthrough in the treatment of diverse cancers, the
response rate to PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody remains only at about 4.8%-26% in TNBC patients. A daunting
challenge for improving efficacy of immunotherapy such as PD1 antibody therapy is how to turn suppressed
CD8+ T cells to activated cells after the checkpoint-imposed brake is removed. Our lab and others have shown
that persistent STAT3 activation is critical for suppression of antitumor immunity. Our recent studies
demonstrated that PD-1-ligation on CD8+ T cells activates STAT3 to upregulate CPT1B/fatty acid oxidation (FAO)
while inhibiting glycolysis/IFNγ and CD8+ T cells antitumor effector. However, the compromised antitumor effects
of CD8 TEFF cells are heavily impacted by suppressive immune cells including CD5+ B cells. We reported that
cancer-promoting role of B cells depends on CD5-induced STAT3 activation. In addition to CD5+ B cells, in our
pilot study performed under 1R21CA241283, we found that CD5 and PD-1 are co-expressed highly on mouse
breast cancer T cells, which increased STAT3 activity in tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells to suppress T cell anti-
tumor function through regulating FAO/glycolysis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that targeting CD5 on T and B
cells enhanced the anti-tumor effect of PD-1 blockade in PyMT mouse model of breast cancer. However, how to
turn up glycolysis and stimulate IFNγ expression in TEFF cells to improve the efficacy of antitumor immune therapy
in breast cancer patients remains elusive. Guided by our preliminary data, we hypothesize that (i) CD5/PD-1-
induced STAT3 activation in T cells inhibits the antitumor immune responses of CD8+ T cells and counteracts
PD-1 antibody therapy by promoting FAO and inhibiting glycolysis in breast cancer patients. (ii) effectively
inhibiting STAT3/FAO in tumor-associated T cells, which can be achieved by blocking CD5, will “fuel” tumor
infiltrating CD8+ T cells to meaningfully improve the antitumor efficacy of PD-1 blockade. We will accomplish our
overall objective by pursuing the following specific aims: Aim 1: To assess whether CD5/PD-1-STAT3 axis-
regulated FAO and glycolysis metabolism in T cells from patient breast tumor samples is associated with CD8+
TEFF cell exhaustion and failure to benefit from PD-1-directed therapy. Aim 2: To assess the antitumor effect and
mechanisms through which CD5 and PD-1 antibodies alters T cell metabolism to enhance CD8 TEFF activity in
patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTOs) and mice bearing patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) with autologous
T cells or human immune system. Together, these studies will provide new mechanistic insights and key
preclinical evidence of therapeutic resistance to PD-1 blockade, and will identify novel therapeutic strategy for
overcoming resistance to PD-1 blockade and extend the benefits of PD-1 blockade therapy for TNBC patients."

Tuberculosis (TB) continues as a global pandemic and remains the leading cause of death by infection
worldwide. The rise of multi-drug resistant forms of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) highlights the need to
develop novel anti-TB therapeutics. A promising drug target is the essential enzyme Cytochrome P450 21A1
(CYP121) of Mtb, which catalyzes a phenol-coupling reaction to convert dicyclotyrosine (cYY) into the cyclical
compound mycocyclosin. Since attempts to delete the CYP121 gene result in non-viable bacteria, various drug
design efforts have focused on the development of competitive active site inhibitors of the enzyme. CYP inhibition
typically involves the use of a nitrogen heterocycle that forms a coordinate covalent bond with the heme iron.
However, given the high degree of structural homology within the CYP superfamily, theoretical competitive
inhibition of CYP121 carries significant risks due to the potential for non-specific inhibition of drug-metabolizing
CYPs like CYP3A4. Patients undergoing treatment for TB are subjected to a rigorous regiment of medications
like rifampicin and isoniazid, among others, some of which are already competitive inhibitors of drug metabolizing
CYPs. In the current proposal, the development of non-competitive inhibition of CYP121 is proposed. The
enzyme displays the unusual feature of relying on a distal-to-distal homodimer interface for its function. Notably,
this particular interface does not occur in mammalian CYPs. Specific Aim 1 centers on the use of a cleavable
fusion of the CYP121 homodimer in combination with enzyme kinetics, 19F-NMR, and loss of function mutations
to test the hypothesis of monomer-to-monomer cross-talk across the dimer interface. In Aim 2, virtual drug
screening will be used to develop potential pharmacophores located near the dimer interface. The short-term
goal of this work is to lay the foundation for a robust investigation of candidate small-molecule binding sites on
the protein surface that inhibit without binding the active site; the long-term goal is to develop novel classes of
non-competitive CYP121 inhibitors that avoid the potential for drug-drug interactions in patients being treated for
TB."

 Environmental contaminant exposure accounts for 20-30% of the known congenital heart disease and is
a significant driver of adult heart disease. Likewise, exposure to environmental contamination also adversely
affects ovarian health and is thought to be a significant factor in the global rise of infertility rates. Cardiac health
is impacted by ovarian health and vice versa. While the heart supplies the ovary with necessary oxygen, the
ovary produces estrogen, which is cardioprotective. 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) exposure is
associated with both cardiac and ovarian dysfunction. However, the effects of TCDD exposure on organ health
are often studied in isolation and, therefore, the interaction between the two systems is lost. This proposal
investigates the central hypothesis that juvenile TCDD exposure affects female heart health by compromising
ovarian function. There is a critical need to understand the mediators of TCDD toxicity in both the heart and
ovary to provide effective treatment for heart disease and infertility. In Aim 1, I will determine the ovarian
contribution to TCDD-induced cardiovascular toxicity. In Aim 2, I will use single-cell sequencing to identify unique
and shared cellular and molecular targets of TCDD in the heart and ovary. In Aim 3, I will determine whether
TCDD-induced infertility results from disrupted functioning of the blood-follicle barrier.
 My long-term goal is to become an independent investigator at an R1 institution studying reproductive

10880273,"Mechanisms of diabetic amyloid formation via 2D IR spectroscopy
Abstract
 Type 2 diabetes afflicts nearly 26 million Americans and causes a larger economic loss than all cancers
combined. It starts as insulin resistance, but ultimately the pancreatic β-cells that make insulin fail, resulting in
overt diabetes. Failure is partially due to aggregation of the hormone known as the human islet amyloid
polypeptide (hIAPP or amylin) into amyloid plaques that occupy up to 80% of the islet space. Surprisingly, the
amyloid fibers themselves are not cytotoxic. Many researchers believe that the toxic species are oligomers of
hIAPP, perhaps by interfering with receptor mediated processes or permeabilizing the membrane. As a result,
there is much interest in understanding the mechanism by which hIAPP aggregates, because the aggregation
pathway dictates the structures and populations of these cytotoxic intermediates. The first cryoEM structure of
amylin was recently reported, but very little structural information exists about intermediates because applying
most structural biology tools to kinetically evolving proteins is difficult. We discovered an oligomeric species by
monitoring the aggregation kinetics of hIAPP using a technology that we invented, on-the-fly 2D IR spectroscopy.
In doing so, we discovered that hIAPP forms oligomers with a parallel β-sheet in the FGAIL region, prior to
restructuring into its fibrillar structure. The need to restructure results in a prolonged lifetime and stable population
of the oligomers. We observed this “FGAIL oligomer” in 4 different mammalian species known to contract type 2
diabetes, strengthening our hypothesis that this intermediate is a key player in the disease. Most importantly, we
realized that we could trap the oligomer with a few benignly placed mutations. Our trapped oligomers are nearly
as toxic as wild-type hIAPP, but persist in vitro for days rather than hours. Because it is stable for so long, it
enables many new structural, biochemical, and physiological assays not previously possible. And, it provides an
intellectual basis to create a new knock-in mouse to investigate hIAPP oligomers in an animal model. With that
goal in mind, we have begun working with humanized mice and developed the technology to image pancreas
tissues with 2D IR microscopy. Specific Aim 1 will generate a series of trapped oligomers, each of which will be
tested for its suitability as a model for hIAPP oligomers. Specific Aim 2 will investigate the aggregation pathway
that leads to a recently reported cryoEM structure to determine if this polymorph is formed from a new or existing
mechanistic pathway. In Aim 3, we link our in vitro observations to in vivo physiology via 2D IR imaging of two
transgenic mouse models. We seek to understand hIAPP aggregation from a fundamental perspective, which is
important for inhibitor design and hormone replacement therapies, and utilize that information to translate our in
vitro work into in vivo animal models. The information that we provide via mechanisms, and now tissue imaging,
is currently not possible with any other technique."
10880277,"The major goal of the project is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac microvascular fatty
acid transport dysfunctions and its involvement in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) under
diabetic conditions. Diabetes mellitus, one of the major leading chronic morbidities worldwide, is continually
increasing with a high prevalence in the United States and throughout the world. Cardiovascular complications
are mainly responsible for the high morbidity and mortality in people with diabetes. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one
of key risk factors for the development of HFpEF, and the prevalence of HFpEF is rising in parallel with global
surging of T2D. However, the molecular mechanisms linking diabetes to HFpEF are poorly understood, and
currently there are no effective treatments available for HFpEF. Endothelium, a cell layer lining of blood vessels,
is an independent organ that functions as a barrier for the nutrient shuttling. The neglected role of endothelium
in controlling the metabolic homeostasis is beginning to evolve. However, the role of coronary microvascular
endothelial fatty acid shuttling in diabetic heart and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Sirtuin
6 (SIRT6), a well-recognized longevity gene, regulates genome stabilization, DNA repair, inflammation and
metabolic homoeostasis. SIRT6 is a histone deacetylase that targets the acetylation of histone 3 lysine 9, an
epigenetic marker for active gene transcription. Recent studies indicate that SIRT6 deficiency is associated with
metabolic disease, and SIRT6 has been proposed as a potential therapeutic candidate fighting the metabolic
syndrome epidemic. In parallel, emerging evidence from our group suggests that SIRT6 plays a crucial role in
regulation of cardiac endothelial homeostasis. Specifically, we have recently found that SIRT6 modulates
coronary microvascular endothelial fatty acid transport and cardiac lipid metabolism under the nondiabetic and
diabetic conditions, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of T2D-induced HFpEF. As such we propose that an
alternation of SIRT6 expression and function in coronary microvascular endothelial cells under diabetic
conditions could cause cardiac microvascular endothelial fatty acid transport abnormality and cardiac metabolic
disarrangement, which may cause diabetes-associated diastolic dysfunction. We will use the combination of in
vitro and in vivo experiments to test this novel hypothesis. Results from proposed studies would help to
understand molecular basis of endothelial FA transport, and facilitate the development of new therapeutic
approaches, such as enhancing SIRT6 expression and activity, to limit diabetes-associated HFpEF, a deadly
disease without any effective therapy."
10880400,"Proposal Abstract
Methionine adenosyltransferase 2 alpha (MAT2A) and protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) are
cancer targets that are synthetically lethal with MTAP deletions and have several drug candidates in clinical
trials targeting MTAP-/- cancers. MTAP is deleted in ~15% of human cancers and encodes the metabolic
enzyme 5’-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, the sole enzyme in humans responsible for recycling of
methylthioadenosine (MTA) to methionine. MAT2A synthesizes S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), the methyl
donor substrate for methyltransferase reactions. PRMT5 utilizes SAM as a substrate and is inhibited by MTA,
and MTAP-/- cells in culture demonstrate elevated MTA levels. In vivo observations of glioblastoma tumors
suggest however, that MTAP-/- does not always lead to increased tumoral MTA levels due to MTA efflux into
matrix MTAP-competent cells. Additionally, MTAP deletions are a rare (~2%) occurrence in colorectal cancers
(CRCs), precluding MAT2A and PRMT5 inhibitors’ use for most CRCs. The Schramm laboratory has
previously solved the transition state (TS) structure of MTAP and synthesized a potent small molecule inhibitor
methylthio-DADMe-immucillin-A (MTDIA) that recapitulates the in vitro effects of MTA accumulation within
tissues. MTDIA has been shown to inhibit tumor growth in several cancer models, including CRC, and is linked
to a decrease in PRMT5 activity through elevation of MTA levels. We propose that MTDIA be used in
combination with MAT2A inhibitor AG-270, currently in Phase I clinical trials, to harness their synthetic lethality
by targeting PRMT5. We will test the safety, target engagement, and anti-cancer efficacy of MTDIA in
combination with AG-270 in ApcMin/+ and CRC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mice. To determine
mechanisms of anti-cancer effects, we will probe the upstream and downstream effects related to PRMT5
activity. We will perform tumor metabolomic quantification of relevant metabolites and histone and protein-
arginine methylation characterization using immunohistochemistry and proteomic techniques. We will also
profile the gene expression changes using single-cell RNA sequencing to determine how combination therapy
alters tumor architecture and growth. Finally, we will solve the transition state structure of PRMT5 with the goal
of laying the foundations for development of novel transition state analogue inhibitors. This work will expand
upon the use of MAT2A and PRMT5 inhibitors beyond the ~15% of MTAP-deleted cancers and provide
avenues for MTDIA to be used in clinical trials."
10870114,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Poor sperm quantity and quality are major causes of male infertility, affecting ~7% of men worldwide. Male fertility
depends on the conversion of diploid germ cells (spermatogonia) into haploid spermatozoa (sperm). Meiotic
initiation, a defining step in this process, revolves around the transition from mitotic to meiotic cell cycles and
entails activation of meiotic genes required for the chromosomal events of meiosis prophase I. To date, a best
characterized gatekeeper of meiotic initiation in mammals is stimulated by retinoic acid gene 8 (Stra8), in that
Stra8P–/–P germ cells fail to express a subset of meiotic genes and do not enter meiosis. Our recent work indicates
a novel molecular role of STRA8 as a suppressor of autophagy, suggesting a novel link between meiotic initiation
and autophagy, a protein and cellular organelle degradation process. Based on this information, we hypothesize
that STRA8-mediated suppression of autophagy allows accumulation of proteins required for meiotic gene
activation and initiation; in the absence of STRA8, these proteins are degraded by autophagy, precluding meiosis.
To test our hypothesis, we will: 1) investigate the role of autophagy in STRA8-mediated meiotic initiation. 2)
define the molecular links between autophagy and meiotic initiation. Together, our study will establish autophagy
as a yet unrecognized regulator of meiotic initiation and uncover autophagy-sensitive proteins that serve as
essential molecular steps during this process in mammals. By developing a better understanding of autophagy
as a barrier to meiotic induction, our study will offer a significant technical advancement for in vitro gamete
production. Ultimately, translation of our study may identify novel therapeutic targets in the autophagy pathway
for male infertility or contraception treatment."
10868028,"The neuronal protein alpha-synuclein (αS) plays a key role in the group of neurodegenerative diseases known
as synucleinopathies: Parkinson disease (PD), Parkinson disease dementia (PDD), and Dementia with Lewy
bodies (DLB). The prevalence and associated societal and personal burdens of these disorders is increasing
rapidly, yet no disease modifying treatment exists. Thus, new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Prior
work of the PI has shown that targeting palmitoylation may be such a strategy. Palmitoylation is the post-
translational modification of proteins by fatty acids, usually palmitate. Palmitoylation plays a key role in protein
and vesicle trafficking. While αS itself is not palmitoylated, under pathologic conditions it disrupts trafficking.
Thus, palmitoylation facilitates normal trafficking, while disease-associated αS disrupts it. In accord, the PI has
found that enhancing palmitoylation by inhibiting the depalmitoylase acyl protein thioesterase-1 (APT1), which
increases palmitoylation of its unknown brain substrate(s), ameliorates multiple measures of αS cytopathology
including toxicity and inclusions. Further, treating genetically modified PD/DLB model mice with a
pharmacologic APT1 inhibitor, ML348, improves their motor and dementia-like symptoms on validated
measures such as the rotarod, pole climbing, Y-maze, and Morris water maze tests. While compelling, in the
context of clinical translation these results are incomplete: the brain substrates of APT1 are unknown, and this
is a major obstacle to developing palmitoylation-based treatments for PD/DLB. In particular, information on the
APT1 substrate(s) responsible for these benefits can 1) ensure specificity of any potential drug by targeting
individual pathways and 2) uncover new palmitoylation-based therapeutic targets. Furthermore, it is not known
how αS itself may alter palmitoylation profiles (the “palmitoylome”) in the brain. This information would provide
insight into whether APT1 inhibition corrects an underlying αS-dependent change in palmitoylation, or
compensates via a separate pathway. Our Aims address each of these questions and together represent a
crucial step in the pre-clinical assessment of palmitoylation as a therapeutic strategy for PD/DLB, using both
physiologic and cellular approaches. In Aim 1, we identify physiologic APT1 substrates by isolating the
palmitoylome in rat and human iPSC derived neurons with and without APT1 inhibition. We then validate the
effect of potential substrates on αS pathology by assessing for somatic and synaptic trafficking defects. In Aim
2, we compare the brain palmitoylomes of wild type versus mutant αS transgenic PD/DLB model mice to
evaluate for potential αS-dependent changes in palmitoylation. As in Aim 1, we then validate the role of this
second set of proteins in synucleinopathy trafficking defects. Together, our Aims address important questions
crucial to the development of palmitoylation-based therapeutics for PD/DLB while providing new leads for
mechanistic insights into the intersection of palmitoylation and αS pathophysiology. To that end, they pursue
research priorities pertaining to the Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (ADRD), specifically PDD and DLB."

The intestinal protozoan pathogen Giardia lamblia causes considerable morbidity and mortality on a global scale.
This parasite inflicts a disproportionate burden on the young, especially in resource limited countries.
Furthermore, treatment options are limited, and drug resistance is building, setting the stage for even greater
human suffering due to infections caused by G. lamblia. Unfortunately, there is currently little hope to reverse
this impending threat due to a lack of effective drugs in the drug development pipelines. Our team will address
this urgent need through the establishment of a robust natural-products-focused testing initiative aimed at the
identification and development of new chemical matter capable of controlling these intestinal protozoan
pathogens. The proposed research takes steps toward realizing the goal of developing new antiparasitic
therapeutics for treating G. lamblia infections through a systematic approach outlined in our three research aims:
1) Investigate a library of crude fungi extracts for selective inhibitors of G. lamblia, 2) Use bioassay-guided
fractionation to purify bioactive chemical constituents of crude fungal extracts that have antigiardia activities, and
3) Evaluate the biological activities of the purified compounds against G. lamblia trophozoites to determine in
vitro and in vivo activity profiles. Such efforts would have a significant benefit to those infected or at risk of
infection by G. lamblia as new therapeutic options are desperately needed, especially for those living in resource-
poor regions where the moderate-to-severe diarrhea caused by infections leads to stunted growth, neurological
defects, malnourishment, and death. Our approach will focus on the application of natural products derived from
biologically diverse fungi, which is an underutilized resource as it applies to infections caused by intestinal
protozoans. A combination of pre-purified natural products and extracts from a large citizen-science-centered
fungal collection will provide thousands of samples needed for bioassay investigations. Bioassay-guided
purification processes coupled with advanced LC-MS dereplication strategies, MS, NMR, and other
spectroscopic tools will be used to propel studies of the fungal-derived compounds toward the identification of
promising therapeutic scaffolds. The early incorporation of in vivo mouse models of PK and efficacy will serve to
greatly accelerate the investigative process to reveal promising bioactive chemical matter, which will become
the subjects of further biological and early-stage preclinical investigations. Our team, which brings together
expertise in neglected infectious diseases drug development (University of Washington) and natural products
chemistry (University of Oklahoma), offers an exciting opportunity to uncover new therapeutic leads that will
become the subjects of future, focused development efforts aimed at providing the drugs needed to protect those
at risk of suffering from these debilitating and deadly parasitic infections."
10869977,"Project Summary
The laboratory led by PI Galia Debelouchina has the following objectives: 1) The development of structural
biology methodology to study complex and dynamic biological assemblies in vitro, and 2) The extension of
these methodologies for structural biology investigations in the cellular environment. Our methodology
development combines solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy with state-of-the-art
chemical biology tools for the comprehensive description of biological systems both in vitro and in cells. We
use these technologies to investigate chromatin, a complex protein-DNA polymer responsible for the
packaging of genetic information in the nucleus. Over the next five years, we plan to focus on the following
projects: 1) The influence of protein post-translational modifications on chromatin structure and dynamics.
Modifications such as methylation and acetylation have profound effects on the compaction of the chromatin
polymer and the accessibility of the packaged DNA. We plan to investigate the molecular mechanisms of
chromatin compaction and decompaction imparted by these modifications at atomic resolution using solid-state
NMR spectroscopy. We expect that this study will provide unique insights into the biophysical properties of the
chromatin polymer and how they can be translated into functional biological outputs. 2) The molecular basis of
heterochromatin formation. Heterochromatin compartments are associated with gene silencing and repetitive
DNA sequences, and their formation is a vital step in cell differentiation and development. Recent hypotheses
indicate that they are formed through liquid-liquid phase separation. We plan to investigate the interactions that
promote phase separation and to provide the first molecular description of this process. 3) Development of
NMR-based tools for structural biology in cells. Here, we plan to focus on the design and implementation of a
strategy to target a specific protein in the cellular milieu and to increase its NMR signals selectively over the
cellular background. Ultimately, we aim to develop a selective and sensitive NMR methodology that will allow
us to record relevant structural data of endogenous amounts of cellular proteins. Such tools will provide the
unprecedented opportunity to build an atomic resolution picture of the cellular milieu and to investigate
changes in protein structure and dynamics as we stress, age or treat cells with therapeutic agents."
10869982,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) infections are a major public health concern due to the global emergence
and spread of multi-drug resistant NG. Pharyngeal NG (pNG) infections, which are primarily
asymptomatic, are a major source of sustained gonorrhea transmission and may play an important role
in the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in NG as resident oropharyngeal commensal
Neisseria species (CNspp) can serve as a reservoir for AMR, which can be easily acquired by NG through
gene transfer. Despite the importance of pNG infections, there is limited knowledge on the epidemiology
of antimicrobial-resistant pNG and a lack of diagnostics to characterize AMR in pNG. This Mentored
Research Scientist Career Development (K01) proposal will fill critical gaps in knowledge in our current
understanding of pNG infections while allowing the candidate to enhance his skillset through research,
training, and mentoring. The specific training foci of this K01 application include: 1) to gain research skills
in epidemiological studies; 2) to obtain expertise in quantitative statistical analysis through the
triangulation of clinical, microbiological, genomic, and behavioral data; 3) to acquire training in genome
analysis and bioinformatics; and 4) to develop additional professional skills for a successful academic
research career. To address the gap in knowledge in pNG infections, the candidate's proposed K01
research involves an epidemiological study in collaboration with the Enhanced Gonococcal Antimicrobial
Surveillance Program (EGASP) in Kampala, Uganda, where the epidemiology of antimicrobial-resistant
pNG infections has not been previously defined. This study will: 1) recruit EGASP participants with
urethritis at high risk for pNG, 2) collect pharyngeal samples, clinical, demographic, and behavioral data
to 3) define AMR in pNG in comparison to urethral NG (uNG), 4) identify predictors of pNG infections and
antimicrobial-resistant pNG in a low-income country (Aim 1), 5) compare the genomic epidemiology of
AMR in pNG and uNG, and, 6) describe the type and frequency of AMR determinants and AMR mosaic
alleles (Aim 2). This project will also test whether a single-cell microfluidic platform could be adapted for
the characterization of the emergence of AMR in NG and improved detection of AMR in pNG (Aim 3).
The objectives of this K01 research project and training goals will be achieved through guidance from a
team of experienced mentors with outstanding track records in basic and translational research and with
complementary areas of expertise. The K01 award will provide the candidate with the necessary training
and mentoring to become an independent investigator in STI translational research."
10869985,"Project Summary / Abstract
The primary purpose of this K24 renewal proposal is to support mentorship by Dr. Lockman of early career
investigators from the US and Africa in conducting global patient-oriented research. This next generation of
investigators will need to tackle ongoing global infectious disease epidemics (such HIV, COVID-19,
tuberculosis, malaria, and antimicrobial resistance) and to respond rapidly to future emerging pandemics and
pathogens. Effective mentorship of early career investigators to conduct clinical research in resource-
constrained settings requires substantial time and effort by experienced mentors, and the need for such
mentors exceeds their availability. The initial K24 project period permitted Dr. Lockman to successfully mentor
more than 20 early career investigators (half of them from Africa) to lead clinical research projects, many of
whom were able to quickly respond to the severe COVID-19 epidemic in Botswana because of prior training.
This K24 grant also allowed Dr. Lockman to gain additional skills in designing and conducting patient-oriented
research in resource-constrained settings with a focus on HIV (particularly in pregnancy) and COVID-19.
Currently, nearly one in five adults in many sub-Saharan African countries is living with HIV; the impact of HIV
co-infection on COVID-19 clinical outcomes and on SARS-CoV-2 viral evolution in settings with both very high
HIV prevalence and high COVID incidence are unknown. In addition, the impact of widely used HIV
antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimens during pregnancy on birth outcomes and on long-term maternal and
child health and development are not well understood. The research aims of this project, which Dr. Lockman
will mentor early career investigators from Africa and the US to lead, include studies of the role of HIV co-
infection in several aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Botswana -- specifically, the impact of HIV infection on
long COVID and on the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 mutations/variants, by SARS-CoV-2 vaccination status.
Additional mentored aims will evaluate the impact of different ART regimens during pregnancy on
cardiometabolic factors in women (specifically, pregnancy and postpartum weight gain, and markers of
diabetes and metabolic syndrome in pregnancy), and the association between these cardiometabolic factors
and pregnancy outcomes and child health/growth. Dr. Lockman’s mentees will use existing data and samples
for these aims, including from studies that she leads (multi-country IMPAACT 2010/VESTED randomized trial
of 3 ART regimens in pregnancy and a new R01-funded study of child developmental/behavioral outcomes
after in utero exposure to different maternal ART regimens in Botswana) and from stored clinical SARS-CoV-2
samples and related electronic routine health databases in Botswana. Dr. Lockman will also help her mentees
access a wealth of other existing data, resources, and co-mentors. The overarching goal of this K24 renewal
proposal is to help expand sustained capacity to conduct high-impact patient-oriented research in Africa by
supporting the mentorship and training of early career investigators."
10866379,"What? We will test the accuracy of an RNA-seq based biomarker assay to predict the diagnosis of stroke in a
minority population (African American). We will investigate the impact of sex and race on test accuracy, and
investigate novel sequencing approaches to speed up the time to obtain actionable results (Nanopores).
Why? When using the thrombolytic tPA, time is of the essence, as the drug must be administered within 3-4.5
hrs of stroke onset. The sooner with in this time window that tPA can be administered, the greater the benefit.
In addition, intracerebral hemorrhage must have been excluded by CT scanning; currently the sole method to
make this therapeutically critical determination. Delays in radiologist interpretation of CT results, or lack of
available imaging facilities is the most common reason for thrombolytic treatment not being initiated. . Thus
corroborative use of a highly sensitive blood test would permit ER physicians to be confident of their CT
interpretation in settings without onsite CT reading by a radiologist. Timely administration of tPA would thereby
be permitted reducing stroke burden. Accordingly, a rapid biomarker test to exclude hemorrhage in acute
stroke would reduce door to needle times, lower mortality, and improve outcome in stroke.
 Stroke burden is higher in African Americans and females, yet these populations have lower representation in
genomic research. We test the impact of sex and race by assessing test accuracy derived from a single sex or
race, and then tested in the opposite sex, or Caucasians. These experiments will determine whether mixed sex
or race derived tests are more accurate than those derived from a single population. Finally, we investigate
approaches to speed up testing using novel Nanopore sequencing technology.
How? Our studies of blood biomarkers, developed at Grady Memorial Hospital Marcus Stroke Center, offers a
diagnostic blood test that discriminates between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. We do not rely on single
biomarkers but rather use analysis of the entire transcriptome (all RNA) in venous blood, by the use of next
generation RNA sequencing. These data provide highly accurate stroke diagnosis, determine stroke subtype,
offer powerful prediction of outcome, and show differences and treatment response by sex. We hypothesize
transcriptome differences in peripheral blood can predict CT diagnosis of hemorrhagic vs. ischemic stroke. We
propose to recruit patients from the Grady memorial hospital, and obtain blood samples for RNA sequencing.
From this dataset we will test three specific aims: AIM ONE: Determine the accuracy of blood RNA profiles to
predict CT documented hemorrhagic stroke. AIM TWO: Determine the effect of sex and race on transcriptomic
profile accuracy. AIM THREE: Show the accuracy of rapid RNA measurement techniques to identify ischemic
brain hemorrhage profiles.
IMPACT: A rapid point of care blood test to diagnosis stroke and stroke subtype will increase the percentage of
the acute stroke population eligible for tPA therapy, significantly reducing stroke morbidity and mortality."
10866381,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Studying the circuit basis of fear in psychiatric disorders has relied on learned associations
between stimuli and threatening experiences. Stimuli which are innately threatening represent
an alternative approach to this problem, and may elicit different neural circuit mechanisms to
promote survival. The neurotransmitter norepinephrine serves an important role in threat
response, and recent studies have demonstrated the existence of multiple subtypes of
norepinephrine cells within the locus coeruleus (LC). The scientific objective of this project is to
determine how subtypes of norepinephrine neurons in LC contribute to the encoding of threat,
so that in the future we can develop improved therapies for trauma-related disorders based on
that knowledge.
Our specific aims employ fluorescent biosensors of norepinephrine, miniature head-mounted
microscopes for recording LC norepinephrine cells, optogenetics, and single cell
transcriptomics. In our preliminary data, we identify a computational framework in which to
consider the problem of learning from innate threat, then show the feasibility of these
approaches. By employing these methods, we can collectively identify the relationship between
norepinephrine cell-types and the encoding of threat at molecular, cellular, and circuit scales.
This will generate a parts list for future studies into the nature of threat processing.
In addition to the proposed studies, this proposal develops a plan to train Dr. Kaye for an
independent research career as a circuit psychiatrist. This plan is mentored by Dr. Alex Kwan,
an expert in optical approaches to neural circuit dissection and computational approaches to
behavior, with the co-mentorship of Dr. Kerry Ressler, an expert in the neurobiology of
posttraumatic stress disorder and Dr. Ronald Duman, an expert in the neurobiology of stress.
This proposal relies on additional training in transcriptomics from Dr. Nenad Sestan, in
optogenetics from Dr. Ralph DiLeone, and in the physiology of the norepinephrine system from
Dr. Gary Aston-Jones."
10866382,"Melanoma is a major world health problem with most deaths occurring due to metastatic
spread of the disease. Although genetic basis of melanoma formation has been well established
whether metastatic progression of melanoma is driven by genetic or epigenetic events remains
unclear. With a hypothesis that epigenetic events may be a key driving force for metastatic
progression, we performed an in vivo gain-of-function screen that identified 10 epigenetic
regulators as drivers of melanoma metastasis. In this proposal, we focus on one of the top hits -
UCHL5 - which is a deubiquitinase and a mammalian specific subunit of Ino80 chromatin
remodeling complex. Using in vitro and in vivo validation experiments, we have verified role of
UCHL5 in promoting melanoma invasion and metastasis. Importantly, our preliminary studies
show that UCHL5 involves its deubiquitinase activity as well as its association with Ino80 in
promotion of invasion. In addition, we find that UCHL5 may regulate important pro-metastatic
pathways such as RhoA-LIMK-Cofilin and SLIT-ROBO signaling via direct regulation of
ARHGAP29 and SLIT2 respectively. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to examine the
contribution of UCHL5 and its regulation of epigenome reprogramming in driving melanoma
metastasis. In the first aim, we propose to characterize UCHL5 mediated epigenome
reprogramming using human melanoma cultures in conjunction with animal models and cutting-
edge epigenomic technologies. We will assess dynamics of nucleosome position and
reprogramming of superenhancer elements by UCHL5 and assess contribution of Ino80 as well
as YAP1, which we have identified as a novel interactor of UCHL5. In the second aim, we will
study signaling events downstream of UCHL5 with a focus on ARHGAP29 mediated regulation
of RhoA-LIMK-Cofilin signaling and actin dynamics. In the third aim, we propose to examine
therapeutic utility of UCHL5 inhibition alone as well as in combination with current standard-of-
care melanoma therapies in pre-clinical transgenic animal models of metastatic melanoma.
Together, our proposal will not only provide new insights into the epigenetic mechanisms driving
melanoma metastasis but also provide proof-of-concept evidence for use of UCHL5 inhibitors as
a therapeutic strategy in metastatic melanoma."

 Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a severe neurological disorder with no proven treatment. There is
increasing evidence that inflammation contributes to ICH outcomes, but the underlying mechanisms remain
largely unknown. ICH disproportionately affects ethnic/racial minorities and young people. Our preliminary data
confirms reports that ICH survivors have a high rate of progressive cognitive decline, plausibly initiated by the
aggressive ICH inflammatory response. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles released from cells into the
circulating blood; by analyzing exosomes released from neurons and microglia, brain-specific inflammatory
pathophysiology can be assessed by testing circulating plasma. Exosomes transport microRNA (miRNA) that
are powerful regulators of gene expression. In our preliminary studies, three inflammatory mediators emerged
as particularly salient in post-ICH inflammation and promising for additional analysis in a larger study: monocytes,
interleukin-8 (IL-8), and miRNA (miR)-181a. We propose the CAPSTONE (Central And Peripheral STrOke
inflammatioN with Exosomes) study that will enroll 250 ICH subjects previously recruited into the ROSE-LAWN
study (Recovery of StrokE, Longitudinal Assessment With Neuroimaging, R01NS120493). CAPSTONE will
utilize plasma, peripheral blood, and functional/cognitive outcomes from ROSE-LAWN; serial plasma and blood
samples will be analyzed from baseline, three months, and 18 months after ICH.
 Through the following aims, we will pursue our overall goal to identify transcriptomic biomarkers associated
with six-month functional outcome and long-term progressive cognitive decline. Specific Aim 1 will determine
miRNA in neuronal- and microglial-derived exosomes that correlate with six-month functional outcome and long-
term progressive cognitive decline (~24 months after ICH). We hypothesize that decreased miR-181a in neuronal
and microglial exosomes will predict worse near-term functional outcome and greater long-term cognitive
decline. Specific Aim 2 will determine mRNA and miRNA in peripheral leukocytes that correlate with six-month
functional outcome and long-term progressive cognitive decline (~24 months after ICH). We hypothesize that
decreased miR-181a and increased CXCL8 and IL-8 will predict worse functional outcome and greater long-term
cognitive decline. Specific Aim 3 will explore the interactions between central and peripheral inflammatory
processes post-ICH. We hypothesize that decreased miR-181a in neuronal- and microglial-derived exosomes
will be associated with increased CXCL8 and IL-8 from peripheral leukocytes.
 Post-ICH inflammation is an interplay of both brain-derived and systemic pathology, but the associated
molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. By analyzing circulating blood (i.e., systemic) and cell-specific
exosomes in plasma (i.e., brain derived), CAPSTONE seeks to provide substantial insight regarding these
inflammatory processes. This research also addresses the NINDS priorities of recovery, imaging, and vascular
cognitive impairment."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of death due to cancer in the United
States and will become the 2nd leading cause of cancer-related death by 2030. PDAC is typically
diagnosed late in the disease process when therapeutic options are severely limited, resulting in an overall
survival time of <12 months post-diagnosis and a 5-year survival rate of <10%. Therefore, new drugs that
prevent PDAC primary and metastatic tumor growth are desperately needed.
PDAC tumor cells are extremely proliferative and thus have a high requisite demand for membrane lipids.
However, the PDAC tumor microenvironment is poorly vascularized, leading to hypoxia and limited nutrient
supply. Lipid synthesis is highly oxygen-consumptive, so neoplastic cells in a hypoxic environment are
challenged with meeting the demand for lipids. The sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)
transcription factors maintain cellular lipid supply by increasing synthesis and uptake of cholesterol, fatty
acids, and triglycerides. SREBPs are activated when lipid supply is low, and SREBP cleavage activating
protein (SCAP) is required for pathway activity. Thus, tumors should require SCAP to adapt to nutrient-
limiting conditions and supply lipid for membrane construction.
To date, the SREBP pathway has been implicated in the growth and progression of several cancers,
including colon, prostate, breast, and glioblastoma. However, the role of the SREBPs in PDAC has not been
examined. Using multiple human PDAC cell lines and mouse tumor models, we demonstrated that SCAP is
required for PDAC tumor development and growth, making SCAP a novel target for therapeutics.
Despite the established requirement for the SREBP pathway in multiple cancers, no potent chemical
inhibitor exists. To identify new candidate therapeutics, we developed a robust high throughput assay for
SCAP inhibitors. Here, we build on our preliminary studies to identify potent SCAP chemical inhibitors for
the treatment of pancreas cancer.
AIM 1. To identify candidate SCAP inhibitors by high throughput screening.
AIM 2. To validate SCAP inhibitors and conduct preliminary SAR studies.
The overall goal of these studies is to identify a series of potent, chemically tractable, validated compounds
that inhibit SCAP in at least two orthogonal assays with a dose-response over 100-fold concentration range.
Traditional approaches to target lipid metabolism in cancer have focused on inhibition of a single enzyme
required for cholesterol, isoprenoid or fatty acid synthesis. SREBPs directly regulate more than 30 genes of
lipid metabolism. Thus, inhibiting SCAP will coordinately block multiple synthesis and uptake pathways and
represents a novel approach to targeting lipid metabolism in cancer."
10866506,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
As congenital heart disease (CHD) survivors enter adulthood, they have a greater risk for developing acquired
cardiovascular complications (e.g., hypertension and coronary artery disease). These comorbidities are
amenable to lifestyle changes, such as increasing physical activity, yet adolescence and young adulthood are
when physical activity rates begin declining. The CHD Physical Activity Lifestyle intervention (CHD-PAL)
targets transition-age CHD survivors, using an engaging face-to-face videoconferencing format that this theory-
informed and tailored to the unique physiology and activity needs of each participant. The CHD-PAL
videoconferencing sessions address elements of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB; i.e., attitudes,
subjective norms, and perceived control for engaging in a behavior) and implements self-monitoring and goal-
setting techniques. The CHD-PAL feasibility/preliminary efficacy trials indicated that CHD-PAL is feasible for
AYAs and that CHD-PAL increases time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) as compared
to the control group for AYAs who engage in lower levels of physical activity. However, a larger trial is needed
to determine the impact of CHD-PAL on MVPA, purported mechanisms (i.e., elements of TPB), and health
outcomes among AYAs with CHD. The primary objective of the current study is to determine the impact of
CHD-PAL on change in MVPA among 144 AYAs (ages 15-25) with moderate and complex forms of CHD who
will be randomized to 1 of 2 arms: CHD-PAL or attention control (Control). CHD-PAL consists of a 20-week
videoconferencing-administered physical activity intervention (9, 20- to 30-minute sessions; Fitbit® to self-
monitor and set goals) with an interventionist (“coach”). Control participants will receive the same number and
frequency of contacts with a coach using the same modality to discuss using the Fitbit without addressing the
TPB hypothesized mechanisms or being directed to self-monitor or set goals. The primary study outcome is
change in MVPA as measured by an accelerometer. Change in the TPB hypothesized mechanisms will be
assessed as secondary outcomes and change in cardiorespiratory fitness (i.e., peak VO2 and METs) will be
explored. Our specific aims are to (1) determine the impact of CHD-PAL on change in MVPA and examine
effect durability, (2) explore change in the TPB mechanisms and their relevance to change MVPA, and (3)
explore the impact of CHD-PAL on change in cardiorespiratory fitness. The current study is the next step in an
iterative process to refine CHD-PAL before multisite assessment of longer-term health implications and cost
effectiveness of the intervention for AYAs with CHD in a clinical setting. Ultimately, this research has the
potential to improve cardiovascular outcomes for transition-aged CHD survivors, an understudied growing
population in need, as well as other pediatric chronic conditions with cardiopulmonary risk."

Understanding why disease progression in the majority of patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
occurs in contiguous anatomic regions over time is one of the fundamental limitations to designing disease
modifying therapies that can be utilized after a diagnosis.
 Several studies in ALS rodent models suggest that astrocytes play a role in disease propagation after
onset. However, astrocyte dysfunction is not an observation merely limited to ALS rodent models but,
importantly, has been one of the most consistent observations in humans with ALS when examined in situ as
well as using human cells in vitro.
 Astrocytes form a highly coupled intercellular network in the central nervous system (CNS) through gap
junctions (GJs) and hemichannels (HC) composed of 6 connexin subunits arranged around a central pore.
Connexins in astrocytes have key roles: homeostatic buffering, synchronization of astrocyte networks, metabolic
support for neurons, and regulation of vascular physiology. They can also propagate Ca2+ waves and modulate
synaptic events or release gliotransmitters, including glutamate and ATP, through hemichannels. Connexin 43
(Cx43) is the predominant connexin in astrocytes and is expressed ubiquitously in the CNS.
 Our recently published studies have demonstrated that astrocyte expression of Cx43 is increased in the
frontal cortex and spinal cords of ALS patients, an observation mirrored in the SOD1 mouse model of ALS. This
phenomenon is not merely a non-specific effect of reactive astrocytosis as we were also able to show, using in
vitro and in vivo mouse modeling, that SOD1 astrocyte-mediated motor neuron toxicity was, at least in part,
mediated through Cx43 hemichannels.
 This proposal builds upon these initial observations by using a fully humanized, spinal cord-specific, ALS
iPSC-astrocyte/motor neuron platform to investigate Cx43 HC localization at the hiPSC-astrocyte membrane,
examine mechanisms by which Cx43 HC opening is modulated in the context of ALS, and understand how this
affects Cx43 HC-mediated ALS hiPSC-astrocyte toxicity to motor neurons. Using newly reported specific
blockers of HC activity we will now be able to dissect the specific contributions of Cx43 HC to motor neuron
death. As we think about translational potential, we will test these Cx43 HC blockers that can penetrate the
blood brain barrier, are well tolerated and orally available, for efficacy in human iSPC-derived astrocyte mediated
MN toxicity platforms and in two ALS rodent models. What we learn from this proposal will allow us to develop
a systematic approach to ALS therapeutics that combines human tissue data with novel in vitro modeling, and
finally to in vivo translational applications."
10866560,"Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CP) is a major public health concern. A number of psychosocial treatments
have emerged in recent decades to help address this problem. These interventions have been shown to be
efficacious when compared to largely inert control conditions; however, recent meta-analyses indicate that
most of these treatments are characterized by modest effects on primary outcomes. This is a critical
shortcoming of these otherwise promising approaches. Rather than attempting to boost efficacy only by
developing new and hopefully more powerful interventions, we can also look within our already proven
treatments for ways to enhance the magnitude of treatment effects. One strategy is to increase our
understanding of treatment mediators. Studies of mediators are needed that directly compare different
treatments with each other to determine which mediators are treatment-specific, which are shared across
treatments, and which contribute the most to clinical outcomes. The findings from such research could be used
to inform adaptations to existing treatment that enhance their benefits. A second strategy for increasing the
beneficial effects of existing treatments is to identify the patient characteristics that moderate treatment
responses. Research is needed that is guided by theoretical models and that tests moderators across multiple
treatments. Identifying subgroups of patients more likely to respond to one or another treatment can advance
precision medicine by informing a priori patient-treatment matches that can optimize treatment effects. We will
compare the mechanisms and moderators of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and
Commitment Therapy (ACT), and Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy (EAET). Examining the
mediators and moderators of these treatments holds great potential for advancing treatment development and
enhancing treatment efficacy. Adults with chronic spinal (axial) pain (N=460) will be randomly assigned to CBT,
ACT, EAET and to treatment-as-usual (TAU). Aim 1 is to identify specific and shared mediators across
treatments. Aim 2 is to identify moderators across treatments. This project can increase the effects of our
psychosocial chronic pain treatments by identifying the most powerful treatment mechanisms – specific and
shared -- and revealing for whom the mediator  outcome pathways are strongest. Via increased
understanding of mediator and moderators, more effective pain treatment approaches can be developed,
tested, and implemented."
10869429,"Project Summary
Life is a complex and dynamics process that relies on intricate spatiotemporal interactions among molecules and
subcellular organelles within cells and multicellular organisms. Recent advances in light sheet fluorescence
microscopy (LSFM), have greatly expanded our capability to visualize, track and quantify these dynamic
interactions with high-resolution across all four dimensions (4D) of spacetime with minimum invasiveness and
photobleaching. Notable among the LSFM technologies is the lattice light sheet microscopy (LLSM), which
excels at 4D subcellular dynamics imaging with resolution, speed, and non-invasiveness superior to the widely
used confocal microscopy. However, the adoption of LSFM in biomedical research remains limited due to its
incompatibility with widely used sample holders such as multi-well plates or microfluidic chips. LSFM, when
operated in an inverted open-top configuration with two orthogonal high numerical aperture (NA) objectives,
experiences complex optical aberrations that severely degrade image quality. Significant efforts, including
specialized sample holder, single-objective architecture, and adaptive optics, have been devoted, but they are
either technically demanding or suffer from various performance drawbacks. A compact, high-performance, cost-
effective, and user-friendly LSFM system that suits the widely used sample holders has yet to be developed.
This proposal aims to address this crucial incompatibility between LSFM and high-throughput imaging by
leveraging recent advances in optical metasurfaces. These microfabricated 2D metasurfaces consisting of
nanoscale plasmonic arrays with subwavelength periodicity are capable of shaping light with an unprecedented
level of complexity and precision. We will develop an inverted open-top LLSM system with integrated optical
metasurfaces that is compatible with conventional high-throughput sample holders for imaging of molecular and
subcellular dynamics within live cells and multicellular organisms. In addition, we will create an open-source
computational pipeline to facilitate the design and fabrication of optical metasurfaces for user-defined open-top
LSFM configurations. Our proposed system will provide a compact, cost-effective, and high-performance solution
to overcome the limitations of existing LSFM systems, enabling biomedical researchers to visualize subcellular
dynamics in a high-throughput and noninvasive manner. To validate the effectiveness and applicability of our
system, we will demonstrate its performance through high-content molecular dynamic mapping of chimeric
antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells and organelle profiling of zebrafish development. While the implementation of
our metasurface-integrated open-top LSFM is on LLSM, the metasurface design pipeline and integration protocol
can be readily adapted and extended to a wide range of existing LSFM systems. By combining the power of
LSFM with metasurfaces, our proposed technology will provide an accessible and high-performance solution for
high-resolution 4D imaging of physiological and pathological processes within live cells and organisms."

 Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) incidence and mortality rates are higher among African Americans (AA)
than other racial or ethnic groups. A lower prevalence of lung-cancer-related genetic mutations in AA indicates
that studying transcription factors is a new promising direction.
 We have identified differentially expressed pfeRNAs by profiling 120 clinical specimens from 72 patients,
including 12 specimens from 12 AA and 108 specimens from 60 Caucasians and Asians using small non-
coding RNA deep sequencing followed by bioinformatic and biostatistics analyses, and all these patients with
either benign or malignant pulmonary nodules. We identified a pfeRNA that was only expressed in AA but
undetectable in either Caucasians or Asians, suggesting that this pfeRNA is an AA-specific pfeRNA (AA-
pfeRNA). The use of AA, Caucasians, and Asians gives us direct evidence that AA-pfeRNA is a potential factor
in health disparities in NSCLC. The use of patients’ benign and malignant pulmonary nodules provides a
perfect model for understanding lung preneoplasia malignant progression, and the AA-pfeRNA we identified is
specifically induced endogenously once lung preneoplasia progresses to NSCLC in AA, giving direct evidence
for AA-pfeRNA as a therapeutic target to inhibit the evolution of lung preneoplasia to NSCLC. Importantly, we
identified AA-pfeRNA following the requirements of the clinical laboratory improvement amendments (CLIA)
compliant a laboratory developed test (LDT) assay, providing evidence for translational development. Further,
its high expression predicted worse overall survival of AA with NSCLC. To prevent AA-pfeRNA function and
disrupt NSCLC development, we have designed oligos complementary to AA-pfeRNA (cAA-pfeRNA) and
optimized modifications and conjugates to deliver pfeRNA to NSCLC and limit accumulation in normal tissues.
 Therefore, in this project, we will provide mechanistic rationale and therapeutic insights into the druggable
AA-pfeRNA: (1) Identify the target protein in cancerous tissues from AA with stage-I/II NSCLC, confirm their
interaction pattern and cellular distribution in both cancerous tissues and cells, and observe its effects on the
basic biological activities of cells with and without the target protein; and (2) evaluate the efficacy, safety, and
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships of ligated-cAA-pfeRNA-2’-MOE-PTO by systemic delivery in
preclinical animal models.
 Our optimized specific & natural pfeRNA-based targeting system will provide a new treatment opportunity for
AA with NSCLC to reduce racial and ethnic health disparities. Also, the system will be of significant interest to
researchers in the field of sncRNA-based therapeutics for cancer treatment."
10869475,"Project Summary
Many men with favorable-risk prostate cancer do not benefit from aggressive intervention. As a
preferred alternative, active surveillance is increasingly used to spare men from the potentially
significant morbidity of treatment. Although adoption of surveillance has increased over the last
decade, its implementation varies widely. Surveillance requires identification of patients with
indolent tumors, coupled with monitoring for changes in cancer severity. Unfortunately, insufficient
monitoring can render surveillance dangerous by exposing men to morbidity, and potentially
mortality, from avoidable cancer progression. Nearly all research related to surveillance quality has
focused on patient selection as opposed to implementation. Confirmatory testing within 6 months of
diagnosis, using prostate biopsy or MRI, is a key component to ensure appropriate selection, as
nearly half of men harbor more aggressive disease, albeit undetected, and may be better suited for
treatment. The Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC) is a statewide
quality improvement collaborative consisting of 90% of all urologists in the state of Michigan and is
expanding outside the state. Among MUSIC urologists initiating surveillance, the use of
confirmatory testing in men with favorable-risk prostate cancer is only 61%. As there is strong
evidence that urologist and practice characteristics are associated with initiation of surveillance,
there is good reason to believe that these factors are also associated with use of confirmatory
testing and adherence to guidelines. The objective of this proposal is to design and develop
implementation interventions aimed at improving the quality of surveillance, and plan a large-scale
trial to test the implementation interventions with the following aims: 1) Assess the relative
importance of key implementation determinants; 2) Design and tailor interventions to support
implementation of quality surveillance in urology practices; and 3) Assess the value of including
practice sites beyond the original MUSIC sites in Michigan in the planned R01."
10869445,"Project Abstract
Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is an autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by the
deletion of one Rai1 allele (Retinoic Acid Induced-1). As a transcription factor, this deletion causes a reduction
in Rai1 expression and concomitant changes in expression of downstream targets, many critical to
neurodevelopment and function. We have assembled a small library that were selected based on their ability to
increase Rai1 expression. Our overarching goal is to demonstrate that Rai1 expression in SMS can be increased
using a pharmacologic approach and many of the transcriptomic defects can be corrected."
10869077,"Respiratory viruses have wide-ranging impacts on public health. Impactful viruses include SARS-CoV-2,
which caused over 1.1 million deaths in the U.S. since 2020, influenza, which typically causes tens of thousands
of deaths and hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations each winter, and rhinovirus, which is a major cause of
disease exacerbations in common chronic lung diseases such as asthma and COPD. The interferon (IFN)
response is a critical defense mechanism that protects against these and other respiratory viruses, but excessive
IFN responses can impair tissue repair and drive immunopathology. Canonical Type I (IFNs a, b) and Type III
IFNs (IFNl1-3), are regulated by induction: they are constitutively off but are rapidly and transiently induced in
response to viral infection. This project focuses on a non-canonical Type I interferon, IFN epsilon (IFNe), and its
distinct regulation and role in coordinating mucosal interferon responses in the human respiratory tract.
 IFNe is known to play a role in mucosal defense in the female reproductive tract (FRT), but a role in the
respiratory tract has not previously been described. This project will address this knowledge gap. Our data
indicate that IFNe is constitutively expressed by human airway epithelial cells and can stimulate antiviral
responses in these cells, albeit much less potently than canonical Type I or Type III IFNs. Previous work and our
data also suggest that constitutive IFNe expression is modulated by inflammation. We hypothesize that IFNe
functions to enhance baseline antiviral defenses in the respiratory epithelium, particularly in the setting of recent
damage, thus fine-tuning antiviral responses to be “just enough” to counter infection while minimizing the need
for inducible IFNs and the risk of excessive immune activation upon viral infection. If this model is correct, IFNe
could be the basis of novel strategies to enhance mucosal antiviral defenses while minimizing the risk of
immunopathology from the more potent canonical IFNs. Testing this model supports our long-term goal, to inform
the development of host-directed therapies that reduce the public health impact of respiratory viruses.
 The goal of this project is to establish the presence of IFNe in the human respiratory tract and understand
its relationship to canonical IFNs in regulating and fine-tuning IFN responses. Aim 1 will define the cell-type
specific expression of IFNe in the differentiated human respiratory epithelium and regulators of expression, using
both the tissue-like air-liquid interface culture model and primary human airway mucosal tissue. We will also
define nasopharyngeal (NP) IFNe protein levels in human subjects using NP swabs collected for SARS-CoV-2
screening at Yale New Haven Hospital. Aim 2 will employ the ALI culture model to define the function of IFNe in
the respiratory epithelium alone, in combination with canonical IFNs, and in dynamic setting of viral infection,
testing the impact on high-impact human respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and rhinovirus.
Public health impact: This work will provide insights into the regulation of the interferon response, a key host
defense against respiratory viruses, and will inform new strategies to prevent viral respiratory infections."

scientific support to accelerate the development of novel drugs, formulations, and technologies for the
treatment and prevention of HIV and related epidemics. The LEAP Process to facilitate drug and formulation
development begins with a landscape analysis, identifying knowledge gaps and barriers, simulating best
product characteristics, communicating potential solutions, and then tracking product outcomes. The Program
serves as a focal point for the global conversation on the development of LA/ER formulations, and has brought
many of the world's key stakeholders into this conversation. LEAP's seminal accomplishments include
foundational input for FDA draft guidance on the development of LA/ER formulations for HIV; promoting
development of the first candidate LA/ER formulations for tuberculosis and malaria; organizing the first
conference on use of LA/ER formulations for HIV in children, adolescents, and pregnant women; producing the
first publically accessible website devoted to LA/ER anti-infective products and strategies; and supporting
development of novel devices like anti-HIV implants and microneedles through its Modeling and Simulation
Core. Established in 2015, LEAP is now poised to apply its acquired expertise to new challenges. During the
next five years, we will leverage the infrastructure we have created to: 1) apply our scientific resources to
identify and facilitate development of the most promising new drugs and drug delivery platforms in order to
overcome the limitations of available products; 2) build upon our existing modeling and simulation expertise to
develop better ways to more rapidly identify those approaches with the most desirable pharmacologic
properties; and 3) expand the scope of LEAP to include diseases that overlap the HIV epidemic, where the
availability of LA/ER drugs and formulations could most profoundly affect treatment and prevention –
specifically, tuberculosis, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus infections. Expected outcomes include an
increased number of new long-acting drugs and formulations in preclinical and clinical development, enhanced
funding mechanisms to bring more such products into testing, and accelerated pathways for more rapid
translation of laboratory-based research into clinical trials and eventual drug approvals."
10873363,"This renewal application is for continued support of the Multidisciplinary Alcoholism Research Training
Program at the University of Michigan (UM), entering its 28th year of funding from the National Institute on
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA). The purpose of this training grant application is to train and equip the
next generation of scientific researchers who are committed to understanding and ameliorating the costs,
causes, and consequences of alcohol- and drug-related problems. The philosophy of this program is that
public health concerns related to alcohol and drug use are in constant flux, and so it is necessary to take a
flexible, collaborative, cross-disciplinary, and multi-method approach to effectively meet the needs of the
nation. While our emphasis continues to be highly focused on alcohol, the success of this approach is
evidenced by a pivot in the faculty’s research in recent years to a greater emphasis on opioids and cannabis,
substance use and neurodevelopment, and the use of mobile technology and social media platforms to reduce
the healthcare burden of alcohol and drug misuse. Since the program’s initial funding in 1990, we have trained
64 research fellows (an additional 4 are currently in training), of whom 11 are physician scientists, with many
continuing on to have successful careers in the alcohol and drug field. In the next five years, we will build on
our prior success by training five postdoctoral fellows each year. The UM Addiction Center in the Department
of Psychiatry houses the training program, and has involvement from 24 mentoring faculty, many of whom are
leaders in the field who have extensive research portfolios including grant funding totaling nearly $20 million
annually. This level of alcohol and drug-related funding, combined with strong histories of mentoring, provides
numerous state-of-the art opportunities for fellows to gain research and career development skills and an
excellent grounding in alcohol and drug research. The UM Addiction Center research is focused in six areas:
(1) Prevention & Early Intervention; (2) Developmental Psychopathology & Genetics; (3) Brain Function &
Neurophysiology; (4) Interventions including Treatment and Recovery; (5) Health Services Research; and (6)
Relationship of Sleep Problems & Chronic Pain to the Treatment for Substance Use Disorders. An addiction
psychiatry fellowship program and addiction treatment clinic are co-located in the same facility as the research
training program, which provides opportunities for clinical exposure, observation, and subject recruitment for
translational research fellows. The highly multidisciplinary program is led by the Director, two Associate
Directors and an Executive Committee. The core elements of the 2-year research training program include an
intense mentored research relationship, a graded set of research and didactic experiences, manuscript and
grant writing, and clinical exposure for translational researchers, with an emphasis on increasing independence
over the course of the fellowship. In sum, this training program renewal will directly shape the career trajectory
of trainees to ensure that they will have a high impact on alcohol and drug problems in the coming years."
10873364,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23 is a phosphate regulating hormone normally produced by bone. In chronic
kidney disease (CKD), accumulation of circulating bioactive intact FGF23 (iFGF23), due to increased Fgf23
transcription and decreased FGF23 de-activating cleavage, is independently associated with cardiovascular
mortality. Novel therapeutic approaches to reduce FGF23 levels and prevent adverse outcomes in CKD are
desperately needed but current therapies are suboptimal. Iron deficiency (ID) and inflammation are powerful
stimuli of FGF23 transcription and cleavage. In healthy mice, FGF23 production is highly increased in response
to ID and inflammation, but only mild increases in serum iFGF23 levels are observed due to concomitant increase
in FGF23 cleavage. miR-122 increases FGF23 cleavage and is highly elevated in response to ID and
inflammation. In CKD, we show that the expression of miR-122 is reduced despite ID and inflammation, FGF23
cleavage is impaired, and ID and inflammation therefore contribute to increased iFGF23 levels. We showed that
partial correction of ID or inflammatory component in mice with CKD reduced FGF23 transcription, corrected
FGF23 levels and prevented development of cardiac disease and premature death. However, bone-specific
deletion of FGF23 was not sufficient to fully correct FGF23 levels in iron deficient or inflamed mice, suggesting
that additional cell targets produce FGF23 in response to ID and inflammation. In fact, we show that erythroid
cells and macrophages also contribute to FGF23 excess. In this innovative proposal, we will test the hypothesis
that erythroid and macrophage cell lineage contribute to increased production of FGF23 in response to ID and
inflammation, and that lower miR-122 result in impaired FGF23 cleavage in health and in CKD.
In Aim1, we will determine if FGF23 is produced by bone and macrophages in response to inflammation and by
bone and erythroid cells in response to iron deficiency. We will use inflammatory challenges and dietary iron
restriction in mice with cell lineage specific deletion of FGF23. In Aim2, we will assess the role of miR-122 in
response to ID and inflammation on FGF23 cleavage using genetic deletion of miR-122 and administration of
miR-122 antagonists in mice. In Aim 3, we will test the therapeutic potential of targeting the osteocytes, pre-
osteoblasts, erythroid and macrophages in CKD, by using complementary genetic and pharmacological
approaches to lower FGF23 in the Col4a3KO mouse model of CKD. We will also use genetic deletion of miR-
122 and administration of a miR-122 mimetic in mice with CKD to demonstrate the therapeutic potential of miR-
122 to increase FGF23 cleavage in CKD and prevent elevations of iFGF23 levels. We will measure FGF23
levels, and assess amelioration of kidney, bone and cardiac morphology and function. These innovative aims
are supported by a productive collaborative team with expertise, skills and resources at Northwestern University
that will further develop our understanding of FGF23 regulation, and support our ultimate goal of developing
novel therapies to improve adverse outcomes in CKD."
10871196,"The pathological hallmarks of multiple sclerosis (MS) include lesions in the white and gray matter of the central
nervous system (CNS) comprised of areas of immune cell infiltration, reactive astrogliosis, axonal transection,
and demyelination. Proteins of the myelin sheath, such as myelin basic protein (MBP) and myelin
oligodendrocyte protein (MOG) have been extensively studied in MS pathogenesis; surprisingly, very little is
known about the changes to lipids components of the myelin sheath during the disease process, in
particular as it relates to changes in the composition of key myelin lipids during relapses, remission,
and progression of MS. Modifications in myelin lipids composition during disease relapses may critically
affect the progression of MS, for example by providing targets for lipid peroxidation. This may provide
druggable lipid-based targets, which have previously not been explored. There is an urgent unmet need in this
area.
Evidence in MS patients supports that increased lipid peroxidation occurs in the CNS. Moreover, it was shown
that combined treatment with glatiramer acetate (GA) and the potent antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC)
decreased MS relapses as compared with GA treatment alone.
Studying myelin lipids in the CNS is technically challenging and therefore, we have developed a novel
approach using matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass
spectrometry imaging (MSI) for analysis of myelin lipids in situ. MALDI-TOF MSI is a label-free, two-
dimensional molecular imaging technique with < 20 µm spatial resolution capable of visualizing the molecular
spatial distribution, colocalization, and relative abundance of hundreds of targeted and untargeted analytes and
providing a molecular biological snapshot of the metabolic state of tissues. In support of the premise of this
proposal we have obtained exciting preliminary data revealing changes to myelin lipids in situ in the CNS
of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our results provide novel insights into
the CNS lipidome during neuroinflammation.
We will leverage our preliminary results and the unique combined expertise of our team in neuroinflammation
and MSI to test the hypothesis that the composition of myelin lipids does not return to baseline during
remission in relapsing-remitting EAE (RR-EAE) models of MS, and that the residual changes in lipid
composition play key roles in disease progression, for example via lipid peroxidation.
We will test our hypothesis by: (1) determining the effects of neuroinflammation on the composition and spatial
distribution of key CNS myelin lipids during relapses, remission, and progression of EAE; (2) determine the key
neuroinflammatory mechanisms driving changes in myelin lipid composition. Our proposal will fill a significant
gap in knowledge and address critical questions that will help develop better treatments for progressive MS."
10876428,"Summary/Abstract
The mechanism by which transcription factors assemble active transcription complexes on specific DNA
sequences does not appear to follow a simple recognition code. Direct readout, wherein specific residues in
the transcription factor “read” the specific DNA sequence through direct interactions is most often assumed to
apply due to an oversimplified view of DNA as a rigid molecule. However, subtle, and not-so-subtle, structural
changes occur when DNA binds to transcription factors. In addition, the DNA binding domains of transcription
factors exhibit a large range of flexibility and often contain intrinsically disordered regions. These elements of
flexibility endow the problem of transcription factor-DNA molecular recognition with many of the features of the
protein folding problem. Our overall hypothesis is that transcription factor-DNA binding would instead be better
described by similar principles as have been elucidated for the protein folding problem. Here, we will focus on
the stress-response transcription factor, nuclear factor κB (NFκB), which activates hundreds of genes involved
in growth regulation and the immune response. We will combine rigorous theory with molecular biophysical
experiments to study the assembly kinetics of NFκB transcriptosome complexes. We will investigate coupling
between DNA and NFκB as it relates to tandem κB sites, nucleosomal DNA, and the DNA-binding co-activator,
RPS3. We predict that NFκB and additional nuclear proteins assemble into specific NFκB transcriptosomes on
κB-DNA sites via a cooperative assembly process. We will test this hypothesis with the following aims: Aim 1
Determine the role of DNA context in NFκB binding. We will test the hypothesis that DNA context plays a key
role in determining which NFκB binding events result in transcription activation by studying the binding of NFκB
to a series of bona fide NFκB promoter and enhancer sequences both theoretically and experimentally. Aim 2
Explore how NFκB interacts with nucleosomal DNA and can invade or unwind nucleosomal DNA. We will test
the hypothesis that NFκB is capable of disrupting nucleosome stability in a manner dependent on NFκB
concentration and the sequence of DNA that is wrapped by the nucleosome, thereby exposing DNA for the
initiation of transcription. Atomic force microscopy and computational modeling of the NFκB interaction with
nucleosomes will be pursued. Aim 3 Determine how the ternary interaction between DNA, NFκB and the
transcription co-activator, RPS3 forms. The NFκB coactivator, RPS3, associates with, and activates, subsets of
NFκB transcription activation sites forming higher-order NFκB transcriptosome complexes. We will use the
AWSEM-Suite code to predict the structures of these larger protein complexes and will verify the predicted
long-range contacts between proteins and domains by NMR paramagnetic relaxation, SAXS, and HDX-MS
experiments."

There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of outcomes related to third-line treatments
[onabotulinumtoxinA, peripheral tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS), and sacral neuromodulation] for refractory
overactive bladder (OAB) in older and frail older adults, who collectively comprise the majority of patients
suffering from this condition. Despite being well-studied in young and middle-aged healthy adults, little is
known about outcomes and complications of these treatments in these more vulnerable populations, potentially
resulting in overutilization of treatments that are ineffective or dangerous, or in underutilization of treatments
that may significantly improve health related quality of life. Our overarching research objective is to improve
care for all older and frail older adults undergoing treatment for OAB. The objective of this proposed study is to
better understand the utilization, outcomes and complications associated with onabotulinumtoxinA, PTNS, and
sacral neuromodulation in older and frail older adults, and to use this information to create an individualized
and actionable prognostic tool. The central hypothesis is that utilization of these procedures may be biased
towards younger aged individuals (of white race and higher socioeconomic status, performed by high volume
specialists), regardless of level of frailty, but that frailty will be highly correlated with poor outcomes and
increased rates of complications. We will test this hypothesis by leveraging a 100% cohort of fee-for-service
Medicare beneficiaries undergoing these procedures and the claims based frailty index (CFI), as the measure
of frailty, by the following three aims: (1) to understand the utilization of invasive OAB treatments (a) according
to age and frailty, and (b) according to other non-clinical factors: patient (race/ethnicity), regional
(socioeconomic) and provider (surgeon and volume); (2) to determine downstream outcomes and utilization of
third-line OAB treatments across the spectrum of advancing age and frailty up to 2 years after the procedure;
(3) to develop and internally validate a prognostic tool to predict successful outcomes for older and frail older
adults undergoing third-line OAB treatments. This study is innovative because it will measure and apply the
important factor of frailty to a national cohort of 100% of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries undergoing
onabotulinumtoxinA, PTNS, and sacral neuromodulation to ultimately create an individualized prognostic tool
to improve outcomes in this understudied population. The proposed research is significant because there is a
critical lack of information about outcomes for refractory OAB in this large and vulnerable population who suffer
greatly from this condition. Development of an individualized prognostic tool to aid in this decision-making
process will serve to minimize the risks of potentially unsuccessful, unnecessary and even harmful procedures,
while promoting the use of such procedures among individuals who are more likely to receive benefit."

 Genomics science gives us a better understanding of the interactions between genes and the environment, thus
allowing researchers to find better ways to improve health and prevent diseases. The Training in Genomics Research
(TiGeR) Track will engage students from under-represented populations, such as those from racial and/or ethnic minority
groups, people with disabilities, those from sexual and gender minority groups, and those from disadvantaged
backgrounds. The program will target qualified candidates from these under-represented communities with undergraduate
degrees in computer science, mathematics, or statistics with limited or no experience working with genomics datasets.
 The TiGeR Track program’s main goal is to prepare students for successful careers as computational experts in
genomics research. This goal will be accomplished through our targeted recruitment and retention efforts within the two-
year graduate curriculum culminating in a master’s degree in biological data science with a concentration on genomics
research. The TiGeR Track will be integrated into our recently established Master’s in Biological Data Science (MSBDS)
degree program. The MSBDS is an interdisciplinary program that capitalizes on the three pillars of specialty within the
School of Mathematical and Natural Sciences (SMNS) at Arizona State University (ASU) West: computer science, life
sciences, and mathematics. However, the MSBDS currently has no focus on genomics research nor bioinformatics, and
the TiGeR Track will help fill this gap. In addition to extensive course work and supervised hands-on research activities,
the TiGeR students will be trained in AnVIL - a cloud-based platform for computational genomics as well as other
genomics toolsets using publicly available datasets and repositories. Combining a strong focus on genomics research and
large-scale data analytics skills will equip our TiGeR graduates to be immediate and valuable contributors to industry and
research jobs in the genomics science sector.
 We will target, recruit and retain a diverse pool of students to develop into the next generation's thought leaders in
genomics sciences. By recruiting students that represent the communities surrounding our institution, we will maximize
deeper ties with surrounding communities at the regional level and generate a diverse science workforce that can compete
globally. The TiGeR Track program will provide a model of interdisciplinary collaboration in genomics sciences among
faculty within SMNS and other stakeholders on and off-campus. To be prepared to undertake a career in genomics
science, the TiGeR Track graduates require a strong foundation of skilled creativity and the ability to identify and achieve
scientific goals of significance to the biomedical and biosciences research enterprise. Throughout their tenure in the
TiGeR Track program, the students will develop skills to utilize and analyze genomic datasets from the public domain in a
research laboratory setting. While a robust interdisciplinary and immersive instruction structure is already present for data
science training within the MSBDS degree program, additional resources are required to establish the genomics science
curriculum, particularly in a way that will support students from under-represented backgrounds. Hence, we are
submitting this grant application."

The goal of this proposal is to disseminate Connectome 2.0, the next-generation 3 Tesla human MRI scanner at
the Massachusetts General Hospital designed for imaging human brain circuits across scales, as a unique
resource for neuroscience collaborations around the world. This ultra-high gradient strength, high slew-rate 3T
MRI scanner was expressly developed through the support of the NIH BRAIN Initiative to enable studies of neural
tissue microstructure and brain circuits spanning the microscopic, mesoscopic, and macroscopic scales. The
Connectome 2.0 scanner builds upon our expertise in engineering and disseminating the first human
Connectome MRI scanner for the Human Connectome Project to hundreds of users worldwide. In order to
maximize the resolution of this powerful scanner for studies of tissue structure down to the microscopic level in
the living human brain, we have pushed the diffusion resolution limit to unprecedented levels by (1) achieving
ultra-high gradient strengths up to 500 mT/m and ultra-fast slew rates up to 600 T/m/s; (2) pushing the limits of
the RF receive coils and gradient characterization to enable maximum sensitivity with greatly reduced artifacts
using real-time eddy current corrected MRI acquisitions; (3) developing new pulse sequences to achieve the
highest diffusion- and spatial-resolution ever achieved in vivo; and (4) calibrating the measurements through
systematic validation in high-fidelity phantoms and ex vivo brain tissue at progressively finer scales. As part of
this collaborative, center-wide endeavor, we will create novel advances in image acquisition and reconstruction
to enable maximal use of the Connectome 2.0 gradients for a wide array of neuroscientific applications. The
scanner has been validated in diffusion MRI studies down to sub-millimeter resolution with high-fidelity distortion
correction. The stronger gradients offer considerable improvements in diffusion imaging, reaching high b-values
with significantly shorter echo times. Funding of the current U24 proposal will facilitate the engineering effort and
scientific personnel to support, maintain, and expand the capabilities of this remarkable instrument, enable
efficient data transfer, integration, and analysis, as well as the requisite subject recruitment, user access, training,
and guidance to advance scientific collaborations nationally and internationally. While the major goal of this
project is to provide an innovative resource for unparalleled tissue microstructure and circuit characterization in
the living human brain, the research resource also holds great potential for improving our current understanding
of a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury,
aging, Alzheimer’s disease, and mental disorders. This one-of-a-kind instrument represents the ultimate diffusion
MRI machine capable of addressing the BRAIN 2025 mandate to image across scales, from the microscopic
scale needed to probe cellular heterogeneity and plasticity, to the mesoscopic scale for enumerating the
distinctions in cortical structure and connectivity that define cyto- and myeloarchitectonic boundaries, to
improvements in estimates of macroscopic connectivity."
10879166,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Classical homeotic mutations (e.g. Drosophila Ubx) disrupt embryonic development,
transforming one tissue type into another. We have discovered the molecular basis of
four human X-linked disorders affecting the eye or brain – BASR syndrome, foveal
dysgenesis, retinitis pigmentosa and spinocerebellar ataxia, which have a homeotic or
degenerative basis. Each disorder is caused by insertion of a large autosomal DNA
segment at the same Xq27 palindromic site near SOX3, which encodes a potent trans-
cription factor homologous to SRY (testis determinant). The Xq insertions are predicted
to disrupt chromatin architecture, activating SOX3 ectopically in tissues defined by newly
juxtaposed enhancers, and altering cell fate (homeosis) via a gain-of-function (GOF). We
propose that SOX3 changes retinal pigment epithelia (RPE) into neuroretina in BASR,
reprograms cerebellar Purkinje cells in SCAX5, and triggers photoreceptor degeneration
in RP24. Using a novel palinsert PCR assay, we defined the breakpoints and candidate
enhancers for each insertion. We also identified >10 further Xq27 disorders affecting the
eye, brain or other organs – including unsolved cases with a likely similar mechanism.
We will define new Xq27 palindrome insertions and test our hypothesis for disease
pathogenesis at chromatin and developmental levels, using [1] patient-derived iPSCs,
3D chromatin interaction assays (Hi-C), in vitro differentiation, serial scRNA-seq profiles;
and [2]
(homol
informative mouse transgenes, including the binary CRISPR/Cas9 Hprt HoP-In
ogy promoted integration) GOF system we pioneered – with Sox3HA expression
activated in RPE, rods, Purkinje cells, or other tissues via established Cre drivers, in a
constitutional (XY) or mosaic (XX) pattern, and in a sustained or Dox-inducible manner."

The availability of predictive in vitro models of human tumors designed to accurately recapitulate key
aspects of human pathophysiology would be transformative to cancer research and pre-clinical validation of
new therapeutic modalities. We assembled an interdisciplinary team of leading experts in bioengineering,
cancer biology, systems biology, pathology and oncology to establish such model. Based on extensive
prior work, we propose to develop a state-of-the art “cancer patient on a chip” of invasive human breast
carcinoma. The tumor will be physiologically integrated with their cognate metastatic sites (lung, liver,
bone) via vascular perfusion containing circulating cells. The tumor compartment will be established directly
from surgical specimens grown in 3D, organotypic conditions while target metastatic sites and vasculature
will be established from blood-derived, patient-matched iPS cells, under an active institutional review board
protocol. The system is imaging compatible and supports long-term culture (up to 12 weeks). Biological
fidelity and heterogeneity of primary and metastatic sites, as implemented in the context of such
vascularized multi-tissue platform, will be validated by single-cell analyses vs. the corresponding native
tumor. For these studies, we will recruit a cohort of patients with metastatic tumors. Our ultimate goal is to
demonstrate utility of the platform in elucidating mechanisms of tumor progression and drug resistance, by
testing drug panels predicted by a novel RNA-seq-based, NY CLIA certified methodology (OncoTreat). Our
hypothesis is that our system will recapitulate key properties of the metastatic breast adenocarcinoma and
enable identification of target proteins that mechanistically drive tumor progression and drug
sensitivity/resistance. Three specific aims will be pursued in a highly integrated fashion: Aim 1: Bioengineer
a 3D human breast carcinoma model and metastasis host tissues; Establish a model of metastasis in an
integrated patient-on-a-chip platform; Aim 3: Elucidate master regulators and predict drug sensitivity in
metastatic cells using the “cancer patient on a chip” model. We anticipate that this platform would have
broad utility in cancer research and in patient-specific testing of new therapeutic modalities.

In this application, I propose a novel precision medicine approach aimed at enhancing the therapeutic effect of
peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas (GEP-
NET)s. This award will provide protected research time and training in preparation for independent R01 funding.
Over the past decade, there has been a fundamental paradigm shift in the management of GEP-NETs through
use of somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2) targeted PRRT. The FDA has recently approved clinical use of
177Lu-DOTATATE (Lutathera), a somatostatin analog loaded with the therapeutic radionuclide 177Lutetium, for
PRRT of SSTR2-expressing GEP-NETs. Patients with low SSTR2 expressing tumors are often unresponsive to
PRRT, leaving them with limited treatment options. Low SSTR2 expression is mainly mediated through
epigenetic gene silencing. Here we propose to upregulate SSTR2 expression by using short-term pulsed
epigenome-modulating chemotherapy to re-sensitize NETs to PRRT and improve its therapeutic index while
reducing the non-target side effects of PRRT. In preliminary experiments we have shown dose-dependent robust
upregulation of SSTR2 both in vitro and in vivo by targeting a series of ploycomb group proteins (PcG) involved
in gene silencing. We propose to assess this approach in a range of models with the goal of optimizing the dosing
and timing of the de-repression chemotherapy. If successful, this study will pave the way for clinical trials and
near-term translation using clinically approved imaging and PRRT agents to markedly improve the effectiveness
of therapy by increasing the radiation dose delivered to tumors relative to non-target organs.
This proposal will enable me to become an independent investigator in translational precision imaging. My
ultimate goal is to lead an independently-funded research program in the translation of novel theranostics for
improving cancer care. To facilitate my progression to independence, I have designed with my mentors a career
development plan involving tailored didactic coursework, workshops, seminars, and hands-on training that will
provide me with formal education in epigenetics, computational biology, radiochemistry and radiotherapy
dosimetry. The primary mentor for this project is Dr. Umar Mahmood, a renowned expert in translational precision
imaging. Drs. Adam Bass and Ciprian Catana will serve as secondary mentors, lending their expertise in cancer
genetics and epigenetics, and radiation dosimetry modeling, respectively. In addition, I will work with a team of
advisors/consultants from MGH, including Drs. David Ryan, Daniel Chung, Ryan Corcoran, and Peter Caravan
who will provide additional expertise and guidance as part of my scientific advisory committee.
This research will be performed at the Martinos Center, a world-leading institution for translational imaging
research. The project will greatly benefit from the unique resources of the Martinos Center, MGH Cancer Center
and other MGH core facilities. This collaborative framework will help me foster relationships with MGH and Dana-
Farber Cancer Centers and leading experts in NETs to increase the impact and visibility of my research."

Monoclonal antibodies have played a pivotal role in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer for nearly two decades
and continue to grow at an exponential pace. Initially developed for their exceptional ability to target tumor
antigens and elicit antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), they have more recently been used to
modulate a patient’s immune system for anti-cancer immunotherapy. While the generation and development of
antibodies targeting various cell surface proteins has rapidly progressed, appropriate model systems for pre-
clinical testing of such therapeutics has lagged. This is because human antibodies i) don’t fully engage murine
or non-human primate Fc receptors (FcγRs), ii) are foreign proteins that are rapidly rejected in allogeneic hosts
and iii) are often inappropriately tested in immunodeficient xenograft models lacking adaptive immune cells or
homologous FcγR. Thus, our studies have focused on the generation and testing of clinically relevant models to
better understand the in vivo activity of diagnostic and therapeutic antibodies. The current proposal aims to now
generate and fully characterize novel murine models that allow better preclinical testing of human antibodies by
engineering our previously developed humanized FcγR mouse strains to express human FcRn and IgG1.
Expression of human FcRn will allow more accurate pharmacokinetic analysis of human antibodies and
assessment of methods aimed at generating antibodies with extended in vivo half-life. By replacing the mouse
heavy chain with the constant regions of human IgG1, this model will also allow chronic administration of human
IgG-based therapeutics without developing anti-drug antibody responses. By addressing two major hurdles in
the field of antibody therapeutics, these models will allow more rapid and efficient pre-clinical toxicology testing
and potentially uncover novel mechanisms of Fc-engineered antibodies. Additionally, given the growing interest
in immunotherapy, having an immunocompetent model provides an additional advantage over current xenograft
models. Finally, as recent data suggest an important role for Fc-FcγR in radiolabeled antibody diagnostics, these
models will provide a clinically relevant model to help improve the development and testing of innovative
antibody-based molecules for the in vivo detection and localization of neoplasms."

 Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is the most virulent form of the disease. Loss of the tumor
suppressors TP53/RB1 is ubiquitous in NEPC, but molecular mechanisms that explain how loss of TP53/RB1
promotes NEPC development are largely unknown. Further, there are no effective therapies for NEPC. Thus,
there is a clear need to clarify targetable mechanisms in NEPC so we may develop new treatments.
 Loss of epithelial differentiation is one critical hallmark of NEPC. We identified specific transcriptional
repressors turned on by TP53/RB1 loss that block androgen receptor signaling and epithelial differentiation.
Activation of a neuroendocrine differentiation/epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program is another
hallmark of NEPC. We identified important activators of this program that are also turned on by TP53/RB1 loss.
Importantly, blocking the repressor proteins with drugs approved for use in other cancers or blocking the
activator proteins with a drug that is currently in clinical trials in prostate cancer reduces growth of NEPC
tumors in vitro and in vivo. However, we find that combination therapy is particularly effective. This application
is designed to clarify mechanisms by which this treatment combination blocks NEPC cell survival.
 We hypothesize that TP53/RB1 loss activates key factors that suppress epithelial differentiation while also
activating those that promote NEPC differentiation; co-targeting this combined axis is more effective because it
restores epithelial differentiation and blocks neuronal/EMT pathways, and—in doing so—blocks adaptive,
single agent resistance mechanisms.
Aim 1: Determine mechanisms by which loss of TP53/RB1 loss represses epithelial differentiation gene
expression. Completion of this aim will provide a detailed understanding of how TP53/RB1 loss turns on key
downstream repressors to block epithelial differentiation so we can prevent that from occurring.
Aim 2: Determine mechanisms by which blocking key transcriptional repressors reactivates epithelial
differentiation. Completion of this aim will determine how key transcriptional repressors block epithelial
differentiation so we can identify the most suitable pharmacologic agents to suppress their function.
Aim 3: Block NEPC lineage plasticity, tumor growth, and metastasis by targeting key transcriptional
activators + repressors induced by TP53/RB1 loss in NEPC tumor models in mice. Completion of this
aim will identify in vivo response biomarkers, measure safety, and provide the rationale to test this combination
in future clinical trials focused on patients with NEPC.
 We expect that the studies proposed will mechanistically clarify the function of a network induced by
TP53/RB1 loss that is critical for survival of NEPC tumors. These results may help translate a new combination
treatment strategy to the clinic to block this network in men with NEPC in the near-term."

The regulation of body temperature, thermoregulation, is a fundamental homeostatic process in warm-blooded
organisms. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays an important role in the control of body temperature by generating
heat in cold environments. BAT is functionally distinct from white adipose tissue (WAT) which is the primary site
of energy storage. Once activated by cold, BAT dissipates the chemical energy as heat in a process called
adaptive thermogenesis. Activating and expanding the thermogenic adipose tissue are attractive ways to
increase energy expenditure and offer promising strategies to combat obesity and cardiometabolic diseases.
Notably, studies in humans and rodents show that the biological significance of thermogenic adipose tissue
extends far beyond enhancing energy expenditure. Due to their high metabolic activity, thermogenic adipocytes
act as a metabolic sink to improve glucose and lipid metabolism and thus exhibit anti-diabetic and lipid-lowering
effects. The major challenge in targeting BAT as an anti-obesity therapy is the limited amount of active BAT in
most adult humans. Although using chronic cold exposure as a preventive or treatment strategy is not feasible,
understanding the mechanisms of cold adaptation presents a unique opportunity to exploit these pathways and
develop strategies to increase BAT thermogenesis and improve systemic metabolism. Using single-cell
transcriptomic analysis of BAT and analyzing the cell-type-specific transcriptional changes in BAT from mice
housed at different temperatures, we have recently revealed that thermogenic adaptation involves the multi-
layered and coordinated remodeling of all adipose resident cells to enhance thermogenesis. Through extensive
analysis of ligand-receptor communications, we have constructed the intricate network of intercellular crosstalk
within the thermogenic adipose niche. Within this framework, we identified the axon guidance ligand Slit3 as an
essential regulator of BAT thermogenesis. Our functional studies demonstrated the role of Slit3 in the regulation
of angiogenesis and sympathetic innervation, firmly establishing Slit3 as a key player in the control of BAT
thermogenesis. However, the mechanisms by which Slit3 signaling influences these processes remain unknown.
Building on our recent discovery and exciting preliminary data, we propose a series of innovative strategies to
determine the contribution of Slit3 proteolytic processing to its function in BAT (Aim 1), identify the molecular
mechanisms of Slit3 signaling in endothelial cells and sympathetic neurons (Aim 2), and address the potential of
Slit3 to ameliorate the detrimental effects of diet-induced obesity by promoting angiogenesis and preserving the
sympathetic innervation in BAT and WAT (Aim 3). Successful completion of the proposed studies will provide a
mechanistic understanding of an entirely new pathway that regulates adipose tissue function and will have an
important and sustained impact on the field."

Researchers at the University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus (UPR MSC) are proposing to purchase
a BD FACSymphony A1TM flow cytometer with 4 lasers that can detect up to 19 different parameters in cells
and/or particles that include size, complexity and fluorescent-tagged markers. The associated BDFACSDiva
software has the capacity to quantify 16 different cell types from complex single-cell suspensions, as per the
experimental and teaching needs of faculty and residents, and graduate, medical, and undergraduate students
at the UPR MSC. UPR MSC is the only public institution in Puerto Rico offering a comprehensive academic
program in health-related sciences and plays a leadership role in teaching and training underrepresented
minority students (>98% Hispanic) and in conducting research on health problems of the Puerto Rican population.
This equipment is sorely needed because currently, the whole campus only has 2 flow cytometers in individual
laboratories at the biomedical research building: BD FACSCelesta analyzer with 2 lasers and a MACS Quant 16
from Miltenyi. These flow cytometers are heavily used by the independent laboratories and are only available for
collaborative research, and not for independent research or educational use. Both cytometers are different and
require distinct training, thus the users do not have an alternative when one instrument is unexpectedly out of
commission. The PI’s NIH and DoD/US Army funded research on experimental cancer therapeutics relies heavily
on analyzing immune cells in the tumor microenvironment from mouse and human blood and tissues. The PI’s
close collaborator and co-investigator of this proposal, Dr. Dorta-Estremera, a cancer immunologist, is a young
investigator with multiple NIH-funded developmental grants, focused on studying immunotherapy responses and
the tumor microenvironment in Hispanic cancer patients, that require quantification of immune cell populations
via flow cytometry. The other users also have projects on identifying immune cell populations in cancer, as well
as in infections (HIV), autoimmune (colitis), and neurodegenerative (Alzheimer’s) diseases. Dr. Dorta is highly
experienced with flow cytometry analysis and will play a lead role in training students and faculty and
maintenance of the instrument. The flow cytometer will be housed in a dedicated space in a core facility at the
UPR MSC main building that will be accessible to all faculty and students. The institutional benefit is the
acquisition of state-of-the-art equipment that will support health-related research projects from both senior and
junior faculty and will be an important tool to forward their career development and generate data for grant
proposals and publications. The equipment is also expected to serve as a teaching tool for students and residents
to gain expertise in this high-end technology. Overall, acquisition of the flow cytometer will forward our broad
long-term objectives of understanding the role of immune and inflammatory mechanisms in cancer, and
infectious, immune, and neurodegenerative diseases and address health disparities, as well as reinforce our
research resources to advance the science and research capabilities in Puerto Rico."
10878420,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overarching goal of this proposal is to understand how two highly homologous epigenetic regulators, MLL3
and MLL4, coordinate critical cell fate decisions during adult blood development. Considerable prior work has
gone into understanding the transcription factor networks that coordinate blood development, particularly at the
level of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), multipotent progenitors (MPPs), and lineage committed progenitors.
These networks are important because they maintain blood and immune system homeostasis, and they touch
on essentially every human blood disorder. Like transcription factors, epigenetic regulators are also critical for
blood development and homeostasis, as evidenced by the fact that they are frequently mutated in clonal
hematopoiesis and various leukemias. However, unlike transcription factors – which often have well-
characterized DNA binding motifs, binding partners, and cis-regulatory elements – we currently have only limited
insight into how epigenetic regulators are deployed to effect specific cell fate decisions.
The case of MLL3 and MLL4 illustrates both the importance of epigenetic regulation in blood development and
our limited understanding of their underlying mechanisms. MLL3 and MLL4 each nucleate a multiprotein,
chromatin-bound complex called the Complex of Proteins Associated with SET1(COMPASS). MLL3 and MLL4
are highly homologous, and both bind enhancer elements to promote gene expression. However, the proteins
have very distinct functions in HSCs and MPPs despite their shared homology. MLL4 maintains HSC self-renewal
capacity while opposing myeloid differentiation, whereas MLL3 antagonizes HSC self-renewal while promoting
differentiation. These observations create a unique opportunity to learn how structurally similar epigenetic
regulators can be selectively recruited to discrete cis-regulatory elements to convey specific hematopoietic fates.
In new preliminary studies, we made additional discoveries that shape the aims of this proposal. Specifically, we
discovered that MLL3 and MLL4 have redundant roles in licensing HSC identity and myeloid potential despite
their apparently antagonistic functions. Inactivating both proteins causes HSCs/MPPs to adopt a B-lymphoid
primed state. We propose the following two aims to investigate the underlying causes of these cell fate changes.
Aim 1 is to define mechanisms by which MLL3 and MLL4 license HSC identity, as well as mechanisms that
account for their distinct functions in HSC self-renewal and differentiation. Aim 2 is to define MLL3/4 COMPASS-
independent mechanisms of B-lymphoid development. We will use a combination of genetically engineered mice
and various genomic and proteomic techniques to identify cis-regulatory elements, transcription factors and
chromatin binding proteins that mediate MLL3- and MLL4-specific cell fates. In each aim, we will focus on
understanding the regulatory logic that defines MLL3/4 COMPASS usage or COMPASS independence. The
proposed work will create a paradigm for understanding transcription factor/co-factor interplay during blood
development."

The neural circuits associated with encoding odors in patterns of activity throughout the brain are critical not
only for chemosensory perception, but are intimately linked to emotion, learning and memory in humans and
mice, the major animal model for studying disorders that impact chemosensory function. We propose to study
the circuit between the ventral CA1 (vCA1) region of the hippocampus and the main olfactory bulb (MOB) to
between understand how cognitive aspects of behavior, such as a sense of environment, or anxiety can
influence the encoding of chemical signals. Improved understanding of these circuits could provide critical
insight into the link between chemosensory function and neurological, neurodegenerative, and
neuropsychiatric disorders.
Mitral and tufted cells (M/T) are the principal neurons of the main olfactory bulb (MOB) in rodents, and relay
chemosensory information they receive to a number of cortical regions including the anterior olfactory nucleus
(AON) and the piriform cortex. Rather than active as passive relays of this information, mitral and tufted cell
activity is reshaped in part by local inhibitory interneurons and by extensive feedback projections from a
number of areas including olfactory cortex and the hippocampus. We have recently begun exploring the
structure of one of these feedback circuits, projections from the pyramidal cells of the ventral CA1 (vCA1)
region of the hippocampus. Although these connections were identified nearly a ½ century ago, little is known
about their function. In this proposal, we will investigate the overall hypothesis that vCA1 projections relay
behaviorally relevant cognitive information (representing where the animal is, the anxiety associated with that
location in the environment, etc.) to the MOB.
Using a combination of electrophysiology and behavioral measures, we will ask three critical questions about
the vCA1->MOB circuit. (1) What behavioral information do the vCA1 neurons that project to the bulb encode?
(2) What are the synaptic networks that link vCA1 to the M/T cells in the bulb? (3) What if any of these
behavioral features are represented in the bulb and how does this affect chemosensory processing?
Combining these studies will provide critical insight into the circuits that allow behavior to shape chemosensory
perception."

Persistent pain following breast cancer surgery is increasingly recognized as an important clinical and public
health issue due to the large number of women affected, the powerful negative impact that persistent pain has
on emotional and physical functioning and its financial costs. Most of the more than a quarter of a million
women newly diagnosed with breast cancer in the U.S. this year will undergo surgery as a part of curative
treatment. The prevalence of persistent pain following surgical removal of the affected breast (mastectomy) or
more limited surgeries (lumpectomy) is high, ranging from 25-60% across studies. Unlike acute post-operative
pain, which is a normal response to surgical trauma, persistent pain at or near the surgical site has an
uncertain multifaceted etiology, and no satisfactory pharmacological treatment. A critical question is whether
key pain-related psychosocial factors are drivers of the continuing burden of persistent pain, and whether they
could be ameliorated by non-pharmacological intervention. The research planned under this award will provide
a first critical test of the hypothesized driving role of pain catastrophizing in persistent pain after breast cancer
surgery. It also will explore the role of two other key psychosocial variables that may contribute to the burden
associated with persistent pain after breast cancer surgery: self-efficacy for engaging in valued activities and
psychological inflexibility. We have developed, manualized, and pilot tested a pain coping skills training
intervention that specifically targets the needs of women with persistent pain following breast cancer surgery
(Targeted PCST) and aims to reduce pain catastrophizing, increase self-efficacy for engaging in valued
activities, and decrease psychological inflexibility. We propose a multiple-site, randomized clinical trial to
evaluate the efficacy of the Targeted-PCST intervention. The study will be conducted in 9 diverse oncology
clinics: 5 affiliated with Duke University/Duke Cancer Network and 4 affiliated with the University of
Pittsburgh/UPMC Hillman Cancer Center. Participants (N=564) will be randomized to either receive: 1)
Targeted-PCST, 2) a general health education intervention (control), or 3) usual care (control). Participants will
complete assessments pre-intervention and at 3 months (post-intervention), 6 months follow-up, and 12
months follow-up. Study aims are: Aim1: Examine the impact of Targeted-PCST on persistent post-surgical
pain severity and interference (i.e., PEG score), emotional distress (anxiety and depression), and cancer-
specific distress. Aim 2: Investigate the impact of Targeted-PCST on pain catastrophizing, pain self-efficacy,
and psychological inflexibility, and evaluate these variables as possible mediators of the benefits of Targeted-
PCST. Aim 3: Evaluate the impact of Targeted-PCST on pain sensitivity and central sensitization, and explore
whether changes in these variables mediate group differences in pain severity and interference."

Malaria-specific CD8+ T cells have long been known to control the liver stages of malaria. We recently showed
that they can also kill reticulocytes infected with Plasmodium vivax. However, the T cell targeted antigens
presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules on parasite-infected cells at any stage
are largely unknown; a lack of knowledge that has hampered the development of rationally designed, T cell-
based vaccines for malaria. In preliminary experiments we determined the MHC-I peptidome presented on P.
vivax-infected reticulocytes. This analysis revealed that many MHC-I-bound peptides are derived from
abundant house-keeping proteins such as histones and ribosomal proteins that are highly conserved among
Plasmodium species—targets not represented in current vaccine strategies. This discovery thus creates the
unique opportunity to develop pan-Plasmodium vaccines eliciting T cells to validated targets. Unexpectedly,
several peptides were identified in multiple donors regardless of their MHC-haplotype and our preliminary data
show this is in part due to peptide presentation on MHC-E, a non-polymorphic MHC-Ib molecule. We therefore
hypothesize that MHC-E-restricted CD8+ T cells contribute to T cell-mediated protection against malaria and
that this can be exploited for vaccine design using cytomegalovirus (CMV)-based vectors, the only platform
that can be programmed to elicit MHC-E-restricted CD8+ T cell responses to inserted antigens. This hypothesis
will be tested in three specific aims using the P. cynomolgi non-human primate model of P. vivax with
validation in human P. vivax-infected samples: In Aim 1 we will determine the relative contribution of MHC-E to
presentation of P.vivax peptides to CD8+ T cells and investigate a possible role of MHC-E-targeting in CD8+ T
cell killing of infected reticulocytes (iRetics). In Aim 2 we will characterize the role of individual P. vivax
antigens in MHC-E-restricted CD8+ T cell targeting of iRetics. This will be accomplished by identifying MHC-
E/peptide-specific T cell receptors and examining the ability of TCR-transfected T cells to target iRetics . In
addition, we will similarly characterize MHC-E-restricted CD8+ T cells elicited to selected antigens in rhesus
macaques immunized with genetically modified rhesus cytomegalovirus vectors (RhCMV) that elicit exclusively
MHC-E-restricted CD8+ T cells. In Aim 3, we will compare RhCMV-based P. vivax vaccines eliciting MHC-E or
MHC-Ia-restricted responses to selected, conserved antigens with respect to their ability to protect against P.
cynomolgi challenge in rhesus macaques. Specifically, we will monitor protection against the liver stage,
primary blood stage and relapsing blood stage resulting from dormant liver stages. This collaborative program
brings together diverse expertise and, if successful, will provide a highly innovative approach to malaria
vaccine development that is expected to have a lasting impact on vaccine research."

 Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a significant and costly public health problem. Women develop AUD more
quickly and suffer a broader range of adverse alcohol-related health consequences than men. Yet, due to
stigma, shame, and child care issues, women are less likely to receive specialty addiction treatment. Moreover,
mounting evidence indicates factors that precipitate relapse differ between men and women. Men are more
likely to relapse in response to positive emotional states and social pressure while negative emotional states
are important precipitators of relapse in women. Indeed, women often report drinking to cope with negative
emotions and express a lack of alternate coping strategies. Given the robust evidence for physical activity (PA)
in decreasing depression, negative affect, and alcohol craving, PA interventions may play an important role as
an alternate coping strategy for women with AUD and a means to decrease relapse. Our team was the first
group to develop and test a lifestyle physical activity (LPA) approach with women with AUD (R34 AA024038).
LPA is a new PA paradigm that emerged as an alternative to the gym-based fitness training interventions that
struggle with high dropout and lack transportability to varied settings. LPA interventions represent simple, low-
cost, and flexible approaches that are supported by brief counseling and activity monitors (e.g., Fitbit) to
facilitate goal-setting and self-monitoring. In our Stage 1a and 1b studies, we developed and demonstrated
initial support for an LPA+Fitbit intervention for women with AUD and depression. The intervention consisted
of 6 brief, phone-based PA counseling sessions focused on increasing PA and strategically using bouts of PA
to cope with affect and alcohol cravings and use of the Fitbit fitness tracker and mobile app. Our preliminary
work established the acceptability and feasibility of this intervention. In addition, results of an initial randomized
controlled trial (RCT; N = 50) showed that, relative to a health education contact (HEC) control, women in the
LPA+Fitbit intervention had higher rates of alcohol abstinence, greater reductions in depression and negative
affect, and increased PA at the 3-month follow-up. We propose to build on our promising preparatory work and
take the next step by conducting a fully powered (N=214), Stage 2 RCT to test the efficacy of the LPA+Fitbit
intervention, compared to a Fitbit Only condition, for women with AUD and depression in alcohol treatment. In
addition, to elucidate mechanisms of treatment effects, we will employ two, 10-day bouts of ecological
momentary assessment (EMA) to obtain multiple daily measures of affect, cravings, drinking, and PA
engagement during early recovery (i.e., first 90 days) coupled with objective assessment of PA (i.e., Fitbit
data). This project will contribute much-needed knowledge on the role of PA in reducing alcohol use,
depressive symptoms and negative mood in women with AUD. If the efficacy of the LPA+Fitbit intervention can
be established, depressed women with AUD will have a valuable adjunct to traditional alcohol treatment that
can server as an alternate coping strategy during early recovery, when relapse risk is highest."

Fluorescence anisotropy (or polarization) is routinely used for investigating

in onjunction with TIRF, confocal or epi-illumination and lately there have been efforts to

a method of choice for 3D imaging of live samples because of its fast-imaging speed
 gentleness. We ropose to leverage our experience in building lightsheet systems and
polarization optics to advance the field of fluorescence polarization i maging. Our aim
 this proposal i s to combine these two modalities in a manner such that it can easily be
and used for biological applications and quantitative analysis. Our previous research has
 a specifically designed Wollaston prism for imaging single color fluorescence anisotropy. In
 application, we propose to build a dual-color optical splitter for fluorescence polarization
 which will employ the Wollaston prism for polarization separation and a single area
 such as sCMOS camera (Aim 1a). Fabricated nanostructured pinhole arrays will be
 to characterize the optical splitter for field dependent distortions, transmission losses in
 channels (due to various optical components), and to validate the registration of multi-
 for polarization computation. We will also combine this splitter with the home-built
systems for 3D live imaging of cells and embryos (Aim 1b). A tailored image analysis
along with a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) will be developed for data
and quantitative image analysis (Aim 2). Our proposed approach would allow us t o map
anisotropy for investigating protein-protein interactions in 3D in live samples.

10888558,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Neutrophils are the first line of host defense against invading pathogens that trap and kill pathogens through a
process called NETosis. Upon stimulation by the pathogen, neutrophils extrude decondensed chromatin in the
form of DNA fibers that trap invading cells and forms a scaffold to harbor associated proteins and antimicrobial
peptides. Bactericidal activity has been attributed to the action of these associated proteins and peptides through
oxidative stress resulting from the free radicals they generate. DNA however, the largest component of NETs, is
only believed to offer the trapping scaffold despite a suicidal path a neutrophil undergoes to extrude the DNA.
DNA is known to form non-canonical secondary structures like the i-motif, triple helices, and G-quadruplexes
(G4). G4 is formed by the stacking of planar square structures of four guanine bases associated by Hoogsteen
hydrogen binds. These secondary structures are concentrated around transcription start sites in promoter
regions and genome-wide high-resolution sequencing has detected >700,000 G4s in the human genome. G4s
are known to sequester free hemin to protect the cell from hemin toxicity and this complex (G4/H) subsequently
regulates gene expression. In vitro, G4/H has been characterized as a DNAzyme that mimics peroxidases to
decompose to hydrogen peroxide to produce hydroxyl radicals. Hydroxyl radicals are known to be most reactive
and toxic to cells in vivo. While G4/H activity is well understood in vitro and the G4 is known to sequester free
hemin within cells, the existence of G4 structures in the decondensed chromatin of NETs or the peroxidase like
activity of G4/H in vivo is unknown.
We propose to discern the existence of G4/H complexes in NETs using antibodies specific to hemin and G4
using multiple approaches like colocalization of immunofluorescence and ChIP-seq on NETs specific DNA pulled
with myeloperoxidase specific antibodies from whole blood of healthy individuals after IL-8 or bacterial
stimulation and patients with COVID-19. We propose to characterize the enzymatic activity of the G4/H
DNAzyme in NETs and demonstrate the local concentrated effect of free radicals generated on trapped bacteria
and prove that this phenomenon occurs naturally ex vivo. Finally, we propose to exhibit the biological outcomes
from the G4/H DNAzyme generated free radicals by testing bactericidal activity, host cell injury, and
posttranslational modifications of NETs associated proteins giving rise to autoimmune disorders like systemic
lupus erythematosus."

Exposure to one flavivirus can elicit immune responses that cross-react with genetically related viruses, in
complex relationships with a variety of impacts on subsequent flavivirus infections. The best-characterized
example of this is within the dengue virus (DENV) serocomplex. Pre-existing immunity to one of the 4 DENV
serotypes, DENV-1, for instance, can increase the risk of severe disease upon infection with a different sero-
type in what is termed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Interestingly, emerging evidence suggests
that immunological cross-reactivity among flaviviruses is not always reciprocal—that is, pre-existing
immunity to virus A may protect against disease associated with virus B, while pre-existing immunity to virus B
may increase the risk of disease upon infection with virus A. For example, we and others have shown in hu-
man cohorts that pre-existing immunity to DENV reduces the risk of disease associated with Zika virus (ZIKV)
infection, while immunity to ZIKV enhances the risk of disease associated with certain DENV serotypes. Thus,
the degree to which pre-existing flavivirus immunity is cross-protective, enhancing, or neutral may depend on
the order in which the host has encountered different flaviviruses previously.
We hypothesize that differences in the antigenic sites recognized by antibodies and/or antibody func-
tional “quality” are major determinants of non-reciprocal flavivirus immunity. To address this hypothesis,
we have assembled a unique team of investigators with expertise in virology, immunology, epidemiology, and
nonhuman primate models, with access to samples and data from our 19-year Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study
in Nicaragua, the longest continuous such study in the arbovirus field.
We will integrate studies of flavivirus immunological cross-reactivity in nonhuman primate models and human
cohorts to evaluate the impact of flavivirus exposure on virus replication dynamics, antibody repertoire diversi-
ty, neutralization titer, and Fc effector function. We will also leverage our unique cohort of children in Nicaragua
with known flavivirus infection histories to examine how the order of exposure to DENV serotypes and to ZIKV
shapes cross-reactive antibody profiles, specifically, the capacity to respond to Spondweni virus (SPONV), a
model emerging flavivirus and the closest known relative to ZIKV. We include SPONV here due to our prelimi-
nary data indicating that cross-reactive immunity between ZIKV and SPONV in macaques is strikingly non-re-
ciprocal. Macaques with ZIKV immunity were completely protected against SPONV challenge, while SPONV
immunity provided no protection against ZIKV.
This study will provide tractable model systems in which to identify how the order of flavivirus exposure impacts
immune responses and infection outcomes. Our findings will have broad implications for how we assess the
risk of emerging viruses and disease in flavivirus-exposed populations and design next-generation flavivirus
vaccines."
10892696,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal outlines an integrated research and career development plan for Nathan Schoettler, MD, PhD to
conduct training in the laboratory of Dr. Carole Ober and transition to an independent academic position by
establishing a research program at the interface of genetics and immunology with a NIH mentored career
award (K08). The PI recently completed an NIH T32 fellowship (T32 HL007605) and is trained in the fields of
immunology, genetics, molecular biology and cell biology, and during the time of this K08 award, the PI will
receive additional academic guidance from additional co-mentors (Dr. Dan Nicolae and Dr. Anne Sperling) and
advisors (Dr. Julian Solway, and Dr. Hae Kyung Im) at the University of Chicago. The career development plan
is designed to equip the PI with the necessary knowledge and skills in statistical genetics and cellular
immunology for a successful transition to an independent academician, and R01 funding. The overall goal of
the proposed research is to elucidate the role of genetic variation in regulating the expression of genes in
specific lung cell types that play a critical role in asthma. Asthma is a complex genetic disease with high
heritability, yet how genetic variation influences pathobiological mechanisms, or endotypes, in asthma has not
been resolved. Studies conducted by the PI during his post-doctoral T32 phase demonstrated that childhood-
onset and adult-onset asthma have both shared and distinct genetic risk loci (Lancet Resp Med 2019). The PI
furthermore showed that human lung tissue resident memory T cells, a subset of T cells that do not circulate in
the blood, are programmed differently and derived from a separate pool of progenitor than lung-draining lymph
node memory T cell subsets (Comm Biol, in press), and they rapidly increase the expression of key asthma
cytokines when activated. This K08 research proposal tests the overall hypothesis that specific asthma sub-
phenotypes have shared and distinct genetic risk factors and that these risk loci mediate effects in cell-specific
manners that perturb gene expression and disease risk in unique ways. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that
clinically important asthma sub-phenotypes share a set of genetic risk variants but also have additional, sub-
phenotype-specific genetic risk loci. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that a subset of asthma-risk loci will harbor
variation that has unique effects on gene expression in lung tissue resident memory T cells that have not been
revealed in other tissues or cell types. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that asthma sub-phenotypes have different
sets of risk loci that influence gene expression in asthma-relevant cells from lungs, specifically T cells, smooth
muscle cells and epithelial cells. The goals of this research will be achieved by integrating genome-wide
association studies with expression quantitative trait loci identified in airway cells with and without asthma-
relevant exposures, and lead to a mechanistic understanding of how genetic risk variants influence cellular
responses, ultimately revealing potential therapeutic targets. This career award will accelerate the transition for
Dr. Schoettler to an independent physician-scientist and the acquisition of competitive R01 funding."

Genetic factors play an important role in the etiology of both sporadic and familial breast cancer.
Since 2007, common genetic variants in ~200 loci have been identified in genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) in relation to breast cancer risk. However, it is often difficult to
translate GWAS findings to disease prevention and treatment since causal genes in the large
majority of GWAS-identified loci are unknown. Furthermore, a large fraction of breast cancer
heritability remains unexplained. Recent studies suggest that nearly 80% of disease heritability
can be explained by genetic variants regulating gene expression. Herein, we propose three
well-powered transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) to systematically investigate the
association of breast cancer risk with gene expression across the transcriptome of African,
Asian and European descendants. In Aim 1, we will perform RNA sequencing and high-density
genotyping assays using normal breast tissue samples and build race-specific gene expression
prediction models using data from 1000 women of African, Asian and European descent. These
models will be applied to the GWAS data generated from approximately 320,000 breast cancer
patients and controls to impute gene expression for association analyses of predicted gene
expression with risk of breast cancer overall and by estrogen receptor and HER2 status. In Aim
2, we will select the top 50 genes identified in Aim 1 for in vitro functional assays to assess their
influence on major cell functions related to cancer biology. In Aim 3, we will evaluate whether
TWAS-identified genes may express differently in normal breast tissues and breast cancer
tissues collected from African, Asian, and European descendants to assess whether these
genes may contribute to racial differences in breast cancer risk by molecular subtypes. With
strong methodology and a large sample size, we believe that this proposed study should be
able to identify and characterize a large number of novel genes related to breast cancer risk.
Uncovering breast cancer susceptibility genes will greatly improve the understanding of the
genetic and biological basis for breast cancer and accelerate the translation of genetic findings
to disease prevention and patient care."
10870132,"During perimenopause, women experience dramatic changes that extend beyond cessation of menses, including
alterations that accelerate the aging process and thereby elevate risks for cardiometabolic diseases, vascular
contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. Metabolic
risk factors that may emerge or worsen in the perimenopausal period include increases in central adiposity, blood
pressure, glucose, and non-HDL cholesterol, which are associated with later development of type 2 diabetes
mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and dementia. Many perimenopausal women also experience neuropsychiatric
changes including symptoms of vasomotor instability, sleep disturbance, depression, anxiety, and memory
problems, which represent major detriments to quality of life and may be important sex-specific risk factors for
cardiometabolic diseases and dementia caused by both VCID and AD. Numerous studies have characterized
genetic and behavioral risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases and dementia in middle adulthood. Less
attention has focused on physiologic and social stressors, which affect all body systems and heighten multiple
risk factors, as contributors to these diseases. Absolute risks differ by sex and lifestage: while premenopausal
women are at lower risk for CVD and dementia than men, risks increase dramatically through and after the
menopausal transition. Lifetime social stressors and physiologic stressors during reproductive transitions unique
to women may substantially account for the sex-specific risks of cardiometabolic diseases and dementia. Yet,
few studies have addressed these relationships in depth with prospective longitudinal follow-up. This Project will
test our overall hypothesis that perimenopausal women with higher exposure to social stressors throughout life
and physiological stressors during important reproductive transitions—pregnancy, the peripartum period, and
the perimenopause—will have greater cardiometabolic risk, more neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms, and
poorer sleep duration and quality. Highly prevalent exposures of interest include physiological stressors (excess
gestational weight gain, dysglycemia/gestational diabetes mellitus, elevated blood pressure/hypertensive
disorders of pregnancy, and excess postpartum weight retention) as well as social stressors (adverse childhood
events, exposures to racism and violence, and financial instability). Furthermore, we hypothesize that these
relations are mediated by adverse weight trajectories. To address these hypotheses, we will leverage Project
Viva, an ongoing, highly engaged cohort of women recruited in early pregnancy 1999–2002 (at mean age 32
years) and followed annually for almost 2 decades. This proposal provides an exceptional opportunity to inform
clinical care for aging women by leveraging outstanding existing data and resources and including over 20 years
of high- quality prospective assessments within a 5-year period. Furthermore, integration with the proposed
Brigham/Harvard Center for Stress and Neural Regulation of Reproductive Aging Health Outcomes will expand
the impact of PV through collaborative work with Project 1 and all Cores."
10870135,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Vasomotor symptoms (VMS), also known as hot flashes, are common perturbations of perceived high
temperature that women experience during menopause as a consequence of the depletion of estradiol levels.
These VMS entail profuse sweating and peripheral vasodilation that can adversely affect quality of life in
menopausal women, relevant to subsequent risk of cardiovascular disease and dementia. Recently, neurons
producing the neuropeptides kisspeptin (encoded by the Kiss1 gene), neurokinin B (NKB, encoded by Tac2),
and dynorphin (Dyn, encoded by Pdyn) and referred to as KNDy neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus
of mice have been identified as mediators of hot flashes through a common pathway that also controls pulsatile
GnRH secretion and the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Based on this dual role of
KNDy neurons, we hypothesize that factors that negatively impact reproductive function, such as stress and
hypercortisolemia, act through KNDy neurons and will also affect thermoregulation (i.e., VMS) and sleep in
menopausal patients. To this end, using mouse models of menopause and VMS, we aim to: 1) determine if
these effects occur through direct regulation of Kiss1 or indirectly through regulation of Tac2 or Pdyn; and 2)
determine if these effects occur on the KNDy neurons themselves and/or via neurons upstream of KNDy
neurons—specifically, via GABAergic neurons. In addition, given the association of the menopausal decline of
sex steroids with not only VMS but also disruption of sleep patterns, we aim to explore the relationships of
stress, corticosteroids and KNDy neurons in the absence of sex steroids with sleep disruption. The successful
completion of this proposal will offer important new mechanistic insights into the roles and effects of stress on
KNDy neurons, the HPG axis, VMS, and associated sleep disturbances with the assistance of the Sleep Core.
These insights will be critical to inform the development of new, safer and more effective tools to mitigate the
effects of stress and of hot flashes in women, as studied in Project 1 and Project 2 of this SCORE application,
and thereby improve reproductive health aging outcomes in women."

initial funding period has been to develop and sustain a clinical and translational research infrastructure that
supports improvements in rural and community health in the IDeA states of Maine, New Hampshire and
Vermont. The Administrative Core has developed the infrastructure to oversee the interactions of primary
healthcare providers, clinical investigators, scientists, trainees, navigators, and community members to
conduct clinical and translational research, with the goal of improving healthcare delivery, health outcomes,
and population health in northern New England. The primary focus of the NNE-CTR is on health challenges
affecting northern New Englanders, with a special emphasis on health disparities and inequities encountered in
underserved urban and rural populations and the barriers to prevention and treatment of chronic diseases and
rural healthcare delivery. Three specific aims are proposed for this renewal application: 1) continue to oversee
and develop the research infrastructure to support, maintain and grow clinical and translational investigation,
with a priority on expanding clinical trials to reach rural areas of northern New England, while embracing
diversity through cultural training and mentoring of NNE-CTR members; 2) expand infrastructure to enhance

expand leadership and collaboration with the Northern New England PBRN. The NNE-CTR will continue to
build and sustain an infrastructure, supported by the principles of diversity, equity and inclusion, for clinical and
translational scientists, leveraging the expertise of the two lead institutions and their partners. The NNE-CTR
will provide the platform for enhancing clinical research, healthcare delivery, and improving health outcomes

10892051,"Abstract
A vast majority of the 25,000 genes identified in the human genome are subjected to alternative splicing, and
their protein products are often heavily modified with posttranslational modifications including but not limited to
ubiquitination, phosphorylation, methylation, and acetylation, thereby vastly increasing the functional diversity of
the human proteome. However, aberrant cell signaling events caused by dysregulation of protein modifications
often lead to altered protein homeostasis and cellular function to facilitate the development of human diseases
including cancer. In keeping with a critical role for these modifications to governing tumorigenesis, inhibitors
targeting enzymes regulating these post-translational modifications have attracted extensive attention as
biomarkers and anti-cancer drug targets. To this end, the heart of my laboratory has been focused on studying
the regulatory mechanisms and physiological functions of two major multi-component protein enzyme
complexes: Cullin-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes and the Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Complex
(mTOR), as well as their interplay with other cell signaling pathways to govern cell cycle regulation and
tumorigenesis. The long-term goal of my research program is to understand how aberrant cell signaling pathways
including phosphorylation and ubiquitination influence tumorigenesis, which guides the identification of novel
drug targets for treating human cancers. Over the past thirteen years of independence, my laboratory has
established an outstanding track record of original, cutting-edge, research in the cell cycle and cancer signaling
fields. In this proposal, I have expanded our research by further deciphering the role of ubiquitination in regulating
the mTORC1 signaling pathway, as well as the interplay between ubiquitination and phosphorylation signaling
pathways to govern tumorigenesis, thereby providing mechanistic insights and the rationale to develop inhibitors
targeting key modules of cell signaling pathways including E3 ligases and kinases to enhance our capability of
creating highly targeted cancer therapies. To achieve these goals, one major theme is to use both biochemical
and genetic approaches to understand the oncogenic role of Skp2 and the tumor suppressive role of Fbw7 in
part via modulating cell metabolism through ubiquitination-mediated pathways. The second major theme of this
proposal aims to investigate the physiological and pathological impacts of GATOR2-mediated ubiquitination of
GATOR1 signaling events during cancer development in vivo, which will guide us to uncover novel therapeutic
opportunities targeting these signaling pathways. This prestigious award would therefore provide us the
necessary resources to use highly innovative approaches to tackle challenging questions such as understanding
the molecular and cellular mechanisms governing tumorigenesis to shed light on novel pathways to target cancer
more effectively. Receiving this prestigious award at this stage of my career will allow my laboratory to
concentrate more on innovative lab research to continue to make breakthrough discoveries to impact
development of the next generation of cancer therapeutics.

10864721,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite the potential for patients to make a full recovery after experiencing an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
(OHCA) due to ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT), mortality remains near
75%. This higher mortality is partly because upwards of 50% of patients do not respond to initial defibrillation
attempts. My career goal is to become an independent, federally funded physician-scientist leading a research
program focused on improving outcomes for patients experiencing OHCA. My K23’s overall objectives are to
evaluate if earlier antiarrhythmic administration is associated with improved survival after VF/VT OHCA, how
the route of administration interacts with this association, and if changing the sequence of antiarrhythmics for
VF/VT OHCA can reduce the time to antiarrhythmic therapy in a pilot feasibility trial. My central hypothesis is
that early amiodarone administration in VF/VT OHCA can improve survival significantly compared to current
guidelines. The rationale is that current cardiac arrest care guidelines for delaying antiarrhythmic therapy until
after three shocks may reduce the efficacy of these agents, increase overall arrest duration, and reduce
survival compared to an early antiarrhythmic approach. I will complete my overall objectives through three
specific aims: (1) to assess the association between the timing and route of amiodarone administration in
VF/VT OHCA and patient survival prospectively; (2) to measure the serum amiodarone concentration of VF/VT
OHCA patients to compare the bioavailability of intraosseous routes to intravenous while accounting for time
since drug administration; and (3) to perform a pilot, stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial evaluating a
modified algorithm for VF/VT treatment to reduce the interval from arrest to amiodarone administration. These
three aims will be accomplished over five years through seamless continuation of a pilot cohort, using the
region’s highest volume cardiac arrest receiving hospital to collect serum drug concentrations, and using
existing infrastructure to conduct a pilot cluster trial. Complementing these aims are five career development
aims to facilitate training in (1) exception from informed consent randomized controlled trials; (2) population
pharmacokinetic analytic techniques; (3) causal inference and multilevel modeling; (4) adaptive clinical trial
methodology; and (5) the K-to-R transition. This proposal is significant as it focuses on improving care in the
high-mortality condition of cardiac arrest, aligning with the NHLBI strategic objectives of levering data science
and optimizing therapeutic strategies for improving health. The research is innovative because it uses a cohort
that captures novel data elements, combining this with the use of serum drug concentrations to evaluate the
efficacy of the intraosseous route to ultimately inform, in combination with pilot trial results, future studies
investigating the optimal timing, route, and dose of antiarrhythmics in OHCA with downstream results that
could change cardiac arrest care guidelines used by nearly every health care professional in the world."
10864655,"Depressive symptoms are highly prevalent among post-deployment Veterans, and the
associated morbidity and mortality is excessively high. Although patient preference studies indicate
that those with depressive symptoms prefer psychotherapy over medication treatment, numerous
person-specific, interpersonal and system-level barriers can prevent Veterans with depressive
symptoms from accessing adequate psychotherapy. Internet-delivered interventions, which are
lower threshold, shows promise for the treatment of depressive symptoms in the general
population. Although internet-delivered interventions have the potential to optimize treatment
access and utilization for those with a recent onset of depressive symptoms, there is limited
evidence supporting their effectiveness in Veterans.
 Deprexis is a computerized intervention, which employs interpersonal, cognitive-behavioral
and third wave behavioral treatment techniques to target depressive symptoms and related
functional impairments. Dr. Beevers (co-mentor) previously demonstrated that Deprexis improved
well-being, and decreased depressive symptoms and disability in a general population sample. Dr.
Pearson then used machine-learning statistical methods to identify predictors of Deprexis
treatment response, with results indicating that Deprexis was most beneficial for those with mild to
moderate symptoms of depression. In the proposed study qualitative interviews will be conducted
to gain insight into Veterans’ perceptions, needs, and preferences vis-a-vis Deprexis, with results
informing a randomized controlled trial. Here an 8-week course of Deprexis will be compared to a
treatment-as-usual control condition to establish if results obtained in the general population
sample extend to Veterans with mild to moderate depressive symptoms. The results of this work
could have a profound impact on Veterans’ functional recovery by broadening the reach and
timeliness of psychological interventions for depressive symptoms. Our long-term vision is that
Deprexis can be integrated in a stepped-care approach; providing rapid intervention for individuals
with mild to moderate depressive symptoms, while reserving resource-intensive treatments such
as face-to-face psychotherapy for individuals with severe symptomatology."

Food allergy (FA) impacts approximately 33 million people in the US, contributing to substantial economic and emotional
burdens. Oral immunotherapy (OIT) is an effective treatment strategy to induce desensitization to specific food allergens,
in which participants consume increasing amounts of allergenic foods daily. However, there are several remaining
concerns that hinder its widespread implementation including the burdens of daily OIT maintenance dosing and
gastrointestinal complications such as the development of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE).
OIT participants often find that continued daily OIT maintenance dosing is challenging, causing some participants to
discontinue dosing and potentially revert to their pre-OIT allergic state with rapid loss of desensitization and increased
risk of anaphylaxis. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify whether less frequent OIT maintenance dosing
regimens can allow participants to maintain desensitization. Long-term follow up studies for participants who have
completed OIT clinical trials at our center show that 53% of participants had difficulty with continued OIT dosing, largely
due to lifestyle restrictions of when they can safely consume their daily OIT maintenance dose. This led to 30% of
participants discontinuing dosing for all their allergenic foods, highlighting the need for less burdensome maintenance
dosing options. Non-daily dosing regimen with 300 mg peanut allergen has not been sufficient, however higher
concentrations of non-daily dosing have not been investigated. In our CoFAR network-wide clinical trial we propose to
evaluate the safety and efficacy of non-daily OIT maintenance doses in maintaining peanut desensitization.
Gastrointestinal symptoms are common during oral immunotherapy (OIT) for food allergy (FA), with the majority of
patients experiencing mild to moderate symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting at some point during the
desensitization process. This raises concern for eosinophilic esophagitis which is a potential and serious side effect of OIT,
estimated to occur in 2-5% of patients on OIT. The diagnosis of EoE during OIT requires an endoscopy with biopsy to
confirm diagnosis, however, many patients forgo this procedure leading to inaccurate estimates of the true incidence.
Additionally, in a pilot study conducted by our site (POISED study), baseline eosinophilia exists in FA patients avoiding the
culprit antigen. Furthermore, OIT-induced gastrointestinal eosinophilia was mostly transient and asymptomatic. In
contrast, although most cases of OIT-associated EoE resolve with dose modification or cessation of OIT, a small subset of
FA participants have EoE symptoms that persist after stopping OIT. However, the mechanisms that drive these differences
in the clinical heterogeneity of EoE during FA treatment are not understood. FA and EoE are associated with changes in
the abundance and expression of key immune cells: eosinophils, mast cells, and gene expression profile of type 2 CD4+ T
cells in prospectively collected biopsies. Exploring these characteristics can provide valuable insights into the underlying
mechanisms and potentially help tailor treatment approaches and drive novel diagnostic techniques."

The opioid overdose crisis necessitates adapting and implementing evidence-based interventions for opioid
use disorder (OUD) in primary care settings to increase access to evidence-based treatment. Buprenorphine
treatment for OUD in primary care is highly effective, patient-centered, and recent changes have removed bar-
riers to prescribing, yet retention in these settings remains low. Measurement-based OUD treatment, a guide-
line-recommended best practice, involves collecting patient outcome data to monitor treatment response and
guide changes, thereby improving patient outcomes and retention. Patient-reported outcome measures
(PROMs) are validated instruments that assess patients' response to treatment and focus on their experience,
making them suitable for measurement-based OUD treatment. Despite the potential benefits, implementing
and maintaining measurement-based OUD treatment using PROMs in primary care settings is lacking.
This proposal aims to develop and pilot test the “Patient Reported Outcome Measures to Individualize Treat-
ment And Improve ReteNtion” (ReTAIN) program intervention package to capture PROMs in Federally-Quali-
fied Health Center (FQHC)-based OUD treatment. FQHCs are increasingly caring for patients with OUD who
come from underserved communities that are disproportionality impacted by the overdose crisis. Utilizing the
Pragmatic, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) and user-centered design strategies, we
will accomplish the following Aims: Aim 1) describe contextual factors and identify intervention package adap-
tations and ideal PROM characteristics; Aim 2) Apply user-centered design strategies to refine the ReTAIN
program intervention package adaptations; and Aim 3) Conduct a pilot randomized control trial to assess the
ReTAIN program's initial effectiveness over 6-months, feasibility, and acceptability.
Dr. Jarratt Pytell's research and training plan aligns with the national Overdose Prevention Strategy and
NIDA's strategic plan to study the implementation of evidence-based treatments in real-world settings and
bridge the evidence-to-practice gap. Dr. Pytell's long-term career goal is to become an independent clinician-
investigator leading addiction medicine implementation research in primary care. As a fellowship-trained addic-
tion medicine specialist providing primary care-based addiction treatment in an FQHC, Dr. Pytell seeks to lev-
erage the HEAL Initiative K23 award to build on his experience and receive training in implementation science,
user-centered design, and pragmatic trials. Dr. Pytell will receive guidance from an internationally recognized
team of mentors and advisors with expertise in implementation science, pragmatic trials, user-centered design,
and patient-centered decision-making who have a proven track record of independent funding and mentoring.
Completion of the research and training aims will result in a definitive trial evaluating the effectiveness of meas-
urement-based OUD care to improve OUD-related outcome across diverse FQHCs."
10865967,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Identification of targeted therapies for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a leading cause of
morbidity and mortality in the United States and globally, has lagged other lung diseases. Eosinophil count,
which has been a good biomarker for identifying type-2 inflammation and response to monoclonal therapies in
asthma has proven to be less beneficial in COPD with unclear molecular mechanism. Since COPD is a
heterogenous disease marked by systemic inflammation and high comorbidity burden it is critical that the
impact of dysfunctional platelets, which act as immune and inflammatory cells, is considered in the mechanistic
pathway of type-2 inflammation and eosinophil activation. Mounting evidence suggests that the magnitude of
platelet activation, independent of cardiovascular comorbidity, is associated with respiratory outcomes in
COPD. Activated platelets conjugate to eosinophils which leads to eosinophil activation and translocation into
the lung tissue. Understanding the role of platelet-eosinophil conjugates in COPD morbidity and associations
between platelet activation and eosinophil activity would enhance understanding of underlying mechanisms for
type-2 inflammation in COPD and lead to novel therapeutic options. To elucidate the association of activated
platelets with eosinophils in COPD we will directly measure platelet-eosinophil conjugates and eosinophil
activation using flow cytometry in 50 individuals with COPD without overt or subclinical cardiovascular disease
co-enrolled in the ongoing study ""Platelet Activation Pathways and Respiratory Morbidity in COPD"" (NHLBI
K23HL151758). We hypothesize that a higher proportion of platelet-eosinophil conjugates and activated
platelets as measured by flow cytometry will be associated with disease severity, worse respiratory symptoms,
higher proportion of circulating activated eosinophils, and more type-2 inflammation. Platelet-eosinophil
conjugates will be identified in whole blood as cells simultaneously expressing eosinophil (CCR3) and platelet
(CD42a or P-selectin) surface markers in unstimulated and agonist-stimulated samples while activated
eosinophils will be distinguished as those expressing CD69, CD63, CD29, or CD18. Proportion of activated
platelets will be identified in platelet rich plasma before and after in vitro stimulation as part of the K23 study as
those expressing P-selectin, CD63, CD40L, or PAC1. Completion of the proposed aims will elucidate the role
of platelet-eosinophil conjugates and associations of activated platelets with eosinophil activation which will
inform future pathway-specific mechanistic and interventional studies toward the ultimate goal of personalized
therapy for COPD. The proposed study uses the infrastructure and refined laboratory protocols created as part
of the K23 study to investigate the role of activated platelets with eosinophils. A more refined understanding of
the mechanisms through which eosinophils are associated with COPD morbidity could potentially reveal more
broadly applicable endotypes for targeted therapy."
10865832,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Muscle diseases caused by mutations in genes that encode for (co-)chaperones, called chaperonopathies, are
characterized by muscle weakness, degeneration, and the accumulation of protein aggregates. These
diseases currently lack a cure, highlighting an urgent need for a better understanding of the underlying
mechanisms. Protein chaperones are needed to recognize misfolded proteins and facilitate their proper folding.
The recognized misfolded proteins are termed “clients.” Classically, DNAJ proteins are thought to diversify the
function of Hsp70 by determining client specificity, but little is known about how DNAJ proteins bind and select
clients for Hsp70 and how dysfunction of DNJ proteins causes chaperonopathies in muscle. Recently,
mutations in DNAJB4 were reported to cause a chaperonopathy with similar myopathology to the known
chaperonopathy caused by DNAJB6 mutations although their phenotypes are distinctive. Our central
hypothesis is that distinct client proteins of DNAJ proteins and chaperone-chaperone availability
contribute to the phenotypic differences and selective muscle vulnerability in chaperonopathies. This
study will experimentally evaluate client proteins of DNAJ proteins in muscle, the combinatory effect of DNAJ
proteins, and skeletal muscle-specific tissue vulnerability in chaperonopathies, using recently developed
innovations (e.g., proximity labeling approach, proteomics, RNAi, RNA-seq, and small animal imaging). In Aim
1, I will Aim 1 test the hypothesis that different DNAJ proteins have common and distinct client proteins in
skeletal muscle. To identify client proteins, I will apply proteomics in TurboID proximity labeling method in
cultured cells and model mice, DNAJ knockout myotubes, and laser microdissections of inclusions from patient
muscle with DNAJB4, DNAJB5, and DNAJB6 mutations. In Aim 2, I will test the hypothesis that DNAJ-DNAJ
interactions play a synergetic role in muscle maintenance. I will employ a knockdown approach to investigate
how this network dysfunction impacts protein homeostasis, using myoblasts and proteostatic stress (e.g., drug,
heat shock). Finally, in Aim 3, I will test the hypothesis that the skeletal muscle-specific tissue vulnerability is
caused by a disruption of proteostasis, where key molecules are compromised. Using chaperonopathy mouse
models, I will thoroughly analyze the myopathology and proteostatic capacity of different skeletal muscle
groups, and perform single nucleus RNA sequencing on the most vulnerable muscle groups in model mice to
identify define vulnerable myofiber subpopulations in chaperonopathies. The proposed study will address an
unmet medical need, providing insight into disease mechanisms and thereby potentially may serve as a basis
for the development of novel treatment for chaperonopathies and a broad range of diseases related to protein
misfolding."
10866125,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lewy body disorders, a subset of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRDs), are the second most
common neurodegenerative disorders worldwide and the 14th leading cause of death in the United States.
Lewy body ADRDs are progressive, incurable, and mortality rates are rising, making end-of-life (EoL) care a
significant public health concern. The majority of persons with Lewy body ADRDs are hospitalized in their last
6 months of life with high rates of intensive care unit admission, in-hospital death, and low rates of discharge to
hospice care. Because these markers of poor care quality are often incongruent with patient care preferences,
urgent interventions are needed to improve EoL care quality in acute care hospitals. Despite this critical need,
there are two fundamental knowledge gaps in developing inpatient EoL interventions for persons with Lewy
body ADRDs: 1) lack of a prognostic model to determine risk of 6-month mortality and 2) lack of a validated
tool to measure EoL care quality. This proposal requests support for a mentored career development award for
Dr. Whitley Aamodt, a movement disorders specialist, neurodegenerative neurologist, and clinical researcher
at the University of Pennsylvania. The overarching goal of this project is to improve prognostication and EoL
care quality for hospitalized persons with Lewy body ADRDs by identifying patients at the greatest risk of death
and ensuring that hospital-based care is appropriate and aligned with care preferences. In Aim 1, Dr. Aamodt
will use comprehensive Medicare data to develop a risk-prediction model for 6-month all-cause mortality in a
nationally representative sample of hospitalized patients with Lewy body ADRDs using advanced predictive
modeling. This model will be externally validated in a second cohort of Medicare beneficiaries from the post-
pandemic period. In Aim 2, Dr. Aamodt will create, test, and externally validate a patient-centered EoL care
quality instrument based on data gathered from diverse Lewy body ADRD patients, care partners, and
practitioners using qualitative research methods and factor analysis. In executing these aims, Dr. Aamodt will
obtain additional training in neuroepidemiology, biostatistics, and qualitative research under the guidance of
mentors and advisors in epidemiologic research methods (John Farrar, MD, PhD), neurodegenerative disease
epidemiology and health services research (Allison Willis, MD, MS), predictive modeling (Warren Bilker, PhD),
qualitative research methods (Katharine Rendle, PhD, MPH), and palliative care research (Scott Halpern, MD,
PhD). The results of this project will provide fundamental knowledge about hospitalized patients with Lewy
body ADRDs nearing EoL and will guide the development of future interventions to improve EoL care quality.
This work aligns with the strategic goal of the National Institute on Aging to address EoL care needs in ADRDs.
Through the research training and mentorship gained during this career development award, Dr. Aamodt will
establish herself as an independent investigator in the field of applied epidemiology, outcomes research, and
palliative and EoL care for aging Americans with neurodegenerative diseases."
10866190,"ABSTRACT Cognitive training is a scalable, well-tolerated intervention for slowing cognitive decline and
preventing Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) with minimal side
effects. Despite much promise, there have been mixed findings on strong, reliable transfer of cognitive training
to non-trained domains in older adults at risk for AD/ADRD, including those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI),
a critical pre-clinical stage for intervention. Transfer is hypothesized to occur when a mismatch between
cognitive resources and task demands leads to increases in the efficiency with which existing cognitive resources
can be applied to untrained tasks. However, few studies have attempted to quantify mismatch. The overall
objective of this K01 award is to develop a new conceptual and operational framework for biopsychological
mismatch in cognitive training in MCI, quantified as high mental energy and task absorption (using experience
sampling) and autonomic adaptation (from electrocardiogram/ECG) both within and across training sessions.
Using an existing speed of processing training (SOPT) dataset (Aim 1) with weekly measures of mental energy
and autonomic adaptation we hypothesize that higher biopsychological mismatch across sessions will be
associated with greater far transfer to executive function and episodic memory in MCI. We will also compare
biopsychological mismatch in MCI with healthy controls. In a small pilot experiment (Aim 2) we will collect
measures of mental energy, autonomic adaptation, and task absorption during SOPT sessions in a local
community representative sample of Asian, Hispanic/Latino, and Non-Hispanic White older adults with MCI, and
hypothesize that higher biopsychological mismatch will be associated with increased near transfer from pre- to
post-session. We will also explore differences in biopsychological mismatch across racial/ethnic groups. This
K01 award application will enhance the career of Dr. Adam Turnbull, a cognitive neuroscientist and young
investigator with a strong research record in experience sampling (method) and cognitive aging (content),
allowing him to become a lead investigator in slowing and preventing AD/ADRD by developing personalized,
scalable non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs: e.g., cognitive training) addressing health disparities. The
candidate will gain research skills in: 1) behavioral intervention trial design and analysis applying principles from
the Science of Behavior Change and the NIH Stage Model, 2) novel biobehavioral measures and relevant signal
processing, data harmonization, and computational modeling; and 3) intersections on biobehavioral and
sociocultural health disparity research applying NIA Health Disparities Research Framework. Dr. Vankee Lin,
who was the candidate’s postdoc mentor with a strong track record and lab infrastructure for NPIs in AD/ADRD,
will guide the candidate in establishing his independent research program at Stanford University. The candidate
will also be mentored by Dr. Booil Jo (clinical trial design), Dr. Ehsan Adeli (machine learning), Dr. James Gross
(psychophysiology/affect science), and Dr. Michelle Odden (research in underrepresented aging populations)."

Approximately 16,000 people are diagnosed with sarcoma each year in the US. Sarcomas are the third most
common cancer affecting children constituting about 15% of all diagnosed childhood tumors. Bone tumors are
the rarest of all, with less than 3,500 cases a year or 0.2% of all cancers. Despite aggressive treatment, overall
5-year survival rates are ~60% and around 30% for metastatic disease.
There is limited data on bone sarcoma drug sensitivity beyond first line chemotherapy. In parallel, there are major
gaps in our understanding of sarcomas molecular hallmarks and drivers, with limited sequencing data available
beyond the exome. Critically, very few sarcomas have had whole-genome sequencing, longitudinal profiling or
multi-region sequencing to understand their spatio- and temporal-genomic variability. This variability is thought
to be critical to understanding treatment response and failure, and there remains an urgent need to relate these
molecular features to quantitative aspects of drug sensitivity in most tumor types.
We have established a pipeline to develop personalized bone sarcoma organoids to screen hundreds of drugs
and determine a drug resistance and sensitivity profile for each tumor. We pair this with whole-genome
sequencing to identify mutational correlates of drug sensitivity. Here we will take advantage of this pipeline to
study how the molecular and pharmacologic behavior of bone sarcomas differs spatially within a single patient
(Aim 1) and how they vary during their transition from curable primary to lethal metastatic disease (Aim 2). This
study will allow us to define how bone sarcoma metastases diverge and respond to therapy and identify
actionable drug sensitivities as well as create a detailed portrait of how bone sarcomas evolve under therapeutic
selective pressure, linked to clinical outcomes."

This clinical research identifies the robust factors that contribute to cognitive outcomes in
pediatric, adolescent, and young adult survivors (PAYAS) of medulloblastoma (MB) brain tumors
located in the cerebellum. Pediatric brain tumor survivors are at increased risk of cognitive
impairment (CI) and have substantial likelihood of poor health and disability relative to those who
do not have a cancer history, and relative to survivors who did not have to undergo lifesaving
neurotoxic chemoradiation treatment. However, individual differences in cognitive outcomes
among PAYAS of MB are diverse and wide ranging, even when the most likely clinical contributors
are the same (i.e., age at treatment, chemoradiation level of risk, MB tumor subtype). This led our
team to examine genetic diatheses and other contributors that may explain the wide range of
outcomes, from mild to severe CI. In addition to genetics, there is a need to fill important gaps in
the research to date to identify both clinical risk factors and environmental resources that identify
those at greatest risk of CI. This multisite project at NCI-designated cancer centers in GA, AL,
and OH will examine multifactorial environmental resources (e.g., neighborhood socioeconomic
adversity, material hardships, caregiving capacity, and school quality), clinical factors (e.g., age
at treatment, chemoradiation level of risk, MB tumor type), and individual genetic diathesis (i.e.,
candidate single nucleotide polymorphism variants (SNPs)). First, in Aim 1, the study will examine
each of the three domains independently using state of the art methods and innovative analyses
to identify the best predictors of CI. In other populations, polygenetic risk scores (PRS) have
provided a stronger prediction of outcomes than single SNPs alone. Therefore, within the genetic
diathesis domain, we will examine targeted SNPs and neighboring interactive mutations to create
a robust PRS utilizing machine learning tools that weights SNPs regulating RNA expression
associated with CI, and incorporates known functional impact of epigenetics, transcriptions and
proteins. Second, in Aim 2, we will create a multi-domain risk algorithm, using the most sensitive
predictors of CI across the three domains (i.e., clinical risks, environmental resources, and genetic
diathesis). This empirically derived risk algorithm will inform precision medicine, by identifying
conditions for risk-adapted chemoradiation treatment and prophylactic interventions to prevent,
mitigate and manage CI. Consistent with the STAR Act of 2018 and the Precision Medicine
Initiative, these findings will allow for early identification of individuals at risk for CI and provide
targets for treatments in order to improve overall quality of life and adaptive functioning in PAYAS
of childhood cancer."

Lung cancer is both the most common cancer worldwide and the leading cause of cancer death in the US. While
radiation therapy (RT) is a highly effective treatment for many cancers, thoracic RT carries an increased risk of
cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality that limit critical gains in cancer control and survival. Despite the
significance of this problem, we have a limited understanding of how RT results in CV toxicity, and the biologic
and functional mechanisms and predictors of CV toxicity in patients. Fundamental questions include: how does
RT affect mechanistic biologic and imaging markers of CV toxicity? Which cardiac radiation dose-volume
parameters are associated with CV toxicity? Can baseline levels or early changes in biomarkers, imaging
measures and radiation-dose volume parameters identify patients at risk of adverse CV clinical outcomes? Our
preliminary data suggest thoracic RT results in inflammation, oxidative stress, microvascular dysfunction, and
worse CV function in patients. We will extend these findings through detailed characterization of these pathways
in a multi-center, longitudinal prospective cohort of nonsmall cell lung cancer patients from the University of
Pennsylvania, Washington University, and the Brigham and Women’s Hospital treated with definitive thoracic
chemoradiation for curative intent. We focus on lung cancer given the high prevalence of disease, the important
role of RT in cancer control, the concomitant CV morbidity and mortality associated with RT, and the high RT
doses delivered to the heart. Our overall objective is to determine if RT results in early, subclinical CV dysfunction
using highly sensitive, quantitative biologic and functional measures; understand how cardiac dose-volume
parameters influence these abnormalities; and develop multi-marker strategies in risk prediction. Our multi-
center longitudinal cohort forms the basis of all Aims. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the changes in circulating
biomarkers of CV stress, inflammation and vascular dysfunction, and to define the associations with RT dose-
volume measures. In Aim 2, we will quantify RT-related changes in imaging-derived measures of CV function
and perfusion, and to define the associations with RT dose-volume measures. In Aim 3, we will determine the
prognostic value of biologic, imaging, and RT dose-volume measures as indicators of adverse CV outcomes. By
using innovative methods in deep CV phenotyping to identify high risk individuals, we will personalize the delivery
of RT and targeted cardioprotective interventions, and ultimately improve CV and overall patient outcomes. We
will leverage our experiences in precision phenotyping of cancer patients undergoing cardiotoxic therapy to
address a high-priority research gap in response to NIH PA 19-112."

Our overarching goal is to identify and characterize cancer patients at risk of developing cancer treatment-
related cardiotoxicity and to mitigate cardiovascular dysfunction while optimizing cancer outcomes. Advances
in early detection and treatment of cancer has improved 5-year survival. However, multi-modal cancer
treatment often leads to cardiotoxicity. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) events during treatment can interfere
with its delivery and thus lead to sub-optimal cancer outcomes and increased downstream morbidity, cost, and
mortality. American Heart Association (2019) guidelines recommend primary prevention with anti-
hyperlipidemic and anti-hypertensive medication in high-risk individuals, based on atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. However, it’s uncertain if primary prevention in cancer patients improves
long-term CVD outcomes. American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) (2017) guidelines has categorized
high-dose anthracyclines, targeted therapy, and certain combinations of these, as cardiotoxic regimens. The
impact of primary prevention in patients on such cardiotoxic regimens is unknown. To evaluate these
questions, we will create a unique dataset by merging Kaiser Permanente (KP)’s electronic medical records
with KP’s SEER cancer registry, KP’s medical financial assistance program, and Social Security
Administration’s supplemental income, disability, and mortality data, in a cohort of 17,000+ breast cancer
patients followed longitudinally for 5+years. We will risk stratify breast cancer patients on ASCVD risk and
evaluate the effect of primary prevention using advanced causal inference models exploring treatment effect
heterogeneity from policy and decision-making perspectives. The study aims are Aim 1: Compare effectiveness
of primary prevention pharmacological therapy on 1) cancer and CVD outcomes during chemotherapy and 2)
cancer and CVD outcomes post- chemotherapy in adults with breast cancer. Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of
primary prevention pharmacological therapy on financial toxicity and disability in adults with breast cancer.
Aim 3: Evaluate the incremental medical expenditure and cost-effectiveness of primary prevention
pharmacological therapy in adults with breast cancer using a net-benefit regression framework. Completion of
this proposal will answer crucial questions to improve patient outcomes (1) Does primary prevention prevent
future CVD events, improve/optimize cancer treatment and outcomes, reduce financial toxicity, disability, and
cost? (2) How many patients need to be treated to avoid one adverse cardiovascular or cancer outcome? (2)
What are the long-term effects of primary prevention? (3) Is primary prevention cost-effective or should
society invest its resources elsewhere?"

The rationale of this Paul Calabresi Award in Clinical Oncology Research (PCACOR) competitive renewal
application is to continue to prepare highly qualified cancer clinical researchers, called Scholars, who will become
independent leaders. These clinical research leaders will meet the ongoing need for highly trained academicians
running pivotal cancer clinical trials and/or the critical clinical correlative studies that will inform ongoing
translation from bench to bedside. Through this unique training program and the expertise of our mentors, the
Scholars will succeed in learning to communicate and coordinate multidisciplinary teams of scientists and apply
the ever-growing amount of scientific knowledge to personalize cancer treatment. Specific objectives are to: 1)
Design a flexible Individual Development Program for each Scholar selected by the multidisciplinary
Advisory Committee from applicants who may be oncology trained MDs, DOs, PhD clinicians with completed
clinical training or PhD level basic scientists committed to an academic cancer career with heavy clinical focus;
2) Foster interdisciplinary training, communication and interaction through intentional team mentoring and
regular Scholar-centered meetings, creating completed PCACOR Scholars successfully transitioned to
independence; 3) Create a diverse cohort of highly trained clinical research leaders that will run novel,
innovative multidisciplinary research agendas to move the translational of our current science to reduce the
burden of cancer. Also, these highly trained thought leaders will become part of the ongoing mentorship cycle
back to new trainees. The PCACOR design incorporates our exceptional faculty as strong mentors who will
provide training and role models in the richly supported environment of the University of Colorado Cancer Center.
Experienced Program Leaders are Virginia F. Borges, MD, MMSc, and Jill Slansky, PhD, both Professors with
extensive relevant experience. The tailored Training Period lasts for two years, with the potential for a one-
year extension and determined by the Advisory Council. The training period includes Core Requirements of a
selection of Scholar-tailored didactic coursework, a Scholar designed major research project of at least one
cancer clinical trial or ancillary study. The Training Period will focus on the specific individual training needs of
each Scholar for which mastery of these needed skills through the mentored environment will ensure transition
to independence. As an outcome metric, all Scholars submit an NIH or equivalent grant on completion of the
training. The ultimate success is demonstrated by our record of accomplishment. Thirty early career faculty
have trained as PCACOR Scholars. Seventeen Scholars are faculty members at University of Colorado Anschutz
Medical Campus; all of which have had multiple peer-reviewed publications and additional peer-reviewed funding
from NIH, DOD, ACS and/or disease-based foundations. All have designed at least one cancer clinical trial, and
several are institutional leaders and/or leading national cancer clinical trials. Our PCACOR successfully
produces the translational cancer clinical researchers of now and the future."

Penumbral salvage is a central dogma of acute stroke care. Radiological characterization of the penumbra has
transformed acute ischemic stroke care by carefully selecting patients who may benefit from acute intervention.
No such innovation has taken place in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Our central hypothesis is that there is a
“mechanical penumbra” surrounding the hemorrhage - an area that is mechanically compressed and at risk of
becoming irreversibly damaged – but still salvageable if the compression is relieved in a timely manner.
Randomized clinical trials of cerebral hematoma evacuation have not consistently shown a benefit. A potential
explanation for these results is that we have failed to radiologically select patients who may still have salvageable
tissue and are most likely to benefit from hematoma evacuation.
Most ICHs occur in the putamen and thalamus, which border the internal capsule (IC). The internal capsule
consists of the long axons of the corticospinal tract connecting the cortex with the spinal cord. Structural damage
to the IC is the major determinant of functional outcomes after ICH. Preserving the structural integrity of the IC
should therefore be the therapeutic goal. Diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance-based imaging
technique which allows for the structural assessment of axons in the white matter, such as the IC. DTI detected
damage to the IC highly correlates with long-term functional outcome after ICH. We hypothesize that this
mechanical penumbra in ICH can be evaluated using DTI imaging (using fractional anisotropy (FA) values, and
other measures). Our preliminary data support the feasibility of using DTI imaging and the ability to identify
spatial and temporal shifts of FA values at baseline and in the early hours after ICH. Identifying mechanical
penumbra may facilitate the selection of patients for surgical intervention in future clinical trials.
In this study, we propose serial MR DTI imaging at the time of ICH presentation (< 12h from symptom onset), at
24h, and at 10-14 days after injury in 24 patients. We will analyze DTI sequences for radiological markers of
permanent injury. The IC will be segmented into three zones emanating from the hematoma to determine if
there is a gradient of DTI measures (including FA values). We hypothesize that axons closest to the hemorrhage
have the lowest (damaged axons) and those furthest away from the hemorrhage have the highest (preserved
axons) FA values. Demonstrating such a gradient of FA values around the ICH suggests the presence of axons
with variable degrees of injury, some of which may still be salvageable. (Aim 1) We will then investigate the
temporal evolution of these axons and correlate the impact of this evolution on functional recovery at 3-month
follow-up (Aim 2). We hypothesize that an improved DTI measures is associated with good functional outcomes
whereas a deterioration of FA values over time is associated with poor outcomes."

Background: Mental health research faces significant challenges, including the heterogeneity of diagnostic
groups and the lack of precise characterization of individual patients, hindering effective clinical decision-making.
However, data-driven approaches, such as machine learning and computational analyses, have emerged as
crucial tools to address these challenges. By integrating data from behavioral assessments, clinical records, and
biological markers, these approaches can generate more precise and objective clinical phenotypes, leading to
improved diagnostic accuracy, personalized treatment selection, mechanistic insights, and enhanced monitoring
and prognosis. The use of data-driven approaches holds immense importance in revolutionizing mental health
research, enabling tailored interventions, and advancing our understanding and management of mental
disorders. By integrating diverse data sources and leveraging advanced computational techniques, the
Individually Measured Phenotypes to Advance Computational Translation in Mental Health (IMPACT-MH)
initiative was formed, with the goal to harness the power of big data to address the complexity and heterogeneity
of mental disorders, ultimately improving patient care and outcomes.
Research gap: Mental disorders exhibit complex characteristics, making it difficult to represent, collect, and
analyze heterogeneous data effectively. One major challenge is the absence of a unified representation for
mental health data. While the Research Domain Criteria framework (RDoC) aims to provide a systematic
framework, a formal representation using existing biomedical standards, such as ontologies, is still lacking.
Developing such standards is crucial to generate computational phenotypes. Additionally, once data standards
and normalization methods are established, disseminating them to researchers is essential for promoting the
generation of interoperable and reusable data. Moreover, ensuring the generalizability of phenotyping algorithms
beyond their original development institute and minimizing bias associated with potential errors are critical factors
for enabling broad applications of such algorithms in mental health research. Addressing these challenges is
pivotal for advancing computational phenotyping in mental health and facilitating its broader utilization.
Method: To tackle these challenges, we will establish three cores within our three Aims:
Aim 1. Project Coordination and Data Management Core. This core will facilitate effective coordination and
communication across IMPACT-MH projects. Additionally, it will build a robust data management system that
encompasses the necessary infrastructure and pipelines to efficiently gather, integrate, store, and manipulate
de-identified multi-modal data from multiple IMPACT-MH projects and submit them to NIH data repositories.
Aim 2. Data Standards Core. This core will work on defining comprehensive data standards by leveraging the
RDoC framework and existing ontologies. It will also develop a consensus process and data harmonization
methods aimed at maximizing the clinical, administrative, and scientific value of the various ascertainment and
assessment practices used across the IMPACT-MH projects.
Aim 3. Data Analytics Core. This core will focus on conducting rigorous analyses on the aggregated data from
the IMPACT-MH projects. It will develop methods to address potential biases associated with the datasets,
algorithms, and applications used. By implementing sound analytical approaches, we aim to ensure the validity
and reliability of the findings generated from the data."

This proposal aims to generate a Cre driver in mice that can be used to investigate the distinct functions and
contributions of type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) in immune responses and diseases. ILC3s, similar to CD4+
helper T lymphocytes (Th), play crucial roles in host defense and in maintaining tissue homeostasis. However,
the functional overlap between ILC3s and Th17 cells has made it challenging to study their specific contributions
in these and other contexts. Our research team identified an ILC3-specific enhancer (E22-2) associated with the
Il22 gene, which encodes a type 3 signature cytokine. We now propose to generate a mouse strain with ILC3-
specific expression of GFP-IRES-Cre using CRISPR-mediated targeting of a single-copy BAC-Il22 reporter (22-
GFP) containing E22-2 and exhibiting GFP expression that is exquisitely restricted to mature ILC3s. The
specificity and extent of Cre-mediated deletion will be determined by crossing the ILC3-specific Cre mice (22-
GFPCre) with a flox-STOP-TdTomato reporter strain. Successful completion of this project will facilitate genetic
engineering and targeted manipulation to study the ILC3-specific functions of specific factors without
confounding effects on Th17 or iNKT17 cells. Examples of such future studies include establishing the roles of
type 3 cytokines (IL-22 and IL-17A/F) in controlling infections, inflammatory bowel diseases, oncogenesis, and
innate immune responses to cancer. Additionally, deployment of the new Cre driver will shed light on factors that
govern the functional plasticity of ILC3s in inflammatory settings."

Our goal is to test a novel hypothesis in humans about the impact of chronic stress and stress-related biobehavioral processes on
stem/progenitor cell biology. Although substantial progress has been made in understanding how stress becomes biologically
embedded to produce long-term effects, crucial knowledge gaps remain. The processes implicated in biological embed-
ding have been described primarily at the level of differentiated cells types that form tissues and organ systems. Based
on the consideration that the long-term effects of stress can extend well beyond the lifespan of most differentiated
cells, whose replenishment does not occur from already-differentiated ‘parent’ cells, but occurs from stem/progenitor
cells, we advance the hypothesis that biological embedding of the effects of chronic stress may extend all the way down to the level of stem
cells, to define fundamental aspects of their biology that determine the earliest vulnerabilities for common stress- and age-related disorders.
We underscore the importance of studying fetal (newborn) stem cells, focus specifically on hematopoietic (HSCs) and
mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSCs), and on the functional capacity of their telomere and mitochondrial systems as our
primary outcomes. We operationalize chronic stress using a composite biological measure of maternal allostatic load that
incorporates the principal biomarkers of the gestational stress transmission pathway. Because stress responsivity is a key
modulator of chronic stress effects, we additionally propose to characterize this phenotype in HSCs and MSCs via an
in vitro oxidative stress [H2O2] challenge. We will conduct the proposed study in N=300 mother-child dyads; isolate
and culture newborn HSCs and MSCs from umbilical cord blood and cord tissue, respectively; and perform cellular
telomerase activity and high-resolution respirometry experiments to characterize telomere and mitochondrial functional
capacity. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that chronic stress exposure (allostatic load) is prospectively associated with reduced functional
capacity of newborn HSC and MSC telomere and mitochondrial systems. Aim 2A will test the hypothesis that chronic stress exposure
primes the stress responsivity phenotype of newborn HSCs and MSCs, and Aim 2B will determine whether antioxidant (resveratrol)
pretreatment attenuates this effect. Both aims will include tests for effect modification by sex and key covariates of telomere and
mitochondrial function. Aim 3 will elucidate the maternal sociodemographic, psychosocial, behavioral and biophysical determinants
of variation in components of allostatic load that impact newborn HSC/MSC biology using state-of-the-art machine learning and
prediction approaches. Aim 4 will establish a shared Biobank repository of HSC, MSC, cord blood, cord and placental
tissue samples for future studies of molecular mechanisms (gene expression, epigenetic profiles) and in vitro differen-
tiation. Significance and Impact: Our project will 1) define novel measures (and their norms) in human newborn
stem cells that profile the earliest vulnerabilities for cell health and risk of age-related disorders; 2) broaden under-
standing of novel cellular targets and molecular mechanisms underlying biological embedding of stress, that, in turn,
may inform the development of personalized interventions; and 3) provide shared resources (human newborn stem
cell, placenta, cord, and cord blood biobank)."
10871709,"Survival Motor Neuron protein (SMN) deficiencies cause Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), the most common
genetic cause of infant and toddler mortality. Although SMN has been implicated in transcription, RNA
processing and translation, the molecular basis of motoneuron loss is still unknown. We recently discovered a
novel activity of SMN: biomolecular condensation caused by SMN’s globular tudor domain (SMNTud), which
binds ligands modified by dimethylarginine (DMA). Although there are hundreds of DMA-modified proteins
in cells, the correspondence between tudor domains and their DMA ligands remains unknown. This
understudied post-translational modification is potentially dynamic and has emerging roles in multiple
neurological diseases through the altered functions of cellular compartments known as biomolecular
condensates (BMCs). Our central hypothesis is SMNTud binding to DMA ligands plays critical roles in cellular
organization, which are especially vulnerable in the neuromuscular system.
Our findings highlight a critical need to comprehensively determine the DMA ligands of SMNTud and the activities
of the interaction modules they form. SMN is diffusely cytoplasmic and present in nuclear BMCs called Cajal
bodies, which are essential for embryonic development. Cajal bodies are scaffolded by a known SMNTud ligand
and altered in SMA. During stress, SMN forms BMCs in the cytoplasm. Our preliminary results directly
implicate DMA binding and biomolecular condensation in SMA, because SMNTud activity was blocked by a
single amino acid mutation, E134K, that blocks binding to DMA ligands and causes SMA. Chemical inhibitors
of DMA drastically altered the composition and substructure of Cajal bodies, which we determined for the first
time with our collaborator and co-I, Dr Joerg Bewersdorf. The identities of the full complement of DMA ligands
that bind SMNTud and those that affect Cajal bodies have been unknown until now. Our preliminary data reveal
~70 novel and specific SMNTud ligands, indicating that new insights relevant to SMA are within our grasp.
The overall objectives of this new application are to (i) identify the DMA ligands of SMNTud that mediate
biomolecular condensation, (ii) understand the dynamicity of asymmetric (aDMA) and symmetric (sDMA)
installed by arginine methyltransferases and removed by demethylases with respect to the structure and
function of BMCs, and (iii) reveal novel SMN functions by leveraging DMA-SMNTud interaction modules. Our
rationale is that objectives concerning DMA-SMNTud interaction modules will be most accessible to rigorous
analysis through a combination of biochemistry and state-of-the-art imaging, using mouse and zebrafish cells
and tissues, including motoneurons, with which we have expertise. If achieved, our aims will discover novel
SMN binding partners and functions of SMNTud in biomolecular condensation. The regulatory potential and
dynamicity of the DMA modification, a source of tissue specificity and disease etiology, will be determined.
Identification of DMA-SMNTud interaction modules will suggest new therapeutic approaches for SMA."

 Dr. Bollyky is a mid-career investigator who has developed a successful, translational research program
focused on bacteriophages – viruses that infect bacteria - and bacterial wound and airway infections. He is also
a highly productive research mentor, serving as a director of the physician-scientist training program for the
medical residency program as well as training numerous residents, fellows, and medical students in his own lab.
 The goal of this K24 is to provide Dr. Bollyky with protected time to grow his patient-oriented research
program and mentor additional clinical fellows, junior faculty and other trainees in patient-oriented research. The
proposal also provides for dedicated time and resources to help Dr. Bollyky enhance his own mentoring skills,
obtain scientific and career guidance from an advisory committee, sharpen his skills in vaccinology and
microbiology, and expand his knowledge and technical skills in human clinical studies.
 The scientific focus of this work is bacteriophages – viruses that infect bacteria – and their impact on bacterial
infections. Phages are abundant in the human body but their impact on human health is largely unknown.
 The Bollyky lab has recently reported that phages produced by the major bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (Pa) promote chronic Pa infections. In particular, they have identified a novel mechanism by which
filamentous Pf phages produced by Pa contribute to antibiotic tolerance by functioning as structural elements in
Pa biofilms – slimy communities of bacteria and polymers that allow bacteria to colonize airways and other
surfaces. Pf phages organize host and microbial polymers in ways that produce a robust biofilm that resists
penetration by antibiotics, leading to antibiotic resistance. Their team recently published that Pf phages are
associated with heightened antibiotic resistance in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disease associated
with thick, tenacious sputum and chronic lung infections with Pa.
 It may be possible to protect against Pa infection by targeting Pf phages. The Bollyky Lab recently developed
a vaccine that targets Pf phages to prevent Pa infections. However, it is unclear whether antibodies against Pf
phages naturally occur and whether these are protective against Pa infection.
 Here, Dr. Bollyky will test the hypothesis that Pf phages contribute to antibiotic resistance and chronic
infections while Pf antibodies protect against this. In Aim 1 they will define how Pf phages contribute to antibiotic
tolerance in Pa biofilms. In Aim 2 they will define how Pf antibodies protect against Pa infections. Finally, in Aim
3 they will determine whether Pf and anti-Pf phage antibodies influence clinical outcomes in patients with CF.
 Together, these studies will give rise to novel therapeutic targets and treatment strategies against Pa biofilm
infections and launch the careers of multiple young physician scientists. Protected time for career development
and mentoring will allow Dr. Bollyky to broaden the scope and influence of his and his trainees’ work and help to
sustain and grow the patient-oriented research enterprise of the NIAID and the NHLBI."

 Many of the estimated four million adults in the U.S. with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI)
resulting from neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative diseases cannot rely on current assistive technologies
(AT) for communication. During a single day, or as their disease progresses, they may transition from one access
technology to another due to fatigue, medications, changing physical status, or progressive motor dysfunction.
There are currently no clinical or AT solutions that adapt to the multiple, dynamic access needs of these
individuals, leaving many people poorly served. This competitive renewal, called BCI-FIT (Brain Computer
Interface-Functional Implementation Toolkit) adds to our innovative multidisciplinary translational research
conducted over the past 11 years for the advancement of science related to non-invasive BCIs for communication
for these clinical populations. BCI-FIT relies on active inference and transfer learning to customize a completely
adaptive intent estimation classifier to each user's multiple modality signals in real-time. The BCI-FIT acronym
has many implications: our BCI fits to each user's brain signals; to the environment, offering relevant personal
language; to the user's internal states, adjusting signals based on drowsiness, medications, physical and
cognitive abilities; and to users' learning patterns from BCI introduction to expert use.
 Three specific aims are proposed: (1) Develop and evaluate methods for optimizing system and user
performance with on-line, robust adaptation of multi-modal signal models. (2) Develop and evaluate methods for
efficient user intent inference through active querying. (3) Integrate language interaction and letter/word
supplementation as input modalities in real-time BCI use. Four single case experimental research designs will
evaluate both user performance and technology performance for functional communication with 35 participants
with SSPI in the community, and 30 healthy controls for preliminary testing. The same dependent variables will
be tested in all experiments: typing accuracy (correct character selections divided by total character selections),
information transfer rate (ITR), typing speed (correct characters/minute), and user experience (UX) questionnaire
responses about comfort, workload, and satisfaction. Our goal is to establish individualized recommendations
for each user based on a combination of clinical and machine expertise. The clinical expertise plus user feedback
added to active sensor fusion and reinforcement learning for intent inference will produce optimized multi-modal
BCIs for each end-user that can adjust to short- and long-term fluctuating function. Our research is conducted
by four sub-teams who have collaborated successfully to implement translational science: Electrical/computer
engineering; Neurophysiology and systems science; Natural language processing; and Clinical rehabilitation.
The project is grounded in solid machine learning approaches with models of participatory action research and
AAC participation. This project will improve technologies and BCI technical capabilities, demonstrate BCI
implementation paradigms and clinical guidelines for people with severe disabilities."
10869958,"Protein-mediated membrane fusion is essential for a multitude of fundamental biological processes. Despite
intensive study, at present we have a limited mechanistic understanding of how fusion protein machinery
manipulates lipid membranes in order to induce their fusion. This lack of knowledge is particularly acute regarding
the structure of membrane intermediates, the extent to which their leaflets are bent or disrupted into nonbilayer
structures, and how they are coordinated and remodeled by fusogens. Similarly, in terms of the structure of the
fusion proteins themselves, very little structural information is available to describe how they change as they
drive membrane fusion. These are processes that are targeted by therapeutics such as fusion inhibitors or
neutralizing antibodies in the case of preventing virus infection, and they are processes that can go awry as a
result of disease mutations for cellular fusogens. The proposed studies will expand our understanding of these
fundamental processes and reveal general principles employed by divergent fusion machines. Cryo-electron
microscopy and structural mass spectrometry provide powerful complementary methods to directly image and
probe membrane fusion because they allow us to trigger a fusion reaction under native conditions then trap and
then image or analyze intermediate states over the course of the reaction. Cryo-electron tomography in particular
can resolve individual fusion machines and membrane leaflets captured in the process of fusing and can discern
when the proteins and membranes have adopted non-canonical intermediate structures. Hydrogen/deuterium-
exchange mass spectrometry complements cryo-EM by enabling us to monitor local backbone dynamics under
native conditions. This approach is particularly effective for tracking conformational changes and for comparing
protein structure in different states. Building on our work with influenza virus, we will apply these methods to
investigate pathways of membrane fusion in two Class I viral fusion systems: the Env fusion protein used by HIV
and the S spike protein used by SARS-CoV-2. These fusion machines employ sequential modes of activation
and triggering involving receptor priming followed by either coreceptor binding (Env) or a proteolytic cleavage
event (S). These systems thus offer the opportunity to analyze in detail the fusion system arrested at an
intermediate, primed stage. For each of these systems, our goal is to image the architecture and progression of
membrane remodeling leading to formation of fusion pores and to understand the means by which the protein
machinery induces two separate membrane bilayers to join into one. By performing such an analysis, we will
gain novel insight into general, obligatory events in Class I protein-mediated membrane fusion, while also
revealing system-specific mechanisms. Our study should thus advance our structural and mechanistic
understanding of the fundamental process of biological membrane fusion while also providing valuable insight
into the mechanism of host invasion by two viruses that have ignited major pandemics impacting global health
and society."

As healthy individuals increasingly can receive genomic testing results that indicate their risk for poor
outcomes (e.g. diseases or adverse drug reactions), healthcare providers will need to ensure that the results
are handled prudently, by addressing the receipt of the results, the workflow challenges, and liability issues.
Given that clinical genomic tests can be initiated outside of the clinical setting (e.g., in a research study), from
the clinician’s perspective, they can be characterized as unsolicited genomic results (UGR). Clinical decision
support (CDS) has great potential to ease the adoption of UGR by providing clinicians with recommendations
and patient-related information presented at particular times to enhance clinical care. Deploying CDS for UGR
in a healthcare setting in a scalable way, however, will depend on our capacity to leverage local institutional
policy and oversight structures to approve of CDS guidance and strategies for UGR. The specific objective of
this research program is to develop and evaluate the Evidence-based Decision support Implementation
over Time (EDIT) model for prioritizing and revising deployed CDS for UGR. The EDIT model will empower
local oversight committees such as Pharmacy & Therapeutics committees to have a role in the CDS review
and deployment processes within existing institutional social systems using accepted organizational
processes. The direct benefits of this work will be an EDIT dashboard that can be used by oversight
committees to prioritize new and to revise deployed CDS, and infrastructure to close the loop of the learning
health system by transferring CDS revisions approved by oversight committee members into deployed CDS for
UGR. EDIT model implementation will be informed by mixed methods research strategies: Strategy 1, we will
conduct focus groups with oversight committee members in order to understand current roles, tasks and goals
of the committee, as well as to capture opinions about the best processes to prioritize, review and approve of
new and revised CDS for UGR as part of committee meeting activities. Research Strategy 2, we will conduct a
survey study with patients to assess preferences for the return of UGR with CDS and usability studies with
oversight committee members to gather feedback on the EDIT dashboard design. Strategy 3, we will conduct
time-motion observations of local oversight committee meetings prior to and after deploying the EDIT model in
order to plan a future, multi-institution, time-motion study with statistical power to detect differences between
oversight committees that use the EDIT dashboard and those that do not. The hypothesis is that time spent
prioritizing new and revised CDS will be shorter with use of the EDIT dashboard. Overall, the EDIT model
establishes processes that lower barriers to implementing robust genomic medicine programs that can be
followed by others. The Genomic Innovator Award will enable me to study, in team-science projects, how the
EDIT model can accelerate the institutional review and approval process of CDS for UGR. The broader impact
of this work is being able to study rate of UGR adoption by healthcare providers for deployed CDS for UGR."

Fertility preservation is a significant concern of pediatric cancer patients undergoing gonadotoxic therapies.
The rate of premature menopause is significantly increased in childhood cancer survivors when compared to
their siblings without a history of cancer, and this has important implications for quality of life as well as overall
health. With increased awareness of oncofertility, more patients are seeking fertility preservation as part of
their cancer care. Currently, the only available option for fertility preservation for female pre-pubertal patients is
ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC), yet OTC has been optimized for adult ovaries. Our main goal is to
elucidate mechanisms that lead to the improvement and expansion of fertility preservation options for pediatric
cancer survivors. Ex vivo in vitro maturation studies have shown that follicles isolated and matured from pre-
pubertal ovaries exhibit reduced developmental competence than their post-pubertal counterparts. This
suggests that progression through puberty is important in determining reproductive potential. Previous work
has elucidated the contribution of the hormonal environment in puberty, however, microenvironment changes
occurring with puberty have yet to be defined. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that pre-pubertal ovaries
display fundamental differences when compared to post-pubertal ovaries. In terms of structure, pre-pubertal
ovaries are less likely to display compartmentalization, which may explain recent observations of primordial
follicles present in tissue fragments discarded from pediatric OTC. Stromal cell populations may also be
influenced by the pubertal transition, as specific cellular populations are recruited by late stage follicles in
post-pubertal, cycling ovaries. In mice, this heterogenous and incompletely characterized population has been
shown to impact follicle growth and maturation by molecular factors that remain undefined. These
observations lead to my hypothesis that structural, molecular, and cellular changes in the pediatric
ovarian microenvironment across the human pubertal transition contributes to reproductive potential.
This hypothesis will be tested across three aims. In aim 1, I will establish the progression of structural
compartmentalization of the ovary across human puberty using analysis of donated punch biopsies. In aim 2, I
will use a multi-omics approach to establish a spatially resolved, single cell atlas of the pediatric ovary. In aim
3, I will elucidate contributions of stromal cell paracrine signaling to follicle maturation using an in vitro co-
culture system. Taken together, these aims will provide foundational knowledge regarding the biology of the
pediatric ovarian microenvironment, informing clinical practice and future work that maximizes fertility
preservation options for pediatric cancer survivors."

 Previously, we have taken an innovative approach (The Human Brainome; [1-6]) to mapping risk loci for
late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). Rather than looking at a single layer of information as in most genome-
wide association (GWAS) studies, we have mapped genomic variation in the context of downstream
transcriptomic and proteomic expression. This allows for mapping both the crucial variation involved in LOAD,
as well as the downstream effects and their directions. Additionally, it allows for building networks of multiple
players crucial for disease processes.
 One shortcoming of the current work is that we have mapped DNA-expression relationships that are subtly
changed in Alzheimer's, but we have yet to fully understand why those DNA-expression relationships are
altered. We know that expression is altered by specific alleles, but there must be added regulation given our
mapped outputs. One target that can alter pathways are natural antisense transcripts (NATs), which can bind
to oligonucleotide products and alter their expression and degradation. In our application, we propose to use
long read sequencing technology (SMRT; Single Molecule, Real-Time) and fully profile RNA from our human
brain bank samples. We will examine where these outputs are located and perform preliminary work to
determine if any of these new hits can act on our existing results.
 We propose to follow these targets through 3 Aims. Aim 1 will involve following hits from public databases.
Aim 2 will involve collecting additional RNA profiling data. Finally, Aim 3 will seek to validate and order all novel
findings from Aims 1 and 2. It is important to use technologies appropriate to our hypothesis for the new data
collection. The majority of non-coding RNA belongs to the class of transcripts called long non-coding RNA
(lncRNA), which can span from 1000-10,000 bp [7]. Typical short-read RNA sequencing (SRS) technologies
are based on the capture of short sequences of ~150 bp, and therefore, SRS has difficulty in capture and
alignment of longer products. We are working with Robert Sebra at the Icahn Institute for Genomics and
Multicale Biology, who is an expert in SMRT sequencing [8]. This technology offers longer read lengths and will
be unique-in-field, since most human RNA profiling involves SRS.
 By the completion of these Aims, we will have 1. A map of novel long read sequencing in human brain
tissues, which will be a significant add-to-field, given most technologies used to date are focused on short read
sequencing, and there is limited profiling in pathologically defined human brain tissues, 2. An understanding of
how these novel hits are affecting both the direct sense transcript of interest as well as the known LOAD
pathologies, 3. Multi-level mapping of rigor and reproducibility of targets through the use of multiple capture
techniques and 4. Validation of the effect of hits on the known LOAD pathogenic targets by measuring both
expression and protein levels in cell culture."

Globoid Cell Leukodystrophy (GLD) is a demyelinating central nervous system (CNS) disease that results in
death in 99% of children before the age of 5 years old. Loss of function mutation in galactocerebrosidase in GLD
leads to a toxic build-up of the lipid psychosine, which is currently thought to underlie the development of this
disease. The rapid progression of behavioral and cognitive deficits present in GLD is devastating for both patients
and families, however current treatments have limited success at modulating these symptoms. Therefore, it is
critical to further understand the complex cellular changes associated with the pathology of this disease to
develop successful therapies for these patients. Our lab has recently identified a novel role for CD8+ T cells in
the pathology of GLD, however the mechanism underlying the recruitment and activation of these CD8+ T-cells
is unknown. It is known that microgliosis is a prominent feature of GLD neuropathology and our preliminary data
indicate that activated CD68+ microglia are anatomically clustered with CD8+ T-cells in demyelinated lesions in
GLD. We also find that microglia upregulate major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) when exposed to
psychosine. Together, these findings indicate that microglia are a plausible antigen presenting cell type
contributing to CD8+ T-cell activation and neuropathology in GLD. We hypothesize that microglial MHC I
expression contributes CD8+ T-cell activation in GLD. Accordingly, in this proposal, we will define and test
the role of microglial MHC I on GLD neuropathology and CD8+ T-cells activation. In Aim 1, we will define the
temporal and anatomical expression patterns of microglial MHC I expression in a GLD mouse model over the
time course of disease. We will also use imaging mass cytometry to corroborate these findings using human
GLD neurospecimens to translate our findings. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of microglial MHC I function
to neuropathology and CD8+ T cell responses in twitcher mice using microglial cell-specific MHC I knockout
mice in the GLD mouse model to investigate effects on disease course, neuropathology and CD8+ T-cell
responses. We will also functionally examine the capability of psychosine to direct microglial MHC I antigen
presentation and CD8+ T-cell activation. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the novel role of
microglial antigen presentation in GLD neuropathology. The expected impact of this project may be a shift in our
thinking on the nature of demyelination in this untreatable disease and the role of microglia in neuropathology.
The training goals of this application will provide both skills and training in neuroimmunology and to enhance
clinical, and professional goals directed toward my future as a physician scientist. Toward these goals, this highly
translational project will take advantage of a strong intellectual environment and unique opportunities available
at UConn School of Medicine and in the sponsor's lab. Collectively, the expected outcomes of this proposal will
foster and support my career aspirations to achieve training in neurological and immunological interactions and
to contribute to the field of neurological disease."

program as he seeks to delineate a new class of neurogenetic disease: the disorders of genome organization.
 This emerging class of genomic disorders involve mutations encoding components that regulate the 3D
organization of chromosomes. This work will elucidate the molecular and phenotypic consequences of mutation
of these genes. Specifically, Dr. Boone proposes to: 1) model these disorders using patient-derived and
CRISPR-generated iPSC and neural lineage cell lines; 2) Characterize alterations to the 3D genome (via Hi-C)
and transcriptome (via RNA-seq), as well as the human phenotype (via exams and history); and 3) Attempt to
correct these defects in cellular models via CRISPRa/i of genes in this network. The work will improve the
diagnosis and understanding of these disorders and lay the groundwork for targeted therapy. It will also generate
fundamental knowledge about the spatial organization of the genome and the regulatory purpose it serves.
 The career development plan includes training in in vitro neurodevelopmental disease modeling, design and
analysis of functional genomic experiments, and cohort building. The candidate will learn all the requisite skills
needed for an independent research career, including supervising trainees and staff, responsible conduct of
research, grant writing, scientific communication, and lab management. His primary mentor, Dr. Michael
Talkowski, is Associate Professor of Neurology at MGH and Institute Member at the Broad Institute. Dr.
Talkowski is an experienced mentor and recognized expert in statistical, computational, and functional genomics.
His co-mentor, Dr. Gusella, is a renowned molecular geneticist with considerable experience in disease modeling
and molecular mechanisms. The mentorship committee also includes diverse expertise in genome organization
and neuronal function (Drs. Leonid Mirny and Kristen Brennand), clinical phenotyping (Dr. Angela Lin), and
genetic counseling (Diane Lucente). Dr. Boone thus has access to the unique convergence of leading-edge
genomics training environments at MGH, Harvard, MIT, and the Broad Institute, and remarkable physician-
scientist training at MGH and BCH. Dr. Boone, his mentors, and their institutions are fully committed to this
proposal and to his goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist and leader in clinical neurogenetics."
10866614,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 This is a K23 career development award application for Dr. David Soleimani-Meigooni, a behavioral
neurologist and Clinical Instructor who is establishing himself as a junior investigator at the University of
California, San Francisco (UCSF) Memory and Aging Center (MAC). His long-term goal is to become a
clinician-scientist who will lead an independent research program to advance the pre-clinical
development/translation of novel PET tracers for diagnosis and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases
associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) pathology. Through the K23 and the optimal training
environment and resources of the MAC, Dr. Soleimani-Meigooni aims to achieve these training goals: 1. To
become proficient in pharmacokinetic radiotracer modeling and optimization of PET image acquisition. 2. To
become proficient in quantitative PET analyses. 3. To learn quantitative neuropathology techniques. 4. To gain
advanced skills in study design and biostatistics. 5. To gain skills in clinical research operations, research
ethics, and grantsmanship. 6. To implement his K23 training and findings into an R01 that will allow him to
become an independent investigator involved in pre-clinical development/translation of novel PET tracers for
FTLD. To achieve these training goals, Dr. Soleimani-Meigooni has assembled a world-class mentorship team
including primary mentor, Dr. Gil Rabinovici, a behavioral neurologist and leader in PET neuroimaging of
neurodegenerative diseases; co-mentor, Dr. William Jagust, a behavioral neurologist and expert in technical
aspects of PET imaging, including radiotracer development and pharmacokinetic modeling; co-mentor, Dr. Lea
Grinberg, a neuropathologist, co-leader of the UCSF Neurodegenerative Disease Brain Bank, and expert on
FTLD and quantitative neuropathological measures; collaborator, Dr. Suzanne Baker, a scientist with technical
expertise in PET imaging; and, collaborator, Dr. Isabel Elaine Allen, an expert biostatistician.
 This project will evaluate/validate new PET tracers to aid in diagnosis and monitoring of FTLD. Candidate
PET tracers include a novel ligand that binds to non-Alzheimer tau proteins, [18F]PI-2620, and another ligand
that binds to synapses, [18F]SynVesT-1. Further evaluation is needed to determine if [18F]PI-2620 can
distinguish FTLD with tau pathology (FTLD-tau) from FTLD with TDP-43 pathology (FTLD-TDP), and if
[18F]SynVesT-1 is a sensitive marker of synapse loss and disease state in FTLD. In this project, both tracers
will be evaluated/validated by comparing patterns of tracer retention in patients with FTLD-tau to FTLD-TDP
and other neurodegenerative diseases (Aim 1); correlating regional tracer retention to clinical measures and
structural brain MRI changes (loss of cortical thickness or subcortical volume) (Aim 2); and performing
quantitative PET-to-pathology correlations (Aim 3). This project provides critical data that could support the
translation of these radiotracers for clinical use and application as clinical trial biomarkers."
10869240,"Neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD) is closely associated with the accumulation of α-
synuclein (α-syn) protein aggregates known as Lewy bodies. Understanding the diverse conformations
adopted by α-syn in both healthy and diseased states is crucial for developing effective interventions.
Recent advances in structural biology have provided valuable insights into the structural diversity of α-
syn amyloid fibrils. However, the extent to which these in vitro models represent the conformations
amplified in biological settings remains uncertain. This uncertainty hinders our ability to develop tools
like PET-tracers, small molecules that bind to amyloid fibrils that can be used to localize and monitor
disease progression in vivo. This project aims to bridge this gap by determining if the amyloid
conformations that can be propagated in vitro can be propagated inside cells. To do so, we will leverage
the sensitivity gains of dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy to investigate the conformations of α-syn fibrils amplified inside cells and compare them
with in vitro amplified fibrils. By using biosensor cell lines capable of propagating α-syn amyloid
conformations, we will examine the structural features of α-syn fibrils in cellular environments. This
knowledge will facilitate the optimization of in silico structure-based and chemical screens to identify
selective α-syn ligands."
10869079,"The classic example of supervised learning occurs at the parallel fiber (PF) to Purkinje cell synapse in the
cerebellum, where plasticity depends on co-activity of the climbing fiber (CF) input, which – according to the
theories of Marr, Albus and Ito – provides the error signal. In a wider interpretation, this signal is instructive in
nature, and might be related to error, sensory omission, as well as reward or reward-prediction. Depending on
the proper timing intervals between the two stimuli, CF co-activity with the PF input promotes synaptic long-
term depression (LTD) at PF synapses and thus helps to optimize synaptic input weights. This well-studied
function of CFs within the cerebellar system is in stark contrast to what is known about the potential relevance
of CF activity outside of the cerebellum. A plausible anatomical pathway for various interactions with
neocortical areas has been described, which includes activation of Purkinje cells, and the subsequent signal
transfer via cerebellar nuclei and thalamic nuclei, e.g. the ventral lateral (VL) and posteriormedial nuclei (Pom).
Here, we ask whether CF co-activity can provide an instructive signal that affects receptive field (RF) plasticity
in the primary somatosensory (S1; barrel) cortex of mice. Preliminary data from our laboratory show that
repetitive activation of individual whiskers enhances whisker representation in the barrel cortex as assessed by
intrinsic optical imaging. Optogenetic co-activation of channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2)-expressing CFs in the
cerebellum suppresses this form of cortical RF plasticity. These data show that indeed CF signaling may act as
an instructive signal for plasticity outside of the cerebellum and supervises learning in the neocortex. However,
intrinsic imaging does not provide information about participating cellular structures, e.g. which neurons
change in this form of RF plasticity and which neurons ultimately mediate the effects of CF activity. In this
study, we propose to use two-photon microscopy and optogenetics in awake mice to address the following
questions. First, we will assess how whisker stimulation affects S1 cortex circuitry (aim 1). We will test the
hypothesis that the RF plasticity observed with intrinsic imaging is due to an increase in the activity of L2/3
pyramidal neurons. We will also zoom in on parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons to follow up on our
pilot data that show that these PV+ interneurons downregulate their activity after whisker tetanization. Second,
we will examine how optogenetic co-activation of CF terminals in the cerebellum with 470nm light pulses
impairs activity changes in these neuronal populations (aim 2). Next to pyramidal neurons, our focus will again
be on PV+ interneurons, as our pilot data show that optogenetic CF stimulation drives activation of these
inhibitory neurons, thus providing a potential pathway for the observed impact on the cortical network. Third,
we will study whether direct optogenetic Purkinje cell activation mimics the effects of CF activation, addressing
the question whether CFs act via the cerebellar cortex or a direct effect on the cerebellar nuclei (aim 3). This
work will be the first to investigate whether CF signaling has an instructive role beyond the cerebellum."
10870495,"PROJECT SUMMARY……………………………………………………………………………………………………
Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) describes infection on and around an orthopedic implant used for joint
replacement. PJI is the most common devastating complication following joint replacement surgery. Treatment
of PJI often involves multiple revision surgeries as well as months to over a year of antibiotics. Current PJI
treatment strategies can have high failure rates, and further adverse outcomes from PJI include amputation or
death, with mortality in patients with PJI often over 10%. There is a critical need for enhanced methods to
prevent PJI and eradicate PJI once it has occurred. The most problematic unaddressed feature of PJI is
bacterial biofilm formation, which is a composition of substances secreted outside the bacterial cell that
provides a protective barrier against antibiotics and the host immune response. Bacterial biofilm formation, and
its influence on antibiotic and immune mediated bacterial clearance, occurs as early as hours following
infection. Outside the context of the orthopedic setting and PJI, a novel biofilm disrupting antibody (anti-DNABII
monoclonal antibody) has been developed. Validation of the efficacy of this antibody has been rigorously
tested in vitro, as well as animal models of otitis media (middle ear infection) and pneumonia and has been
demonstrated to diminish bacterial biofilm biomass by over 90% and enhance clearance of infection in vivo.
This anti-DNABII antibody is currently undergoing Phase 1 clinical trials in patients with bacterial pneumonia. In
this investigation, we will test anti-DNABII antibody in a mouse model of PJI using the most common clinical
cause of PJI, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Aim 1 will determine if implants coated with anti-DNABII
antibody can prevent implant biofilm in a mouse model of PJI. We hypothesize that localization of anti-DNABII
antibody to the implant, at the time of implant surgery and bacterial inoculation, will substantially diminish S.
aureus bacterial biofilm formation on the implant in the mouse PJI model. Aim 2 will determine if anti-DNABII
antibody eradicates persistent S. aureus infection in a mouse model of PJI. We hypothesize localized delivery
of anti-DNABII antibody through intra-articular injection to the infected surgical site, starting at day 7 following
implant placement and S. aureus inoculation, will result in collapse and disintegration of the bacterial biofilm
and allow complete eradication of infection in combination with antibiotic treatment in the mouse PJI model.
Data generated from this investigation will inform future pre-clinical as well as clinical studies to investigate the
ability of anti-DNABII antibody to eradicate or prevent PJI."
10873229,"SUMMARY
Therapies to treat Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the types of inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD) characterized by severe chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, have greatly improved over the
past three decades; yet, a large proportion of IBD patients fail to achieve sustained remission. Genetic
biomarkers may offer an avenue toward the dissecting heterogeneity of disease etiology, and improving
personalized therapeutic approaches. Our group has recently identified a coding gain-of-function mutation in the
LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2) gene that conferred a ~70% increased CD risk and affected CD age of
onset, disease location, LRRK2 kinase activity, and autophagy flux. Importantly, LRRK2 has also attracted
considerable attention for its causal link to Parkinson's disease (PD). Further analyses identified dozens of
additional variants within LRRK2 that were associated with the risk of both CD and PD, suggesting shared
pathogenesis between these diseases. Given extensive efforts to target LRRK2 kinase activity as a means to
treat PD, we explored known LRRK2 inhibitors developed for PD as potential therapies for IBD. We showed that
selective LRRK2 inhibitors have ameliorated experimental colitis and reduced inflammatory cytokine TNF-α
levels, a hallmark of IBD-associated inflammation, in dendritic cells of IBD patients. However, studies of LRRK2
kinase inhibition in preclinical models suggest that brain penetration and toxicity in peripheral tissues may be a
critical safety liability for these inhibitors in IBD patients. To advance this therapeutic hypothesis, we have
developed structure-based approach to design novel gut-restricted LRRK2 inhibitors, synthesized prototype
inhibitors, crystallized analogs in complex with kinases mutants that mimic LRRK2 binding site and tested their
LRRK2 potency and efficacy, which are maintained. Thus, we are proposing, starting from known LRRK2
inhibitor structures to 1) Develop proof-of-concept gut-restricted LRRK2 inhibitors as potential IBD therapeutics
using structure-based drug design and medicinal chemistry; 2) Evaluate novel compounds for LRRK2 inhibition,
in vitro absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and pharmacokinetics, off-target selectivity, and effects on
cellular substrate phosphorylation and cytokine activity using biochemical and cell-based assays, and 3) Pre-
clinically validate new inhibitors for in vivo absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and pharmacokinetics,
plasma exposures, and effects on inflammatory biomarkers and severity of experimental colitis. Our hypothesis
is that gut-restricted LRRK2 inhibitors could be a safe and effective therapeutic target of IBD therapy in the
presence or absence of IBD-associated LRRK2 mutations. These studies will provide a basis for future clinical
trials aimed at testing LRRK2 as an effective drug target for IBD. We believe our strong preliminary data and
relevant therapeutic hypothesis align well with the research goals and objectives of PAR-19-294 and will help
improve the current standard of clinical care for patients with this disease of interest to the National Institute of
Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases."
10873231,"Chronic pain affects over 100 million American adults, with an estimated cost of $560-635 billion annually, yet
this major burden is relatively understudied in African Americans (AAs). Older adults are at increased risk of
having multiple painful conditions and are living longer with the negative impacts of chronic pain. Chronic pain,
regardless of anatomy or diagnosis involved (e.g., back pain, migraine), is the leading cause of disability
worldwide. Limited insights into whether common mechanisms underlie all pain conditions, regardless of
diagnosis, has contributed to inadequate pain management options. Health care providers who treat one pain
condition (e.g., joint pain) typically do not manage symptoms in other parts of the body (e.g., abdominal pain),
and patients are often referred from one specialist to another. Studying commonalities of various chronic
overlapping pain conditions (COPC) in community-based cohorts unselected for pain conditions can provide
novel insights into causes and consequences of chronic pain as a disease itself. For example, neurophysiologic
alterations in pain processing such as pain sensitization (assessing ascending pain pathways) and conditioned
pain modulation (CPM) (assessing descending pain modulation) may be common mechanisms underlying all
chronic pain. Such knowledge would spur development of novel pain management approaches for all types of
pain regardless of anatomy or diagnosis involved. Despite the substantial public health burden of chronic pain,
little is known about the epidemiology and evolution of COPC in older AA adults, nor of the impact of COPC on
physical or psychosocial function, risk of nursing home admission, and mortality in older AAs. We propose to
evaluate chronic pain in the upcoming study visit of a thoroughly-characterized community-based older AA cohort
unselected for any pain complaints, the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) (N~2540, two-thirds ≥age 65). We aim to
understand the epidemiology of COPC, regardless of anatomy or diagnosis involved, the evolution of COPC
over time, neurophysiologic alterations in pain processing, healthy lifestyle factors and psychosocial factors as
risk factors for COPC, and consequences of COPC and altered pain processing in older adults. We propose
acquiring objective quantitative sensory testing (QST) measures of pain sensitization and CPM, which are
associated with pain severity in experimental settings. Whether QST-assessed neurophysiologic alterations may
be common underlying risk factors for all forms of chronic pain, and for poor physical and psychosocial
functioning, institutionalization, and mortality in a community-based cohort of older AAs unselected for pain is
unknown. We will collect data regarding a multitude of chronic pain conditions, QST, healthy lifestyle factors,
physical and psychosocial function, and nursing home admissions during the next planned study visit, as well as
two follow-up assessments to obtain longitudinal data, and leverage the ongoing JHS surveillance of mortality.
Our work will address several knowledge gaps, and insights gained may ultimately facilitate new preventive and
therapeutic approaches to relieving chronic pain and its consequences, regardless of underlying diagnosis."
10873232,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Suicide is the second leading cause of death for 15-to-24-year-olds in the United States. Compared to their
heterosexual and cisgender peers, sexual and gender minority (SGM) adolescents report significantly higher
rates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Unfortunately, many barriers complicate the implementation of
suicide prevention in SGM communities. SGM youth often report feeling unwelcome and misunderstood in
traditional behavioral health service organizations. Consequently, treatment attendance and retention remain
low. Instead, this population generally seeks mental health services in community organizations for lesbian,
gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) youth. Unfortunately, these organizations are often
unprepared for this clinical challenge. The Behavioral Health-Works (BH-Works) suicide risk management
system may offer a potential solution to this problem. BH-Works is an evidence-based, comprehensive youth
suicide prevention program. It offers support for policy development, staff training, suicide and behavioral
health screening, technology-assisted safety planning, an electronic patient referral system, real-time data
analytics for program monitoring, and a learning collaborative structure to support sustainability. All functions
are supported on a web-based software platform that facilitates implementation, adoption and expansion. BH-
Works has been used in both clinical and non-clinical settings. In this project, we will adapt this program for
LGBTQ organizations. This project builds upon robust partnerships with two diverse LGBTQ organizations
(Mazzoni Center, in Philadelphia and Diversity Camp Inc., in rural Southwest, Virginia) and partnering
behavioral health sites. We will use an Effectiveness-Implementation Hybrid Type 2 design (Curran et al.,
2013) with a historical comparison group to pilot the BH-Works program within the two LGBTQ organizations.
Informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, we will pilot test a sequenced
implementation strategy. This strategy focuses on promoting engagement, building partnership, , and creating
sustainability In Year 1, we will collect treatment as usual data, work with our partners to adapt BH-Works
content, practices, and workflow. We will also train staff/providers in suicide risk management, family
engagement and affirmative care. In Year 2, we will begin pilot testing the SGM BH-Works screening and
referral systems. We will evaluate primary program outcomes (increased suicide identification and successful
referrals), secondary outcomes (program acceptability), and explore program mechanisms (training impact,
partnership development, software usability and caregiver involvement). The proposed research responds to
the growing national need to identify and refer vulnerable youth at risk for suicide. A future R01 will test
program effectiveness with a larger sample and different implementation strategies."

10877868,"Substance use and substance use disorders (SUD) are among of the most critical public health concerns in the
United States. Because patients with substance use and SUD are encountered most frequently in non-specialty,
general medical settings, there is a great need to develop a diverse and interdisciplinary pool of clinician-
scientists to conduct high-quality impactful research on substance use and SUD in these settings. Therefore, we
propose the University of Pittsburgh Collaboration in Addiction Training Scholars (PittCATS) Program.
PittCATS leverages the exceptional cadre of multidisciplinary substance use and SUD investigators and
mentors, existing postdoctoral training programs in substance use and SUD, and the exceptional career
development experience and resources of the University of Pittsburgh's Institute for Clinical Research
Education (ICRE) and the Clinical and Translational Science Institute to achieve its goal of preparing highly
qualified junior faculty Scholars for independent careers in substance use and SUD research, with a focus on
the care of patients with substance use and SUD in general medical settings. The junior faculty Scholars will be
supported for 3-5 years and required to have a MD, PhD in a clinical discipline, PharmD, or equivalent. The
Program's short-term objectives are to: 1) recruit outstanding Scholars with strong motivation to conduct
interdisciplinary substance use and SUD research; 2) help Scholars develop a rigorous customized career
development plan; 3) provide Scholars with hands-on interdisciplinary mentored experiences in the conduct of
clinical research from conceptualization to completion, presentation, and publication and dissemination of
results; and 4) ensure close, effective mentoring of Scholars to guide their research career development. The
long-term objectives are: 1) provide Scholars the tools to develop and submit competitive grant applications for
independent funding; and 2) teach Scholars the leadership and professional skills necessary to excel as clinical
researchers, mentors, and leaders in substance use and SUD research. To achieve these objectives, Scholars
develop a customized career development plan and engage in a comprehensive set of training activities: 1)
rigorous coursework in research methodology; 2) substance use and SUD research and topical seminars; 3)
mentored research projects; 4) development of an independent research grant proposal; 5) mentoring training;
6) leadership and professionalism training; and 7) responsible conduct of research training. The success of the
Program will be measured by course, Program, and mentor-mentee evaluations and through short and long-
term tracking of career outcomes, including acquisition of research competencies, independent grant funding,
presentations, peer-reviewed papers, promotion, and awards. The Program is administered by a Program
Director, two Program Co-Directors, an Executive Committee, and an Advisory Committee who together

10889951,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect and affects 1% of all live born infants, and
genetics likely contribute to 90%. While ~90% of patients with CHD survive into adulthood, there are many
comorbidities that make CHD an increasingly significant public health problem. During the first two project
periods the PCGC has made significant progress in understanding the genetic architecture of CHD. The
highlights of the genomics work are the identification of de-novo variants contributing to ~10% of CHD, the
identification of chromatin remodeling genes contributing to 2.3% of all CHD and to a striking 28% of CHD that
is associated with extracardiac and neurodevelopmental abnormalities, the identification of novel CHD genes
underlying inherited CHD, and the contribution of genes involved in cilia structure and function to CHD. The other
most significant finding from the PCGC genomic studies is the tremendous heterogeneity of CHD: over 440
genes contribute to CHD by a dominant inheritance mechanism alone. Combining these findings with previous
data on the contribution of copy-number variants and aneuploidy identifies a likely genetic cause for ~40% of
CHD. Our hypotheses are that many yet unidentified mutations affecting the genic region contribute to a
significant portion of CHD, and that the specific mutations contributing to CHD impact outcomes. The two major
questions addressed in this proposal are what is the genetic contribution to the “missing 55%”, and how
do specific mutations impact the cardiac and non-cardiac outcomes and clinical care of patients with
CHD? In the setting of large genetic heterogeneity and variable phenotypic expressivity that characterizes CHD,
answers to these questions will require very large patient cohorts with genotype and phenotype data. Aim 1 will
define the genetic architecture of CHD through analysis of 30,000 enrolled patients with genomic data in the
combined PCGC cohort. Patients are recruited by outreach to the entire Pediatric Cardiology community along
with internet-based direct patient recruiting. This will be coupled with a cost-effective tiered sequencing strategy
that starts with MIPs-based targeted sequencing on all probands and progresses to whole-exome and whole-
genome sequencing in MIPs-negative patients. Since the eventual goal of the PCGC program is to use genomic
data to improve clinical care of CHD patients, we will need to link genomic and outcome data efficiently. Aim 2
will establish a central PCGC data mining center to directly link phenotypic data from the EMR and STS database
with genomic data. We will initially focus on two outcomes that are readily available in the EMR and are
associated with significant morbidity in CHD patients: the potential role of cilia mutations in progressive valve
dysfunction in single-ventricle patients and the potential role of chromatin modifier gene mutations to cancer risk
in adult CHD survivors. The informatics paradigms developed for this project can then be applied to investigate
potential genetic contribution to a wide range of other CHD outcomes."
10889955,"Learning desired actions from experience requires evaluating alternative actions by integrating the
consequences assigned to each action over time. In the real world, actions and outcomes occur in complex
sequences, and a continuous stream of events must be parsed into appropriate pairs of causative action and
outcome before such pairs can be evaluated. However, how the brain solves this problem, known as temporal
credit assignment (TCA) is unknown. The goal of the proposed project is to use an innovative paradigm and
test novel hypotheses regarding the role of heterogeneous dynamics of memory in the prefrontal cortex in TCA.
 In our contextual lagged bandit task, monkeys will choose between three options offered in one of two
alternating contexts, but feedback for a choice in one context will be temporally delayed and delivered after
another choice is made in the other context. Learning optimal choices in this task consists of two parts: causal
inference for learning the causal structure or model of the task, and model-based TCA for learning the value of
each choice. Learning from delayed outcome requires memory of a chosen action or eligibility trace (ET).
Although theories postulate that ET exponentially decays over time (i.e. exp-ET), exp-ET cannot resolve TCA
when causative action is separated from the outcome in time and by irrelevant events. We hypothesize the
flexible dynamics of ET might be crucial for causal inference and model-based TCA.
 More specifically, we hypothesize that model-based TCA requires dynamically-modulated ET (dynamic-
ET) which is selectively activated at the predicted time of its outcome to obviate receiving credits from
intervening events. For causal inference, we hypothesize that memory of past actions might be re-activated by
hindsight in search of a new causal link (i.e. hypothetical ET, hyp-ET). We also hypothesize that ET might be
strongly sustained until the lagged feedback (i.e. persistent ET, persist-ET) to test the accuracy of new link at
the expense of confounding intervening inputs. We will investigate how flexible dynamics of ETs might be
supported by heterogeneous dynamics of neural activity across different regions of cortico-striatal network.
 First, we will assess whether the primate prefrontal cortex (PFC) provides dynamic-ET for model-based
TCA, whereas the striatum provides exp-ET for contiguity-based TCA. Second, we will assess whether
dorsomedial and dorsolateral PFC provide hyp-ET and persist-ET, respectively. We will take a highly
integrative approach and combine multi-scale neural recordings, perturbations and computational modeling to
examine whether and how complex patterns and dynamics of neural activity in the prefrontal cortex constitute
necessary and sufficient conditions to support model-based TCA. The proposed project will transform the
conventional view of memory as storage, recasting memory as an integral part of learning and reasoning with
temporal dynamics being its key structure. Causal inference is central to dysfunction in the individuals with
psychotic symptoms and our work will contribute to understanding underlying prefrontal pathophysiology."
10889956,"ABSTRACT
Our objective is to identify genes that regulate development of bone density, quality and strength in childhood.
Childhood is a critical window for lifelong musculoskeletal health. Failure to achieve optimal bone accrual during
childhood results in suboptimal peak bone mass and bone fragility later in life. In excess of 50 million older US
adults have osteoporosis or low bone mass. Osteoporosis has a strong heritable component, yet only 20% of
adult bone mineral density (BMD) variability is explained by genetic variants discovered to date. Pediatric studies
should be highly effective in distilling the genetics of this complex phenotype, given (a) the duration of
environmental influences is shorter, and (b) the genetic determinants of growth, body composition and
maturation also influence bone accrual. Uncovering the genetic architecture of childhood bone accrual is critical
for understanding lifelong skeletal health and identifying targets for preventing and treating bone fragility.
Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measures of areal BMD are widely used in genetic studies. With DXA
software advances, elements of bone quality and structural strength can be extracted, along with body
composition parameters known to influence bone accrual. These deeper DXA-derived phenotypes have great
potential to shed further important, novel insights into genetic determinants of the developing skeleton. We have
genome-wide genotyped the NICHD Bone Mineral Density in Childhood Study (BMDCS) cohort which is unique
for its large size, broad age range, high data quality, diversity and longitudinal design. We will derive new
phenotypes from existing DXA and radiograph images, and apply advanced multidimensional phenotyping and
multivariate GWAS methods to identify new loci. GWAS only reports genomic signals associated with a given
trait and not necessarily the precise location of culprit genes. Therefore, we will use high-resolution `variant to
gene mapping' techniques established in our `Center for Spatial and Functional Genomics' to investigate both
previously reported pediatric novel loci and our anticipated new loci. Our approach first prioritizes putative causal
SNPs using open chromatin and enhancer epigenetic signatures, and then identifies 3D genomic contacts
between these prioritized SNPs and their target gene promoters, using a high-resolution promoter-based
chromatin conformation capture technique. To validate these target genes, we will use CRISPR/Cas9 to edit the
putative regulatory SNPs and use siRNA to target genes and show an effect on bone-relevant phenotypes. We
will apply our techniques in primary pediatric human mesenchymal progenitor cell (MSC)-derived osteoblasts, a
very relevant bone cellular model for understanding pediatric bone mass accrual.
Thus, our proposal is an unparalleled opportunity to interrogate novel phenotypes and functionally characterize
the actual effector genes using high resolution chromatin conformation capture approaches at these new, as
well as previously known bone-related loci."

10888670,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Fungal infections impact hundreds of millions of people and kill >1.5 million individuals
annually. The recent emergence of resistance against all three major classes of antifungals in
pathogens such as Candida auris presents a grave threat to human health. Indeed, with mortality
rates ~60%, C. auris is now classified as a “superbug” by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).
This program will address this therapeutic need via the discovery of small molecules that inhibit
novel Cu-only superoxide dismutases (SODs).
 During infection, the host can produce a toxic burst of superoxide (O2-•) to attack microbes.
However, fungal pathogens produce extracellular SODs that disproportionate O2-•. The co-I
(Culotta, JHU) has discovered a new class of extracellular, Cu-dependent SOD metalloenzymes
that are unique to fungi, distinct from human SODs, and essential for the virulence of widespread
fungal pathogens. These ‘Cu-only’ SODs are highly conserved in fungal kingdom and our data
suggests they are a promising, untapped antifungal targets.
 This exploratory effort (R21) will identify inhibitors of fungal Cu-only SODs using an innovative
approach to metalloenzyme inhibitor discovery developed in the laboratory of the PI (Cohen,
UCSD). This approach utilizes metalloenzyme fragment-based drug discovery (mFBDD) and
does not involve removal of the metal ion from the enzyme active site. The laboratory of the PI
has a strong track record of identifying first- or best-in-class inhibitors of metalloenzymes by using
mFBDD. In this effort, we will focus on Cu-only SOD5 from the fungal pathogen C. albicans,
followed by validation of our approach with Cu-only SOD4 from drug resistant C. auris. Promising
MBP hits will be developed in a hit-to-lead effort into inhibitors that will be screened for activity
against fungal infections in vitro and in vivo. Ultimately, this program will discover first-in-class
inhibitors of fungal Cu-only SODs and demonstrate their utility as a novel therapeutic target
against these life-threatening infections."

 HAZWOPER emergency response work represents one of the most dangerous jobs in the United States (U.S.)
where, in many cases, emergency medical first responders are expected to deliver immediate care to persons
suffering from acute traumatic injuries and exposure to hazardous substances (e.g., chemical spills). Therefore,
the HAZWOPER standard devotes very specific and detailed attention to training that represents a major
departure from classical emergency medical first responder action.
 Although advanced training technologies (ATT) have emerged over the past decade, ranging from mobile to
virtual reality technologies, current HAZWOPER ATT are insufficient at tutoring, debriefing, and quantifiably
evaluating hands-on skill proficiency while, simultaneously, enabling both hands free to practice emergency
medical skills. NIEHS and OSHA require realistic HAZWOPER training that measurably develops hands-on
skill proficiency. Additionally, students who continually practice hands-on clinical skills in simulated
environments and with patient simulators significantly improve their hands-on skill proficiency.
 For the NIH SBIR Phase I effort, Juxtopia proposes to build upon preliminary research results to develop an
artificial intelligent (AI) Juxtopia® Intelligent HAZWOPER Instructor (JiHi) that e-evaluates Fire-Fighter
EMTs and Paramedics’ clinical skill proficiency by using deep learning algorithms to auto-interpret granular
data generated from Juxtopia® Imhotep Band (JiBand) armlets and e-instructing first responders by displaying
multimodal andragogical data on Juxtopia® Augmented Reality (AR) Goggles.
 Juxtopia hypothesizes that JiHi, that e-trains through AR Goggles and e-evaluates through JiBands, will
measurably augment instructor training and improve emergency medical personnel (e.g., Fire-Fighter EMTs’)
psychomotor skill proficiency while learners practice emergency medical skills in outdoor simulated HAZMAT
environments. To test the hypothesis during the NIH SBIR Phase I effort, Juxtopia and the Maryland Fire
Rescue Institute (MFRI) will answer the following questions: How can a JiHi deliver multi-modal tutoring of
hands-on clinical skills?; How can a JiHi evaluate hands-on clinical skills?; How can a JiHi continually learn
from students?; How can a JiHi e-evaluate correct or incorrect clinical steps from JiBand collected data?; How
can the JiHi JiBand product be sold at an affordable price? To accomplish the proposed NIH SBIR Phase I effort
and answer the aforementioned question, Juxtopia will test the technical and commercial feasibility of JiHi-
JiBand at MFRI facilities."

There is a national effort to diversify the aging-focused STEM and healthcare workforce in order to eliminate
health disparities and improve health equity. Older Americans are one of the fastest growing demographics in
the country, yet geriatric education and training programs are lacking. To address this educational need, we
developed an aging-focused curriculum that provides an introduction to basic, clinical and translational
research that incorporates hands on training components for high school students. This curriculum aligns with
Next Generation Science Standards to provide foundational knowledge required to understand and translate
concepts related to aging research across the continuum while providing the skills to perform basic lab
techniques and clinical skills. We propose to implement and evaluate this basic, clinical and translational
research nanocourse that promotes skill development with the goal of preparing students for a subsequent
aging-focused applied research experience in year 2, and adds a training component for professional mentors.
Completion of this program’s first year would serve as a “RAMP” to the next step: a lab or research-based
experience with Pepper Center and UMGCCC affiliated faculty conducting aging-focused research during the
second summer. Specifically, we aim to: Aim 1: Implement the curriculum developed in our pilot study with new
cohorts of West Baltimore HS students via a 2-year program consisting of a 5-week summer program and
school year research rotation experiences in year one followed by an applied summer research experience
during the second summer. Students will receive real-time exposure to basic science labs and clinical
gerontology research settings while progressively acclimating to the academic research environment. This
authentic experience in aging research will excite them about biomedical/health-focused STEM subjects and
inspire them to pursue aging-focused academic research in college and their careers. Aim 2: Develop and
implement a mentor training program for near peer and professional faculty mentors. This training program will
prepare mentors to work with high school students, including how to communicate and understand their
mentees as well as introduce some of the challenges these students may face from growing up in West
Baltimore. Aim 3: Evaluate the impact of program components on scholars and mentors and the impact of the
RAMP program across the pipeline of UMB educational training programs. Workforce diversification is
essential to engage this underutilized resource and meet growing US demands in aging research, biomedical
science and broader STEM fields. This program will allow students to build their CV with skills and experiences
to make them more competitive for future research programs while building confidence and self-efficacy that
they belong in an academic research environment and ultimately in a biomedical science career."

GATA zinc finger domain containing 1 (GATAD1) is an as-yet uncharacterized zinc finger domain protein,
which was initially identified as a histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) interactor. Genome-wide
homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing identified a GATAD1 mutation in a large four-generation family
with autosomal recessive dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Three individual carriers homozygous for a single
amino acid substitution of Serine 102 to Proline (S102P) in GATAD1 presented with full penetrance adult-onset
DCM and heart failure in their fifties. However, thirteen relatives were heterozygous mutation carriers with no
evidence of myocardial disease, even at advanced ages. The unique DCM phenotype observed in patients
homozygous for the S102P mutation and the absence of symptoms in heterozygous carriers suggest that the
S102P mutation is a loss-of-function mutation, and that GATAD1 is critical for maintaining normal cardiac
structure and function. However, little is known as to the specific role of GATAD1 in CMs, or molecular
mechanisms by which GATAD1 loss-of-function results in cardiomyopathy. Gatad1 knockout zebrafish display
a heart failure-like phenotype and lethality at 7 months of age when exposed to ethanol and high cholesterol
stress. GATAD1 interacts with H3K4me3 and binds at gene promoters, suggesting it is likely to regulate gene
expression. However, the transcriptional program regulated by GATAD1 in CMs has not yet been addressed.
To determine the role of GATAD1 in CMs, we have successfully generated a floxed Gatad1 mouse line and
used it to generate CM-specific knockout (cKO) mice. Our preliminary studies revealed that, although the
cardiac structure and function were normal in in Gatad1 cKO mice at 3 months of age, expression of fetal
genes Nppa and Nppb, typically upregulated during cardiac stress, were increased in hearts of Gatad1 cKO
mice, compared with those of Cre negative controls, suggesting that deletion of Gatad1 in CMs induced
cardiac stress. The normal cardiac function in Gatad1 cKO mice at 3 months of age suggests that loss of
Gatad1 might result in slowly developing late-onset cardiomyopathy during aging, as observed in the patients
carrying GATAD1 mutations. Interestingly, we observed that expression of Gatad1, was increased in hearts
one week after pressure overload. Taken together, the foregoing evidence leads us to the hypothesis that
GATAD1 plays an essential role in maintaining normal cardiac function and in response to cardiac stress by
regulating cardiac gene expression. Accordingly, our Specific Aims are: (1) To elucidate the role and molecular
mechanism by which GATAD1 is required to maintain normal cardiac function during aging by histological,
physiological, biochemical, and molecular analyses of Gatad1 CM-specific knockout (cKO) mice. and (2) To
investigate the role of GATAD1 in pressure-overload induced heart failure by preforming transverse aortic
constriction (TAC) surgery on Gatad1 cKO mice at two months of age, prior to any cardiac phenotype."

 This application to be a Pelvic Floor Disorders Network Clinical Site contains both an innovative
randomized controlled trial and comprehensive description of Northwestern Medicine’s unique
strengths, as a team and environment, to contribute to all PFDN trials. Our concept proposal draws on the
collective experience of our team in exercise physiology, perioperative optimization, and postoperative recovery.
The proposal describes a randomized controlled trial of prescriptive early exercise following prolapse surgery to
reduce deconditioning and improve recovery without any negative impact on pelvic floor outcomes. Our
proposed study will go beyond existent research and be the first to implement and quantitatively
evaluate (using accelerometer data) a postoperative exercise regimen and its effects on recovery and
pelvic floor symptoms. In addition, our proposal highlights the strengths of our large, high volume, multi-
disciplinary team, which draws from a diverse patient population across several regional hospitals to ensure
equity and inclusion within PFDN clinical trials. We can also leverage our resources and collaborations as part
of two NIDDK cooperative networks related to urinary incontinence and bladder health to advance the PFDN’s
goals. The NM team is a nationally recognized group of collaborative, productive, and established
investigators well poised to lead the design, implementation, analysis and dissemination of this
multicenter RCT as well as participate in and lead additional studies within the PFDN."

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Internal Medicine’s Division of Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine
at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. My long-term career goal is to become an independent
researcher leading an interdisciplinary team that identifies how family members and informants can be used to
detect early warning signs of mild cognitive impairment and dementia for Mexicans and Mexican Americans. To
accomplish this goal, I will complete three training objectives that build on my prior training in family caregiving for
Mexican American families: (1) clinical use of family members and informants in diagnosis of dementia and mild
cognitive impairment, (2) analysis of surveys and statistical methods for survey validation, and (3) career
advancement and leadership development to gain essential competencies to function effectively as an independent
extramurally-funded investigator, specifically by developing mentoring and leadership skills and enhancing
manuscript and grant writing skills. Training in these areas will include taking coursework, shadowing
interdisciplinary teams in clinical settings, and developing new research areas. My training activities are integrated
with a research project. I will use data from the Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS), a nationally
representative longitudinal study of older adults in Mexico, linked with the Auxiliary Study of Cognition (MexCog),
an in-depth study of cognitive functioning of older adults in Mexico, as part of the international Harmonized
Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) to complete the following specific aims: (Aim 1) describe the informant
assessments in the population and how they vary by dementia status, and evaluate the informant assessments of
cognition to estimate MCI and dementia prevalence, and (Aim 2) examine how adding the informant assessment
improves the performance of the cognitive screening in the questionnaire. The expected findings of this research
will provide evidence of the value of incorporating informant assessments of cognition in population studies to
assess mild cognitive impairment and dementia and more accurately categorize marginal cases. Completion of the
K01 mentored training and research plans will provide me with the knowledge, skills, and expertise required to
understand measurement of cognitive functioning in the specific context of Mexicans to develop a program of
research that blends life course social and health constructs with clinical data, with the goal of incorporating family
members and informants as early warning signs of cognitive impairment and dementia for both Mexican and
Mexican Americans."

Although as humans we appear symmetrical on the outside, our internal organs are asymmetrically positioned
along the left and right sides of our body. Left-right (L-R) patterning is a fundamental biological process that helps
to ensure the correct positioning of our organs, and its perturbation is typically associated with congenital heart
malformations and high mortality. In a typical deuterostome, including humans, proper L-R patterning involves
motile cilia in the L-R organizing (LRO) region, which trigger a Ca2+ wave on the left side of the embryo. This
results in asymmetric gene expression and ultimately asymmetric organogenesis. However, more than 65% of
all tetrapods, including reptiles and even-toed ungulates, do not use motile cilia for L-R patterning. Instead, tilting
of the LRO and asymmetric cellular movements somehow lead to molecular asymmetry. However, the mecha-
nisms underpinning L-R asymmetry in these organisms are poorly understood. It is unclear how asymmetric cell
movements originate, whether they trigger the asymmetrical Ca2+ wave, or if cilia are involved in any aspect of
L-R patterning. Currently, the chicken embryo is used to represent the diversity of all 25,000 species of reptiles,
and new models are required for a deeper evolutionary understanding of fundamental developmental events.
Veiled chameleons (Chamaeleo calyptratus) are perfect for the study of early development and evolution in non-
avian reptiles, since they lay large clutches of eggs at pre-gastrulation stages. Their LRO lacks motile cilia, and
instead molecular asymmetry is established through large-scale morphological changes. Veiled chameleons
have a sequenced and annotated genome, and are amenable to cell and embryo culture, as well as live imaging.
The objective of this application therefore is to define the mechanisms governing L-R patterning in chameleons
and thus expand our understanding of amniote development and evolution. The central hypothesis is that cellular
flow and large-scale morphological changes trigger an evolutionarily conserved asymmetric Ca2+ wave, leading
to molecular L-R asymmetry, which has undergone evolutionary change across amniotes. This hypothesis will
be addressed in the following aims: (Aim 1) Determine the mechanics of establishing L-R patterning in veiled
chameleon. (Aim 2) Evaluate genetic changes and conservation of the L-R patterning pathway across amniotes.
The patterns of cell migration and the dynamics of Ca2+ signaling will be evaluated through live imaging, providing
training in advanced microscopy. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing will be adapted for use in chameleons and will
include training in surgery and virus production. This study will result in the first scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq
libraries for asymmetric gene expression between the left and right sides of chicken, chameleon, and mouse
embryos, and will involve computational biology training. Successful completion of this project will be significant
in the fields of L-R patterning and evo-devo, providing the first detailed study of the early steps of L-R patterning
in a non-avian, non-mammalian amniote, which may revolutionize our current thinking about roles for cilia and
Ca2+ signaling in L-R patterning. It will also lay the foundation for a successful independent career."

 Sensory neurons convey information about external and internal environment to the brain. Proper function
of sensory neurons is regulated by different types of glial cells, and alterations in glial functions have
emerged as a major contributing factor in many neurodevelopmental disorders. While Schwann cells
surrounding sensory axons are very well studied, much less is known about satellite glial cells (SGCs), which
completely envelop sensory neuron soma in various sensory ganglia, including spiral ganglia mediating
transduction of sound. Spiral ganglia neurons in the cochlea receive auditory information from hair cells in the
ear and convey it to the brain with high speed and precision. Small alterations in conduction velocity in these
neurons have major effects on signal processing in the auditory circuits. Whether this peripheral auditory
system is dysregulated by FMRP loss remains largely unknown. Sensory deficits, and particularly
hypersensitivity to sound is one of the hallmarks of Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and other autism-spectrum
disorders. Increasing evidence suggests that sensory hypersensitivity in FXS leads to behavioral alterations
such as anxiety and impaired social interactions. The defects have been thus far largely attributed to sensory
processing abnormalities in brain circuits. However, core sensory and cognitive deficits may arise from an
earlier abnormality in sensory inputs that drive subsequent abnormal development of cortical circuits. Yet, the
mechanisms of sensory deficits in FXS remain poorly understood and no targeted treatments are available. In
response to this challenge, we began to define potential deficits in spiral ganglia neurons in Fmr1 KO mice,
the FXS mouse model. At the ultrastructural level, we observed altered association of spiral ganglia neurons
with their enveloping SGCs. We found that genes related to neural development and myelination are
dysregulated in Fmr1 KO spiral ganglia. We also observed abnormal number of immune cells in Fmr1 KO
spiral ganglia. Our initial observations point to potential deficits in the peripheral auditory system in FXS. The
goal of this proposal is thus to unravel the contribution of SGCs to sensory hypersensitivity caused by FMRP
loss. To achieve this goal, we will first determine if and how cell type proportions and the transcriptome of
cells in spiral ganglia are affected by loss of FMRP using single-cell RNAseq approaches at two critical
developmental stages, postnatal day 5 (P5, pre-hearing), P15 (post-hearing), and P28. We will also perform
electron microscopy analyses of spiral ganglia at the same stages to define the developmental timeline by
which SGCs envelop and myelinate spiral ganglia neuron soma in normal conditions and to identify when
abnormalities caused by FMRP loss arise during development. Finally, we will determine if absence of FMRP
causes alterations in the excitability of auditory neurons. These experiments will unravel potential defects in
peripheral auditory system in Fmr1 KO mice and provide the foundation for future in depth analyses and
hypothesis-driven approaches to ameliorate sensory hypersensitivity in FXS."

Substance use disorder (SUD), overdose risk, and housing insecurity have reached crisis levels in the US. In
2019, over 8 million individuals met criteria for SUD, and nearly 37 million households were spending more
than 30% of their income on housing. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, already-high overdose
mortality rates soared, and millions of households have fallen behind on their rent. Beyond initiatives focused
on people without housing such as housing first, there has been a paucity of research focusing on the
intersection of SUD and housing insecurity. Even less is known about whether policy attempts designed to
support housing security have the potential to improve engagement in substance use treatment and reduce
fatal and non-fatal overdose. Innovative housing policies enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic—including
eviction moratoriums, emergency rental assistance, and legal representation to tenants facing eviction (right to
counsel)—offer an unprecedented opportunity to fill this vital knowledge gap. Widespread variation across
states in whether and how these policies were implemented allow them to be rigorously studied using causal
methods with mechanisms and potential mechanisms explored using qualitative approaches. In Aims 1-2, we
will conduct a 50-state study using a difference-in-differences approach to examine the effects of the three
housing policies of interest on rates of substance use treatment and fatal and non-fatal drug overdose. Data
sources for Aims 1-2 will include 50-state administrative databases capturing services delivered in the general
medical sector (IQVIA LRx/Dx and HCUP) and specialty addiction treatment sector (TEDS), as well as CDC
fatal drug overdose data. In Aim 3, we will conduct in-depth qualitative interviews with people with recent
histories of drug use as well as providers and policy officials in urban and rural counties. Our study will yield
actionable evidence to inform policy development and implementation at the intersection of housing and SUD
designed to enhance engagement in addiction treatment and prevent drug overdose."

The goal of this study is to develop best practices for returning results to family child care home (FCCH)
directors about pesticides present in their facilities. Best practices will be defined as activities that
maximize comprehension of key knowledge and catalyze action to measurably reduce children’s exposure to
agricultural and household-use pesticides, thus limiting potentially harmful exposures at an important stage of
development. A mixed methods study will be conducted in four Central Valley counties in California in three
phases. In Phase 1, multi-stakeholder working groups including local FCCH directors, child care, health and
environmental organizations will meet with study staff to discuss ethical issues about reporting back results on
pesticides detected in FCCHs using a bioethical environmental justice framework. Qualitative methods will
identify common themes to inform the process of reporting back results with the Digital Exposure Report-Back
Interface (DERBI) and understanding the barriers and facilitators. In Phase 2, a convenience sample of 30
FCCHs serving ethnically diverse young children in marginalized Central Valley communities will be recruited
and participate in a 12-month integrated pest management (IPM) intervention, with carpet dust sampled and
assessed for pesticides at baseline and 12 months later. FCCH directors will attend educational workshops,
receive environmental assessments, and have regular consultations with study staff focused on IPM goals they
have set. Three months post-baseline, FCCH directors will receive access to their pesticide results via the
DERBI, including enhancements or modifications resulting from Phase 1 work. Immediately and over the next
9 months, FCCH directors will be interviewed to explore their reactions to and understanding of results,
intention to change pest management strategies in response to their report, and plans to share results with
families and their community. Throughout Phase 2, researchers will consider the impact of having returned
results via DERBI, including barriers to or facilitators of impactful action and unintended consequences of
returning results. Upon completion of post-intervention pesticide exposure assessment, Phase 3 of the study
will begin. In Phase 3, the FCCH directors and local stakeholders will reconvene along with statewide
stakeholders to discuss the quantitative and qualitative results of the IPM intervention, to identify best practices
in reporting back pesticide results to FCCH directors, and to write a policy brief. The study aims are: (1) to
develop a process for reporting back pesticides detected in FCCHs to program directors by collaborating with
key local stakeholders, (2) to determine how an IPM intervention in FCCHs that includes reporting back
pesticides using DERBI a) influences directors’ understanding of pesticides, IPM practices, intentions to act on
and share their results, and b) whether the intervention subsequently, reduces pesticide exposures in FCCHs,
and (3) To develop and disseminate best practices to report back pesticide exposure results for FCCHs and
produce a policy brief by re-convening local stakeholders and meeting with statewide groups."

 This R03 proposal is to follow-up on recent findings from my SERCA K01 award, which focuses on
elucidating the role of the type 1 diabetes (T1D) PTPN2 risk allele in loss of B cell anergy. Previously B cells
bearing antigen receptors with high affinity for insulin were found only in the anergic B cell compartment of
healthy individuals. Importantly, these cells leave this compartment in a proportion of first-degree relatives
(FDRs), and in all autoantibody positive pre-diabetics and recent onset T1D individuals. Departure of these
autoreactive anergic B cells in FDRs was shown to be associated with the high risk non-HLA allele, PTPN2
(rs1893217). PTPN2 has been previously shown to be a negative regulator of T cell signaling, but has not been
studied in B cells. Recently we demonstrated that mice that lack Ptpn2 specifically in their B cells
(Mb1Cre.Ptpn2fl/fl.C57BL/6) have a decrease in anergic B cells, similar to our findings in humans, an increase in
autoimmune associated B cells (ABCs), increase in production of autoreactive antibodies, and a hyperresponsive
phenotype. Despite these findings, these mice did not develop overt autoimmunity, likely driven by the fact these
mice are on the autoimmune resistant genetic background, C57BL/6. Hence, in this study we aim to determine
the effect of B cell specific deletion of Ptpn2 in the NOD mouse, which develops spontaneous diabetes by about
20 weeks of age. Specifically, we aim to study whether B cell deletion of Ptpn2 increases the rate and penetrance
of diabetes incidence, the effect on frequency and activation status of insulin-reactive and non-reactive B cells,
as well as its effect on B cell antigen presentation to T cells and the differentiation of pathogenic T cells. The
potential impact of these studies will lie in understanding how risk alleles conspire to undermine maintenance of
immune tolerance to autoantigens in T1D."

 The decreasing cost and increasing robustness of genomic sequencing technologies offer an exceptional
opportunity to advance the future of newborn screening (NBS) and increase the number of babies who have
access to lifesaving interventions. Newborn sequencing, however, comes with many ethical, legal, and social
implications (ELSI). A key determinant of benefits and risks of public health newborn sequencing, at both
individual and societal levels, is which genes are screened. The proposed study addresses this
fundamental question: how should public health NBS programs decide which genes to screen? In the
next few years, around a dozen groundbreaking research studies will conduct population-based newborn
sequencing pilot studies. Existing sequencing studies provide a time-sensitive opportunity to obtain critical
input from experts, yet it is also vital to consider viewpoints of other professional and community partners
with a stake in newborn sequencing. Understanding community preferences helps protect against missteps
in the implementation of newborn sequencing that could lead to mistrust and decreased uptake of NBS,
which is the most equitable and successful public health initiative in the United States. The first aim of this
project is to appraise and contrast approaches and criteria used by experts conducting newborn
sequencing studies to determine which genes to screen. This aim will synthesize decision frameworks,
key criteria (e.g., actionability, age of onset, penetrance), values (e.g., equity, access), and lessons learned
by newborn sequencing researchers in their experience building gene panels. The second aim is to
determine preferences and values of professional and community partners about decision-making
for genes to include in newborn sequencing. Informed by a deliberative public health approach, we will
conduct engagement with 10 panels of engagement partners that include professionals, parents, and
individuals living with genetic disorders to explore preferences and values about gene selection criteria and
associated ELSI. The project outcome is guidance that is informed by a view of common interest on how to
select genes to include in public health newborn sequencing. We will leverage expert investigator experience
at a time of high research concentration, while also closing a critical gap in ensuring integration of public,
parent, patient, and professional preferences. Rather than developing a consensus gene list (which would
require constant updating), the guidance will provide collectively defined decision-making values, gene
selection criteria, and critical ELSI while characterizing areas without broad agreement for future study. The
output of this study will guide ethical and appropriate decision-making as we prepare for future
implementation of sequencing in public health NBS."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia is a major burden on the healthcare system and a major barrier to human
longevity, especially productive human longevity. Genetics of familial early-onset AD, pathological changes in
the brain of sporadic late-onset AD patients and pathological changes in the brain of individuals with Down
syndrome, who have increased expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) owing to partial trisomy of
chromosome 21, all point to APP and its cleavage product amyloid β (Aβ) peptide as causative factors in the
pathogenesis of AD. Adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter subfamily A member 7 (ABCA7) is
also a major factor in AD pathogenesis that bears on Aβ metabolism. Unfortunately, the mechanisms of its
effect on Aβ turnover and the disease progression have been uncovered insufficiently. One reason for this is
that the currently commonly-used Abca7 deletion mouse model have yielded divergent and contradictory
findings and may not be suitable for the discovery of ABCA7 functions. We summarize the finding made with
the model and point to the weaknesses of this model. Given this, we propose to make a tissue-specific ABCA7
overexpression mouse using the Cre/loxP system. An overexpression model will have several advantages as
an ABCA7 investigation tool over the deletion model. It is then proposed to use the overexpression model to
test a hypothesis about the role of ABCA7 in astrocytes, in particular that astrocyte ABCA7 drives production of
apolipoprotein E-lipoprotein and thus promotes efflux of the neurodegenerative lipid from the cells and
clearance of Aβ from the brain. We have recently proposed the existence of the neurodegenerative lipid
generated during normal functioning of neural tissue. The proposed model will be valuable for the studies of
ABCA7 in the neural tissues, while the proposed experiment will advance our understanding ABCA7 functions."

The overall objective of the Viral Gene Editing and Bioinformatics Core (VGEBC) is to provide basic and clinical
researchers with knowledge and familiarity with the latest technology involving a genetic approach, including
gene editing to investigate the neuroscience of HIV and exploring novel strategies for suppressing viral infection.
The VGEBC will offer access to a comprehensive and integrated CRISPR gene editing design and
implementation pipeline. Our collaborative, multi-institutional team of experts will provide guidance, training and
shared resources allowing successful utilization of the CRISPR technology in projects focused on a better
understanding of the mechanisms of neuroHIV and the discovery of reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis and
development of intelligent therapies toward a cure. The services will include canonical DNA editors: SpCas9 and
SaCas9, novel CasX and CasY, RNA editing Cas13, and CRISPR-mediated gene expression regulation using
catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) fused to a variety of effector domains. Additionally, the Core will test and
implement new upgrades to existing and novel gene editors as they emerge from the literature. The design and
selection of optimal gRNAs will be performed with the assistance of the co-director and his bioinformatics team.
The Core's unique expertise in gene editing, bioinformatics sequence analysis, and gene delivery, and the cross-
collaboration between two universities will be used to guide investigators in: i) the design of the most up-to-date
and safe gene-editing techniques; ii) the utilization of the latest bioinformatic pipeline to maximize in target and
minimize off-target effects; iii) the development strategies for activation or suppression of gene transcription; iv)
the employment the most accurate and cost-effective genomic sequencing with long-read technology. Our Core

The overall goal of the Cell Biology and Functional Analyses (CBFA) core is to provide basic scientists as well
as clinical researchers studying HIV-1 induced neurological deficits at cell and molecular levels, resources,
mentorship, and training. In addition, resources would be available to researchers transitioning to the area of
NeuroHIV. Despite the success of the currently used antiretroviral therapy (ART) in controlling viral load in
virtually all HIV-1 patients, this cocktail of viral inhibitors has not been able to eliminate the virus from latently
infected cells including T-cells, macrophages, brain microglial cells, and cells in other sites of latency throughout
the body. Therefore, the individuals remain at risk of viral rebound once they stop ART regimen. In the recent
years, several strategies have been implemented to remove/edit viral sequences from the latently infected
reservoirs. Equally as important is to be able to identify such cells to target and destroy them. The CBFA core is
designed to provide investigators with training and technical expertise to utilize cellular and molecular tools to
conduct research related to deciphering molecular mechanisms of HIV-1-induced CNS disease and ultimately
design of molecular therapeutics to combat HIV-1 infection in the brain. This core would provide investigators
with well characterized highly purified brain cells including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia,
endothelial cells, and neural progenitors as well as cultured human peripheral blood cells for performing
molecular, cellular, and virological studies. Moreover, human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines, and
cortical spheroids and cerebral organoids from iPSCs, will be generated, characterized and made available for
the core users in the field of NeuroHIV. In addition, expertise will be also provided for the isolation,
characterization, propagation and maintenance of a variety of HIV-1 clades, HIV-2 and SIV. In this submission,
we have included novel methods to study neuronal function in different regions of the brain using our
Microelectrode Array (MEA) technology. In addition, expertise and training in microscopical,
immunohistochemical analyses are offered to investigators. Our core will work closely with the other cores to
promote a comprehensive multidisciplinary collaborative center program. This synergistic approach will ensure
the success of CNHC developmental award recipients and CNHC users in conducting productive high impact
research in neuroHIV. The main strength of our program is our team of experts with complementary expertise
for investigators to conduct their neuroHIV research while working closely with the viral vector facility, and
ultimately performing experiments in highly purified CNS cell cultures to assess the functional aspects of
neuronal cells both in vitro and ex vivo."

These are: (1) Rare & Orphaned Diseases of Neurodevelopment; (2) Parental Stress & Early Life Exposure as
Determinants of Brain Development; (3) Neuroinflammatory Mechanisms in Pathological Brain Development;
(4) Autism Spectrum Disorder; and (5) Multisensory & Sensorimotor Integration. The ADM coordinates a
substantial pilot grant program, supported through extensive philanthropic efforts and substantial University
support, distributing $400,000 per annum in a highly competitive program designed to promote high-risk high-
return IDD projects. We have set in place an innovative system of educational activities for pre- and post-
doctoral trainees, and a substantial dissemination effort that includes multiple online social media outlets (with
closed captioning in Spanish, and ASL translators at live events), an effort that has been specifically designed
to be consumable by the public. The ADM coordinates a major data archiving and sharing effort across the
Cores, interfacing with the UR CTSI and leveraging our state-of-the-art Bio-Lab Informatics System (BLIS).
The Core has established reportage and systematic assessments that continuously scrutinize and evaluate the
functioning of the center, ensuring that efficiency and cost-effectiveness are maintained at the highest levels
and that the Cores evolve to be fully responsive to changes in technology and systems. The ADM is supported
by five key advisory committees that provide crucial input regarding ongoing functioning of the center. These
are: (a) The Executive Committee; (b) The External Advisory Board; (c) The Parent and Community Advisory
Board; (d) The Internal Advisory Board; and (e) The Core Facilities Management Committee. We stand
committed to a clear-eyed purpose, that through our science, we will endeavor each and every day to remove
impediments facing people with IDD that prevent them from living the healthiest, most fulfilling lives possible."

Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a group of neurodevelopmental diseases categorized as
autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorders. Clinical features include retinopathy, intracellular
accumulation of lysosomal ceroid and lipofuscin, seizures, motor decline and dementia. CLN3 disease
(Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis, JNCL) is one of the most common types of NCL, and results from
mutations in the CLN3 gene on chromosome 16. Individuals with the CLN3 mutation show a consistent decline
in cognitive functioning and verbal intellectual abilities over the course of later childhood and early
adolescence. The precise neuropathological bases of this decline are not yet well understood and objective
neurologic biomarkers (neuromarkers) of disease progression are not currently available. Yet, our preliminary
data indicate that a good candidate for a biomarker of CLN3 disease that tracks with disease severity can be
identified using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) in the context of auditory mismatch negativity
experiments. Using these methods we have been able to show consistent declines in the P1 component of the
auditory evoked response as CLN3 disease severity increases.
 Here we propose to further develop our understanding of auditory processing in children and young adults
with CLN3 disease with a focus on validating a biomarker of the disease. Simultaneously we propose to use a
mouse model of CLN3 disease with the same genetic mutation to identify an endophenotype that is shared in
both patients and mice. We will also test whether the accumulation of autofluorescent lipopigments
preferentially occur in specific subsets of interneurons and predict their subsequent loss as well as the
hypertrophy of remaining interneurons. This three-pronged, convergence of techniques and approaches in
both species has the potential to yield unique opportunities to understand the underlying neurophysiology of
CLN3 mutations and their impact on auditory processing, as well as encourage testing of future treatments for
CLN3 disease first in mice and secondarily in patients. This innovative approach, tying the patient
neurophysiological markers to identical measures in the murine model of the disease will permit improved and
more efficient pre-clinical development of novel therapeutics, improved measurement of disease progression in
clinical trials, and with these advances, lead to improved outcomes for patients with CLN3 mutations."

 Both new investigators with an interest in testing IDD-related hypotheses and experienced investigators
who may wish to expand their research portfolios to address important IDD-related issues often find that there
are structural barriers to entry into a new research path. High costs of modern imaging techniques, the
specialized technical aspects of experimental design, data acquisition and analysis, as well as working with
new patient populations can each constrain execution of important translational research. The purpose of the
Translational Neurophysiology and Neuroimaging Core (TNN) is to provide access to a set of modern (if
complex) tools, access to the professional expertise so that use of these tools can be productive, and access
to an intellectual environment that encourages and supports new and ongoing research on IDDs. To
accomplish these important goals, the TNN has a set of aims that include providing UR-IDDRC members
access to human and small animal neuroimaging tools (3T and 9.4T MRI), human and small animal
electroencephalography (EEG), Mobile Brain/Body Imaging, and access to pilot funding to defray the costs of
using these tools to jump-start new IDD research. TNN faculty and staff will consult with investigators on the
design of the experiment, assist with the implementation of protocols and train investigators and/or their
trainees (postdocs and students) to perform the data processing and analyses. A monthly users group meeting
also allows new investigators to learn about current protocols, capabilities and ongoing projects that might
synergize with their own proposed work, and to develop collaborative relationships with other TNN
investigators.
 In addition to this general support for UR-IDDRC members, the TNN core also supports the proposed
research project “Bridging the translational divide from cells to patients: toward reliable neuro-markers
of Batten disease.” Aim 1 of the research project proposes to investigate auditory processing in children with
Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis in an effort to construct a neurophysiological biomarker of disease
progression. Aim 2 of the research project proposes develop an identical EEG-based neuromarkers in murine
models of Batten disease. The TNN serves as the hub for murine model EEG and also human EEG in people
with and without IDDs. The facilities and services described in this core will be key elements to successful
completion of the Aims of the research project."
10873779,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The underlying pathology of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs) accumulates gradually over
decades, making the identification of non-invasive, sensitive biomarkers in the preclinical stage a critical public
health priority. Harnessing advanced analytic methods, our team and others have established neuroimaging
signatures of advanced brain aging (Spatial Pattern of Atrophy Recognition of Brain Aging, SPARE-BA) and
functional decline (fSPARE-BA), and ADRDs (SPARE-AD and SPARE-Small vessel disease), which predict
incident cognitive decline. Unfortunately, most research to date has been conducted in predominantly non-
Hispanic white populations, which limits the ability to generalize results to the diverse ethnoracial makeup of the
United States' growing aging demographic. If current trends continue, machine learning models will primarily be
trained in ethnically imbalanced datasets, leading to biases that may affect clinical relevance. Thus, the primary
aims of the current proposal are to: leverage an ethnically diverse neuroimaging consortium to build new machine
learning models trained by data from ethnically well-balanced populations, derive sensitive and specific
neuroimaging signatures of brain aging and ADRD, and evaluate whether they can be practical non-invasive
biomarkers of incident cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia across ethnoracial
groups. We propose to leverage the rich clinical and neuroimaging (structural MRI and resting-state functional
MRI) data within the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium,
including the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC), the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), the
Genetics of Brain Structure and Function Study (GOBS), the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), the Vascular
Contributions to Cognitive Impairment and Dementia consortium (MARK-VCID) and the Multi-Ethnic Study of
Atherosclerosis (MESA). We will leverage a collaborative research framework across existing longitudinal
cohorts to address unanswered questions contributing to disparities in ADRD burden. Machine learning
algorithms will be applied to brain imaging data of over 7,200 non-Hispanic Whites, 1,400 Blacks, and 1,425
Hispanics to address our Specific Aims: 1) Generate and evaluate clinical utility of machine learning-based
signatures of brain aging and ADRD for each race/ethnic group and uncover multidimensional heterogeneity in
aging across groups; 2) Examine associations of vascular risk factors with the derived machine learning-based
brain signatures of ADRD by race/ethnicity, and 3) Explore blood-based biomarker predictors of these machine
learning-based brain signatures by ethnoracial group to elucidate underlying biological mechanisms. Further, we
will share our robust machine learning models together with implementation software with the scientific
community. This project will develop and validate neuroimaging markers with robust predictive utility for incident
cognitive decline and to identify underlying pathophysiologic pathways, expanding opportunities for novel
intervention development across diverse ethnoracial cohorts.

10873874,"ABSTRACT
 Non-human primate (NHP) models have been recommended as ideal animal models for preclinical,
translational stroke research by the Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) committee due to
translational failures in rodents and significant cerebrovascular, neuroanatomical and biomolecular similarities
between NHPs and humans. In response to this recommendation, Dr. Nudo (one of PIs on the current proposal),
has pioneered and further developed NHP stroke models in the past few decades. Although clinically-relevant
NHP stroke models are now available, limitations in imaging modalities that can map neural activates in deep
brains of awake monkeys are hindering the current research. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
has been widely used to detect functional changes in the brain. However, this technique is limited by poor
temporal and spatial resolution when collecting functional information. Particularly, for brain research involving
awake, behaviorally active monkeys, the limited temporal resolution of fMRI can be a significant barrier because
of motion artifacts. Alternatively, many studies have used chronic, invasive microelectrode implants for recording
action potential and local field potentials in awake monkeys; however, microelectrode electrical recording is quite
invasive, has poor spatial resolution, and does not provide depth-resolved information.
 We propose to develop a wearable, whole brain imaging system based on the emerging photoacoustic (PA)
imaging (PAI) for ischemic stroke research with NHP models. Ischemic stroke is characterized by changes in
hemodynamics in the brain. Triggered by the occlusion of a major cerebral artery or its branches, ischemic stroke
leads to cerebrovascular adaptations both acutely and chronically. PAI, based on optical absorption contrast, is
intrinsically sensitive to the changes in brain hemodynamics including both blood volume (perfusion) and blood
oxygenation (oxygen consumption). Therefore, PAI offers excellent ability to understand the acute and chronic
cerebrovascular adaption after stroke, as well as hemodynamic changes resulting from functional activation in
the brain. Built on our strong expertise in PA brain imaging, especially in PAI of an awake behaviorally active
rhesus monkey, we propose to develop a real-time wearable PA brain imaging system that can be used for deep
brain mapping through a cranial window. By utilizing state-of-the-art capacitive micromachined ultrasonic
transducer (CMUT) technology, the proposed PAI technology can provide depth-resolved functional information
in deep brain regions in real-time with high spatial resolution. Two aims are proposed: 1) Evaluate and optimize
a wearable, multi-wavelength CMUT-based PAI system for real-time visualization of functional activation in the
NHP brain; and 2) Image changes in brain functional activations and cerebrovascular adaptations in an NHP
stroke model in a longitudinal study. The success of this study will provide answers to important scientific
questions about stroke with NHP models, and pave the way for new stroke therapy development."

 Dr. Eric Lofgren, the PI of this proposal, runs the Lofgren Lab at Washington State University. The goal
of this research group is to strengthen the methodological foundation of modeling disease dynamics in small,
structured populations, with a focus on how organizations or groups structure themselves. Contact patterns
between individuals in small populations arise not only from individual-level decisions, but also from structural
constraints such as the staffing levels, work assignments, or the built environment. When aggregated over an
entire state or country, the dynamics of these small groups and the structural influences on them can be
extremely important to public health. In healthcare environments, these contact patterns can greatly affect
patients’ risk of acquiring a healthcare-associated infection.
 However, the methods and tools to study these populations using mathematical modeling are
underdeveloped as compared to those that consider much larger populations. Borrowing from epidemiology
and disease ecology, the Lofgren Lab’s research uses stochastic models of disease transmission that
incorporate both individual-level variation in how people interact and higher-level contact patterns that are
externally imposed, for example, examining how workplace policies or a building’s architecture influences who
comes into contact with whom.
 The proposed five-year research program seeks to strengthen the field’s methods for modeling small,
structured populations. The goals of the program are to produce a number of important research outputs.
These include not only modeling papers exploring disease dynamics in this population, but also development
of computational tools necessary for others to advance this area, including novel synthetic data for methods
development. Additionally, the program seeks to develop web-based software platforms that allow clinicians
and policymakers to use the methods produced in this program without needing to understand the underlying
computational machinery. The proposed research program will also extend the Lab’s work geographically,
extending it to rural populations in the United States, Argentina and Eastern Africa.
 The overall vision of this research program is to employ a four-pronged approach: (i) developing the
theoretical basis for particular modeling approaches; (ii) examining phenomena that arise in these populations
(e.g., small but intensive outbreaks within healthcare facilities as an early mark of emerging epidemics); (iii)
leveraging computational tools to address unique challenges in small populations (e.g., utilizing machine
learning and information theory approaches to detect an effect within the extremely noisy data that emerges
from these populations); and (iv) producing policy-relevant and actionable information for clinicians and public
health decision-makers."
10873881,"A Multifaceted Radiomics Model to Predict Cervical Lymph Node Metastasis for Involved
Nodal Radiation Therapy
PROJECT SUMMARY
The majority of disease sites treated with radiation therapy (RT) no longer receive elective/prophylactic RT to
clinically-negative areas, including lung, pancreas, and lymphoma. These disease sites now employ involved
nodal radiotherapy (INRT), focusing on involved lymphadenopathy. However, in head and neck cancer (HNC),
we still target the same lymph node regions as conventional 2D radiotherapy, despite our ability to tailor the
radiotherapy volume and dose to specific areas using intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). This
approach leads to excessive acute and long-term toxicities for HNC patients after RT. Therefore, INRT is highly
desirable for HNC. In INRT, one particular challenge during gross tumor volume (GTV) and clinical target volume
(CTV) delineation is the identification of malignant lymphadenopathy. While some lymph nodes (LNs) are
obviously malignant based on standard imaging modalities, there is often uncertainty about whether a LN is
malignant and requires targeting. Treating benign nodes as malignant may cause a significantly higher risk of
late complications, such as xerostomia and dysphagia. On the other hand, missing occult lymphadenopathy will
lead to regional recurrence. The goal of this project is to develop, optimize, and test a multifaceted predictive
model with both high sensitivity and specificity for LN metastasis classification to maximize the efficacy and
minimize the toxicity of INRT for HNC. The proposed multifaced model presents a flexible framework and
considers multiple aspects of a predictive model, including: 1) Evaluation criteria used in model training (multi-
objective); 2) Different sources of information (multi-modality); and 3) Classifiers used for model construction
(multi-classifier). By designing a multi-objective function, we will consider sensitivity and specificity
simultaneously during model training and optimization. Instead of blindly combining features extracted from
different modalities and empirically choosing one preferred classifier, the information extracted by modality-
specific classifiers will be combined optimally through a reliable classifier fusion (RCF) strategy. We will develop
a prospective registry database to train the multi-classifier, multi-objective and multi-modality (MCOM) model
through prospectively collecting clinical characteristics and images of HNC patients who will undergo surgery at
UTSW with pathology-confirmed LN metastasis status. The model will be validated on an independent UTSW
patient cohort and patients who underwent outside imaging but operated at UTSW. The specific aims of the
project are: 1) Develop and validate a multi-classifier, multi-objective and multi-modality (MCOM) LN metastasis
prediction model for HNC patients. 2) Conduct a randomized phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and
utility of INRT versus conventional radiotherapy for HNC using the MCOM model. Successful completion of this
project will result in the development and validation of a strategy that can identify malignant LNs in HNC with
high sensitivity and specificity, which will lead to improved outcomes for HNC patients who receive INRT."

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive malignancy of the bone marrow characterized by the
accumulation of immature myeloid cells defective in their maturation and function. AML affects more than
20,000 adults annually in the United States, most of them over the age of 65. Even with aggressive treatments,
five-year overall survival is between 30-40%, and much lower for those over age 65. Human AML shows
evidence of a hierarchical cellular organization, with a minor fraction of self-renewing leukemia stem cells
(LSCs) at the apex of this hierarchy. LSCs are defined as cells that are capable of initiating the disease when
transplanted into immunodeficient mice and can both self-renew by giving rise to leukemia upon serial
transplantation and also partially differentiate into non-LSC bulk blasts that are unable to self-renew. The
clinical significance of this leukemia stem cell model is supported by the finding that gene expression
signatures of AML LSCs are independently correlated with adverse clinical outcomes. Detailed characterization
of AML LSCs has demonstrated their properties of self-renewal, relative quiescence, resistance to apoptosis,
and increased drug efflux that likely render them less susceptible to conventional therapies aimed at the bulk
proliferative disease. Thus, the generally poor clinical outcomes in AML are attributed to chemotherapy-
resistant LSCs that persist during clinical remission, eventually giving rise to relapsed disease. From a
therapeutic perspective, this cancer stem cell model implies that in order to eradicate the disease and achieve
long-term remissions, treatment approaches must eliminate the LSC population. Although initially described
several decades ago, AML LSCs have not been rigorously purified primarily due to the extensive heterogeneity
of primary human AML and limitations of available xenotransplantation models. Functional LSCs have been
found to be enriched in the CD34+CD38- fraction of leukemic cells, but are also present in other
immunophenotypic populations. A number of cell surface markers have been characterized on these AML
LSC-enriched fractions, but none are specific for LSCs or facilitate their rigorous purification. These results
have made it difficult to further characterize LSC biology and to develop methods for more specific therapeutic
targeting. While the field of human AML LSCs has a rich history of investigation, many key questions remain to
be addressed. Can LSCs be more rigorously identified and isolated based on cell surface marker expression?
What features or programs of LSCs are associated with clinical outcomes? How do adversely prognostic LSC-
associated genes regulate LSC functions? Do non-LSC blasts affect the properties of LSCs? Do AML
subpopulation dynamics affect LSC properties? This proposal seeks to address these questions through the
investigation of human AML LSCs based on the hypothesis that LSCs exhibit distinct functional properties and
biological programs that contribute to AML pathogenesis, response to therapy, and clinical outcomes.
Therefore, these LSCs represent the critical cellular target for the development of curative therapies."

In nature, bacteria typically exist within multispecies communities. Bacterial communities play vital roles in
shaping the environment and their plant and animals. In spite of the prevalence and importance of microbial
communities, important gaps still remain in our understanding of how bacteria interact within these microbiomes.
Our lab’s NIGMS-relevant research is focused on investigating the chemical, molecular, and genetic
mechanisms bacteria use to chemically and physically interact within multispecies communities. We focus on
the soil microbiome as our model system: the soil is not one of the most phylogenetically diverse microbial
environments on the planet, but soil microbes are also the source of the majority of our antibiotics and many
other therapeutics. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms bacteria use to interact within this natural
environment will not only provide a systems-level understanding of complex natural microbiome interactions but
also provide us with potential chemical tools and therapeutic leads to manipulate bacterial behavior. These
bacterially generated compounds are celled specialized or secondary metabolites. These secreted chemical
cues can act as cell-cell communication signals that influence the physiology and metabolism of neighboring
bacteria. They play key roles in bacterial differentiation, or the development of transcriptionally distinct,
heterogeneously expressed subpopulations of cells. We focus on the soil and probiotic bacterium Bacillus
subtilis, which can differentiate into cells that are making biofilm matrix, swimming, or sporulating, among others.
We are interested in understanding the transcriptional specificity, ancestral lineages, and spatial distributions of
this cellular heterogeneity as well as what roles specialized metabolites play in its development. We also aim to
discover specialized metabolites involved in interspecies cell-cell communication to expand our understanding
of chemical interactions in native microbiomes and obtain chemical tools to modulate bacterial physiology.
Finally, we seek to identify the genetic and molecular mechanisms these extracellular signals use to impact
bacterial transcription, heterogeneity, and metabolic activity. This research is significant because it will reveal
fundamental information about the chemical and genetic mechanisms bacteria use to interact with one another.
Our results will deepen our molecular understanding of cell-cell interactions within microbial communities as well
as enable the development of targeted interventions to manipulate microbial behavior in environmentally and
therapeutically important bacteria."

The growing prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) creates an imperative to reliably
distinguish between patients with simple steatosis and those with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
However, hepatic inflammation and cellular injury diagnoses often require invasive liver biopsies for
histopathologic staging. There is an urgent need for safe and reliable noninvasive imaging methods for
diagnosing NASH and longitudinal assessing hepatic inflammation and hepatocellular injury to monitor
treatment efficacy. The presence of and severity of steatosis and fiborosis are now well addressed with
chemical shift imaging and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). Our current cycle of research has
confirmed that MRE-assessed loss modulus is a very promising biomarker for inflammation. In this renewal
application, we propose to continue validation of this biomarker for inflammation and to add noninvasive
assessment of cell injury (ballooning) by introducing a novel MR cytometry modification into the MRE protocol.
The overall goal of this work is to develop and validate multiparametric MR-ICE imaging technologies for fully
assessing disease states during NAFLD evolution, especially inflammation and hepatocellular injury.
• In Aim 1, we will develop the MR-ICE imaging protocol. Fat fraction will be evaluated with a 6-point Dixon
 method. A dual-frequency, self-navigating, and hybrid radial-Cartesian 3D vector hepatic MRE technique will
 be optimized for characterizing multiple mechanical properties of viscoelasticity and nonlinearity. MRC
 sequence and reconstruction will be developed with gradient waveforms and diffusion signal fitting that are
 specifically designed for hepatocyte cytometry, with or without simultaneous MRE acquisition.
• In Aim 2, we will perform longitudinal application of the MR-ICE in an in vivo rat model (N=96, diet-induced
 NASH). Technical integrity and diagnostic performance will be assessed by comparing multiple in vivo
 imaging biomarkers (fat fraction, hepatocyte size, viscoelasticity, nonlinearity) with ex vivo tissue composition
 (water and fat contents), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) testing and histologic features (steatosis,
 inflammation, ballooning, fibrosis), respectively. Statistical models will be trained to diagnose NASH.
• Prior to pilot clinical evaluation, we will aseess the repeatability of MR-ICE biomarkers in 5 controls and 5
 clinical patients using a test-retest strategy. Finally, a pilot clinical evaluation in 10 controls and 40 patients
 with biopsy-proven NAFLD/NASH will be performed to provide preliminary evidence of the diagnostic
 performance of the MR-ICE protocol for staging NAFLD/NASH.
Emerging therapeutic interventions may require life-long treatment, creating the need for more precise non-
invasive methods for identifying those patients who need such interventions. The development of MR-ICE will
make it possible for us and other investigators to advance the precise noninvasive assessment of NASH."

Hip osteoarthritis (OA) impacts approximately 25% of the population over the age of 45 years. Current
conservative treatments include exercise-based programs yet these interventions are ineffective in reducing
hip OA-related clinical and functional abnormalities. One limitation of these exercise programs is the lack of
evidence used to establish these treatment paradigms, which leads to the ineffectiveness of these programs in
treating hip OA. Current experimental protocols used to inform exercise programs for the hip OA population
lack precision in measuring hip joint muscular dysfunction. Therefore, there is a need to establish an
experimental platform that can precisely measure hip joint muscular dysfunction. The novel experimental
platform proposed in this application will be able to precisely assess hip muscle dysfunction and will provide
clinicians with the evidence needed to develop effective multi-disciplinary, exercise programs for conservative
treatment of symptomatic hip OA.
 The principal investigator (PI) of this K01 award will develop a novel, multi-modal experimental platform
that will precisely measure the effects of hip extensor muscle dysfunction in patients with symptomatic hip OA.
The PI will utilize novel imaging techniques and assessment of muscle torque development to assess the
pathomechanism of hip extensor dysfunction in patients with symptomatic hip OA. The corresponding effects
of hip extensor dysfunction during aerobic exercise (mechanical stress test) will be assessed in patients with
symptomatic hip OA. Musculoskeletal simulations and serum-based biomarkers of cartilage health will be used
to quantify the changes that occur in hip joint contact forces and systemic cartilage turnover/synthesis,
respectively, during the mechanical stress test. These study results will be used to determine the relationship
of gluteus maximus muscle fibrosis and hip extensor rate of torque development with changes in hip loading,
cartilage health and self-reported hip pain in the symptomatic hip OA population. Upon completion of this K01
project, the applicant will possess the knowledge needed to implement this novel experimental platform on a
large scale basis to assess the longitudinal relationship between hip extensor dysfunction with hip OA disease
progression in the subsequent R01 application.
 The PI has developed a strong training plan in aging, muscle-imaging, muscle-physiology and
biochemical biomarkers. The PI has established a diverse advisory committee with expertise in aging, physical
therapy, biomechanics, muscle-physiology, exercise for OA, biomarkers of OA and biostatistics. This K01-
award will provide the PI with the training and resources needed to accomplish the goals of this project and will
lead the PI towards a successful career as an independent investigator in aging-related research."

The incidence of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is steadily increasing while most treatment modalities
remain ineffective. Therefore, it would not be a surprise to learn that PDAC is one of the top-4 causes of cancer-
related mortality. What is most striking about this malignancy is that even if detected at early stages, outcomes
remain poor. It is well known that pancreatic cancer is characterized by an immunosuppressive environment,
already found surrounding premalignant lesions or pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), which has been
postulated as one of the main reasons for the lack of response to most therapies. However, the regulatory signals
that precede and support the development of this suppressive TME are not well characterized. The objective of
this grant is to characterize the mechanisms and regulators implicated in the generation of the
immunosuppressive TME that characterizes pancreatic tumorigenic process and to reverse it through
pharmacological and microbial interventions. Our laboratory found that IL-17-secreting immune cells play an
important role in promoting pancreatic tumorigenesis in genetically engineered mouse (GEMM) models of
pancreatic cancer. We now plan to characterize the mechanisms by which IL-17 promotes tumorigenesis by
genetically deleting the IL-17 receptor specifically from the pancreatic oncogenic epithelium using GEMM and
CRISPR/Cas9 (Aim 1). We also found that IL-17 neutralization decreases recruitment of myeloid cells, mostly
neutrophils, and induces CD8+T cells activation and in PDAC orthotopic model. Monoclonal antibodies against
IL-17 or neutrophils will be used to assess the mechanisms employed by IL-17 supporting an
immunosuppressive TME (Aim 2). Finally, we have recently found that fecal microbial transplants can modulate
tumors systemically. In particular, human PDAC-associated gut bacteria is capable of increasing IL-17 levels in
circulation, which may affect distant tumors like pancreatic cancer. We now plan to definitively address the role
gut bacteria in promoting Th17 differentiation and its systemic implications by performing human-into-mice fecal
microbial transplants (Aim 3). Achieving our goals will not only help us better understand immunological as well
as microbial mechanisms implicated in pancreatic tumorigenesis, but will also result in practical novel
interventions with either monoclonal antibodies, narrow spectrum antibiotics or microbial transplants that would
have a direct impact in preventing and/or treating this deadly disease."

No approved medications are available for cocaine abuse, and medications for opioid addiction are limited to
agonist replacement therapies that are abuse liable themselves. Glutamate is one neurochemical system that
has been recently for drug dependence and relapse. One of the most viable therapeutic targets within the
glutamate system is glutamate transporter subtype 1 (GLT-1), a predominantly astrocytic protein that clears
glutamate from the extracellular compartment in the CNS. GLT-1 transport and uptake mechanisms are
dysregulated during COC or opioid exposure and facilitate the enhanced glutamate transmission in brain
reward circuits that underlie dependence and relapse. Agents that enhance the expression of GLT-1
transporters do display efficacy in preclinical models of drug addiction and related CNS disorders, but an
existing hurdle is the disappointing clinical translation. Part of the problem is the agents themselves, which are
limited mostly to β-lactam antibiotics that suffer from a host of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic issues,
including parenteral administration, poor brain penetrability, chronic dosing, adverse effects, and a slow onset
of CNS efficacy that is dependent on increased GLT-1 protein expression. In this proposal, we address both
the lack of effective treatments for cocaine and opioid addiction and the limited diversity in the GLT-1 activator
pipeline. We propose to characterize the efficacy of two non-β-lactam GLT-1 activators (e.g. troriluzole [TRLZ]
and NA-014) in rat assays that model cocaine and opioid reinforcement, dependence, and relapse. TRLZ is a
prodrug of riluzole (approved for ALS) that is already being tested in clinical trials for obsessive-compulsive
disorder and spinal cerebella. TRLZ displays a unique pharmacodynamic profile in that it acts that acts through
a dual mechanism to enhance cellular glutamate uptake and inhibit neuronal glutamate release. Despite a
glutamate-based profile that is favorable for potentially treating drug abuse, the parent drug RLZ has only been
assessed in few preclinical studies that have yielded mixed outcomes. Our interest in RLZ-like compounds for
drug addiction was recently reignited by a 2018 study showing that RLZ reduces cocaine relapse in rats. RLZ
itself, however, is an unlikely candidate for repurposing because of reduced efficacy and potency related to
pharmacokinetic limitations, including high first-pass hepatic metabolism, elevated liver enzymes, a negative
food effect, low aqueous solubility, and poor oral palatability. To mitigate limitations of RLZ, we designed,
synthesized, and evaluated TRLZ as a third-generation prodrug with optimized in vitro and in vivo features.
The second GLT-1 activator is NA-014, which directly activates GLT-1 through selective allosteric modulation
of GLT-1 after a single exposure, making it different from β-lactams that rely on upregulation of the GLT-1 but
only after repeated treatment with high doses. In summary, our results will offer the first comprehensive
information about the efficacy of non-β-lactam GLT-1 activators in preclinical models of drug addiction, and, if
positive, may pave the way for the development of safer and more effective GLT-1-based medications."

Additionally, patients with aromatase/estrogen receptor inhibitors often experience cognitive decline. However,
the underlying pathophysiology and sexual dimorphic mechanisms are still not completely understood, and no
proven treatment or prevention is currently available. Our preliminary studies suggest that brain
aromatase/17β-estradiol (E2) declines significantly preceding the symptoms of AD dementia in rodent AD
models, and systemically inhibiting aromatase or brain-specific knockdown of aromatase further aggravates AD
progression, especially in females. Conversely, the retention of brain aromatase/E2 using exogenous E2
administration or pulsed photobiomodulation (PBM)/laser treatment can mitigate AD development and alleviate
cognitive impairment. Therefore, this proposal aims to elucidate the role of brain aromatase in AD development
and identify whether aromatase is a new target for PBM therapy for preventing and managing AD. Our central
hypothesis is that a decline in brain aromatase plays a causal role in the pathogenesis of AD and that pulsed
PBM can target the heme-iron-containing aromatase enzyme to improve its activity and preserve local brain E2
level, thereby promoting synaptogenesis and ameliorating cognitive decline in AD. To test these hypotheses,
we will first examine whether downregulation or inhibition of aromatase is associated with aggravated cognitive
decline and if PBM or E2 treatment prevent aromatase decline and cognitive deficits in a novel AD rat model.
Secondly, we will test if brain aromatase mediates the beneficial effects of PBM therapy on local E2 production
and cognitive improvements using different AD models. Third, we will determine if PBM enhances
synaptogenesis and spine formation via an aromatase/E2-irisin-BDNF signaling mechanism in both in vivo and
in vitro AD models. To accomplish our objective, we will use transgenic TgF344-AD and 3xTg-AD rodent
models, forebrain neuron-specific aromatase KO (FBN-Aro-KO) mice, and cross-generated FBN-Aro-KO AD
mice. Rat primary neuronal cultures exposed to PBM will also be employed to validate our hypothesis. Our
proposed research is both mechanistically and technically innovative as it will elucidate the efficacy of pulsed
PBM therapy in retaining brain aromatase/E2 homeostasis in different AD models while also identifying novel
signaling mechanisms for pulsed PBM therapy. In addition, our proposed research could offer an important
adjuvant therapy for patients with aromatase/estrogen receptor inhibitors. Therefore, this proposal has valuable
clinical novelty for the prevention and management of AD dementia and to explain the sex differences in AD
development."

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) undergoes autophagic degradation in response to the accumulation of
aggregated proteins within its lumen or in response to starvation. We have proposed that in yeast, actin
assembly at sites of contact between the cortical ER (cER) and endocytic pits is required to displace elements
of the cER from their association with the plasma membrane so that they can interact with the autophagosome
assembly machinery near the vacuole.
 To test our model, we will determine if the requirement in cER-phagy for actin assembly at endocytic
pits can be bypassed by deleting all six genes encoding ER-plasma membrane tethers (DTether). If the role of
actin assembly is to push the cER away from the plasma membrane, the DTether mutations should bypass the
need for actin assembly in ER-phagy. We will ask if the bypass of actin assembly is specific to cER-phagy or if
actin-related defects in other selective autophagy pathways, such as nucleophagy, mitophagy, and pexophagy
are also bypassed. As an additional test we will ask if an artificial ER-plasma membrane tether can block cER-
phagy in both wild type and the DTether strain. Extensive parallels between ER-phagy in yeast and mammalian
cells suggest a conserved mechanism. A long-term goal will be to use siRNA knock downs of actin assembly
components in U2OS cells to assess their roles in ER-phagy.
 We will order all known cER-phagy requirements with respect to the displacement of the cER from the
plasma membrane. Our recent data suggests that a vesicle coat adaptor protein associates with a selective
ER-phagy receptor prior to the displacement of cER from the plasma membrane. We will develop a
bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay to visualize the dynamics of this ER-phagy intermediate in
live cells. We will also order the displacement of the cER from the plasma membrane with respect to the super
assembly of Atg40 oligomers, a process required for packaging of ER fragments into autophagosomes. We will
explore a novel fluorescence complementation assay for super assembly of Atg40 oligomers that will allow
visualization in live cells. In total our studies will define the pathway by which the ER is degraded by
autophagy. This pathway plays a key role in a variety of human diseases including neurodegenerative
disorders and forms of diabetes."

Due to mandates from funding agencies and publishers, high-throughput, molecular data from Down syndrome
individuals and controls (mostly humans and mice) are available in public repositories. Researchers can use such
data to corroborate their own ﬁndings and pose new research questions. Doing so would help to leverage prior
investments and complement efforts by the INCLUDE Data Coordinating Center (DCC) to generate data for new
cohorts. Our proposal focuses speciﬁcally on mRNA expression and DNA methylation data. These data types
shed light on how genes are regulated, how molecular aberrations lead to medical conditions, and how medical
outcomes can be predicted, potentially leading to improved diagnostics, treatments, and insights into human
health and disease. However, many data-generation platforms are used for these data types, and researchers
use a wide range of techniques for normalizing the data, checking data quality (if they check at all), and mapping
to gene annotations. To reuse the data most effectively, the data must be reprocessed from its original form;
normalized and quality checked consistently; and mapped to current annotations. Agencies who manage public
repositories lack resources and expertise to perform these steps. In our ﬁrst aim, we will address this problem using
a data-curation approach. We have identiﬁed 148 datasets speciﬁc to Down Syndrome that we believe should be
prioritized for reuse. Using our expertise in molecular-data processing and bioinformatics, we will re-normalize,
quality-check, summarize, and annotate the data using an approach that maximizes consistency for all of the
datasets. Additionally, we will map the metadata to biomedical-ontology terms in collaboration with the INCLUDE
DCC. We expect that these efforts will reduce barriers for researchers in the Down syndrome community to reuse
the data and accelerate progress in the ﬁeld. Our second aim focuses on interoperability. For many research
questions, a single dataset is insufﬁcient. Sample sizes may be small and/or a single dataset may not represent
the range of phenotypes or other factors necessary to answer a given question. Therefore, it is often crucial to
integrate datasets from multiple sources. However, systematic differences between datasets are inevitable due to
differences in populations, laboratory conditions, and environmental factors. Failing to adjust for these differences
will likely lead to biased conclusions. We will evaluate the feasibility of using generative neural networks, a type
of algorithm that is highly conﬁgurable and is behind many of the most inﬂuential artiﬁcial-intelligence advances
of the past decade. We will apply these algorithms in the context of studying medical conditions that co-occur
with DS, such as autoimmune conditions, dementia-related disease, congenital heart defects, and leukemias. Our
algorithms will search for systematic patterns that differ between datasets and generate a modiﬁed version of the
data in which those differences have been minimized yet the biologically relevant patterns have been retained."

Within a nerve terminal, neurotransmitter-filled vesicles fuse at the active zone. The active zone consists of
protein scaffolds that are anchored to the plasma membrane and form sites for vesicle fusion, and active zone
proteins mediate both the release of synaptic and neuromodulatory transmitters. Interactions between active
zone proteins and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (CaVs) have long been of central interest. Ca2+ influx through
channels of the CaV2 family triggers secretion, and CaV2 positioning determines the sub-millisecond timing,
magnitude and plasticity of release. In previous work, we distinguished between two competing models of CaV2s.
In the “assembly model”, CaV2s are structural scaffolds with functions in active zone assembly and vesicle
docking. In the “anchored model”, active zone proteins recruit CaV2s to anchor them to release sites, and
presynaptic assembly is CaV2-independent. We found that active zone assembly and vesicle docking are
unaffected by genetic ablation of CaV2s. This argues strongly against the assembly model.
The alternate anchored model remains difficult to establish. It is uncertain how CaV2s are targeted to active
zones and whether this model applies broadly to synaptic and neuromodulatory transmission. One line
of work has found that disrupting binding between CaV2 channels and active zone proteins results in impaired
CaV2 recruitment. However, no specific CaV2 binding activity is required, and it remains unknown which CaV2
sequences suffice to mediate CaV2 active zone delivery. We hypothesize that the CaV2 C-terminus contains
multiple interaction motifs that together provide a module for CaV delivery to release sites in most synaptic and
neuromodulatory transmitter systems. We build on two lines of preliminary data. First, we find that multiple
sequence elements in the CaV2 C-terminus together mediate presynaptic delivery, and that they can serve to
target non-active zone CaVs to release sites. Second, our experiments suggest that release of two volume
transmitters, serotonin and acetylcholine, fully depends on CaV2s. In aim 1, we define CaV2 sequences that
mediate CaV active zone targeting at hippocampal synapses. In aim 2, we determine the CaV2-dependence
of neuromodulatory transmitter release in the brain, focusing on serotonin, acetylcholine and norepinephrine.
Our work will establish mechanisms of CaV2 targeting to the active zone and will determine whether these
mechanisms can fundamentally operate in both synaptic and neuromodulatory transmission through assessing
their CaV2 dependence. Altogether, the proposed experiments will likely lead to broad support for the anchored
model across transmitter systems. The understanding of CaV2s that we develop in this line of work is important
for determining how neurotransmission operates and how it breaks down in disease."

The NHLBI has invested extensively in the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC), recognizing that
translating genomic discoveries into optimized management and therapeutic strategies for congenital heart
disease (CHD) can only be achieved in the context of multi-center, collaborative research. Currently, the PCGC
is lacking two fundamental capabilities that hinder its ability to define the genomic basis for CHD outcomes: (1)
a robust mechanism for extracting pertinent, machine-readable clinical data from Electronic Health Records
(EHRs) across multiple institutions; and (2) a robust Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform that is capable of teasing
apart the complex interplay between maternal factors, phenotypes, genotypes, gene functions and clinical
outcomes. Here, we propose innovative solutions to these challenges, by assembling teams of content experts
to leverage existing infrastructure to extract relevant outcomes directly from the EHR of participating PCGC
Centers and by designing best-practice AI tools for outcomes research. Our principal goal is provide the vision,
infrastructure and expertise to collaboratively empower CHD outcomes research, foster knowledge exchange,
and train the next generation of genomic scientists. We propose to leverage existing data infrastructure to obtain
Electronic Health Records (EHR) and other clinical variables at scale by partnering with other research networks
to create a PCGC Data Resource. Using this resource, we will create and deploy a platform of Artificial
Intelligence (AI)-based predictors for CHD outcomes research, with the goal of translating genomic discoveries
into improved management and therapeutic strategies for CHD."

Fibrous dysplasia (FD) affects approximately 1 in 5000 individuals and causes focal bone lesions that result in
pain, deformity and fracture susceptibility. FD lesions are characterized by an accumulation of immature
osteoblast lineage cells as well as robust osteoclastogenesis with increased bone turnover. Receptor activator
of NFkB ligand (RANKL), the key cytokine driving osteoclast differentiation, is highly expressed by osteoblastic
cells in FD lesions. Neutralizing antibody against RANKL, aRANKL, prevents osteoclast formation and
decreases lesion size in mouse models of FD. In patients with FD, denosumab, which targets RANKL, is the
only effective treatment. However, denosumab can inhibit skeletal growth and withdrawal can cause rebound
bone resorption and fractures. Thus, alternative therapies are needed. If we could understand how aRANKL
inhibits FD bone lesions, we might be able to discover new treatment targets.
 To investigate the effect of aRANKL antibody treatment in FD, we used an established mouse model
where GnasR201H expression is induced post-zygotically in skeletal stem cells; bone lesions in this model are
osteoblastic precursors which are a mosaic of wildtype and lineage traced mutant osteoblastic cells. We
demonstrated that aRANKL inhibits the fibrotic bone lesions of FD in this model. At the cellular level, we
demonstrated that aRANKL treatment altered the phenotype of Gnas mutant cells and also had a significant
impact on wildtype osteoblastic cells, inhibiting proliferation and promoting differentiation of both.
 The cellular mechanism responsible for the effect of aRANKL is not known. While RANKL is best known
for its role in driving osteoclast differentiation, it has many other biologic functions. For example, RANKL is critical
for the development of lymph nodes and some specialized epithelial cells, and it can stimulate osteoblast
differentiation through reverse signaling. Thus, we hypothesize that RANKL may promote FD bone lesion
pathogenesis in an osteoclast-independent manner and that the critical target of aRANKL is RANKL itself. We
will test this hypothesis by comparing the efficacy of osteoclast inhibition with anti-CSF1R (which blocks a key
survival factor for osteoclasts) with aRANKL in inhibiting FD lesions in this model.
 The molecular mechanism by which aRANKL treatment alters the cellular phenotype of Gnas mutant
cells and wild-type cells in FD lesions is unknown. To investigate the pathways downstream of aRANKL
treatment, we propose to determine the transcriptional changes induced in Gnas mutant cells and adjacent wild-
type osteoblastic cells using a spatial transcriptomic approach using the GeoMx digital spatial profiler platform.
Through a combination of determining whether aRANKL efficacy is independent of osteoclast inhibition and
molecular investigation of tissue and cell level response to aRANKL, this proposal will significantly advance our
understanding of FD pathogenesis and identify additional pathways that could be targeted for treatment."

The successes of immunotherapies like blockade of co-inhibitory `checkpoint' molecules have changed the
treatment paradigm of cancer. However, the fact that robust responses are restricted to a subset of patients
highlights the need to further understand the biology of exhausted T cells: what drives their differentiation,
maintains their dysfunction, and how they may be reinvigorated to eradicate tumor cells. Our lab and others
have revealed that metabolic stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are key drivers in T cell exhaustion, both
from a cell extrinsic and cell intrinsic perspective. We recently reported that mitochondrial stress and reactive
oxygen species (ROS) production, driven to intolerable levels under hypoxic environments in the face of
persistent antigen, was sufficient to deviate cells into a terminally exhausted fate. Antioxidants both
pharmacologic and genetic could bias T cell differentiation away from exhaustion to more functional fates. But precisely how ROS production alters T cell fate and function remains unclear. One of the more intriguing
observations was elevating ROS via mitochondrial dysfunction altered T cell signaling: as peroxide is one of
the more potent inhibitors of tyrosine phosphatases, elevating ROS alone mimicked TCR and other
phosphotyrosine signals. ROS also dramatically reprograms cellular metabolism: by inhibiting aconitase, citrate is driven from the mitochondria where it is converted to acetyl-CoA, acting as a substrate for de novo
lipogenesis. As a result, while exhausted cells possess dysfunctional mitochondria and compete poorly for
glucose, they are loaded with lipid droplets and repress fatty acid oxidiation and lipolysis. While we know that
mitochondrial stress can drive T cells to exhaustion and that terminally exhausted T cells are metabolically
insufficient, the mechanisms that ultimately drive and enforce the phenotype remain unclear. In this Proposal,
we will identify the metabolic underpinnings of T cell exhaustion: how metabolic stress can interfere with
signaling, transcription, and differentiation. AIM 1: Determine how oxidative stress alters T cell signaling
cascades at the level of phosphatase inhibition. ROS play central roles in signaling as inhibitors of tyrosine
phosphatases. We will determine the role of ROS in exhausted T cell function in vivo, and use proteomics and
transcriptomic technologies to identify the phosphorylation cascades susceptible to ROS induction. AIM 2:
Identify how ROS-mediated changes in metabolic flux undermine T cell function. In this Aim, we will explore
the role increased lipid storage plays in T cell function and ask whether these elevated levels of lipids
represent `dead weight' or an untapped fuel source. AIM 3: Define the importance of altered nutrient pathways induced through oxidative stress responses. Our data suggest Slc16a11 similarly supports lactate uptake into exhausted T cells and maintains their dysfunctional state. Using a conditional knockout mouse and blocking antibodies, we will determine the importance of monocarboxylate metabolism in exhausted T cell biology."

 Tendon overuse initiates mechanical damage that leads to chronic tendinosis (degeneration) and
tendinopathy (clinical presentation with pain), which are common and notoriously difficult to treat. Despite the
widely accepted role of loading in tendinosis, the structural, mechanical, and cellular mechanisms by which
loading leads to initiation and progressive damage in tendinosis remain unknown. We hypothesize that
overload causes micro-scale structural and mechanical damage, which alters load transmission to
cells, driving the multi-scale structural and molecular progression of tendinosis in a vicious cycle.
 To determine the mechanisms involved in tendinosis, a preclinical in vivo animal model of tendon
overuse and multiscale assessments of tendon structural and mechanical damage and interrogation of
cellular mechanotransduction and intracellular signaling mechanisms are all required. This is because
the physiological processes in tendinosis involve tissue-scale tendon loading that is transferred to the micro-,
nano-, and molecular-scale, where microstructural damage and cellular mechanotransduction signaling occurs.
Our team has recently established a model of tendinosis using rat synergist ablation (SynAb), where we
remove the Achilles tendon, which overloads the synergistic plantaris tendon without directly injuring it. Our
pilot data exhibit hallmark features of human tendinosis (increased area, collagen disorganization,
proteoglycan accumulation, collagen Type III production, and reduced tensile modulus).
 Our long-term goal is to enable interventions for tendon regeneration and rehabilitation to treat tendinopathy
and prevent its progression. The objective of this proposal is to determine the mechanisms responsible
for onset and progression of tendinosis in the SynAb model of tendon overuse in the following aims:
Aim 1: Assess the multiscale structural changes following the onset and progression of tendinosis.
Aim 2: Quantify the multiscale mechanical properties and damage following the onset and progression
of tendinosis.
Aim 3: Interrogate changes in tenocyte mechanoresponse and cytoskeleton during tendon overload.
This study will determine the mechanisms responsible for the multiscale damage in overuse tendinosis and
establish these in the context of key hallmarks of human tendinosis using a preclinical in vivo model.
Quantifying multiscale damage and cellular mechanisms by which loading leads to tendinosis is critical for
designing and evaluating interventions to prevent and treat tendinopathy."
10891615,"Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) shows great promise in characterizing
brain circuits and networks related to human mental function and identifying
pathophysiological changes underlying mental health disorders, healthy and pathological
aging, substance misuse, and beyond. Great strides are being made in many areas, but
the vast majority of fMRI research relies on the simplifying assumption of a canonical (or
highly constrained) hemodynamic response function (HRF) that is substantially
inaccurate. The HRF varies across brain regions, individuals, and age, but estimating it
with sufficient accuracy and precision is problematic in small to medium-sized studies.
As a result, over 95% of fMRI studies use a canonical HRF of fixed form. This results in
substantial bias, power loss, and confounding. These problems apply to both task-based

1, we will contrast commonly used HRF models across the lifespan based on reliability
and ability to ‘decode’ task state and phenotypic variables (e.g., cognitive function and
mood). We develop novel methods for extracting meaningful phenotypic information
from HRF shape and population inference, and develop robust software for best-in-class
models. In Aim 2, we integrate best-in-class HRF models into a novel Gaussian process

customized HRFs based on readily measurable characteristics (age, sex, and body-
mass index) and brain region. In Aim 3, we use the HRF atlas to deconvolve rs-fMRI
data and construct an HRF-corrected connectome map. We validate the HRF models,
atlas, and connectome on two independent HCP Disease Connectomes and the CAM-
CAN dataset (n=~700), and share the atlas, connectome, and software integrations with
the research community. The development of these large-sample models will provide
more accurate and precise estimates of task-related fMRI activity and connectivity in

There is no cure for osteogenesis imperfecta (OI or brittle bone disease), a group of heritable genetic disorders
affecting 1:15,000 births. The most evident clinical hallmarks of OI are bone fragility and skeletal deformities.
Mutations in trimeric intracellular cation channel B (TRIC-B), an endoplasmic reticulum potassium (K+) channel
encoded by transmembrane protein 38 B (TMEM38B) gene and modulating Calcium (Ca2+) flux, cause the rare
recessive form of the disease, namely OI type XIV. How a potassium channel is responsible for a heritable bone
disease is puzzling the field. Calcium is indispensable for several cell activities including signal transduction
pathways that regulate osteoblast differentiation and function.
We here plan to identify the intra and extra-cellular mechanisms responsible for the skeletal defects and fragility
caused by loss-of-function mutations in TRIC-B, with the goal to unveil a druggable target for OI therapy. We
recently proved that the Calcium flux impairment due to osteoblast TRIC-B loss-of-function compromises the
TGF-β/SMAD signaling. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that TMEM38B mutation generates an
impairment of β-catenin/WNT pathway and of cell adhesion, which results in an increased bone fragility by
compromising bone matrix structure and composition, thus reducing strength and toughness. Specific aims are
to: 1) dissect TRIC-B role in osteoblast intracellular signaling affecting activity and adhesion; 2) determine the
mechanism by which osteoblast specific absence of TRIC-B develops bone fragility.
To address TRIC-B bone function, we generated an osteoblast specific TRIC-B knock-out mouse that
reproduces patients’ skeletal outcome. The consequence of loss of TRIC-B on osteoblast WNT pathways and
cell adhesion will be investigated by advanced molecular, biochemical and high-resolution imaging techniques
(AIM 1). Bone strength and fracture toughness combined with second harmonic generation microscopy and
spectroscopic analysis of the bone tissue collagen fiber structure and composition, respectively, will inform on
the mechanism through which depletion of Tmem38b generates bone fragility (AIM 2). This work will shed light
on TRIC-B role in osteoblasts and extracellular matrix to identify a druggable target for OI."

Intracellular bacterial pathogens manipulate host cells through a vast array of mechanisms. Studying these
interactions has propelled our understanding of therapeutic development against these pathogens and host cell
biology. However, many intracellular pathogens cannot be easily studied due to their obligate nature and
resistance to genetic manipulation. These include the spotted fever group (SFG) Rickettsia, which cause a range
of potentially severe arthropod-borne human illnesses, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The
development of new random mutagenesis systems for SFG Rickettsia has propelled studies of these microbes
and hinted at the remarkable diversity of unprecedented pathogen innovations in this genus. Recently, our lab
performed a small-scale transposon mutagenesis screen in the model rickettsial species R. parkeri to identify
attenuated mutants. This screen led to the isolation of >100 R. parkeri mutants with infection defects, with only
a few containing insertions in genes previously linked to R. parkeri virulence. The remaining strains represent a
valuable tool for probing and understanding R. parkeri and intracellular pathogen biology. Over 15% of the genes
hit in this screen are unannotated. Two of these unannotated genes, hrtA and sp50, encode R. parkeri proteins
that are predicted to be surface-exposed or secreted and have putative structural features suggestive of direct
binding to host proteins. I hypothesize that HrtA and Sp50 are novel R. parkeri secreted or surface-exposed
effectors that can hijack specific host functions to promote infection. In this proposal, I will first demonstrate the
spatiotemporal niches of both HrtA and Sp50 (Aim 1) to establish how they phenotypically contribute to R. parkeri
infection. Then, I will use affinity purification approaches to identify direct host-derived interactors of HrtA and
Sp50 (Aim 2). Finally, I will use host-direct genetic perturbation screens to profile host-pathogen synthetic genetic
interactions with R. parkeri strains lacking HrtA or Sp50 (Aim 3). Through this work, I will not only extend our
understanding of SFG Rickettsia pathogenesis, but will also demonstrate the potential of a synthetic genetic
approach for investigating and annotating pathogen genes of unknown function. Results from these studies may
also inform development of therapeutics such as vaccines against SFG Rickettsia species.

Itch is an unpleasant sensation that evokes a desire to scratch. While itch accompanies many skin infections, a
causative role for microbes in itch has not been previously investigated. Itch-induced scratching can contribute
to significant skin damage and bacterial pathogenesis. Here, we investigate the role of the human bacterial
pathogen Staphylococcus aureus and its secreted proteases in driving itch and inflammation. S. aureus
colonizes 90% of skin lesions caused by Atopic Dermatitis, a disease characterized by chronic itch. S. aureus
also causes impetigo, a contagious skin disease characterized by itchy lesions. We hypothesize that S. aureus
secretes proteases that can directly act on host sensory neurons to drive itch, scratch-induced skin damage, and
neuroimmune crosstalk. Our preliminary data shows that S. aureus epicutaneous infection of mice induces
robust itch behaviors (alloknesis, spontaneous itch) and resulting skin pathology. Using isogenic mutant strains,
we find that secreted S. aureus proteases, and in particular the serine protease V8 (SspA) is required for itch
production during infection. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine the role of S. aureus V8 protease in driving itch,
neuronal activation, and skin inflammation. We will utilize isogenic S. aureus mutant and complemented strains
for V8, as well as recombinant V8 to elucidate the necessity and sufficiency of this protease in inducing itch,
scratch induced damage, and inflammation caused by S. aureus. Itch is mediated by dorsal root ganglia (DRG)
sensory neurons. DRG neuron calcium imaging will be performed to investigate specific neuronal responses to
V8 protease. Cheek intradermal injections and neurobehavioral analysis will be performed to distinguish itch vs.
pain behaviors in mice. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine whether neurons and host cells detect S. aureus
V8 protease through specific protease-activated receptors (PARs). Preliminary data indicates that PAR1 may be
an important host receptor that is activated by V8. We will utilize biochemical and luminescence-based
approaches to determine the V8 cleavage site on PAR1. We will treat mice with pharmacological antagonists
against PAR1 and utilize PAR1-/- mice to determine effects on V8-protease and S. aureus induced itch. In
Specific Aim 3, we will utilize genetic approaches to ablate specific skin-innervating neurons (Nav1.8+, Mrgprd+,
and Trpv1+) to assay their roles in S. aureus induced inflammation. We hypothesize that neurons will drive both
itch/scratch-induced damage, and the release of neural mediators that directly signal to immune cells. We will
use targeted approaches and proteomics to assess neuronal release of proinflammatory mediators. Our work
could elucidate novel molecular crosstalk between S. aureus, host neurons and immune cells in itch. The three
aims of this study leverage the complementary skills of Dr. Chiu and Dr. Horswill, combining neurobiological,
immunological, and microbiological approaches to investigate the mechanisms of itch and neuroimmune
signaling in S. aureus infection. Given the importance of itch in skin diseases, elucidating a microbial role in
inducing this sensation could transform our understanding of host-microbe interactions at the skin barrier."

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has the worst prognosis and survival in all breast cancer subtypes with
currently available standard therapies, representing an unmet therapeutic challenge. Significant heterogeneity
(with six genetically defined subgroups) and a lack of FDA-approved targeted therapeutics and are the major
reasons contributing to poor prognosis and high mortality rates and have prevented identification of common
molecular targets and development of targeted therapeutics. To meet this challenge, we extensively analyzed
breast cancer patient databases and discovered that expression of Eukaryotic Elongation Factor 2-Kinase
(EF2K) gene encoding an unusual alpha kinase has a dramatic effect on survival rates of TNBC patients.
Remarkably, TNBC patients with low EF2K expression had no mortality up to 10 years. More importantly, we
found that EF2K is highly overexpressed in the majority of TNBC patients and showed that it is an important
driver for TNBC tumorigenesis, invasion and progression; and validated it as a potential molecular target using
genetic silencing technology in multiple preclinical animal models. Based on our preliminary studies, we
hypothesize that EF2K represents an Achilles’ heel for targeting TNBC and if effectively targeted, it will have a
tremendous impact on patient survival. Considering that EF2K knock-out mice are healthy and have no signs of
toxicity, EF2K-targeted therapies are expected to be safe. However, currently there is no specific or potent
inhibitors for targeting EF2K. Thus, in collaboration with a team of investigators, including medicinal chemists
and computational chemists, we recently synthesized a serious of potential small molecule inhibitors of EF2K
based on computational modeling and identified a lead compound that significantly inhibits EF2K activity. Based
on the lead compound, we further designed and synthesized more than a hundred of second generation of novel
compounds and identified a more potent inhibitor that is effective in inhibiting EF2K at with nanomolar
concentrations and demonstrated remarkable in vivo efficacy in TNBC tumors when formulated in long-acting
single-lipid based nanoparticles, with no observed toxic effects. In this proposed project, we will characterize
and optimize the EF2K-inhibitor based therapy using clinically relevant TNBC models with the goal of developing
highly specific strategies for TNBC. Our long-term goal is to develop safe, highly effective therapies and translate
them to the clinic for TNBC patients, who lack targeted treatment options."

Today, lung transplantation for patients with end-stage lung disease has become increasingly standardized
around the world, thanks to decades of international collaboration and partnership. As a result, more patients
can receive a life-saving procedure and benefit from vastly improved survival and quality of life.
However, access to lung transplant remains particularly variable for three categories of high-risk patients: 1)
highly sensitized patients; 2) patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support as a bridge to
transplant (ECMO-BTT); and 3) patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, including those with
COVID-19-associated ARDS). Because these patients are at high-risk for complications and historically
understudied, there are no clear guidelines for their treatment. As a result, they are uniquely disadvantaged:
receiving a transplant largely depends on their program’s willingness to accept the risk of transplant without
sufficient data to inform how it can be optimally and safely performed. Programs, therefore, differ in the
selection and management of these patients, creating significant disparities and variation in care across
centers, ultimately to the detriment of the transplant candidate.
With support from the NIH Lung Transplant Consortium, we propose the formation of CATCH: Creating Access
to Transplant for Candidates who are High Risk, with the goal to improve access and outcomes for these
patients in need. The four lung transplant programs that comprise CATCH—University Health Network,
University of Florida, Columbia University, and Brigham and Women’s Hospital—collectively perform over 400
lung transplantations per year, and each have extensive but differing experience in managing these patients.
Our CATCH study hypothesis is that our individual management strategies significantly impact high-risk
candidates’ likelihood of receiving a transplant and their post-transplant outcomes. Through prospective
cohort studies, we aim to devise an optimal and united strategy that addresses the specific unmet needs of
these high risk patients.
Our team has been carefully assembled based on scientific merit and strategic collaboration, representing
multidisciplinary strengths in thoracic surgery and lung transplant pulmonology that will complement our
recognized research leadership. We have extensive experience in successful project management for large
multi-site projects, and our expertise in developing standardized protocols and consensus documents will help
to maximize the potential across all transplant centers. Ultimately, as key opinion leaders in a field that actively
looks to us for guidance, our CATCH project outcomes are strongly positioned to have an immediate
transformative impact by standardizing the field and ensuring that every patient in need of a lung transplant
can receive one."
10892175,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Lung transplantation (LT) recipients suffer from life-threatening pulmonary infections that can trigger acute
rejection and death. Although vaccination is the most effective way for preventing infections, vaccine efficacy is
limited in immunocompromised solid organ transplant recipients. Two recent JAMA studies suggest that most
transplant recipients fail to mount antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines; anti-metabolite
immunosuppressants further dampened this response. To facilitate more effective vaccination strategies,
there is an urgent unmet need to understand vaccine responses in immunosuppressed LT recipients.
Adopting a system vaccinology approach, this grant characterizes complex vaccine-elicited immune responses
to address the problem of deficient vaccine immunogenicity in LT recipients. As the COVID-19 pandemic
heightens focus on the vulnerability of LT recipients, the creation of a vaccine-oriented biobank to facilitate
system biology analyses can strengthen the newly-formed NIH LT Consortium.
In this proposal, we unite physicians/scientists from Stanford, Inova-Fairfax, and Houston Methodist to build a
vaccination-oriented biorepository as the focus of a clinical center (CC). Responding to the RFA to explore
center-specific hypotheses, our CC seeks an answer to the pressing question: ‘how do LT recipients respond to
vaccinations?’ The grant hypothesis is that a vaccination-oriented biorepository will facilitate the holistic
analysis of influenza vaccine-induced immune responses in LT recipients from geographically distant
regions and that the use of an anti-metabolite immunosuppressant predicts reduced protective innate
and adaptive responses in these patients. In Aim 1, biospecimens from patients immunized by vaccines
against COVID-19, varicella-zoster, pneumococcus, and influenza will be prospectively collected and banked to
generate the biorepository. To address hypothesis-driven questions achievable with a modest budget, Aim 2
uses system vaccinology tools to evaluate the influenza vaccines, the most common vaccinations administered
to LT patients. Aim 2a characterizes humoral and innate immunity, Aim 2b focuses on cellular immunity, and
Aim 2c builds a vaccine response network with bioinformatics tools. Aim 2 will also assess whether the use of
an anti-metabolite as immunosuppression reduces influenza vaccine immunogenicity. The rationale for focusing
on influenza over COVID-19 is that most patients will be vaccinated against the latter when this project begins.
However, our CC is well-equipped to test other types of vaccinations when future initiatives are available. In
addition to fostering interactions and shared resources within the LT Consortium, the main purpose of the
Stanford CC is to improve vaccine designs, adjuvants, and administration protocols in at-risk LT patients through
an improved understanding of immune responses. Information gleaned here can inform and improve vaccination
efforts for all immunosuppressed patients."
10885406,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Regenerative medicine cell transplantation strategies are limited by poor transplanted cell survival,
retention, and integration. To overcome this, I propose development of an engineered biomaterial that addresses
two major causes of transplanted cell death: (i) acute membrane damage during injection and (ii) long-term
exposure to a toxic microenvironment, by providing (i) cell encapsulation within an injectable hydrogel and (ii)
slow-release of growth factors. To evaluate the preclinical effectiveness of this biomaterial, I will target cervical
spinal cord injury (SCI), which results in permanent sensorimotor dysfunction and has no clinically available
regenerative therapies. My data demonstrates that transplanting human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived
neurons (hiPSC-neurons) significantly improves anatomical and functional outcomes in rat models of cervical
SCI; however, this cell type suffers from poor transplanted cell viability, reducing therapeutic efficacy. I have
already shown that use of an injectable hydrogel significantly improves the acute viability of encapsulated cells
by providing mechanical shielding during injection, which resulted in statistically improved neurite outgrowth and
forelimb function. I now hypothesize that tuning the temporal growth factor-release properties of this designer,
injectable hydrogel will significantly improve long-term survival of transplanted hiPSC-neurons, leading to
significantly improved anatomical and functional outcomes. Specifically, in Aim 1, I will optimize a growth factor-
release system in vitro to assist hiPSC-neurons in surviving oxidative stress and excitotoxicity that are present
at the injury site. In Aim 2, I perform functional evaluation of this biomaterial/cell therapy in a subacute model of
SCI in comparison to standard delivery vehicles (saline and fibrinogen) and appropriate controls.
 My career goal is to lead a translational laboratory that leverages expertise in biomaterials and stem cell
biology to develop regenerative therapies for central nervous system (CNS) injury and to serve as a role model
for young female scientists from underrepresented backgrounds. This Career Development Award would enable
me to enhance my strong background in CNS neurodegeneration and stem cell biology with new expertise in
biomaterial design and translational bioengineering. My career development plan includes (1) formal
coursework in materials science and bioengineering, (2) technical training in recombinant biomaterials synthesis
and characterization, (3) close mentorship by an outstanding bioengineer with a strong track-record of successful
training and collaboration, and (4) career guidance by an Advisory Committee to prepare for my transition to
independence. My training plan leverages the outstanding resources available within Stanford University and
national and international events to strengthen my scientific network, build on my extensive mentorship and
grantsmanship skills, and polish my scientific communication. This plan will position me to submit innovative and
interdisciplinary application packets for tenure-track Assistant Professorships in my last year of this award as I
embark on an independent career at the intersection of biomaterials science and CNS regeneration."
10893408,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): 
The various forms of cognitive decline cost an estimated $305 billion in the United States alone. It 
is anticipated that, by 2050, the number of older adults with cognitive decline will double. The impact 
of cognitive decline goes beyond the financial costs but also presents physical, mental, and 
emotional burdens to older adults, their caregivers, and society. Recent studies reveal that the 
prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) ranges from 10% to 20% in older adults and no 
medications have been proven to be effective for treating MCI. Thus, accurate diagnosis, assessment, and 
detection of cognitive decline in older adults are essential for developing effective, precise, and 
individualized management and treatment procedures. 
In this project, we will develop a toolchain for the assessment of cognitive decline using 
multimodal neuroimaging and machine learning (ML) methods. We propose three specific aims: (1) 
to develop a comprehensive test battery selective of MCI in a mobile software synchronized with 
multimodal functional near infrared spectroscopy and electroencephalography (fNIRS-EEG) based 
neuroimaging system that can concurrently provide electrophysiological, hemodynamic and behavioral 
measures; (2) to extract, select, and validate the multitude of within and across modality biomarkers 
from fNIRS-EEG data in temporal, spatial, spectral, and complexity domains together with the 
behavioral ones; (3) to develop a comprehensive multimodal ML approach to detect MCI based on 
fNIRS-EEG and behavioral features. 
The finding of this project can lead to an unprecedented transformation to the study, assessment, 
diagnosis and monitoring of cognitive decline in older adults. Developing a mobile application that 
combines functional near-infrared-spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) on one 
platform that could be used in less expensive and restrictive testing environments to determine 
functional brain alterations in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is very innovative and will 
have major impact on knowledge. Furthermore, utilizing the mobile application and cutting-edge machine 
learning methods, will allow us to determine novel functional brain biomarkers that distinguish older 
adults with MCI from healthy controls, which in turn can have major impact on diagnostic procedures of 
older adults with MCI."
10893409,"Goals. The Cleveland Chronic Kidney Disease Recruiting Site (CLE-CKD-RS) has been a member of the KPMP
since its inception 5 years ago and will continue to recruit a cohort of CKD patients with diabetic kidney disease
(DKD) and hypertension-attributable CKD (H-CKD), building on our demonstrated successes. To meet our
proposed recruiting targets, we will expand patient screening to the Cleveland Clinic main campus general
medicine clinic and CKD clinics in regional facilities, focusing on sites that serve minority communities. The CLE-
CKD-RS will strengthen and broaden its relationships with diverse communities to foster trust and ensure the
Cleveland KPMP cohort reflects the people most burdened by kidney diseases.
Background. Kidney diseases are common, costly and deadly. The Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP)
is building a resource, which will have patient-level clinical datasets and molecular phenotypes, to identify hidden,
clinically actionable subgroups of people with kidney diseases for discovery of mechanisms, biomarkers and
new treatments. The KPMP hypothesizes proposes integration of multidimensional patient data, omic level
molecular data and variation in genome sequence will generate tools necessary for needed innovation.
CLE-CKD-RS: synergy with and value to KPMP. In the first funding cycle the CLE-CKD-RS research team has
successfully executed KPMP protocols to ethically and safely enroll, biopsy and retain a diverse cohort of KPMP
participants. In addition, The CLE-CKD-RS has established an engaged Community Advisory Board and used
opportunities to educate the medical and patient communities about the KPMP, the burden of kidney diseases
and approaches to promote kidney health. Although KPMP activities were first suspended and then slowed by
the public health response to the COVID pandemic, the CLE-CKD-RS used telehealth tools to follow our cohort
and rapidly restarted activities when permitted. This experience has prepared for future black swan events.
Members of the CLE-CKD-RS team serve on KPMP working groups and committees as members and leaders.
We participate in two CKD extended clinical phenotyping studies funded by the Opportunity Pool funds and
engaged other local investigative groups to join the KPMP by winning Opportunity Pool funding. Building upon
these successes, we are proposing the following Milestones:
 1. Safely and ethically collect 30-40 research kidney biopsies per year from eligible individuals with H-CKD
 or DKD with target aggregate enrollment of 180 CKD participants for the 5 year funding period.
 2. Retain 90% of enrolled participants in research follow-up visits and activities throughout the funding cycle.
 3. Initiate KPMP recruitment at CKD clinics in regional sites that serve the Black and Hispanic communities
 in years 6 and 7, respectively and maintain recruitment at those sites for the duration of the funding cycle.
 4. Broaden in person, expand virtual and live community engagement activities for education and reciprocal
 interactions about kidney health, KPMP participation and biomedical research in general."
10893414,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Abnormal placental blood flow significantly increases the risk of fetal morbidity and mortality. Placental
insufficiency (PI) occurs in as many as 6% of pregnancies in the United States and can result in
neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) increases rates of placental
dysfunction, but the impact following moderate PAE is less clear. More than 5% of infants born in the United
States have PAE, which can result in severe long-term neurodevelopmental deficits, including cognitive
impairment, language and motor disabilities and attention disorders. Although it is known that PAE or PI each
result in brain injury, the impact from the combination of PAE and PI on neurological outcomes is poorly
understood. As there are currently no clinical methods to diagnostically or prognostically stratify infants with this
combination of conditions, this study fills a gap in knowledge on the interaction between PAE and PI and their
cumulative effects on the developing brain. Our central hypothesis is that: Moderate prenatal alcohol exposure
exacerbates the impact of acute placental insufficiency on behaviors sensitive to medial frontal cortical functional
and structural damage in juvenile offspring. In Aim 1, we will test whether touchscreen testing reveals greater
deficits in attention to target stimuli and the ability to withhold responding to non-target stimuli in the PAE+PI
compared to either insult alone. In Aim 2, we will examine whether the combination of PAE+PI reduces fractional
anisotropy, increases tensor diffusivity, and alters dendritic morphology and spine density in the cingulate cortex
at Postnatal day 35 (P35). We predict that PAE+PI will result in significantly decreased branching more so than
in PAE or PI alone. Finally, we will test whether PAE+PI alters patterns of neuronal firing and oscillatory activity
within the cingulate cortex in Aim 3. We predict that PAE+PI will result in decreased firing rate in cingulate cortical
Layer 5 pyramidal neurons, a compensatory increase in the number of task-responsive single units and a
decrease in the coherence of oscillatory activity. Together, these studies will examine both the microstructural
and functional abnormalities during a critical period of neurodevelopment and could provide vital translational
clues to the specific functional brain damage caused by PAE and PI. Completion of this investigation could
lead to mechanistic studies providing important insights on if alcohol consumption can exacerbate the
neurobehavioral consequences of a relatively common placental complication in late pregnancy."

This grant proposal describes a research project that aims to improve the fairness of deep learning models for
pathology detection in chest radiographs. Health equity, the state in which everyone has a fair and just
opportunity to attain their highest level of health, is the cornerstone of a fair and just society. However, racial
and ethnic minority groups in the United States experience higher rates of illness and death across a wide
range of health conditions. With the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning (DL) in
healthcare, there is growing concern about increased disparities through the use of algorithms.
To address this issue, the research team proposes to leverage generative modeling to better represent
minority groups in training data. Specifically, they will train DL models that detect 14 pathologies from publicly
available chest radiographs with patient age, sex and race information. They will use Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to create synthetic data and augment the dataset with more diverse images.
The research team expects that engineered image synthesis will train DL models that reliably detect chest
pathologies without being biased on race or sex. To achieve this goal, they have proposed three aims: 1)
Establish a baseline for pathology detection in chest radiographs; 2) Augment the real radiographs with
synthetic chest radiographs representing minorities; and 3) Assess the impact of synthetic data on model
fairness.
The proposed research leverages the power of DL image generation algorithms to potentially improve the
accuracy and fairness of pathology detection in chest radiographs. Additionally, the generative model will be
released publicly as a foundational model for researchers without access to the required computational
resources to train such models. This approach has the potential to improve healthcare outcomes for
underserved populations and advance the field of fairness in AI research."

The Hippo pathway is conserved from yeasts to humans. In mammals, this signaling pathway controls tissue
development by balancing cell proliferation and death. The Hippo kinases, MST1 and MST2, transduce signals
via phosphorylation of the scaffold protein MOB1 and the downstream kinase LAST1. Animal models show that
tissue-specific Mst1/2 gene knockouts lead to abnormal organ development and tumor formation. In addition to
its well-known functions in development and cancer, recent studies found the Hippo pathway is targeted and
manipulated by bacterial pathogens, suggesting a role of this conserved host pathway in bacterial pathogenesis.
Notably, individuals with loss-of-function mutations in the MST1 gene are immunocompromised. Consistent with
this observation in humans, our lab knocked out both Mst1 and Mst2 genes in macrophage and found that these
macrophages are highly susceptible to infection by the human pathogen Legionella pneumophila, highlighting
an emerging role of the Hippo kinases in immunity against infection. Using the Mst1/2 double knockout cell model,
we further discovered that MST1/2 are the key regulators for immune gene expression and programmed cell
death during infection. Importantly, upon challenge of virulent L. pneumophila, MST1/2 full-length proteins are
proteolytically cleaved, resulting in MST1/2 fragments (MST1/2-NT) that contain the kinase domains but are
separated from the regulatory domains. In biochemical assays, MST1/2-NT, surprisingly, no longer
phosphorylate their cognate substrate, MOB1, but exhibit altered substrate specificity for protein phosphorylation.
In cell-based assays, MST1/2-NT production contributes to activation of apoptotic cell death that is critical for
restricting virulent L. pneumophila. Based on the preliminary data collected in our lab, we propose a model that,
upon infection, macrophages trigger cleavage of MST1/2 to activate an inflammatory Hippo signaling mediated
by the proapoptotic MST1/2-NT as a defense mechanism. The objective of the proposed study is to dissect the
importance of this novel inflammatory Hippo signaling. In Aim 1, we will use an innovative technique,
Thiophosphorylation Proteome Screen (TPS), that allows us to screen more than 21,000 human proteins for
direct substrates of full-length MST1/2 and MST1/2-NT. We will use the established substrate validation methods
which include in vitro and cell-based assays to validate genuine substrates of these kinases. This aim will yield
a comprehensive phosphoproteome controlled by the Hippo kinases that is fundamental for understanding both
the canonical and inflammatory Hippo signaling. In Aim 2, we will focus on how MST1/2 influence gene
expression and communication in immune cells. Specifically, we discovered that expression of the complement
protein C1q is depleted in Mst1/2 double knockout macrophages. We will use genetic and cell-based assays to
elucidate the molecular mechanism by which MST1/2 regulate C1q, the complement protein with a crucial role
in bacteria killing. This study will provide insights for boosting innate immunity against infection through
modulating the activities of the Hippo kinases."

Desensitization of b1-adrenergic receptors (b1ARs) is a hallmark of heart failure (HF), in which b1ARs on the
plasma membrane (PM-b1AR) undergo endocytosis. The loss of PM-b1AR leads to impaired cAMP-PKA activity
associated with reduced ejection fraction in HF. Despite decades of efforts that have primarily aimed to restore
the cell surface b1AR signaling in failing hearts, effective pharmacotherapy for HF remains an unmet clinical
need. Distinct from most prior studies that focused on bAR at the PM, accumulating evidence of bAR signaling
inside myocyte indicates potential implication in HF. We aim to reveal an internal b1AR signaling at the
sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) critical for regulating cardiac contractility, which is desensitized in HF. We recently
reported a pool of functional b1ARs on the SR (SR-b1AR). The SR-b1AR is activated by catecholamines entering
cells via primarily organic cation transporter 3. We found that monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), an enzyme
responsible for the degradation of catecholamines, is significantly increased in human HF. Thus, the elevated
expression of MAOA essentially restricts the access of catecholamines to the SR-b1AR in HF despite increased
sympathetic drive. In this proposal, we hypothesize that 1) activation of the SR-b1AR is fine-tuned by MAOA for
enhancing cardiac E-C coupling in physiological stress; 2) the increased expression of MAOA in HF exacerbates
b1AR signaling desensitization and contributes to depressed contractility. We propose that MAOA inhibition re-
sensitizes the SR-b1AR signaling in failing myocytes and rescues E-C coupling and cardiac contractility in HF.
We will apply integrated experimental approaches to test the hypotheses. Aim 1 MAOA controls the access of
catecholamines to the SR-b1AR and cardiac inotropy. Aim 2. Cardiac b1ARs undergo translocation from the PM
to the SR under chronic adrenergic stimulation in HF. Aim 3. Inhibition of MAOA rescues the SR-b1AR signaling
and cardiac contractility in HF. Distinct from most studies focusing on adrenergic signaling on the PM, this study
aims to unravel a novel local SR adrenergic signaling in the regulation of cardiac E-C coupling and present
MAOA as a potential therapeutic target to rescue depressed cardiac contractility in HF."

Numerous genetic variants in tRNA modification enzymes have been linked to
devastating neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders. However, the molecular
mechanisms underpinning these pathologies are unknown. Why is it that perturbations to
many different tRNA modification enzymes and thus, changes to the various chemical
modifications they catalyze, seem to affect the brain more so than other organs? To
resolve this question, our lab seeks to elucidate the molecular and cellular roles of tRNA
modification enzymes in human health and disease. We have recently uncovered a novel
tRNA synthetase-like mimic, DALRD3, that is required for a specific chemical modification
in a subset of human tRNAs. Our preliminary results suggest that the DALRD3-dependent
modification impacts tRNA conformational stability and function. Notably, we have also
identified an autosomal-recessive variant in the DALRD3 gene that causes loss of
function and the neurological disorder epileptic encephalopathy. Based upon these
findings, we propose that DALRD3-mediated modification plays a critical role in the proper
function of specific tRNAs important for protein synthesis during neurodevelopment. In
our first Aim, we will define the requirements for tRNA recognition and modification
dependent in DALRD3 and its cognate tRNA substrates. For our second Aim, we will
measure the impact of DALRD3-dependent modification on tRNA structure and function.
In our final Aim, we will determine the role of DALRD3-dependent tRNA modification on
global protein translation in the brain through ribosome profiling. In total, the proposed
research will have broad implications in understanding how tRNA modifications can
impact proper neurodevelopment. Although DALRD3 was an unexpected player in tRNA
modification, we now have a new target to explore potential therapeutics for individuals
suffering from epileptic encephalopathies linked to tRNA biology."
10895467,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We propose to investigate the mechanisms that regulate a cell’s ability to escape from the crisis caused by
telomere shortening. As normal human cells age, their telomeres gradually shorten. When the telomeres
shorten significantly, the cell undergoes senescence, which is a naturally occurring barrier to cancer. If,
however, a cell should suffer a transforming mutation, it can by-pass senescence and continue to proliferate
until its telomeres become so short that they are non-functional. The resulting lack of end protection triggers
“crisis”, a state that is highlighted by genomic instability as chromosomes engage in breakage:fusion:bridging
cycles that almost invariably result in the death of the cell. On rare occasions a cell can resolve its fusions,
reestablish its telomeres and stabilize its genome. Such cells are said to be immortalized and it is likely that
they are the progenitors of most human cancers. That the (dys)regulation of telomere maintenance is also
associated with aging, immortalization, and tumorigenesis in other experimental systems adds confidence to
the belief that these issues are conserved and important. Previously, we have demonstrated that DNA ligase III
and poly (ADP) ribose polymerase 1 are required for human cells to survive crisis. Here, we propose to define
the role of DNA polymerase theta/Q (POLQ), which acts in the same pathway, in this process. Unexpectedly,
we show that deletion of POLQ causes telomere elongation and escape from crisis. We will uncover how
POLQ normally suppresses these events.
 Integral to surviving crisis is a requirement to resolve the chromosomal fusions/translocations that occurred
during crisis. One way to do this is to physically shear them apart by the application of tension (aka,
“breakage”). This process, however, is highly mutagenic and often leads to lethal outcomes. A second
resolution process more likely to ensure survival is to convert the chromosome fusions into ultra-fine bridges
(UFBs) and then enzymatically — in a process that is very poorly understood — resolve these UFBs. Here, we
demonstrate that the loss-of-function of the resection nuclease, C-terminal interacting protein (CtIP), results in
a high frequency of UFBs that are not resolved and we propose experiments to mechanistically unravel how
these bridges, many of which involve telomeres, are generated and why they are not resolved. In all of these
approaches we utilize the strengths of the Hendrickson and Baird laboratories. The Hendrickson laboratory
excels at the technology of gene targeting to study the impact of loss-of-function mutations of genes (POLQ
and CtIP in this instance) on telomere maintenance. The Baird laboratory is the world’s leader in analyzing
telomere fusion events in human cells undergoing crisis. Their ability to characterize the dynamics of single
telomeric ends has provided the field’s deepest understanding of the mechanism of telomere fusions in human
cells. In summary, our proposed studies impact on DNA repair and telomere maintenance and the importance
of understanding these processes for cancer biology is clear."

 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to atherosclerosis represents the leading cause of death worldwide.
Progress in preventing CVD has been stalled by the growing epidemic of obesity, insulin resistance and type 2
diabetes (T2D), which increases the relative risk of developing atherosclerotic vascular disease and its
complications four-fold compared to non-diabetic individuals. Despite this, the cellular and molecular
mechanisms underlying the incidence of diabetic atherosclerosis are still unclear, as are appropriate strategies
for the prevention and treatment of CVD in diabetic patients. We have recently developed an orally available,
liver-directed controlled release mitochondrial protonophore (CRMP) that promotes oxidation of hepatic
triglycerides by promoting a subtle sustained increase in hepatic mitochondrial inefficiency and shown that this
agent safely reverses hypertriglyceridemia, fatty liver, insulin resistance and liver fibrosis in rodent and
nonhuman primate models of obesity. Here, we will leverage the insulin-sensitizing effects of CRMP to directly
assess the role of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in driving diabetic atherosclerosis in a murine model
of metabolic syndrome (Aims 1 and 2). We hypothesize that chronic CRMP treatment will reduce hepatic
steatosis, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia due to increases in rates of hepatic mitochondrial fat oxidation,
which in turn will reduce susceptibility to atherosclerosis. In addition, we will develop and utilize novel state-of-
the-art metabolic tracer methods to characterize the regulation of macrophage immunometabolism during
diabetic atherosclerosis (Aim 3), as the relationship between the inflammatory status and bioenergetic profile of
plaque macrophages in vivo, as well as its impact on atherosclerotic development and stability, remains largely
unknown. We hypothesize that obesity and T2D will increase glucose availability and utilization in
macrophages which will initiate a feed forward loop that fosters inflammation and further aggravates
atherosclerosis Collectively, this work will provide meaningful insight into the mechanisms regulating diabetic
atherosclerosis and will be critical for understanding the therapeutic utility of liver-directed mitochondrial
uncoupling agents for the treatment of cardiometabolic diseases. Therefore, we propose a focused career
development training plan during which the applicant will be trained in the responsible conduct of research,
learning all aspects of atherosclerotic plaque sectioning and characterization; the development and utilization
of stable isotope methods to assess macrophage immunometabolism; and bioinformatics analysis of large data
sets. This will be carried out under the supervision of the candidate’s primary mentor Dr. Gerald Shulman, co-
mentor Dr. William Sessa, and collaborators Drs. Carlos Fernandez-Hernando and Rachel Perry. By
completing the proposed training outlined in this application (K99), the applicant will obtain the knowledge and
skills that will provide her with the initial steps towards scientific autonomy in the subsequent phase (R00) and
transition successfully from the role of postdoctoral trainee to that of an independent researcher."

Studies across a broad range of species have established a common set of evolutionarily conserved hallmarks
of aging, including age-related decline in mobility and mitochondrial failure. This evidence points to the
potential for pharmacological intervention to improve healthy aging and extend longevity. Pharmacological
blockade of the Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) by inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is
an effective therapy in improving age-related impairment of physical function and is a potential strategy to slow
human aging. The beneficial effect of ACE ihibition in reducing age-associated damage of tissues, such as the
skeletal muscle, may be attributed in part by the drug’s capacity to preserve mitochondrial function. However,
improvement in physical performance in response to RAS blockade varies widely in human studies, potentially
due to genetic variation among individuals. Research in this area has been slowed by lack of understanding of
the biology that connects aging, genetics, and response to drug treatment and because of the shortage of
appropriate animal models for biological and intervention studies. To tackle this issue, we propose to leverage
the evolutionary conservation of ACE across species to determine the genetic basis for the anti-aging effect of
the ACEi Lisinopril in the invertebrate model D. melanogaster. The proposed research builds on a powerful
genomics resource, the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), which consists of genetically distinct
lines of flies derived from a natural population. Our preliminary studies using three genetically diverse DGRP
lines revealed that treatment with Lisinopril extends lifespan and improves age-specific walking in D.
melanogaster, but it does so in a genotype-specific manner. Our data also suggest that genotype-specific
responses to Lisinopril may act, in part, through variation in the degree to which mitochondrial function is
affected by the drug treatment. To address this hypothesis, we propose to use genome-wide association
mapping in 400 new DGRP lines to first identify variants, genes and genetic pathways that respond to ACEi to
ameliorate age-related decline in locomotor activity and extend lifespan (Aim 1). Functional genetic studies
using RNA interference (RNAi) of candidate genes are then proposed to validate the effects of ACEi on
lifespan and healthspan and to test whether these effects are mediated via changes in mitochondrial function
in skeletal muscle (Aim 2). Finally, we propose to evaluate the genome wide effects of ACEi on gene
expression and the metabolome for genes for which RNAi in thoracic muscle extends lifespan and/or
healthspan in order to gain insight into the mechanism(s) by which ACEi modulates lifespan and healthspan
(Aim 3). Completion of the proposed studies will identify genetic and metabolic pathways that regulate the
ACEi-mediated improvement in physical performance in older individuals."

Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) comprises 90% of cellular RNA, and ribosome biogenesis is one of the most
energy-consuming processes in the cell. The core rRNA transcriptional machinery is evolutionarily ancient and
highly conserved from unicellular eukaryotes to mammals, but the bodies of higher organisms have different
ribosome production rates in different cell types, responsive to unique tissue-specific demands. Mutations in
ribosome biogenesis proteins cause cell-type-specific “ribosomopathies” in humans, manifested by
developmental abnormalities, specific organ dysfunctions, or cancers. However, there is little understanding of
the transcriptional and epigenetic factors that differentially regulate ribosome biogenesis across normal cells
types in intact organisms. Specifically, no one has characterized the protein composition of nucleoli, or the
components of rRNA transcription complexes, in any primary mammalian tissue. This represents a key
knowledge gap in our understanding of eukaryotic biology.
Using quantitative proteomics and transcription factor (TF) mapping studies in a mouse model system, we
have identified nucleolar localization and abundant, specific binding to ribosomal DNA (rDNA) of several
cell-type-specific TFs (Pu.1, Irf8, Etv6) that are known to be critical for normal development and survival, but
whose roles in ribosome biogenesis have never been reported. We propose in this application a combination of
unbiased as well as focused approaches to identify and dissect the roles of cell-type-specific rRNA regulators
in tissue homeostasis. We will pursue this goal through the following projects:
PROJECT 1: DISCOVERY: We will use nucleolar and rDNA-chromatin proteomics in defined primary mouse
cell types to identify proteins with cell-type-specific nucleolar localization and rDNA binding. The goal of this
project is to identify novel regulators of differential rRNA transcription in intact tissues.
PROJECT 2: MECHANISM: We will use ​in vitro and ​in vivo degron and chromatin tethering approaches to
dissect the direct roles of rDNA-binding cell-type-specific TFs (Pu.1, Irf8, Etv6, others) in the regulation of
rDNA chromatin, rRNA transcription, and tissue homeostasis. The goal of this project is to understand how
TF-rDNA binding regulates normal tissue biology.
The long-term goal of this work is to gain a detailed understanding of how the ancient process of ribosome
biogenesis has evolved to meet diverse tissue needs in complex organisms, and how disruption of this
regulation can derange tissue homeostasis and cause disease."

 Substance use (SU) rates among American Indian (AI) adolescents have been greater than national rates
for decades, and recent evidence indicates that some SU disparities are increasing for AI adolescents living on
or near reservations (hereafter reservation). Given the changing nature of SU and the unique influences on this
population (e.g., factors specific to reservation life), continued surveillance and dissemination of SU rates for
these youth is vitally important to inform prevention, treatment, and policy efforts.
 The proposed study is a renewal of a large-scale epidemiological study of SU among reservation AI
adolescents, the only study of its kind. Each year, nationally-representative rates of SU for reservation AI
adolescents will be obtained and compared with national rates measured by Monitoring the Future (MTF) in
order to identify areas of special concern for reservation AI adolescents. The sample will be expanded to
include 6th graders due to early initiation rates of AI youth. The study will move beyond basic epidemiology to
include additional analyses of low-base rate/high-risk SU (e.g., methamphetamine, opioids) and heavy
marijuana use, examining simultaneous and co-occurring use, predictors of use, and consequences of use.
Because data are gathered from a wide variety of contexts (e.g., reservations), a comprehensive multilevel
analysis examining relationships of school/community factors will be conducted, building on epidemiologic
models. The findings from these analyses will provide essential information for reducing health disparities that
result from structural and economic inequities, policy, and allocation of resources.
 Building etiologic evidence for effective intervention to address high rates of adolescent AI SU is also a
fundamental part of this project. Although AI adolescents are influenced by broader society, unique individual,
cultural, geographic, economic, and other factors influence SU and its correlates and consequences.
Moreover, there has been limited focus on understanding how positive characteristics related to strength and
resilience serve as protective or promotive factors for AI adolescents. Etiologic models, based on eco-systemic
resilience theory, will be used to assess the role of individual, cultural and collective measures of strength and
resilience to identify relationships to SU and delayed or nonuse. Measures of low-base rate/high-risk and
heavy marijuana use will be included as dependent variables in these analyses. An ongoing discussion among
AI researchers is the need for systematic analysis of the role of racial-ethnic and cultural identity in SU
behaviors; therefore, this study will give special emphasis to assessing psychometric properties of measures of
racial/ethnic identity that have been used successfully for prediction in this and other populations.
 Project findings will be disseminated to key stakeholders, with special emphasis on tribal and non-tribal
entities involved in policy and resource-related decisions that affect AI youth SU."
10895486,"Project Summary/Abstract
Depression is a leading cause of psychosocial impairment, poor academic performance, increased risk of
school dropout, and a greater likelihood of self-harm, suicide, and medical illness over the lifespan. Moreover, a
striking 30% of college students experience clinical levels of depression, making this is a critical period to identify
intervention targets to mitigate risk for this burdensome disorder. Although research has evaluated psychological
and immunological mechanisms of depression, these factors are typically studied in isolation. Social Safety
Theory is a compelling, integrated framework that hypothesizes that social stressors are uniquely predictive of
increases in depression because social stress has a greater biological impact compared to other stressors.
Further, this pathway can be amplified by negative social safety schemas characterized by interpretating social
situations as conflictual, unreliable, and dangerous. This proposal seeks to test this integrated, multi-level model of
depression etiology using the transition from high school to college as a quasi-experimental social stressor and
an intensive longitudinal design. Briefly, self-report data collected daily and inflammatory data collected every
three days over a 24-day period will be used to evaluate how trajectories of perceived stress, inflammatory
proteins, and depression symptom change as a function of transitioning to college (Aim 1), test if negative social
schemas predict individual differences in trajectories of perceived stress, inflammatory proteins, and depression
symptoms (Aim 2), and investigate the extent to which changes in inflammatory proteins mediate the association
between changes in stress and depression symptoms during this period and whether this indirect relation is
moderated by negative social safety schemas (Aim 3). To test if these interrelations between stress, social safety
schemas, and inflammation predict long-term depression outcomes, Aims 2 and 3 will be re-tested predicting
depression diagnoses across the entire freshman year (Exploratory Aim). Participants will be 112 healthy,
incoming UCLA freshmen will be recruited via e-mails from the Registrar’s Office. Starting seven days before
moving onto campus, participants will complete daily self-report measures (stress and depression symptoms, n =
2,688) and blood draws every three days (n = 896). Trait social safety schemas will be measured on the first day
and a diagnostic interview will be completed before the study and again at the end of the year. Consistent with
the NIMH Strategic Objectives (SO), this multi-method study will define biological mechanisms of mental illness
(SO 1); provide insight into how mental illness trajectories change during developmental transitions (SO 2);
highlight three, multi-domain targets for prevention and intervention (SO 3); and contribute to the public health
impact of NIMH by reducing rates of depression on college campuses (SO 4). A training plan has been
designed that includes a breadth of experiences aimed to advance the applicant’s conceptual and technical
expertise in social stress and related cognitive vulnerabilities (Training Goal 1), high frequency immunological
data collection (Training Goal 2), and statistics suitable for intensive longitudinal data (Training Goal 3)."

A predoctoral training program in Chemistry-Biology Interfaces (CBI) at University of California, San Diego (UC
San Diego) will leverage our historical strengths in interdisciplinary research and join diverse faculty for a
robust training environment. UC San Diego has historically excelled at the interface of chemistry and biology,
and the renewed support from the University has ensured a strong and vibrant program in the future. Many of
the training faculty in this program are new to the University (within the past 10 years), and the collaborative
bonds established in this proposal represent the best of interdisciplinary training. The proposal aims to train 10
students each year, with 20% of these slots supported by a match from the Graduate Dean, starting in their
second year of graduate studies, and offering support for two years. The proposal establishes a special
curriculum for students who will participate in research within preceptor laboratories in Department of
Chemistry and Biochemistry, Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, or Pharmacology.
The respective Deans/Directors from each of these divisions/centers have offered significant institutional
support, including the topping off of tuition/fees and stipends, providing additional trainee slots in the form of
fellowships, and assisting administrative and organizational costs associated with this program. The curriculum
we have put together offers a training and personal/professional growth experience that will be unique to this
program. This includes required coursework in Chemical Biology and Scientific Ethics (with a Scientific Ethics
refresher workshop); a CBI Seminar Series that invite world-class scientists; a CBI Workshop that focuses on
research, personal, and professional growth; an annual Career Day; an annual Industrial Tour; an annual CBI
Symposium of research accomplishments; and regular interaction/feedback from the world-class faculty in our
CBI faculty. Given our strengths for interdisciplinary and collaborative research and the outstanding pool of
qualified trainees, we believe that CBI at UC San Diego offers an excellent and unique training opportunity."

The NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium’s (IBDGC) mission is to characterize the genetic architecture of IBD
phenotypes, particularly in populations currently underrepresented in IBD genomic studies, and to elucidate the
biological mechanisms by which genetic variants influence IBD pathophysiology, phenotypes and clinical course.
This proposal is to serve as the data coordinating center (DCC) for the IBDGC in a cooperative agreement with
genetics research centers (GRCs) to benefit the field broadly. The DCC has played an essential role in the
International IBD Genetics Consortium (IIBDGC), resulting in very large, well-powered cohorts that can
statistically refine association signals. However, less than 10% of present IIBDGC patients are from African-
American and Hispanic/LatinX IBD patients. For both scientific and social justice reasons, the NIDDK IBDGC is
strongly prioritizing recruitment of African-American and Hispanic/LatinX IBD patients for genetic and genomic
studies. In Aim 1, the DCC will optimize power and enhance pathophysiologic insight across diverse populations
affected by IBD by coordinating, standardizing and tracking increased recruitment of African-American and
Hispanic/LatinX IBD patients by the GRCs to more than double present cohort sizes. By so doing, substantially
increased power to refine allelic effects may be achieved. Integration with multi-omic ATAC + transcriptome
single cell data may provide further refinement of association signals between Crohn’s disease and ulcerative
colitis and across populations. Complete mapping of sequence data for the NIDDK IBDGC lymphoblastoid
lymphocyte repository from over 9000 patients will enable for broad use and dissemination. In Aim 2, the DCC
will provide high-quality operational services optimized to the scientific objectives of the Consortium, including
data collection, management and distribution; guidance in study design and data analysis; researching and
facilitating use of new platforms and technologies; and supporting Consortium governance, communication and
administration. We shall also substantially enhance our Data Commons and website to promote and facilitate
discovery and usage. In Aim 3, in selected clinical scenarios of unmet medical needs, the DCC will enable
longitudinal analyses prioritized by the NIDDK IBDGC Steering Committee, and to scale and standardize multi-
omic cellular data. The NIDDK IBDGC has made major investments in serial biosampling in ileal resection
Crohn’s disease cohorts, which powerfully tracks the earliest steps in disease recurrence. Mechanistic insight
may well be accrued via serial sampling (systemic and tissue-based) in other key scenarios, such as acute,
hospitalized flares in ulcerative colitis and perianal fistulae in Crohn’s disease. The power of GWAS locus
identification lies in the definitive mapping from trait to outcome (disease development). Given the polygenicity
of IBD, more complete explication of multi-omics in diverse populations will provide a key means of defining
cellular and therapeutic mechanisms, enabling Precision IBD broadly."
10895549,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chemical modifications of DNA and histones represent carriers of regulatory information that cooperate with
transcription factors to control genome accessibility. Methylation at histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) is an
evolutionarily conserved chromatin modification. In yeast, a single methyltransferase Set2 catalyzes all
methylation states on H3K36. In contrast, H3K36 methylation states are subject to more complex regulation in
mammalian chromatin. Whereas SETD2 is the sole enzyme catalyzing tri-methyl H3K36 (H3K36me3), several
additional enzymes including NSD family members and ASH1L have evolved as the methyltransferases specific
for di-methyl H3K36 (H3K36me2). Accordingly, the genomic distribution of H3K36me2 is distinct from that of
H3K36me3, implying a possible functional divergence that remains incompletely understood.
 Germline mutations in NSD and ASH1L lead to various neurodevelopmental disorders, whereas somatic
alterations of these enzymes are frequently found in human cancers. Recent work by us and others have
identified and elucidated recurrent mutations directly affecting histone H3K36 that induced global depletion of
H3K36me2 in human bone and head and neck cancers. Therefore, precise regulation of NSD/ASH1L-mediated
H3K36me2 is critical for human development and represents a key barrier to neoplastic transformation.
 Despite its importance, there is limited understanding of the regulatory mechanisms governing
H3K36me2 establishment and its function in genome regulation. Therefore, the five-year goal of my research
program is to systematically examine the chromatin biology of H3K36me2 and its associated modifiers. The
conceptual innovation is built on our recent findings of an interplay between H3K36me2 and intergenic DNA
methylation through the recruitment of de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A. In addition, we have developed
tractable experimental systems and novel CRISPR/Cas-based genome- and epigenome-editing platforms that
allow us to dissect the regulation of H3K36me2 in a multiplexed manner. We will determine the respective
contribution of NSD and ASH1L to establishing H3K36me2 at introns and intergenic regions. A combination of
chromatin biochemistry and functional genetic screening approaches will be employed to understand the
regulatory input that guides the formation of H3K36me2. We will perform structural-functional analysis to better
understand the molecular basis of DNMT3A recruitment by H3K36me2, and kinetic studies to delineate its
relationship with the well-known antagonism between H3K36me2 and H3K27 methylation. Lastly, we will employ
integrative epigenomics and epigenome-editing tools to determine the impact of H3K36me2 on the accessibility
of cis-regulatory and repetitive elements. Together, these studies will provide a knowledge base upon which
mechanistic insights into pathogenesis and targets amenable for therapy can be uncovered for human diseases
driven by H3K36me2 dysregulation. Furthermore, the technical tools and resources could be readily applied to
the study of additional chromatin modifications and of broad interest to the chromatin research community."
10895593,"Gene regulatory evolution is a major driver for phenotypic divergence. While this has been well-studied in
development, its importance in non-developmental processes is far less understood. The overall vision
of the lab is to fully characterize the evolutionary rewiring of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) for
major stress responses in opportunistic yeast pathogens, and elucidate the contribution of such
changes to the survival and virulence in the host. The lab previously discovered a significant difference
in how a commensal and opportunistic yeast pathogen, Candida glabrata, regulates its Phosphate
Starvation (PHO) response compared with its non-commensal relative, Saccharomyces cerevisiae: the
commensal has dramatically expanded its PHO response targets both in number and in function, which
was attributed to derived changes in its master transcription factor (TF) by being less dependent on the
co-TF. The goal of the lab in the next five years is to determine the genetic and mechanistic bases of this
novel mode of TF evolution, i.e. acquiring new targets by reducing co-TF dependence, and the effect of
such evolution on stress resistance to phosphate starvation as well as combinatorial stresses in the host.
Understanding how this model stress response evolved by itself and in its interaction with other stress
responses will begin to elucidate the principles for stress response evolution in commensal yeasts in
general. To reach this goal, three Directions will be pursued: 1) Elucidate the mechanisms of a novel mode
of TF evolution and its impact on the downstream response, using biophysical and fitness assays; 2)
Dissect the crosstalk between stress responses and how it evolved in commensal yeasts, by determining
the interaction of PHO response with oxidative stress and general stress responses in C. glabrata and S.
cerevisiae; 3) Determine how the PHO network evolved in other commensal yeasts and related non-
commensals, using transcriptome profiling coupled with genome-wide Chromatin-IP. Research proposed
in this application is innovative because the evolutionary approach will identify key changes in the wiring
of the stress response GRNs underlying host adaptation. The proposed research is significant because it
will both shed light on the general principles for GRN evolution, and will provide a conceptual framework
for developing novel antifungal strategies targeting stress responses."
10895595,"Project Summary / Abstract
Cell polarity is a fundamental feature of eukaryotic cells, and must be coordinated between cells and regulated
to allow for normal animal development and tissue homeostasis. Despite genetic identification of proteins
involved in cell polarity and a large body of knowledge about their interactions in vitro, it remains unclear how
polarity proteins are organized into signaling complexes in cells. This lack of knowledge has prevented the field
from understanding mechanisms of developmental control of polarity signaling in vivo.
The long-term goal of the proposed research is to resolve the network of protein-protein interactions that
supports animal cell polarity and to understand how this network can respond to developmental signals. To
enable progress towards this goal, the applicants have developed innovative experimental tools that allow
single-molecule measurements of native protein complex abundance in single cells. This project focuses on
two evolutionarily conserved protein kinases, called aPKC and PAR-1, that play central roles in polarity by
localizing to opposite ends of a polarized cell and dictating polarized cell behaviors. The applicants will make
use of the C. elegans early embryo, in which cells reproducibly polarize in response to multiple spatial and
temporal cues, to discover mechanistic links between developmental signals and the polarity machinery.
The central hypothesis of this work is that that developmental signals control cell polarity by altering the
molecular complexes in which aPKC and PAR-1 reside. This hypothesis will be explored by identifying
dynamic aPKC and PAR-1 complexes that control polarity (Aim 1); by determining how polarity signaling is
coordinated with cell cycle cues in the zygote (Aim 2); and by determining how developmental cues re-program
polarity signaling in later embryos. The work proposed in this application is significant because it will reveal
fundamental mechanisms controlling cell polarity, and because it places these mechanistic studies in a
developmental context. The proposed work is innovative, in the applicant’s opinion, because it uses novel
experimental methods to perform biochemical, mechanistic studies in vivo. By studying the biochemical control
of aPKC and PAR-1 in multiple cellular and developmental contexts in a single experimental system, this work
will identify fundamental mechanisms of PAR polarity signaling and to learn how these mechanisms are
deployed to achieve different outcomes during development."

 The proposed study will work to reduce firearm-related suicide deaths in young people by investigating the
most effective way to implement a universal safe firearm storage program in pediatric primary care. The
number of young people dying by suicide in the United States continues to rise, and risk for suicide death is
much greater when there is an unlocked, loaded firearm in the home. A simulation study found that a modest
increase in safe firearm storage could prevent up to 32% of firearm-related deaths in youth. Pediatric primary
care is an ideal setting for universal suicide prevention strategies to reduce access to firearms, and prior
research has shown that both health care clinicians and parents find firearm safety to be an appropriate topic
to discuss, yet these conversations do not happen routinely. Safety Check, an evidence-based practice for
firearm safety promotion that involves brief counseling and provision of a free cable lock, has been shown to
double the odds of self-reported safe storage among parents but has not been implemented widely. Using
feedback from pediatric clinicians, health system leaders, and firearm-owning parents regarding attitudes and
barriers related to broader use of the program, the proposed study incorporates recommendations on how to
boost the acceptability and feasibility of Safety Check for use as a universal suicide prevention strategy.
Combining this feedback with insights from behavioral economics, we will conduct a hybrid type III
effectiveness-implementation with a longitudinal cluster randomized design. The study will allow us to compare
two approaches to implementing the program in pediatric primary care and evaluate the effectiveness of the
adapted intervention, now named Gun Safe. The study will include 151 clinicians in 32 clinics who serve
38,989 youth annually in two MHRN health systems in Michigan and Colorado. All 32 clinics in the two
participating health systems will receive Gun Safe materials, including brief training and cable locks. Half of the
clinics (k = 16) will be randomized to receive the EHR implementation strategy (Nudge); the other half will be
randomized to receive Nudge plus 1 year of facilitation to target additional clinician and organizational
implementation barriers (Nudge+). We will collect the primary implementation outcome for 6 months before
exposure to condition and for 1 year following to allow for comparisons between (a) the active and pre-
exposure periods and (b) the active and sustainment periods. Results will guide future efforts to promote
firearm safety as a universal suicide prevention strategy. In Aim 1, we will identify the effect of the
implementation strategies on implementation outcomes (i.e., parent-reported clinician fidelity, reach (how many
families received the intervention), cable lock distribution, acceptability, and cost). In Aim 2, we will also test
potential implementation strategy mechanisms (i.e., how it worked). In Aim 3, we will examine clinical
outcomes including a parent-reported safe storage behavior. This study can improve implementation of firearm
safety interventions and identify the best approach to national implementation, with the ultimate goal of saving
the lives of American youth, in alignment with NIMH Objective 4."

increase the scientific impact, innovation, and productivity of population researchers at Columbia, increase
their competitiveness for peer-reviewed external funding in population dynamics research, help junior
population scientists achieve research independence, and maximize the efficiency of funding for population
dynamics research. To achieve that mission, our specific aims are to: 1) nourish a vibrant cross-campus
intellectual community of population dynamics researchers at Columbia, fostering the development of junior
scientists and encouraging collaborations within and across units and disciplines; 2) advance population
dynamics research in CPRC’s five primary research areas (PRAs): children, youth, and families; reproductive
health and HIV/AIDS; immigration/migration; urbanism and neighborhoods; and, new with this renewal, climate
and environment; 3) continue to be a leading population center focused on research on inequalities in the
health and well-being of vulnerable populations and on policies to address those inequalities; and 4) implement
a new partnership to share P2C resources with population dynamics researchers at the City University of New
York (CUNY). The coordinated work of three research infrastructure cores—administrative, computing and
methods, and development—will facilitate cross-disciplinary and cross-campus population dynamics research
at Columbia, with a particular focus on advancing the professional development of junior scientists, and ensure
the CUNY partnership is implemented across the center. From our 2006 start as a “developmental” center with
population scientists at three Columbia University schools (Social Work, Public Health, and Arts & Sciences),
CPRC has grown into a large, cohesive and vibrant university-wide center featuring 93 affiliates (including 39
junior scientists) at 10 schools. Hallmarks of the center are the diversity of our faculty at both the junior and
senior scientist levels; the crucial role of the center in transforming computing infrastructure for population
research at the university; the substantial leveraging of university support, with an institutional commitment of
more than double the total requested NICHD direct costs; affiliates’ success rate with NICHD applications; and
the extraordinary success of our seed grant program in this cycle, with a return on investment that is 18 times
that of the prior cycle (84 vs 4.6). Key innovations in this application include a substantially expanded program
of pre- and post-award grant support for junior scientists, to address the unevenness of grant support across
the university; a new primary research area on climate and environment; and a new partnership with CUNY to
increase access to P2C resources for population scientists at an institution without a P2C funded center."

Our objective is to produce a bispecific antibody, VTC-890, capable of binding two proinflammatory cytokines,
LIGHT (TNFSF14) and TL1A (TNFSF15), for the treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). IPF is a
chronic fibrotic lung disease characterized by widespread progressive scarring of the lungs. Patients with IPF
show declining lung function leading to early death 5, 47.We will demonstrate that VTC-890 can effectively block
the receptor binding domains of LIGHT and TL1A, thereby reducing downstream activation of pro-fibrotic
pathways that lead to tissue remodeling in IPF.
The causes of IPF are complex and include genetics and environmental exposure, but the involvement of
cytokine-dependent processes is demonstrated by the recent introduction of two new antifibrotic, anti-
inflammatory medications that slow the rate of respiratory decline. Unfortunately, therapeutic benefits are
relatively minor and IPF is still invariably fatal, typically in about 3.5 years. No present treatment stops or
reverses the progression of the disease, and patients sometimes discontinue treatment with the therapeutics
due to side effects5.
Important characteristic features of the progression of IPF are tissue remodeling and fibrosis22. In this regard,
our team published the first reports that a genetic deficiency in the TNF superfamily cytokine LIGHT and
blocking LIGHT binding to its receptors (HVEM/TNFRSF14 and LTβR/TNFRSF14), strongly reduced lung
tissue remodeling and fibrosis in animal models. We also showed that injection of recombinant LIGHT protein
into the lungs promoted the tissue remodeling characteristic of IPF13, 14. In our recent published studies15, we
have now show that TL1A also strongly contributes to tissue remodeling in these same models, and injection of
recombinant TL1A into the lungs of mice drives pathology independent of LIGHT, suggesting it plays a
complementary and synergistic role to LIGHT in tissue remodeling15.
This proposal is designed to produce and validate a novel bispecific antibody, VTC-890, capable of blocking
the receptor binding of both LIGHT and TL1A for the treatment of IPF. The high-level objectives are to: 1)
establish VTC-890 production and analytical assays to support manufacturing, purification, bioactivity
determination, and formulation; 2) complete the animal studies required to support our clinical study design;
and 3) identify the remaining preclinical datasets necessary to obtain FDA IND approval. Successful
commercialization of VTC-890 would ultimately provide a profound front-line therapy for the treatment of IPF
and potentially other fibrotic diseases, such as systemic sclerosis and asthma."

HIV remains the most consequential zoonosis of the last century, with 36 million fatalities and another 37 million
infected. Even today, almost 2,000 people per day die of HIV/AIDS globally. Medications are reducing the effects
of HIV on the human body and transmission of the virus to others. However, forty years into the HIV/AIDS
pandemic, there are still no vaccines or cures. One hindrance to the development of HIV vaccines and cures
has been the lack of an effective animal model organism. Macaques were thoughtfully developed as an animal
model in the 1980s and remain the main HIV model today. However, there are well-known problems with this
model, with the most significant problem being that SHIVs can only be made to contain about 30% of the HIV-1
genome (essentially, just Env). Here, we describe a new animal model for HIV infection. The overarching goal
of this grant is to design and test physiologically-relevant transmitted/founder (T/F) HIV-1 strains for this new
model species. We examine and optimize the ability of these viruses to bind to CCR5 and RanBP2 host factors
in the new model species, and study how the virus is evading restriction factors in this species. All newly
developed viruses will then be assayed for their sensitivity to neutralization by HIV-1 antibodies. Taken together,
we will learn about the molecular underpinnings of HIV host switching, and at the same time the viruses we
design in this proposal will become a vital tool for HIV-1 research. This new animal model will serve as an exciting
new model system in which to study all aspects of HIV-1 biology and immunity."

It has been nearly 15 years since the last FDA approval for a new treatment for Alzheimer's Disease and Related
Dementias (ADRD). Critical to the mission to improve the available therapies and curb the public health impact
of ADRD will be a new generation of ADRD scientists, especially scientists with the unique training and skills
necessary to design and perform clinical trials. This training is rarely provided through the traditional course of
medical or biostatistical education. As a result, there is a dearth of well-trained ADRD clinical trialists. Moreover,
there is very limited diversity among the current group of active ADRD trial investigators. To develop improved
therapies for ADRD, multidisciplinary expertise in clinical trials will be necessary, including medical specialists
but also expertise in biostatistics, trial design, biomarkers, ethics, and informatics. This proposal requests support
to establish a first-of-its-kind training program in the essential elements of ADRD trials. The Institute on Methods
and Protocols for the Advancement of Clinical Trials in ADRD (IMPACT-AD) Course will leverage the full
infrastructure and expertise of the Alzheimer's Clinical Trials Consortium (ACTC) affiliated faculty. IMPACT-AD
will be conducted annually to attract and train the next generation of ADRD clinical trialists, with a particular focus
on improving the diversity of ADRD clinical investigators across race/ethnicity, gender, and scientific/professional
backgrounds. IMPACT-AD seeks to provide a diverse range of clinicians, scientists and researchers with a
modern and robust training in the design and conduct of ADRD clinical trials."
10867413,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Epilepsy is a major cause of morbidity, mortality, disability, and expense, and affects over 470,000 children in
the U.S. While many medications to control seizures have been developed, about 30% of patients do not
respond to medications, and to date, there are no medications that can prevent or halt the progression of
epilepsy. Recently, many genetic causes of epilepsy have been identified, providing insights into pathways
involved in epileptogenesis. Mutations causing hyperactivity of the mTOR pathway (so-called “mTORpathies”)
have emerged as an important cause of cerebral malformations and epilepsy, including tuberous sclerosis
complex, focal cortical dysplasia, and polyhydramnios, megalencephaly, and symptomatic epilepsy (PMSE)
syndrome, which is associated with severe epilepsy and intellectual disability and is caused by a loss-of-
function in the STRADA gene. Inhibition of the mTOR pathway with rapamycin or its analogs can help in
mTORopathies, but many individuals still have seizures that do not respond. Prior studies generated stem cells
from individuals with PMSE and differentiated them into excitatory neurons in 2-D culture and dorsally-fated
human cerebral organoids, 3-D neural structures that resemble the developing cortex and predominantly
contain excitatory neurons. The PMSE organoids demonstrated mTOR hyperactivity, increased size, abnormal
morphology, delayed neuronal differentiation, and an increase in outer radial glia, a progenitor cell that is
responsible for the expanded size of the human brain. These findings explain megalencephaly in PMSE, but
the intermediate mechanisms by which STRADA loss-of-function results in these observed phenotypes is not
known. Furthermore, the effect of STRADA loss-of-function on inhibitory interneurons that originate from
ventral forebrain structures is not known. Abnormal inhibitory interneurons are a major cause of epilepsy and
autism, both prominent features of mTORopathies. This proposal will test the central hypothesis that loss of
STRADA causes cortical malformation by mTOR complex 1 hyperactivity, and that inhibitory interneuron
development is also impaired, resulting in epilepsy. This innovative proposal will use dorsally-fated organoids
to identify which signaling pathway alterations downstream of STRADA result in altered cortical development,
and will determine whether compensatory feedback signals hinder the effectiveness of rapamycin treatment
(Aim 1). We will also generate fusions between ventrally-fated and dorsally-fated organoids to study
interneuron development, interneuron migration, cell-type specific transcriptional alterations (Aim 2), as well as
neuronal network hyperexcitability that can result in epilepsy (Aim 3). The proposed study will have significant
impact because understanding the signaling pathways and cell types responsible for pathogenesis in PMSE
will provide a platform to develop mechanistically driven therapies that can halt or reverse epileptogenesis for
mTORopathies, and our findings should be applicable to epilepsies in a broader context."
10867506,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Speaking multiple languages is the norm for the majority of the population of the world. However, research on
the neural bases of multilingualism has not been commensurate with the demographic relevance of this
population. In no small part, this has been due to the traditionally lower socioeconomic or immigrant status of
multilingual individuals. Consequently, there is a lack of fundamental knowledge about the organization and
interaction between languages in the bilingual brain. This lack of knowledge has appalling implications for
planning behavioral and surgical treatments for bilingual individuals with neurological disorders: it is currently
unclear which cortical tissue needs to be spared, and how much and how often each language should be targeted
to maximize recovered language function after brain damage in bilingual individuals. Thus, there is a critical need
to obtain a better understanding of how multilingual individuals’ languages are organized and how they interact
at different levels of representation to inform the development of strategies that maximize potential language
recovery after brain damage in a demographic group that will be the majority of the US population by 2040. The
proposed project will address this gap in knowledge by combining the study of aphasic and healthy Spanish-
English bilingual individuals in behavioral and fMRI tasks to create a symbiosis where theory and praxis mutually
inform each other. Specifically, the project will investigate the typology of deficits in post-stroke aphasic bilinguals
at the lexical level (i.e., single-word level; Aim 1A), and at the morphosyntactic level (i.e., how words are
combined into meaningful phrasal/sentential structures; Aim 1B) through the analysis of a spontaneous speech
corpus. The validity of the conclusions derived from these analyses will be tested and confirmed with tailored
behavioral experiments (Aim 1C). Aim 2 will target the neural bases of these processes through a combination
of voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping in post-stroke aphasic bilinguals (Aim 2A) and fMRI analysis of healthy
bilingual individuals (Aim 2B). Critically, by combining the study of a large speech corpus, targeted experimental
paradigms, and neuroimaging research, the proposed project holds the potential to obtain a comprehensive
characterization of bilingual individuals’ language organization across linguistic levels. This information will
constitute the first step to subsequently develop theoretically informed language recovery strategies, and
protocols tailored to the needs and characteristics of brain damaged bilingual individuals. Thus, the successful
accomplishment of the projects laid out in this proposal will establish the basis to develop strategies that
maximize potential language recovery after brain damage in a demographic group that will soon be the majority
of the US population. This award will also provide the candidate, who has a strong background in cognitive
neuroscience and electrophysiological methods, with critical training in patient testing and neuroimaging
methods, to promote a successful transition to an independent research career."

This U01 proposal is submitted in response to the NIMH IMPACT RFA (RFA-MH-23-105). It will extend research
efforts to both define novel, deployable behavioral phenotypes (highlighting cognitive and emotional
transdiagnostic measures) and develop and test diagnostic and prognostic prediction models, using advanced
analytics, within the clinic setting. It does so for children aged 7-17, presenting with common forms of
psychopathology, characterized by dysregulation of attention, behavior, and/or emotion. Aim 1 uses established
longitudinal research cohorts to further refine computational phenotypes for cognition (executive functions,
alertness/arousal) and low-cost trait ratings relevant to emotional regulation and valence, and in combination
with key environmental variables, tests their cross-sectional and longitudinal predictive utility using machine
learning models. Aim 2 uses large electronic medical record (EMR) data to refine sophisticated neural network
models to enhance mental health diagnostics and outcome prediction in children. Aims 3 and 4 entail new data
collection of several thousand patients in four pediatric and psychiatry clinic sites around the country, and then
combines and extends findings from Aims 1 and 2 to test their diagnostic and prognostic effectiveness in these
diverse patient populations. The study is significant in its potential to open the way for clinical care to benefit
from years of scientific progress in phenotype refinement that are low cost and deployable. It is further significant
in its potential to harvest from existing EMR data far more clinically useful prediction algorithms than are currently
available. The inclusion of sequential Bayesian logic for aiding clinicians in deciding which cases require
additional assessment and which do not will be transformative in opening a path for significant savings in cost
and clinician time by improving efficiency of care. The ability to better predict critical outcomes, such as
worsening of mental health symptoms, suicidality, or increased resource utilization is urgent and will be
addressed in our work. This project is innovative in combining large machine learning models from EMR data
with similar models using novel research phenotypes and will be the first prospective test of these models in
patients recruited from active clinics in multiple locations to evaluate generalizability. Further significance and
innovation are added by careful attention to the role of environmental adversity and extensive plans to minimize
or overcome the asynchronous benefit of such efforts to historically under-served and under-represented
populations. The project directly, significantly, and with innovation addresses the goals and purpose of the
IMPACT RFA by aiming to demonstrate how novel behavioral phenotypes can enhance clinical care even as
maximum value is extracted from EMR data already in hand."

 The overarching goal of the Research Education Component (REC) of the Shiley-Marcos Alzheimer’s
Disease Research Center (ADRC) at UC San Diego is to support the research education and mentoring of
outstanding junior-level scientists (defined as advanced postdoctoral fellows and assistant professors) to
advance our understanding of the complex and heterogenous nature of Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementias (ADRD). To realize this goal the Shiley-Marcos ADRC REC (1) has developed a detailed
recruitment plan to recruit a diverse cadre of outstanding trainees to the program each year, (2) will provide a
solid foundational platform to prepare this diverse research workforce with transdisciplinary expertise and
ability, and (3) engage our trainees and their mentors in the team science initiatives necessary to meet the
ambitious goals of the National Plan to address Alzheimer's Disease to prevent and treat ADRD.
 The REC specific aims are to: 1) Develop the careers of advanced research associates and junior faculty
who demonstrate outstanding research potential and an interest in research focused on understanding factors
that affect the heterogeneity, etiology and outcomes in ADRD; and 2) Provide mentorship, education, career
development activities and a broad array of educational and infrastructural resources across the multiple sites
afforded by our rich academic and clinical settings (e.g., School of Medicine, main campus, VA, and affiliated
institutions such as the Salk Institute for Biological Studies) to enable our REC scholars to enhance their
expertise in ADRD research and research methods, successfully complete their research, present and publish
their work, and attain independent research and/or career development funding.
 The Shiley-Marcos ADRC REC program will be directed by two Leaders and one Consultant from UC San
Diego: Lead Dr Bondi (UCSD – Psychiatry; VA – Psychology / Neuropsychology), Co-Lead Dr Hook (UCSD -
Pharmaceutical Sciences, Neurosciences, and Pharmacology), and Consultant Dr Moore (UCSD – Medicine /
Geriatrics; PI UCSD/SDSU AD-RCMAR). The Leaders and Consultant have complementary scientific skills
(e.g., basic vs. clinical science), reside in multiple campus localities, and have collaborated to develop this
program using the team science model. With Dr Moore we will coordinate selection of our REC scholars with
that of the AD-RCMAR to maximize our breadth and depth of trainee support from these two programs. The
Program Faculty have been assembled with the goals of diversity with respect to their disciplines, research,
advanced mentoring skills, and affiliations. The REC Leaders and Consultant will continuously and objectively
monitor the effectiveness of the training program, dynamically modifying the program based on feedback from
mentors, mentees, and ADRC Executive Committee, to provide the highest quality training program possible."
10866025,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Traditional genomic analyses like Genome-Wide Association Studies
(GWAS) and Polygenic Scores (PGS) have greatly enhanced our knowledge of diseases, yet they also have
certain drawbacks. Their use of binary traits is less desirable as this ignores the phenotypic heterogeneity,
resulting in lost information and potential barriers to the progress of personalized medicine. Furthermore, case-
control ratio imbalance reduces the effectiveness of GWAS for binary traits. Although using logistic regression
on selection-biased samples can boost statistical power, it is suboptimal for risk prediction as the interpretation
of observed effect sizes, such as odds ratios, may not accurately represent the target population. There is yet to
be a multi-trait model that effectively addresses all these issues.
My doctoral and postdoctoral work experience has laid the foundation for the Liability Threshold-based
Phenotypic Integration (LTPI) model. Designed to enhance disease association mapping and risk prediction
accuracy, this model leverages comprehensive individual disease histories captured by Electronic Health
Records (EHRs), revealing shared genetic factors between target and non-target traits. Our initial research using
UK Biobank and eMERGE data demonstrated that incorporating phenotypic information from both target and
non-target phenotypes significantly improves the accuracy of disease risk prediction. However, a GWAS analysis
using the LTPI score as a dependent variable identified several false positives. This outcome prompted questions
about the LTPI model's assumption of homogeneity in genetic covariance estimates across the genome, a
common assumption in conventional multi-trait methods.
In Aim 1, I plan to develop a multi-trait model to maximize statistical power and control false positives. Based on
a liability threshold model for binary and continuous phenotypes in EHR, the proposed model will consider
genetic and non-genetic factors and use important sampling methods to manage estimation bottlenecks. For
Aim 2, I propose a GWAS framework built on the model from Aim 1 that will utilize locus-specific risk scores. I
aim to explore and validate the optimality of model parameters, including locus lengths, covariance matrix
estimates, and trait selection. Ultimately, my effort will lead to a successful GWAS on Chronic Kidney Disease
and Anxiety disorder. In Aim 3, I will undertake a large-scale analysis of multiple traits, mapping each disease
with related non-target traits per locus, assessing disease risk, and observing individual disease susceptibility
patterns. This analysis will draw on massive population cohort data from the eMERGE network, the UK Biobank,
the Million Health Discovery Program, and All of Us to deliver meaningful scientific contributions."
10865617,"PROPOSAL SUMMARY
 Exposure to viral or bacterial infections during pregnancy increases risk for offspring
neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and schizophrenia. Gestational biomarkers indicate that the
maternal immune response plays a critical role in altered fetal neurodevelopment. Our ability to mitigate the
harmful effects of maternal immune activation (MIA) on offspring neurodevelopment is limited by our
incomplete mechanistic understanding of the neurobiological changes associated with prenatal exposure to
MIA. While rodent studies have shown similarities between alterations in brain and behavioral development in
MIA-exposed offspring and changes observed in human neurodevelopmental disorders, there are limitations in
translating these findings to human neuroanatomy and physiology. It is therefore necessary to expand this
research to a preclinical model more closely related to humans, such as nonhuman primates (NHPs).
 My primary mentor’s laboratory (Bauman) has developed the first viral-mimic based rhesus macaque
model of MIA exposure in pregnancy. For this K01 Career Development Award, I propose to leverage the
entirety of biobehavioral data available for the NHP MIA model to examine the effects of neuroimmune
changes on behavioral and brain alterations in MIA-exposed NHPs. My outstanding mentorship team will
provide foundational training in immunology (Van de Water) and the use of NHP models (Bauman) to
accelerate complex translational biomedical research in neurodevelopmental disorders (Schumann). This
award, which represents a critical next step in my development as an independent research scientist, provides
an opportunity to make use of my unique skill set in human and NHP cellular and molecular neuroanatomy,
while expanding the breadth of my research foci in the unique institutional environment provided by UC Davis
and the California National Primate Research Center.
 Our research will contribute to our understanding of the behavioral and neurobiological changes
associated with prenatal exposure to MIA. Specifically, we will apply novel behavioral phenotyping paradigms
to evaluate alterations in socioemotional behavior in the MIA-exposed NHP (Aim 1a). We will longitudinally
map the development of the amygdala in MIA-exposed NHPs and controls to understand the course of MIA-
induced structural brain changes (Aim 1b). Using postmortem tissue collected from subjects at two critical age
time points, we will examine neuroimmune proteomic alterations in the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex
(Aim 2a). Using markers for neuroimmune targets identified in Aim 2a, we will map the expression of
neuroimmune transcripts in specific cell types in brain tissue sections (Aim 2b). Together, these data build a
comprehensive picture of MIA-induced changes in NHP brain circuitry, toward the ultimate goal of identifying
pathways of vulnerability and critical periods for novel, targeted interventions and biotherapeutics."

becoming an independently funded translational clinician scientist, advancing sight-saving research with
expertise in multimodal imaging and functional assessment of the optic nerve and retina. An over-reaching
goal is to restore function in patients with visual loss (rehabilitation) and to intervene in patients with
progressive forms of vision loss (prevention).
Introduction: Poor blood flow has been identified as a risk factor for blindness from age-related non-exudative
macular degeneration (AMD). To save vision, research in choroidal perfusion and its normalization is needed
in AMD patients. This will be accomplished using an imaging technique that measures the dynamics of ocular
blood flow, laser speckle flowgraphy (LSFG), to complement imaging of vascular structure, using Optical
Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCT-A). This will enable the identification and monitoring of patients at
high risk of progression to advanced stages of AMD, who will be candidates for emerging interventions to
increase blood flow. Precise understanding of blood flow in AMD patients is required to capitalize on these
treatments to prevent vision loss and restore function in the millions of Americans at risk. Our preliminary data
using LSFG in the choroid and retina in a retrospective case-control study showed that ocular blood flow is
reduced in large areas even in early and intermediate AMD, which agrees with previous literature.
Methods: This proposal centers on a cross-sectional study of patients with non-exudative age-related macular
degeneration in the early, intermediate and advanced stages, as well as a cohort of control subjects stratified
by age. Blood flow will be measured in across a wide area of retina, including the macula, with laser speckle
flowgraphy, using standard techniques and a novel approach with a wide field montage image. Blood flow will
be compared between controls and patients with AMD at each stage to test the hypothesis that blood flow is
measurably reduced in all stages of dry AMD, after controlling for other risk factors. Repeat variability of blood
flow measurements will be assessed in preparation for following patients longitudinally to assess risk of
progression as a function of reduced blood flow. To test the hypothesis that blood flow reduction may precede
structural changes in the retina, we will compare the areas of reduced flow to the corresponding locations of
retina containing photoreceptors, retinal pigmented epithelium and underlying choroid. Once we have
established baseline studies of the cohort of AMD patients and age-matched control subjects in the proposed
2-year CDA-1 study, we will plan to study these subjects longitudinally in a follow-on prospective cohort study,
which the applicant will be well positioned to perform as part of a future career development proposal (CDA-2).
Career Development: Formal training will consist of university coursework in biostatistics related to clinical
research design, as well as internet-based coursework in Python programming for data science, image
processing, and introductory deep learning. Weekly interactions with mentors will advance skills in the design,
execution, and coordination of clinical research, techniques for image analysis of OCT, OCTA, and LSFG, and
communication of results. Primary mentor is Randy Kardon, MD, PhD, a neuro-ophthalmologist and career VA
clinician scientist with specific expertise in structural, functional, and blood flow assessments of the retina and
optic nerve. Co-mentor Elliott Sohn, MD is a vitreoretinal surgeon-scientist with expertise in the role of the
choroid in the development of age-related macular degeneration, from genetics and histology to imaging
including sophisticated OCT analysis of the choroid. Co-mentor Jui-Kai Wang PhD is an engineer and research
scientist with expertise in developing deep learning approaches to ophthalmic image analysis. The mentors
and career development activities will ensure Dr. Linton’s success in carrying out the proposed study and in his
future career as a VA translational scientist."
10867539,"Stroke is a severe ischemic neurovascular injury, with high rates of incidence in the developed world, high 
mortality, and long-term disability for survivors. It is critical for the development of improved interventions that 
novel therapies take into account post-ischemic stroke (IS) temporality to target appropriate time windows 
for intervention. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation, which effectuates the neuroendocrine 
stress response, is elevated in the hyperacute phase post-IS, increasing corticotropin releasing hormone 
(CRH) and corticosteroid (CORT) signaling. Elevated stress and HPA activity pre-IS is associated with worse 
outcomes, and hypercortisolism in the subacute and chronic phases is both typical and deleterious. The 
hippocampus provides crucial negative feedback regulation of the HPA axis, and secondary post-IS damage 
to the hippocampus is common. Secondary damage to the hippocampus post-IS may depend on corticoiddependent 
signaling; this could set up a feed-forward loop whereby post-stroke potentiation of stress 
signaling propagates itself, promoting further excitotoxicity and neurodegeneration. 
A growing body of evidence suggests that targeting CRH signaling could reduce post-IS morbidity and 
mortality; this includes advanced anti-CRH antibody treatment and CRF1R antagonism. CNS control of HPA 
axis activation is likely a major contributor to CRH and corticoid elevation post-IS. The ventral hippocampus 
regulates CRH production and HPA activation through excitatory projections to the bed nucleus of the stria 
terminalis (BNST), which in turn sends inhibitory projections to CRH+ neurons in the paraventricular nucleus 
(PVN) of the hypothalamus. This circuit represents a viable target for temporally-modulated interventions 
after stroke. In this proposal we will investigate how BNST and PVN neuronal activity changes acutely poststroke, 
and how modulating the activity of key neuronal populations in these nuclei will be effective in 
improving functional outcomes and reducing neuronal damage in the hippocampus and throughout the brain 
after ischemia."
10865828,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Research: Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality in the world, with estimates as high as 1.9 million
new diagnoses and 0.6 million deaths in the United States last year. Trillions of normally beneficial microbes,
termed the microbiota, continuously colonize the mammalian intestine and emerging evidence indicates key
roles for these microbes in impacting cancer. This includes both promoting tumor growth and progression, but
also in supporting response to immunotherapies, raising the exciting possibility to manipulate microbiota to
combat cancer, however the mechanisms by which microbiota influence cancer progression and
immunotherapies remain poorly understood. Based on my published and new preliminary data, I hypothesize
that host-microbiota interactions (i) promote tumor growth by limiting metabolites that provoke anti-tumor
immunity, and (ii) shape systemic anti-tumor immunity and the outcome of immunotherapy by antigen-specific
responses to gut microbiota via crosstalk of RORgt+ lymphocytes. These studies will define two novel pathways
by which microbiota interacts with mammalian hosts to impact tumor growth, progression, and immunotherapy
response, thus provoking novel opportunities for intervention.
Career goals: My overarching goal is to become an independent investigator at an academic institution where
I investigate the mechanisms by which host-microbe interactions modulate anti-tumor immunity and
immunotherapy response for the treatment of cancer. Further, I aspire to become an inspirational and
productive mentor as these are essential aspects of being an independent investigator.
Career Development Plan: To become a successful independent investigator, I will further develop a various
research, professional, and personal skills. These will include further acquiring expertise in cancer biology and
microbiology techniques, as well as fostering collaborations and developing skills in writing, communicating,
teaching, mentoring and laboratory management. My host laboratory and Weill Cornell Medicine provide an
outstanding academic environment where trainees can fulfil these criteria by fostering scientific collaboration
and enrolling in courses to develop skills in specialist scientific areas, personal development, and laboratory
management. The mentorship I will receive will be of the highest standard. Further, in addition to my mentor
and co-mentor, I have support from a team of independent investigators with extensive expertise in areas that
will greatly facilitate the completion of experiments proposed and my career transition into independence.
Career Development Environment: I will perform the K99 phase in the laboratory of Dr. Gregory Sonnenberg
at Weill Cornell Medicine, which provides an outstanding environment in terms of the resources and facilities
available. Weill Cornell Medicine is an ideal environment to develop during the K99 phase as I progress to
become a successful independent investigator. The laboratory has access to all the instruments and facilities
necessary to complete the experiments proposed in this application."
10872137,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Photoreceptor phosphodiesterase (PDE6) is the central enzyme of the visual signaling pathway. Precise
regulation of its activation and deactivation is essential for the speed, sensitivity, and recovery of rod and cone
photoreceptors to illumination. Inherited mutations in rod and cone PDE6 genes have been linked in a variety
of retinal diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa, congenital stationary night blindness, and cone dystrophy.
Next-generation sequencing is identifying a growing number of mutations in PDE6 genes, the large majority of
which remain of uncertain clinical significance. Even less is known about the molecular etiology of retinal
disease-causing mutations. Rod PDE6 consists of two catalytic subunits whose activity is inhibited in the dark-
adapted state by binding of two identical γ-subunits (Pγ). Upon light-induced activation of the visual signaling
pathway, PDE6 activity is stimulated by binding of the heterotrimeric G-protein, transducin. The lifetime of light-
activated PDE6 is precisely controlled by the rate at which the transducin hydrolyzes its bound GTP, a process
controlled by RGS9-1 (Regulator of G-protein Signaling9-1). While the proteins involved in regulation of PDE6
during phototransduction have been identified, the molecular sequence of events in which PDE6 dynamically
interacts with its binding partners--as well as its allosteric regulation--during PDE6 activation and deactivation
remain poorly understood. Until we understand the mechanistic basis of PDE6 regulation during normal
phototransduction, we will be hampered in developing therapeutic interventions for those diseases arising from
defects in PDE6 or its binding partners that result in retinal degenerative diseases and visual disorders.
The overall objective of this application is to understand the sequence of events accompanying PDE6
activation by transducin and its subsequent inactivation by RGS9-1 and other proteins during recovery of
PDE6 to its dark-adapted state. Our experimental plan is based on the hypothesis that the inhibitory Pγ subunit
of PDE6 is the “master regulator” responsible for mediating multiple allosteric interactions that occur within the
PDE6 catalytic dimer, as well as with the transducin α-subunit and RGS9-1. We propose two specific aims that
will (1) delineate the sequence of binding interactions between transducin α-subunits and PDE6 catalytic and
inhibitory Pγ subunits to provide a comprehensive model of rod PDE6 activation, and (2) determine the
molecular architecture of the PDE6 inactivation complex upon RGS9-1 binding and the structural
rearrangements of the Pγ subunit that accelerate termination of activated PDE6. The outcomes of this
research advance the goals of the Retinal Diseases Program at the National Eye Institute by enhancing our
ability to predict the pathogenicity of mutations in phototransduction proteins, thereby enabling development of
personalized therapeutic interventions for retinal diseases resulting from dysregulation of the visual signaling
pathway in rod and cone photoreceptor cells of the retina."

Spinal interoceptive pathways (SIPs) convey bodily signals to an interoceptive system in the brain and their
dysregulation is linked to major depressive disorder (MDD). Current treatments are partially effective and the
role of SIPs in MDD is vastly unexplored. Preliminary data suggests that SIPs are feasible therapeutic targets
in MDD. The central hypothesis is that non-invasive spinal cord stimulation will modulate SIPs to elucidate their
role and therapeutic potential in MDD using an R61/33 phased innovation approach.
R61 phase specific aims (SA). The specific goal will be to evaluate spinal and brain-based SIPs target
engagement markers of transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) in MDD with two SAs:
SA1) To determine tsDCS SIPs modulation using laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) as
electroencephalography (EEG)- based neural measures of target engagement.
SA2) To evaluate optimal tsDCS dose based upon tolerability and SIPs target engagement markers.
Anodal tsDCS will be evaluated as a tool to modulate SIPs in MDD. SIPs (Aδ and C fibers) can be evaluated
via LEPs as neural measures (EEG) elicited in MDD-relevant brain regions within an interoceptive system.
Prior data shows anodal tsDCS inhibits SIPs and LEPs N2 component will be assessed as tsDCS engagement
markers. Adults with MDD (n=67) will participate in a double-blind, crossover, sham-controlled study to
evaluate tsDCS at 0,2.5,3, and 3.5 mA. The working hypothesis is that tsDCS will induce a change in LEPs
(SA1) in a dose-dependent and tolerable manner (SA2), supporting their use as SIPs engagement markers.
Go/No-Go milestones: Compared to sham, the active tsDCS dose that induces a change in LEPs at a pre-
established threshold will be evidence of SIPs engagement and “Go” criteria for the R33 phase.
R33 phase SAs. The most robust LEPs-based SIPs engagement markers at a well-tolerated dose from the
R61 phase will be replicated and used to evaluate tsDCS effects on MDD symptoms with three SAs:
SA3) To replicate R61 phase tsDCS LEPs-based SIPs engagement markers (as required by RFA).
SA4) To determine tsDCS effects on MDD symptomatic domains, safety, and tolerability.
SA5) To evaluate SIPs engagement markers as predictors of change in MDD symptomatic domains.
Adults with MDD (n=80) will participate in an 8-week, double-blind, parallel-group, sham-controlled study.
Based on pilot data, we will evaluate tsDCS (3/week) SIPs modulation effects on symptom severity score
(primary outcome), safety, tolerability, and secondary/exploratory domains. The working hypothesis is that
tsDCS will improve symptom severity (primary) in a safe and tolerable manner, and that SIPs engagement
markers will be replicated (SA3 & 4). LEPs-based markers will also predict change in symptoms (SA5).
Results from this study will support the development of tsDCS as an innovative and feasible SIPs
neuromodulation tool with therapeutic potential and will inform on SIPs role in MDD symptomatic domains."

There is paucity of information on culturally tailored implementation strategies to promote interventions for
people with dementia and their caregivers from LMICs, and yet dementia is a growing concern in resource
limited settings (e.g., Uganda).
Approximately 80% of Uganda’s population
resides in the rural areas where
awareness about dementia is limited.
The proportion of households in rural Uganda with at least one older
adult ≥60 years is 23.2%, and yet data on the
prevalence of dementia in
Uganda
is scarce. While
the hallmark
of comprehensive dementia care should include early detection, management plan, and family caregivers
support,
dementia awareness and support services are virtually non-existent in Uganda.
The World Health
Organization (WHO) developed the dementia toolkit for community workers, consisting of evidence-based
practices for early detection and management of dementia and caregiver support. However, the toolkit has
not been adopted because there is lack of an appropriate and effective implementation strategy. Uganda’s
decentralized health delivery system leverages indigenous Lay Health Workers [LHWs]) at the village level
to address the human resources shortage countrywide. Working with an indigenous member of the
community to support implementation of interventions is a potentially effective strategy. In our prior work, we
demonstrated that training LHWs in the WHO dementia care toolkit was feasible. However, subsequent
implementation and delivery of dementia care was minimal and highly variable because there is lack of an
appropriate and effective implementation strategy. Our overall objective in this proposal is to develop and
evaluate the feasibility of a culturally tailored implementation strategy consisting of the WHO dementia toolkit
by indigenous village-based LHWs to provide dementia care at village level, supported by internal facilitation
from indigenous HAs as supervisors: the “WHO Lay Health Worker Dementia Care, with Internal
Facilitation (WLDC+IF)”. Our proposition is that internal facilitation by indigenous providers is feasible in
achieving adoption and implementation of WHO evidence-based dementia care by village-based LHWs in
rural settings. The pilot feasibility study is informed by the integrated Promoting Action on Research
Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework. The framework allows us to use internal facilitation
as an ‘active ingredient’ to integrate action around the innovation, and recipients within the local,
organizational and wider health system context to enable successful adoption of WLDC+IF. We will co-
design an implementation strategy guide for the WLDC+IF (Aim1), and evaluate feasibility of the
implementation strategy consisting of WLDC+IF (Aim 2). Our expected outcomes are to establish the
feasibility, acceptability, adoption, fidelity, and appropriateness of a culturally tailored implementation strategy
for dementia care at village level by indigenous community members."

Cell migration is integral to embryonic development, immune surveillance, wound healing, and cancer
metastasis. In order to traverse the varied physiochemical environments in tissues, cells have been shown to
switch between distinct migration modes. For instance, when subjected to high mechanical confinement, cells
have been shown to undergo a phenotypic transition to what has been termed, fast amoeboid (leader bleb-
based) migration. Fast amoeboid migration is characterized by the formation of a leader bleb, which is a large
and stable bleb. With non-specific friction, a rapid cortical actin flow in leader blebs provides the motive force
for fast amoeboid migration. Previously, we demonstrated that the actin capping and bundling protein, Eps8, is
required for leader bleb formation within a range of cancer cell types. However, under conditions of high
mechanical confinement, immune cells have also been shown to adopt fast amoeboid migration. Therefore,
cancer and immune cells can utilize similar methods of migration in confined environments. Although it appears
that cancer and immune cells may share similar mechanisms for switching to fast amoeboid migration (i.e.,
confinement sensing), whether cancer and immune cells require the same suite of factor(s) to undergo fast
amoeboid migration is not known. Accordingly, using in vitro and in vivo approaches, the proposed work will
determine the molecular mechanism(s) required by cancer and immune cells for migration in confined
environments. This is significant as elucidating these mechanisms is a required first step for the rationale
development of so-called “migrastatics,” which prevent or abate the migration of unhealthy (cancerous) but not
healthy (immune) cells."

PTP1B, a non-receptor–type oncogenic PTP, also known as PTPN1, is involved in growth factor signaling. The PTP1B
gene is frequently amplified in cancers and correlates with poor prognosis. However, despite the attractiveness of
PTP1B as a therapeutic target, the development of drug-like inhibitors of this enzyme has proven difficult, primarily
due to low cell permeability and a lack of selectivity towards other PTPs. While numerous investigators are developing
traditional types of inhibitors that target the reduced, active form of PTP1B, targeting PTP1B-ox has important
advantages relating to inhibitor bioavailability and selectivity. The goal of this proposal is to develop charge neutral
inhibitors that specifically target the oxidized form of PTP1B (PTP1B-ox), which exists principally in the disease state.
This approach was validated in a recent study showing that single-chain variable fragment antibodies can stabilize
oxPTP1B and, in so doing, modulate signaling pathways related to energy metabolism and cancer. In Aim 1, we will
prepare and evaluate diverse sulfenic acid-reactive combinatorial libraries. In Aim 2, we will screen libraries prepared
in Aim 1 to identify compounds that target oxidized PTP1B. Based on our expertise in targeting distinct redox forms
of therapeutically important proteins and innovative chemistry (Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012, 2018, 2023 and Nat. Chem.
2021), we will almost certainly identify molecules that target and stabilize the oxidized form of PTP1B. These
nucleophilic compounds will lay the foundation for future studies on this topic as an R21 proposal to examine potency
and SAR in cellular assays."

10873780,"Project Summary/Abstract
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive breast cancer subtype in which limited targeted
therapies are available. Therefore, the standard of care treatment for TNBC patients is neoadjuvant
chemotherapy where ~50% of patients have residual tumor burden and poor prognosis after treatment.
Recently, it has been demonstrated that mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos) is both upregulated
and a therapeutic vulnerability in chemoresistant TNBC, however, the mechanism behind this finding is not
understood. The tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), which produces reducing equivalents necessary for oxphos, is
requires the molecule acetyl-CoA (AcCoA). AcCoA can be derived from the breakdown of long chain fatty
acids during fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Because heightened fatty acid metabolism has been associated with
improved survival in TNBC, it is possible that chemoresistant TNBC derives AcCoA from fatty acids, fueling the
TCA and oxphos. The gene carnitine acetyl transferase (CRAT) produces an enzyme (CrAT) that catalyzes the
reversible transfer of an acetyl group between CoA and carnitine within the mitochondria. It is thought that
CrAT buffers the pool of free AcCoA to maximize the energetic needs of the TCA cycle and to prevent pyruvate
dehydrogenase inhibition via excess AcCoA. Within chemoresistant TNBC, greater transcription and/or
translation of CRAT may maximize TCA-derived reducing equivalents needed for oxphos, aiding in
chemoresistance. We have identified the fatty acid metabolism pathway and CRAT as significantly enriched in
chemotherapy (docetaxel combined with carboplatin, standard NACT for TNBC)-resistant versus chemo-
sensitive TNBC PDXs and patient biopsies (NCT02547987) at the RNA and protein levels. In a preliminary
analysis of post-versus pre-NACT TNBC patient derived xenograft (PDX) tumors, I also found increased
cytosolic lipid droplets (LDs) in carboplatin treated PDXs compared to vehicle by transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), suggestive of enhanced fatty acid metabolism. Therefore, I hypothesize that elevated
expression of CRAT in chemoresistant TNBC provides enhanced metabolic plasticity, buffering lipid
derived accumulation of AcCoA to maximize TCA cycle flux and oxphos, aiding in chemoresistance. I
will address this hypothesis by determining if AcCoA is preferentially derived from increased fatty acid
oxidation in chemoresistant TNBC. I will investigate if CRAT ablation impairs chemosensitivity and survival
using both in vitro and in vivo models. I will also determine which isoform of CRAT is necessary and sufficient
to drive chemoresistance. Together, these studies will improve our mechanistic understanding of increased
oxphos in residual TNBC and provide rationale for therapies targeting CrAT function to improve prognosis for
chemoresistant patients."
10873782,"Organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP)1B1 and OATP1B3 (abbreviated as OATP1B1/3) are liver-
specific drug transport proteins that mediate uptake, from blood into the liver, of a diverse array of endogenous
compounds, environmental toxins, and many clinically important drugs (e.g., lipid-lowering statins and anticancer
agents). OATP1B1/3 are important determinants of transport-mediated drug-drug interactions (DDIs) resulting
in severe side effects, such as statin-induced rhabdomyolysis, a sometimes-fatal muscle toxicity. Dysfunction of
OATP1B1/3 significantly contributes to altered drug disposition and adverse drug events. Our long-term goal is
to delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying drug/toxin disposition through OATP1B1/3, and to predict and
mitigate OATP-mediated drug-drug and drug-disease interactions. Although it is evident that factors (drugs,
aging, disease) modulating OATP1B1/3 function could cause drug-drug or drug-disease interactions with
OATP1B1/3 substrates, unfortunately, our ability to predict such interactions is hampered due the dearth of
information on OATP1B1/3 regulation. In particular, modulating lysine acetylation, a major post-translational
modification known to alter function of numerous target proteins, including histone for epigenetic regulation, has
not been investigated for OATP1B1/3. The overall objective of this application is to determine the molecular
mechanisms governing the regulation of OATP1B1/3 by lysine acetylation, and to evaluate the impact of lysine
deacetylase (KDAC) inhibitors (KDACIs) on OATP1B1/3 expression and function. Our central hypothesis is that
OATP1B1/3 are lysine-acetylated proteins, deacetylation of which involves KDAC6; OATP1B1/3 can be
regulated at the epigenetic level by KDACIs targeting histone deacetylation and at the post-translational level by
KDAC6 inhibition. Our novel preliminary data show that 1) OATP1B1/3 are lysine-acetylated; 2) mutagenesis
mimicking hyper-acetylation of OATP1B1 and specific KDAC 6 inhibition significantly reduces OATP1B1/3
transport function; and 3) FDA-approved pan KDAC inhibitors (KDACIs) inhibiting histone deacetylation induce
mRNA and protein levels of OATP1B1/3. Guided by preliminary results, two specific Aims are outlined. In Aim
1, we will elucidate the role of KDAC6 in regulation of OATP1B1/3 lysine acetylation and transporter function. In
Aim 2, we will dissect the regulation of OATP1B1/3 by pan KDACI drugs and the interplay between epigenetic
and posttranslational regulation of OATP1B1/3 via K-Ac. A combination of proteomics, biochemical, and genetic
engineering approaches will be utilized in cell lines and in the physiologically relevant sandwich-cultured primary
human hepatocytes. The outcomes of these experiments will elucidate novel posttranslational and epigenetic
mechanism(s) involved in regulating OATP1B1/3. The knowledge gained from these studies will be invaluable
toward the rational design of novel drugs and inhibitors to optimize drug therapy while avoiding unwanted drug
interactions. This work will enhance our ability to predict altered OATP1B1/3 function by lysine-deacetylase
modulators (e.g., drugs/candidates that are HDAC inhibitors/activators and liver disease states)."

 The NIMH research domain criteria (RDoC) reconceptualizes mental health research along a series of key
cross-disorder dimensional constructs. However, these dimensions were determined in a top-down fashion by
relatively small groups of researchers. We propose a data-driven approach that tests the validity of the key RDoC
constructs of attention, cognitive control, and working memory. We will evaluate these constructs using multiple
cognitive tasks per construct to examine their relationship to brain networks and their ability to predict real-world
behaviors that are relevant to mental health. Finally, we propose an augmentation to the RDoC framework by
adding new units of analysis: contrasts and practice.
 The current RDoC matrix maps directly from task paradigms to constructs and subconstructs, which is
problematic because supposedly distinct constructs can sometimes map to exactly the same set of tasks. To
address this, we propose a new RDoC unit of analysis called a “contrast”, which better reflects the usual logic of
experimental design. We will identify mappings between cognitive systems constructs and contrasts through
consultation with domain experts. We will then acquire a large-scale dataset to test both exploratory and
confirmatory models for RDoC cognitive system constructs. Finally, we will evaluate whether these RDoC
cognitive systems constructs are predictive of related real-world outcomes.
 The RDoC matrix links constructs to both behavioral measures and neural circuits, but the present mappings
between cognitive systems constructs and brain systems are sparse and inconsistent. We will use a dense-
sampling fMRI acquisition of 65 subjects each completing 10 scanning sessions on the same battery of tasks as
the behavioral study, to develop a precise data-driven atlas of neural engagement at each level of the matrix,
from contrasts to subconstructs to constructs. We will then validate the behaviorally-derived models using neural
data, both between subjects and within subjects. We will also perform fully exploratory analyses to identify
whether the data-driven neural circuit structure on these tasks diverges from the RDoC matrix.
 A long history of research in both and animals has shown that repeated practice on a task changes the way
that the task is performed and the brain systems that support performance. We will leverage our behavioral and
brain imaging samples to evaluate whether the structure of the cognitive systems domain remains constant with
practice. In parallel we will also apply exploratory methods to assess the consistency of structural models
estimated either early in training or after extensive practice.
 Overall, this project expands the RDoC matrix with two new units of analysis (contrasts and practice), and
validates the constructs of attention, cognitive control, and working memory across both behavior and neural
circuits."

Because many adverse effects of treatment for childhood cancer may not become clinically apparent until the
survivor attains maturity or older ages, continued follow-up across the lifespan, from childhood through
adulthood, is essential. With the number of childhood cancer survivors in the U.S approaching 500,000, there
is a critical need to accurately characterize the development and manifestation of very late cancer-related
sequelae. In late 2007, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital initiated a unique clinical (i.e., medically
evaluated) cohort with the primary aim of undertaking lifelong evaluation of health-related and quality of life
outcomes in aging adult survivors of pediatric cancer. Eligibility for participation in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort
(SJLIFE) was initially defined as survival >10 years from diagnosis, and attained age of >18 years. With the
award of the U01 Cohort Infrastructure grant (U01 CA195547) in July 2015, eligibility for the cohort was
modified to include >5 year survivors. Participation rates for the cohort remain high with 80.4% of the 7152
contacted survivors having been successfully enrolled and an additional 6.8% with expressed interest in
participating but pending an on-campus visit to provide informed consent. As of February 1, 2019, total
enrollment on SJLIFE is 5753 survivors and 629 controls. Accomplishments over the 43 months since award of
the U01 include: 2657 new participants enrolled, implementation of uniform medical assessments with 4096
on-campus clinical evaluations (reflecting performance of 263,165 clinical tests), banking of biospecimens for
94% of new participants (43,240 vials), germline whole genome sequencing of 4422 survivors, 22 active
investigator-initiated funded grants utilizing the cohort, 22 active intervention-based trials, 27 data sharing
collaborations, and 78 manuscripts submitted with 69 published/in press. In this competitive renewal
application we propose to build upon these successes through activities to maintain and enhance the SJLIFE
cohort as a unique and highly productive resource for pediatric cancer survivorship research and to directly: (1)
facilitate an accelerated rate of discovery in survivorship research by establishing an innovative cloud-based
data sharing platform to make clinical and genomic data from the SJLIFE cohort available to the global
research community; (2) facilitate the investigation of genetic contributions to and pathophysiology of
treatment-associated adverse long-term outcomes among survivors of childhood cancer; and, (3) facilitate
establishment of a portfolio of validated risk prediction tools for clinical use in the management of pediatric
cancer patients from the time of diagnosis through survivorship. The SJLIFE cohort will continue to be unique
in its ability to provide new insights into the risks and pathophysiology of morbidity associated with cancer and
its therapy, which is critical to the design of contemporary treatment protocols and public health initiatives to
enable survivor access to preventive and remedial services."
10874217,"The evidence-based use of prescription medications has led to substantial improvement in healthy aging.
Despite this, the use of medications by patients and providers remains suboptimal. Many patients are not
prescribed guideline-recommended therapies from which they would benefit; among those for whom
appropriate treatment is initiated, almost half do not adhere over the long-term; and others receive potentially-
hazardous medications with an unfavorable balance of risks and benefits. The result: preventable adverse
health outcomes and health spending for middle-aged and older adults.
 While many factors influence the suboptimal use of prescription medications, individual, interpersonal and
institutional behaviors are central. As a result, existing intervention to address these issues have attempted to
remind, reward, motivate, simplify or otherwise change behavior. Unfortunately, these approaches have only
been modestly effective and even among those do work, behavior change is rarely sustained over the long-
term. The results can be explained by the lack of integrating behavioral principles when designing
interventions, a limited focus on evaluating how to deliver them over the long term, and the inherent challenges
in delivering precise and personalized behavior change at population scale.
 Thus, the Brigham and Women’s Hospital Roybal Center for Therapeutic Optimization using Behavioral
Science will continue to focus on the thematic area of promoting adherence and maintenance of long-term
behavior change. The structure and activities of the proposed Center will be based upon 4 key principles: (1) a
multi-disciplinary approach; (2) the testing of principle-driven interventions in real-world settings; (3) the explicit
testing of mechanisms of action, and (4) the use of novel analytic methods and technological approaches to
gain a deeper understanding of behavioral mechanisms and to personalize interventions. Based on these
principles, our Center will have the following Specific Aims:(1) to oversee a translational research program for
the testing of principle-driven, potent, practical, scalable and sustainable behavioral interventions to enhance
the appropriate prescribing and use of evidence-based medications.; (2) to strategically direct and to provide
scientific oversight, fiscal and operational support to ensure the successful completion of behavioral
interventions funded by the Center.; and (3) to conduct trials evaluating principle-drive interventions that aim to
sustain behavior change for the use of evidence-based medications. The proposed Year 1 studies conducted
in partnership with large delivery systems and testing novel approaches to promote the deprescribing of high-
risk medications and to support adherence to evidence-based preventive therapies.
 The expected impact of the Roybal Center for Therapeutic Optimization using Behavioral Science is that it
will develop principle-driven interventions that will readily translate to improvements in healthy aging and will
also advance our fundamental understanding of how health behaviors can be effectively sustained."

Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum remains one of the leading causes of death globally of both
children and pregnant women. The recent global stall in the reduction of malaria deaths has made the
development of a highly effective vaccine essential. A major challenge to developing an efficacious vaccine
is the extensive diversity of Plasmodium falciparum antigens. While genetic diversity plays a major role in
immune evasion and is a barrier to the development of both natural and vaccine-induced protective immunity,
it has been underprioritized in the evaluation of malaria vaccine candidates. This proposal will use genomic
approaches to credential next generation malaria vaccine candidates. Reverse vaccinology is a method of
identifying potential antigens for a vaccine that starts with the genomic sequence of an organism and uses
that information to identify epitopes and antigens that might make suitable vaccine candidates. Since the
genome sequence of Plasmodium falciparum was published, only four new potential candidate vaccines
have entered clinical development, including PfRh5. The main objective of the proposed study is to use a
reverse-vaccinology approach utilizing parasite genomic data directly from infected patients to identify and
functionally interrogate the importance of diversity in these antigens. For these current and novel candidates,
including PfRh5 and binding partners, we will test the role of genetic diversity on immune neutralization by
creating transgenic parasites by using efficient CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. These parasite lines will be
used to assess the role of specific variants in immune evasion prior to Phase 2 clinical trials. We will use IgG
from malaria-immune individuals, followed closely in long-term longitudinal cohorts, and IgG from subjects in
vaccine trials to assess the degree of inhibition of replication of malaria parasites by growth inhibition assays,
neutrophil respiratory burst, and opsonophagocytosis of merozoites. This approach requires the cohesion of
genomic sequencing technologies to identify potential candidate antigens and naturally occurring diversity,
well-characterized human longitudinal cohorts to follow evolution of infection and immunity, standardized
assays to serve as in vitro correlates of immunity, structure-based approaches for vaccine design, and strong
ties to both scientists and institutions in endemic countries. Our research team is uniquely positioned to
combine these critical requirements to investigate the implications of parasite diversity on the development
of protective immunity and vaccine efficacy, an essential factor to accelerate malaria vaccine discovery. This
approach fills a critical need in the malaria vaccine development field in that it brings genetic diversity in
candidate antigens to the forefront of vaccine candidate validation and credentialing. This study holds
exceptional promise to discover new vaccine candidate combinations that will provide broadly neutralizing
antibodies for inclusion in a globally effective vaccine, one that circumvents the parasite’s natural strategy to
evade the immune system."

Europe, and Latin America. However, as in the general population, identifying and engaging MSM with
problematic substance use (PSU) into treatment is a significant challenge, which results in the great majority of
MSM with PSU never receiving treatment. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
(SAMHSA) recommends Screening (S), Brief Intervention (BI), and Referral to Treatment (RT; SBIRT) as an
early intervention for non-treatment-seeking individuals with risky alcohol and drug use, as well as the timely
referral to more intensive substance abuse treatment for those with substance use disorders. The need for such
an intervention is particularly acute in Argentina and Latin America, where there is little implementation of
evidence-based interventions for MSM with PSU. The proposed study seeks to address this glaring gap by
developing and piloting an electronic-SBI program tailored for MSM awaiting their HIV test at Nexo Asociacion
Civil, our community partners in Buenos Aires. The tablet-based e-SBI will integrate substance use and sexual
risk behavior screeners and individually tailored Motivational Interviewing (MI) as the BI. We will also adapt and
pilot the implementation of the Young Men’s Health Project (YMHP, now MHP since it will not be limited to young
MSM), a four-session MI-based intervention that effectively reduced substance use and condomless anal
intercourse among substance using MSM, as a brief treatment provided at Nexo for participants with moderate
or high-risk substance use. The Specific Aims of this R34 study are to: 1) develop a tailored e-SBI intervention
for MSM in an HIV testing context aimed at reducing substance use and HIV risk behavior (Primary); 2) assess
the feasibility and acceptability of integrating e-SBI into the HIV testing process at Nexo as measured by a)
percent of MSM testing clients at Nexo who accept entry into the study; b) percent of participants who complete
e-SBI; c) e-SBI acceptability ratings (Primary); 3) assess the feasibility and acceptability of implementing adapted
YMHP at Nexo, as measured by a) the percent of MSM with moderate or high-risk substance use who enter
and/or complete MHP; b) acceptability of MHP among those who received it; and c) percentage of sessions
conducted by each MHP counselor that meets criteria for MI fidelity (Secondary). In Stage 1 (Development) we
will develop e-SBI, adapt YMHP into MHP, train MHP counselors, and pilot e-SBI with 50 MSM coming to Nexo
for HIV testing. In Stage 2 (RCT Pilot), we will randomize 200 MSM coming to Nexo for HIV testing at a 3:1 ratio
(eSBI: Screening Assessments Only-SA) to assess the feasibility and acceptability of e-SBI among MSM coming
to Nexo for HIV testing and establish and pilot the RCT process for a future trial. As a secondary aim, we will
assess uptake, acceptability, and feasibility of delivering MHP to participants with low or moderate risk substance
use and subsequent referrals to substance abuse treatment among participants with high-risk substance use or
dependence. Lastly, we will explore preliminary findings on substance use and sexual risk reduction outcomes."

evidence exists on the patterns and continuity of care following discharge from acute and post-acute care to
the community after TBI. This mixed-methods Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will
generate data on the patterns and continuity of care to identify disparities in care and inform initiatives to
improve quality of care of older adults with TBI following hospital discharge. The overarching goal of this NIA
K01 award is to provide the candidate with a better understanding of the needs and provision of care of older
adults with TBI, advanced analytical skills to evaluate care delivery, skills in translating evidence into health
initiatives to improve care, and development of an independent research program contributing to improving
health outcomes of older adults with TBI. The candidate's mentoring team includes well-established
researchers in geriatric medicine, post-acute care, health services, mixed methodology, quality improvement,
implementation sciences, and health disparities. The candidate will receive mentorship and training in four
essential areas to achieve her career goals, which are to: (1) understand the clinical care processes and health
care policies influencing health care delivery of older adults; (2) increase proficiency in advanced analytical
approaches to evaluate health care delivery for older adults using administrative claims data; (3) develop,
adapt, and evaluate real-world evidence-based interventions to improve health care delivery for older adults;
and (4) accelerate career trajectory to becoming an NIH-funded investigator focused on improving care for
older adults with TBI. Using Medicare data (2015-2018), the training activities will prepare her to address the
following specific aims, which are to: (1) determine the patterns of care in older adults with TBI during the year
following acute discharge; (2) explore facilitators and barriers to continuity of care, and elicit stakeholder
recommendations to improve care following acute discharge among older adults with TBI, caregivers, and
healthcare personnel; and (3) examine the association between continuity of care and health outcomes
following acute discharge among older adults with TBI. The findings from this K01 will contribute to describing
current practice, and integrate stakeholder perspectives to guide efforts to address disparities in care receipt.
Through the research aims and career development training activities, the candidate will be better equipped to
submit an R01 to evaluate the effect of implementing an evidence-based, patient-informed transitional care
intervention to improve care continuity and health outcomes following discharge among older adults with TBI."
10878544,"PROJECT ABSTRACT: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive malignancy representing the 7th most
common cancer globally and the 4th most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Although magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) represents a common HCC diagnostic and prognostic tool, MRI fails to provide insights
into HCC risk stratification, and does not allow for rational therapeutic allocation. Chemical exchange saturation
transfer (CEST) molecular MRI, on the other hand, permits noninvasive measurement of tumor metabolism
predictive of malignancy. Integration of CEST MRI into clinical HCC management has the potential to radically
alter clinical practice paradigms through: (1) identification of small malignant nodules and those with
unconventional enhancement features to increase diagnostic performance; (2) improved prediction of tumor
aggressiveness to inform patient prognosis and treatment stratification; and (3) monitoring of tumor metabolism
in patients post therapy to differentiate between pseudoprogression—characterized by tumor regression
following an initial increase in tumor burden—and true tumor progression. This proposal employs the innovative
Oncopig Cancer Model—a transgenic porcine model that recapitulates human cancer through induced KRASG12D
and TP53R167H expression—to test the hypothesis that noninvasive mapping of in vivo creatine (Cr) metabolism
empowers prediction of differential HCC tumor aggressiveness. Combining our innovative Oncopig Cancer
Model with MRI and CRISPR protocols optimized under our previously funded R03 and R21 grants, we will
image Oncopig HCC tumors engineered to display differential Cr metabolism and malignant potential to
demonstrate that Cr CEST MRI can accurately differentiate: 1) HCC malignancy due to intertumor genetic
heterogeneity, 2) intratumor heterogeneity, and 3) pseudoprogression from true tumor progression. Genes
targeted will include the ubiquitous mitochondrial Cr kinase (CKMT1), which converts ATP and Cr to ADP and
phosphocreatine to meet cellular energy demands. CKMT1 knockdown reduces human HCC proliferation and
migration in vitro, while increased CKMT1 serum levels are associated with poor prognosis following
radiofrequency ablation. We plan to test our hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) Demonstrate
applicability of Cr CEST MRI for stratifying HCC malignancy reflective of intertumor genetic heterogeneity. (2)
Demonstrate applicability of Cr CEST MRI for assessment of intratumor heterogeneity. (3) Demonstrate
applicability of Cr CEST MRI to differentiate between pseudoprogression and true tumor progression. Oncopig
HCC tumor growth and Cr levels will be quantified using a respiratory gated liver CEST MRI protocol to reduce
motion artifacts. MRI-guided biopsy collection will enable co-registration—based comparison of in vitro
measurements with Cr CEST for assessment of Cr CEST sensitivity and specificity. This proposal will radically
alter HCC clinical practice paradigms by enabling noninvasive high-resolution in vivo molecular profiling to
improve HCC diagnostic performance, treatment stratification, and treatment response monitoring."
10878615,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Current immunotherapies, such as anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, have low objective responses in patients,
necessitating the development of novel therapies that boost immune responses to cancer and responses to these
treatments. Further, most immunotherapies in the clinic, anti-PD-1 immunotherapy included, predominantly act on
T cells. While combinations of T cell-directed therapies can lead to excellent outcomes for some, most patients still
have no objective responses to combinations of these immunotherapies. Thus, it is imperative to identify novel
therapeutic targets that work synergistically with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy and other T cell-directed therapies.
Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that can control tumors through direct cytotoxicity or their
immunomodulatory production of cytokines and chemokines. NK cell abundance in the tumor correlates with
increased patient survival and patient responses to immunotherapies. We previously found that a key
immunomodulatory function of NK cells is their production of the cytokine FLT3LG which regulates type 1
conventional dendritic cell (cDC1) abundance in the tumor microenvironment (TME). cDC1s are an important
antigen presenting cell that shapes anti-tumor T cell responses. We found that NK cell production of FLT3LG
regulates cDC1 abundance in the TME which leads to increased patient survival and responses to anti-PD-1
immunotherapy. We hypothesize that targeting the immunomodulatory effects of NK cells in the tumor
microenvironment will lead to more protective cDC1s, better tumor-directed T cell responses, and increased
efficacy of immunotherapies. Thus, it is critically important that we define how NK cells are regulated in the tumor
microenvironment. In particular, the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating NK cell phenotype and function
in the tumor are unknown, and the molecular mechanisms controlling NK cell production of the cytokine FLT3LG
are unknown. In Aim 1 of this project, we will determine tumor-intrinsic features that regulate NK cell phenotype
and function in the tumor. In Aim 2, we will define the mechanisms that regulate NK cell production of Flt3L. In Aim
3, we will elucidate the mechanisms regulating NK cell phenotype and function in human metastatic melanoma. To
address these aims we have developed ectopic tumor models and in vitro NK cell stimulation assays that allow us
to define the molecular mechanisms regulating NK cell production of Flt3L. We have also developed complimentary
human immunology studies of metastatic melanoma samples that allow for the study of NK cells and their
immunomodulatory effects in a translational setting. The studies outlined in this proposal will provide answers to
longstanding questions about how NK cell phenotypes and functions are regulated in the TME and will be
foundational to the development of novel immunotherapies that target the immunomodulatory effects of NK cells
to increase a patient’s immune response to cancer."
10881663,"Title: Xenobiotic Receptors in Mediating the Environmental Effects on Human Disease and Morbidity
Project Summary/Abstract:
This R35 proposal is designed to consolidate our current NIEHS funded projects into one program with the
focus on understanding the role of xenobiotic receptors in regulating the metabolism of xenobiotics and
endobiotics and the implications of this regulation in human health. The human population is at an increasing
risk of developing chronic diseases, such as fibrosis, metabolic syndrome, alcoholic liver disease, and
neurologic disorders. Environmental factors, including environmental chemicals, are among the major
contributing factors in the pathogenesis of these chronic diseases. As such, understanding the mechanisms
by which environmental chemicals modify human physiology and pathophysiology will help to design
therapeutic or preventive strategies to mitigate the pathogenic effect of environmental chemicals. Xenobiotic
receptors, including the xenobiotic nuclear receptors pregnane X receptor (PXR) and constitutive androstane
receptor (CAR) and the PAS domain transcriptional factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), are best known for
their functions in sensing xenobiotic chemicals and regulating xenobiotic metabolism. Emerging evidence,
mainly through the creation and characterization of gene knockout mice and identification of endogenous
ligands, suggests that the xenobiotic receptors also have functions in regulating the homeostasis of
endobiotics and impacting pathophysiology. Our overarching hypothesis is that xenobiotic receptors are
critical environmental chemical-sensing transcriptional factors that mediate the environmental
chemical effects on human disease and morbidity. Mechanistically, xenobiotic receptors impact the
pathogenesis of human diseases by regulating the metabolism of xenobiotics and endobiotics in both
the hepatic and extrahepatic tissues. We propose that the xenobiotic receptors are pivotal environmental
modifiers that integrate signals from chemical exposures to the regulation of many aspects of human
physiology. To test our hypothesis, we will assemble a highly experienced team and employ a broad spectrum
of genetic and pharmacological tools, transdisciplinary approaches, and the expertise of an array of
collaborators and clinician scientists to comprehensively define the roles that xenobiotic receptors play in
environmentally influenced diseases, such as fibrosis, metabolic syndrome, alcoholic liver disease, and
neurologic disorders. By understanding these pathways, we cannot only understand the environment-gene
interactions and the implications of these interactions in human diseases, but also establish xenobiotic
receptors and their target enzymes and transporters as potential therapeutic targets to manage these human
diseases and morbidity. The insights gained from this R35 program can be used to design intervention
strategies to manipulate these pathways via therapeutics or to guide human behavior or the human
environment in a manner that is most beneficial to the sensitive populations. Over the next eight years, this
R35 program will give us the freedom and power to make considerable advances in our understanding of
xenobiotic receptors and how they influence human health. As the Principal Investigator, I am committed to
devote 55% of my total effort to this R35 program, and all of my existing NIEHS funding will be consolidated
into this grant if funded. I am confident that I can lead this R35 program, because I have studied xenobiotic
receptors for two decades and have demonstrated a broad vision and made seminal contributions to our
understanding of the toxicological and pathophysiological functions of xenobiotic receptors."
10881667,"The long-term goal of this vision research program is to gain a better understanding of 1) the mechanisms
underlying retinal synaptic and cellular physiology mediating visual image processing, and 2) the early
cellular changes that are likely to mediate ganglion cell death and loss of vision following retinal and optic
nerve disease and trauma. This program consists of two related components.
1) National Institute of Health supported studies are concerned with the functional organization of the
mammalian retina by investigating synaptic and cellular mechanisms, and the role of retinal microcircuits in
mediating image processing. This fundamental experimental component is focused on two classes of retinal
interneurons, called amacrine and horizontal cells, their network connectivity, and the action of their
signaling molecules that play a role in defined retinal circuits. These studies aim to advance our knowledge
of normal cellular mechanisms mediating visual information processing in the retina. This information is key
to understanding the pathophysiology of eye diseases, a required step for developing rational genetic and
stem cell therapeutic approaches for preventing or treating retinal diseases such as glaucoma, macular
degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy, which affect the Veteran population.
2) VA supported studies are concerned with understanding early mechanisms underlying retinal ganglion
cell death due to retina and optic nerve disease and injury. Ocular trauma, which frequently occurs with
traumatic brain injury (TBI), results in severe visual impairments, including acuity loss, photophobia, and
partial and total loss of vision. The current Merit Review is focused on Ca2+ channel and calcium permeable
AMPA receptor (CP-AMPAR) transcriptional and translational regulation and ganglion cell intracellular Ca2+
following optic nerve injury, as a model for optic nerve trauma. The first group of studies is focused on L-
type Ca2+ channels expressed by ganglion cells, to elucidate the actions of the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker,
lomerizine, which enhances ganglion cell survival in different models of optic neuropathy. Studies are
evaluating L-type Ca2+ channel expression and function following optic nerve injury, and to test the idea that
lomerizine blocks up-regulated Ca2+ channel function, which in turn slows intracellular retinal ganglion cell
Ca2+ influx. This in turn would limit pathological changes including ganglion cell loss. Animal studies testing
lomerizine administration on retinal ganglion cell survival are also planned. Related experimental studies
are focused on testing if CP-AMPARs, which are reported to be rapidly up-regulated on retinal ganglion cell
dendrites after ocular injury, mediate Ca2+ uptake into ganglion cells and contribute to ganglion cell death.
Experiments are focused on defining CP-AMPAR and the AMPAR editing enzyme expression, and testing
the idea that pharmacological antagonism, genetic and siRNA-mediated regulation of CP-AMPARs and the
AMPA editing enzyme ADAR2 stabilize ganglion cell intracellular Ca2+ levels, and enhances ganglion cell
survival following nerve injury. Animal studies will also test if selective CP-AMPAR antagonists and targeted
siRNAs protect against retinal ganglion cell loss after optic nerve injury.
The long-term goal of the Merit Review studies is to understand how vision loss associated with retinal
ganglion cell death can be reduced. These studies have the potential impact of unveiling novel therapeutic
approaches to ameliorate ocular damage and vision loss. These investigations are consistent with the
health-related goals of the Department of Veteran Affairs to develop effective treatments for eye injuries."
10881721,"With an increasing number of women serving in the military, there is a significant need to effectively manage our
active duty and Veteran women who develop breast cancer. In the United States alone, ~276,000 women will
be diagnosed with breast cancer, of whom ~42,000 are predicted to die from this disease this year. Patients
diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-
positive breast cancer have an increased likelihood of distant recurrence in the brain compared to other breast
cancer subtypes – exceeding 35% of metastatic breast cancer patients. Brain metastases (BMs) confer dismal
prognosis, as existing treatments have very limited efficacy; indeed, median survival for TNBC patients after
detection of metastatic disease is ~5 months. Multiple unique barriers limit effective drug delivery to breast cancer
BMs. These barriers include (i) the blood-brain barrier (BBB) within the normal brain parenchyma and the blood-
tumor barrier (BTB) within metastatic lesions; (ii) elevated tumor interstitial pressure and the dense
electrostatically charged brain extracellular spaces (ECS) which together limit convective and diffusive drug
penetration; (iii) the activity of multidrug resistance (MDR) pumps expressed by both brain capillary endothelial
cells and tumor cells, which reduce drug levels within tumor cells; and (iv) the brain glialymphatic system (GLS),
which acts as an efficient drug clearance system. Thus, new therapeutic delivery strategies designed to mitigate
and surmount these barriers will likely offer new promise towards effectively treating BMs.
Accordingly, we propose to couple an emerging therapeutic delivery technology, decreased nonspecific
adhesivity, receptor-targeted nanoparticles (DART NPs) with MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) for
treatment of breast cancer BMs (BCBMs). DART NPs will be engineered to target Fn14, a member of the TNF
receptor superfamily that is highly expressed in primary breast cancer and breast cancer BMs; but minimally in
normal breast, brain, or other organs. Research findings from our team related to the development and
application of DART NPs and MRgFUS-enhanced drug delivery that motivate the proposed studies include: (1)
DART NPs rapidly penetrate in brain and breast tumor tissues ex vivo, selectively targeting Fn14-positive tumor
cells both in vitro and in vivo, and significantly enhancing drug retention within intracranial tumors in vivo. (2)
MRgFUS-induced BBB disruption (BBBD) can safely increase DART nanoparticle delivery into the normal brain
parenchyma. (3) Fn14-targeted DART NPs containing the chemotherapeutic paclitaxel (PTX-DART NPs) are
more effective than free PTX in killing cancer cells that overexpress the MDR1 efflux pump. (4) PTX-DART NPs
more effectively reduce tumor growth and improve animal survival in mammary fat pad and intracranial TNBC
xenograft models compared to Abraxane, an FDA-approved nanotherapeutic currently used to treat breast
cancer patients. The proposed work will build on these findings to test the hypothesis that clinical-grade PTX-
DART NPs in combination with MRgFUS-induced BBBD will provide superior delivery, drug retention, and
therapeutic efficacy in BCBMs compared to the clinical standard drug treatments. The results from this study
also have the potential to make an impact on both male and female military service personnel with other Fn14+
cancer types that frequently metastasize to the brain; specifically, lung cancer and melanoma."
10878547,"ABSTRACT
Immune responses to platelet alloantigens cause pathology in the settings of transfusion and pregnancy, the
latter resulting in the relatively common and more serious non-malignant hematologic bleeding disorder, fetal/
neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT). FNAIT occurs when maternal antibodies, specific for paternal
platelet alloantigens inherited by the fetus, cross the placenta and clear platelets from the fetal and/or neonatal
circulation, resulting in thrombocytopenia and bleeding that are often serious enough to require transfusion in
the neonatal period. FNAIT arises in some but not all at-risk pregnancies. In an unpredictable subset of severely
thrombocytopenic cases, major organ bleeds such as intracranial hemorrhage occur in the fetal period, placing
such infants at risk for irreversible brain damage, lifelong disability and death. Off-label therapies are used to
manage thrombocytopenia in subsequent pregnancies of a mother who has delivered an affected infant. It is
currently not possible to identify pregnancies at high risk for severe bleeding so that they can be specifically
targeted for therapy or to prevent development of FNAIT. Research needed to develop diagnostic tests for severe
forms of FNAIT, to better understand disease etiology, and to test strategies for disease prevention are difficult,
if not impossible, to perform in the pregnant women and neonates who constitute the FNAIT population. There
is a compelling need for transformative animal models that can narrow the existing information gap and improve
diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of this notable cause of morbidity and mortality in human neonates. We
have developed a unique, alloantigen-specific, preclinical mouse model of FNAIT that recapitulates clinically
important aspects of human disease. Herein, we apply extensive immunological expertise to this model to 1)
determine whether the severe bleeding and other pregnancy complications that accompany FNAIT are caused
by subpopulations of alloantigen-specific antibodies that bind to and impair the functions of fetal platelets,
syncytiotrophoblasts and endothelial cells and 2) identify events capable of causing development of FNAIT
during pregnancy and prophylactic strategies needed to prevent it. Our studies are made feasible by established
immunization schemes, breeding protocols, antibody infusion strategies, and methods for classifying pregnancy
outcomes and alloantibody epitope specificities and function blocking activities. Our studies will have diagnostic
and therapeutic significance in that they will lay the groundwork for development of diagnostic tests that can
safely discriminate between pregnancies at risk for mild vs. severe FNAIT, thereby providing a mechanistic basis
for rational therapeutic intervention, and will identify potential causes of FNAIT that can be validated in human
studies and inform efforts to prevent development of FNAIT during pregnancy. This cutting-edge work at the
interface of molecular biology, immunology, and hematology will provide novel and informative insights to trans-
form our understanding of anti-platelet alloimmune responses to benefit the field of non-malignant hematology."
10878552,"Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common primary malignant brain cancer, remains among the most lethal of
cancers. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is dysregulated prominently in GBM, however existing
inhibitors are limited by either poor target inhibition or poor pharmacology. CoPI Kevan Shokat therefore linked
the clinical TORKi sapanisertib (MLN0128) to the allosteric mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. This first bisteric
mTORC1 inhibitor, RapaLink-1, showed mTORC1-specific binding and blood brain barrier permeability. Like
rapamycin, this agent bound tightly to the cellular chaperone FK506 Binding Protein 12 (FKBP12), a protein we
showed to be expressed at high levels in GBM. Thus, RapaLink-1 potently blocked the catalytic ATP- and
substrate-binding site of mTOR within mTORC1, and accumulated in brain tumor cells. We showed that
RapaLink-1 was more potent than rapamycin or the TORKi sapanisertib, which we traced to its superior
pharmacokinetic profile compared to sapanisertib. We next generated a strategy to potentiate the inhibition
Rapalink-1 in GBM, while sparing mTOR inhibition outside the CNS, dosing mice with both RapaLink-1 and a
brain-impermeable FKBP12 ligand that we synthesized, called RapaBlock. This drug combination mitigated the
systemic effects of mTORC1 inhibitors but retained the efficacy of RapaLink-1 in orthotopic GBM xenografts. We
furthered this strategy by designing cell-permeable, FKBP12-dependent kinase inhibitors from known drug
scaffolds including FK-dasatinib. Outside of the CNS, these inhibitors were sensitive to deactivation by
RapaBlock, enabling brain-restricted inhibition of respective kinase targets.
A clinical bisteric mTOR inhibitor, RMC-5552 is currently in clinical trials. A GBM trial opens in 2023. Like
RapaLink-1, RMC-5552 is FKBP12-dependent. We hypothesize that 1). RapaBlock will potentiate efficacy while
decreasing peripheral toxicity of RMC-5552 in GBM, and 2). We can further develop our strategy to develop
FKBP-dependent inhibitors of other targets in GBM, including targets with liabilities outside of the CNS.
A1. Test the hypothesis that RapaBlock will enhance efficacy and reduce toxicity associated with use of
rapamycin and the clinical bisteric mTORC1 inhibitor RMC5552 in GBM.
A2. Test the hypothesis that linking FK506, a high-affinity FKBP12 ligand, to JAK1/2 inhibitors will generate an
FKBP12-dependent JAK inhibitor. STAT3 drives progression and therapy resistance in GBM. JAK inhibitors
block activation of STAT3, however hematologic toxicity limits their utility. We will generate an FKBP12-
dependent version of the clinical JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. We will combine FK-ruxolitinib with RapaBlock as a
strategy to maximize inhibition of STAT3 in orthotopic GBM xenografts, while sparing hematological toxicities.
Successful completion develops a preclinical strategy to improve brain penetration while sparing peripheral
toxicities for kinase inhibitors; and provides the preclinical rationale to: 1). Test RMC-5552 and Rapablock in
combination in GBM, and 2). Move forward with developing both FK-ruxolitinib and RapaBlock as drugs.

10878481,"ABSTRACT
Although most melanoma deaths are caused by distant metastasis, the mechanisms that regulate metastasis
are poorly understood. During metastasis, cancer cells encounter oxidative stress in the blood, and successful
metastasis requires that cancer cells adapt to this hostile environment by undergoing metabolic changes. One
of the ways in which oxidative stress can kill cells is through ferroptosis, marked by the accumulation of lipid
reactive oxygen species. Recent work from Dr. Ubellacker’s studies discovered that melanoma cells in lymph
are protected against ferroptosis. These studies revealed that lymph protects from ferroptosis is by having high
levels of the monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) oleic acid, which shields cells from lipid oxidation by reducing
the abundance of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that undergo lipid oxidation in membranes. These
observations suggest that it may be possible to target lipid metabolism in cancer cells to prevent cancer spread
from lymph nodes. However, we do not know to what extent the lymph node microenvironment protects
melanoma cells from lipid oxidation. Nor do we know what lipidomic adaptations melanoma cells undergo in the
lymph node microenvironment enable them to metastasize more efficiently. The objective in this project is to
identify and exploit lipidomic vulnerabilities in melanoma cells in the lymphatic microenvironment to prevent early-
stage melanoma metastasis. To accomplish this objective, this project will use a clinically relevant model of
melanoma metastasis of patient-derived xenografts, as well as a murine melanoma model in immunocompetent
mice and human clinical samples The central hypothesis is that melanoma cells in the lymph node
microenvironment undergo specific lipid adaptations to withstand oxidative stress and that targeting these
adaptations will prevent melanoma metastasis from lymph nodes. The central hypothesis will be tested in three
specific aims: 1.) To investigate the extent to which melanoma cells depend on N-acylglycine synthesis for
survival in the lymph nodes, and whether this synthesis pathway can be targeted to decrease melanoma cell
survival; 2.) To assess the contribution of dietary and intracellular fatty acids to increasing lipid oxidation and
increasing death of melanoma cell metastases in lymph nodes; 3.) To determine the extent to which ferroptosis
resistance can be targeted to reduce survival of melanoma cells in lymph nodes. By identifying the influence of
the lymph node microenvironment on lipidomic changes in melanoma cells, we expect to determine lipids in
melanoma cells that serve as prognostic biomarkers and to identify feasible lipidomic targets and dietary
interventions to prevent the spread of early-stage melanoma and improve disease outcome in patients."
10878553,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In addition to intellectual disability, individuals with Down syndrome (DS, Trisomy 21, Ts21) have an increased
risk for many other health conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). DS is the leading genetic risk factor
for AD, and nearly 90% of individuals with DS develop AD (DS-AD). Beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles,
characteristic AD pathology, begin accumulating in DS brains earlier than in the general population, and most
individuals with DS are diagnosed with DS-AD in their early to mid-50s. Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons
(BFCNs), involved in arousal, learning, attention, and memory, are a susceptible population prone to
degeneration in DS-AD as well as other neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, Parkinson’s disease (PD),
and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Little is known about BFCN development and molecular mechanisms
underlying vulnerability. Limited analysis of human DS tissue suggests fewer BFCNs populate the basal
forebrain, however, it remains unclear whether the reduction is due to developmental deficits, accelerated
degeneration, or a combination of both.
The goals of the F99 pre-doctoral proposal are to 1) determine whether fewer BFCNs and AD pathology are
present in the early postnatal DS basal forebrain, 2) identify underlying molecular signatures that may contribute
to the susceptibility of BFCNs later in life, and 3) model BFCN development in vitro using isogenic of Ts21 and
control induced pluripotent stem cells. The goals of the K00 post-doctoral proposal are to 1) analyze tissue
across the lifespan at different disease stages to determine the temporal order of AD pathology accumulation in
the DS basal forebrain, and 2) sequence basal forebrain tissue from DS-AD, AD, PD, and DLB to determine if
shared mechanisms underlie BFCN vulnerability across several neurodegenerative diseases.
This F99 proposal will be the first study of human DS post-mortem tissue to reveal early deficits in DS BFCNs,
suggesting deficits in DS BDCN development. Elucidating early post-natal deficits in DS BFCNs may inform early
interventions and improve BFCN health across the lifespan. The K00 proposal will be the first cross-sectional
study of human DS post-mortem tissue to reveal early emerging pathology and molecular mechanisms
contributing to the susceptibility of BFCNs in the basal forebrain and elucidate shared mechanisms underlying
BFCN vulnerability in several neurodegenerative diseases. Results may provide novel targets for therapeutics
impactful for many neurodegenerative diseases. The results from this project will meet the goals of the NIH
INCLUDE project by establishing scientific data to improve the health and neurodevelopment of individuals with
Down syndrome and have a broader impact on the health of individuals at risk for other neurodegenerative
diseases characterized by the loss of BFCNs, including DS-AD, AD, PD, and DLB."
10890039,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) strains cause most urinary tract infections (UTIs)
globally, resulting in enormous health and social costs. In the past decade, research has shown
that UPEC strains are not just transmitted person-to-person; environmental sources, such as
food-animal products, also contribute to transmission. Applying comparative genomics, we have
identified host-associated mobile genetic elements (MGEs) that can be used to identify the
vertebrate host from which a strain originates. Applying these methods in the United States, we
have found that approximately 8% of human UTIs can be linked directly to UPEC from meat and
poultry products. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), the intensity of human-animal
interactions is greater suggesting a different ecology for UPEC transmission. A literature review
by our team demonstrates that UPEC transmission is poorly understood in LMICs. In this study,
we will integrate comparative genomics, exposure assessment and spatiotemporal analyses to
determine the drivers of UPEC epidemiology in poor, marginalized communities of an LMIC. We
will leverage over 20 years of experience working in northwestern coastal Ecuador, a region that
has been historically neglected in the context of health infrastructure and where communities
live in proximity with livestock, poultry, and pets. We have developed a research platform
studying diarrheal and vectorborne diseases, and have fully developed survey instruments to
capture demographic, socioeconomic, and water, sanitation and hygiene data, and fully
developed assays to process blood and stool samples.
Our goals for this project are to identify the dominant zoonotic sources of UPEC, quantify the
transmission to humans and characterize the behaviors and environmental conditions
associated with risk for colonization and infection. We will carry out active surveillance at
regional hospitals over a 30-month period and follow 420 households prospectively over a 4-
year period. We hypothesize that domestic animal species will be important sources of UPEC
within LMIC settings like our study site and will be major drivers for UPEC colonization. The
study will characterize the role that domestic animals play in the transmission of UPEC in an
LMIC setting, where environmental transmission pathways are likely much more important
compared to high-income settings. By identifying specific reservoirs of UPEC and high-risk
exposures, we will define optimal mitigation strategies to decrease disease burden in resource
poor settings. Understanding how host-specific genetic markers vary in an LMIC is important for
developing targets of diagnostics and therapeutic interventions."
10890044,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a disabling and costly psychiatric disorder that is estimated to occur in
20% of individuals who are exposed to a traumatic event and is chronic in one third of cases. In addition to its
negative impact on quality of life, there is substantial evidence that PTSD (even after controlling for depression
and other risk factors) is associated with a markedly increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
However, the mechanisms for the association between PTSD and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk are not well
understood. Although adverse health behaviors, including cigarette smoking, alcohol abuse and poor medication
adherence are common in PTSD, recent prospective studies show that they do not account for the magnitude of
CVD risk among individuals with PTSD. We propose to test our central hypothesis by evaluating whether CBT-I
results in improved biomarkers of CVD risk among those with PTSD. Well established biomarkers of CVD related
morbidity and mortality will be used including measures of vascular endothelial function measured by brachial
artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), nighttime blood pressure (BP) dipping measured using 24-hour ambulatory
blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity as measured by 24-hour
urinary catecholamines. We will also assess lipid profile, which along with BP is a modifiable component with
marked impact on the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk score. The primary sleep parameter of
interest is objectively-measured sleep efficiency (through actigraphy), although self-report insomnia measures and
sleep related arousal will also be measured. The rationale for the proposed research is that once it is established
that insomnia is an important and modifiable symptom conveying increased CVD risk in this population, the
development of new and innovative approaches to integrating insomnia treatment with PTSD-focused
interventions can be developed. 150 men and women with comorbid PTSD and insomnia disorder will be
randomly assigned with a 2:1 ratio to 8-week cognitive behavioral therapy-Insomnia (CBT-I) intervention or a
waiting period control condition. Sleep quality parameters and CVD risk biomarkers will be assessed at pre-
randomization baseline, post-intervention, and at a 6-month follow-up. The study is designed to evaluate the
association between insomnia and CVD risk biomarkers among persons with PTSD, and determine whether
improvements in insomnia symptoms are associated with improvements in CVD risk biomarkers."
10890045,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glioblastoma is a lethal primary brain tumor with limited treatment options. The current standard therapy with
combined chemoradiation therapy (chemoRT) with temozolomide (TMZ), an alkylating agent offers a median
survival of only 16-18 months. There is an urgent need for novel therapies especially those that can overcome
resistance to chemoRT. Cancer cells develop complex resistance mechanisms that enable them to survive the
effects of conventional therapies. One such evolutionally conserved mechanism is the heat shock response
(HSR) which can deploy several diverse defense processes in the setting of adverse environmental conditions.
The HSR is mediated by heat shock proteins (HSP), a class of molecular chaperones that shuttle and
configure client oncoproteins into proper functional states. In preliminary studies, we show that onalespib, a
novel long acting inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), a critical mediator of the HSR in cancer cells,
blocked tumor growth, invasion and angiogenesis in gliomas suggesting the potential for a strong independent
antitumor effect. Relevant to this proposal, onalespib sensitizes glioma cells to TMZ and RT in patient-derived
(PDX) cell lines and in a zebrafish and mouse intracranial glioma animal models. Based on these data, in this
grant submission, we propose a phase I clinical trial through the NCI-funded Adult Brain Tumor Consortium to
identify the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of onalespib with chemoRT in adults with newly
diagnosed GBM. We also propose to conduct key correlative tissue and plasma studies through the following
specific aims: Aim 1 will identify the MTD of onalespib in combination of chemoRT and adjuvant temozolomide
and will determine whether onalespib can cross the blood brain barrier and achieve sufficient concentrations in
enhancing and non-enhancing glioma tissue compared with plasma levels. Aim 2 will determine the
pharmacodynamic effects of onalespib by assessing whether onalespib can inhibit Hsp90, its target, in human
GBM tissue obtained in this trial and whether this inhibition can affect its chaperone oncoprotein clients
particularly those relevant to DNA repair and cell survival against the effects of RT and TMZ. In Aim 3, we will
conduct co-clinical trials using PDX intracranial glioma models and organotypic human glioma slices to
determine the mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to onalespib effects to provide insights that can help
modify the subsequent phase II trial. This is the first human trial of an Hsp90 inhibitor in brain tumors and the
first to combine an Hsp90 inhibitor with chemo- and radiation therapy against GBM. Successful completion of
this trial will enable us to proceed to a Phase II efficacy trial (approved by NRG oncology) and will provide
comprehensive PK and PD data that can help the development of onalespib and Hsp90 inhibitors in other
malignancies."

Herpesviruses such as Herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2 are ubiquitous DNA viruses that establish lifelong
infections. After primary infection, they enter latency and occasionally reactivate, causing recurrent disease.
HSV 1 and 2 establish latency in neurons, and reactivation causes lesions of the facial or genital area. HSV-1
and 2 lack vaccines or curative treatments and new therapeutic strategies against chronic HSV diseases are
critically needed. During an infection, cells are frequently co-infected by multiple virions, and therapeutic
approaches that rely on viral co-infection have great potential. We recently invented a CRISPR-based “viral
gene drive” that relies on viral co-infection to replace wild-type viruses with an engineered version. Our
strategy was inspired by similar methods developed in insects and uses CRISPR-Cas9 and homologous
recombination to efficiently propagate a genetic modification in the viral population, ultimately reducing viral
levels. Our discovery uncovered a new way to engineer herpesviruses for therapeutic and research purposes.
Our long-term goal is to design gene drives that could be used as curative therapies for HSV infection. Patients
suffering from chronic HSV disease could be treated with an engineered virus that recombines with wild-type
viruses in the latent reservoir and prevents viral outbreaks. In this innovative application, we propose to
determine if a viral gene drive can spread to the latent reservoir and inactivate wild-type viruses in mice latently
infected with HSV-1. In specific aim 1, we will use mouse models of HSV-1 infection to test if a gene drive can
suppress viral shedding in mice persistently infected with wild-type HSV-1. This will establish the potential of
gene drives to cure chronic HSV-1 infection. In specific aim 2, we will use fluorescently-labeled viruses and
mathematical modeling to quantify co-infection frequency during gene drive propagation in vivo. The rationale
is that gene drives rely on co-infection, and that a better understanding of the biology of co-infection is needed
for the development of our innovative therapeutic strategy. We will determine how often a gene drive reaches
latently infected neurons and establish if a gene drive can efficiently inactivate the latent reservoir. Altogether,
this project will test the therapeutic potential of a breakthrough technology and may lead to novel therapies that
significantly improve human health."

A longstanding challenge in neuroscience is how to monitor neuronal signaling and activity at cellular resolution over a large area/volume with millisecond time resolution. At high frame rates, conventional two-photon fluorescence microscopy (2PFM) methods are limited in their achievable fields of view by their point-scanning mechanisms. Although camera-based one-photon widefield fluorescence microscopy (1PWM) can be used to image fast activity events at kilohertz frame rates, it requires sparse fluorescence labeling/excitation and is limited to superficial tissue depths. Previously, we implemented an all-optical and passive ultrafast laser-scanning technique called free-space angular-chirp-enhanced delay (FACED) in 2PFM. Capable of generating millions of line scans per second, our FACED module has enabled 2PFM to image large fields of view at kilohertz frame rates. Applying FACED 2PFM to the mouse brain in vivo, we recorded supra- and sub-threshold electrical activity and characterized ultrafast cortical blood flow dynamics deep below the brain surface. Here, we aim to further optimize FACED technology to maximize its accessibility and impact. First, we will develop a FACED module with fully motorized positioning and active beam stabilization, to enable alignment-free operation with flexible configuration. We will also build software support for FACED data acquisition into ScanImage, a widely used 2PFM control program. Together, the development of user-friendly hardware and software will facilitate the adoption of FACED in labs that specialize in biological applications. Next, we will expand the impact of FACED on fast neural imaging into the mesoscale by integrating a FACED module into a two-photon mesoscope, with the resulting 10-30× speed gain enabling the recording of neuronal activity over 20 mm2 in vivo. Finally, to overcome the limitations of 1PWM in voltage imaging, we will build a kilohertz-frame-rate single-photon confocal microscope using FACED to enable voltage imaging in both sparsely and densely labeled brains, while developing new far-red voltage sensors to maximize the imaging depth of this approach. The proposed work will substantially broaden the impact of FACED technology by making it accessible to and capable of answering a wide variety of neuroscience questions."

The University of Michigan (UM) Kidney, Urology and Hematology Research Training Network (KUHR) was
developed with the primary goal of creating an institutional infrastructure with resources to aid recruiting and
preparing a diverse group of trainees (predoctoral to physician scientists and PhD postdoctoral fellows) for
academic careers. The Program faculty mentors and trainees will pursue a broad translational science
spectrum from the biological basis of disease to interventions that improve the health of individuals and the
public in the KUH domain. The U2C component will coordinate and provide administrative support through its
Administrative Core to achieve the goals of the Program, structured around the following Specific Aims. Aim 1:
To train the next generation of scientists in KUH relevant areas. The TL1 component supports a rigorous
training program emphasizing research training themes based both on the critical need to develop well-trained
investigators in all areas along the translational and cross-disciplinary spectrum of KUH disease research and
on the investigative interest and expertise of program faculty members. In addition to UM, Program faculty
members are drawn from a regional research base involving the University of Toledo, Ohio and institutions
across the State of Michigan. Trainees focused on basic research will participate in an intensive pre or
postdoctoral research training program. Trainees focused on more translational or health services research will
often pursue a Master's Program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis, Bioinformatics, Health
and Health Care Research or Health Infrastructures and Learning Systems. Aim 2: To assist trainees with
developing the skills broadly necessary for a successful career in research. Offerings from the
Professional Development Core will support activities and curricula designed to enhance trainee research
competitiveness in research, including building skills in leadership and communication, grant writing and
professional networking. Aim 3: To ensure the provision of robust and skillful research mentoring. The
Professional Development Core will also include specific curricula directed at preceptors to develop their
mentoring skills. Another important component, the Networking Core will develop systems and processes that
support direct peer communication and near-peer mentoring amongst all trainees supported directly by the TL1
component of this award, as well as those institutional trainees already supported by other NIH training
mechanisms. Aim 4: To establish a pipeline for future trainees fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion.
Community outreach to attract diverse early-career students (high school and undergraduate) into KUH
research areas is another important focus of the Networking Core. The ultimate goal of the Program is to
attract, recruit, provide networking opportunities, engage and prepare trainees for academic KUH disease
research careers in the United States."
10891619,"Exposures to chlorine (Cl2) and bromine gases (Br2) are public health threats. Cl2 and Br2 exposures occur as a
result of industrial accidents as well as in chemical warfare. Cardiopulmonary failure is a major concern
following exposures, which contributes to mortality and morbidity; but the mechanisms underlying end organ
injury after exposure to Cl2 or Br2 remain to be determined. We discovered that Cl2 and Br2 gas exposure target
host plasmalogen lipids, resulting in high levels of 2-halofatty aldehyde and 2-halofatty acids in the lung and
circulation. Recently, we have shown 2-chlorofatty acids, at levels found in the plasma of mice and rats
exposed to Cl2, elicit neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. Since NETs are critical and early initiators of
coagulopathies that cause end organ injury, the proposed studies will test the hypothesis that Cl2 and Br2
derived 2-halofatty acids elicit NET formation to induce lung injury. Furthermore, our preliminary data show 2-
bromofatty acid also causes NET formation, underscoring the potential for NET formation as a unifying
mechanism mediating both Cl2 and Br2 gas toxicity that will identify common therapeutic targets and
countermeasure development opportunities. Moreover, while Cl2 and Br2 are similar, their unique
physicochemical properties endow differences in mechanisms by which each cause injury. Salient to this
proposal, we have shown that 2-bromofatty aldehyde reactivity with nucleophiles is 25-fold greater than that of
2-chlorofatty aldehyde. In addition to testing the role of NET formation, proposed studies will also identify
protein targets of 2-bromofatty and 2-chlorofatty aldehydes and their respective 2-halofatty acids in mediating
NET formation, and we anticipate results from these studies will demonstrate overlapping and unique targets in
the pathways by which Cl2 and Br2 mediate circulatory and pulmonary dysfunction.
There are two specific aims for the proposed studies.
Specific Aim 1 will identify chlorolipids and bromolipids as critical mediators of NET formation and subsequent
lung injury following Cl2 and Br2 exposure.
Specific Aim 2 will identify mechanisms by which chlorolipids and bromolipids elicit NET formation in human
neutrophils.
We will employ both mouse and rat models of Cl2 and Br2 gas exposure. This, together with testing two distinct
toxicants at LD50 levels, meet criteria for this RFA. Collectively, the proposed studies will delineate a common
mechanism for Cl2 and Br2 toxicity mediated by halolipid-stimulated NET formation and organ failure. This
mechanism could lead to a common treatment for both of these Chemical Countermeasures Research
Program concerns in the future."

Stress- and infection-driven neuroimmune activation in the brain plays a central role in sickness, allergies, and
psychiatric diseases like anxiety and depression. Mast cells (MCs) are innate immune cells rapidly activated upon
exposure to immune challenges and stress, and they release preformed mediators such as histamine, serotonin,
enzymes, and cytokines that regulate inflammation and physiology in the brain, making them well positioned
affect brain function and drive behavioral and physiological responses to stress and sickness. Although we know
that MC development and function are largely driven by changes in gene transcription, the genetic and
transcriptional mechanisms by which MCs are regulated remain poorly understood, and the means to target MCs
to treat infection and stress-related diseases remain largely unavailable. We have uncovered a novel transcription
factor that limits MC activation and modulation, ΔFosB, and our preliminary data show that mice lacking the FosB
gene specifically in MCs are more vulnerable to sickness in response to acute immune activation but show
elevated mood and reduced anxiety overall. Thus, we hypothesize that: 1) acute MC activity is limited by FosB
gene expression as a mechanism to prevent sickness; and 2) chronic stress or immune activation drives ΔFosB
expression to alter MC dynamics and promote vulnerability to psychiatric diseases associated with
neuroinflammation in the brain. To delineate the mechanisms by which ΔFosB regulates MC gene expression
and function, we will complete the following aims: 1) Determine the role of FosB gene expression in MC function
using traditional immunohistochemistry combined with a completely novel ex vivo and in vivo Ca2+ imaging
technique; 2) Characterize the role of MC ΔFosB in physiology and behavior using our novel mouse line lacking
FosB gene expression specifically in MCs and testing both physiological response to immune challenge and
behavioral response to stress; 3) Determine the downstream gene targets of ΔFosB in MCs using RNAseq and
CUT & RUN in cultured MCs and an innovative TRAP approach to uncover gene targets in MCs in vivo. Together,
these aims will demonstrate a novel mechanism of MC regulation relevant to physiology and disease, introduce
and validate new tools critical for the study of MC activity in the living mouse, and uncover new genetic and
transcriptional targets in MCs that could be pharmacologically leveraged to treat conditions ranging from allergic
reactions to deadly infections to depression and other mood disorders."
10891678,"Project Summary/Abstract
Francisella tularensis is a bacterium that causes tularemia, a disease which, when in its pneumonic form, can
be fatal even with appropriate treatment. Due to its low infectious dose, ease of spread by aerosol, and high
virulence, F. tularensis is classified as a Tier 1 Select Agent by the U.S. federal government. This R01 project
builds on our earlier identification (by contact PI Horwitz's group) of the Francisella Type VI Secretion System
(T6SS) and our subsequent determination (by Horwitz's and MPI Zhou's group) of the first atomic models of its
sheath and its uniquely endowed central spike complex through cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM). T6SSs are
large, complex, multi-protein nanomachines that Gram-negative bacteria use to sense environmental cues and
deliver toxins into other bacteria or into eukaryotic hosts; in Francisella, they mediate phagosome escape and
intracytoplasmic replication. They are important virulence determinants, present in 25% of Gram-negative
bacteria and in an even higher percentage of those that are human pathogens. However, without knowing
T6SS composition and structure, we cannot fully understand its mechanisms of pathogenesis nor effectively
design countermeasures against a myriad of bacterial diseases. The T6SS of Francisella is both significant
and attractive to study because of the high infectivity and lethality of Francisella species and its relative
simplicity compared with other T6SSs. However, significant knowledge gaps remain, including the following:
(1) an atomic model of the structure of the pre-contraction outer sheath; (2) the composition and an atomic
model of the baseplate and membrane complex; and (3) the composition of the Francisella central spike and
secreted effector protein complex and an atomic model of its interaction with the sheath, baseplate, and
membrane complex in the pre-contraction state and during the contraction process.
 To fill these gaps, we propose to carry out three major structure-function studies on T6SS using
Francisella novicida [and its closely related F. tularensis live vaccine strain (LVS)] as a model. First, we shall
obtain the atomic model of the sheath and tube complex in purified T6SS in its pre-contraction state with
cryoEM, and elucidate the energetics and mechanism of T6SS contraction by structural comparison with the
contracted sheath and structure-guided mutagenesis. Second, using proximity labeling, crosslinking, affinity
pull-down, immunoblotting, proteomics, and bacterial 2-hybrid analyses, we shall determine the composition
and protein interactions of the baseplate and membrane core complex. This information will be used in
conjunction with cryo electron tomography of T6SS-containing mini-cells to determine the composition and
structure of the T6SS baseplate and membrane complex in their pre- and post-contraction states. Third, we
shall determine the composition and structure of the Francisella T6SS central spike and secreted effector
complex. The results will form the foundation for future function studies and the development of new strategies
for treating and preventing diseases caused by the numerous important pathogenic bacteria that have a T6SS."

This R01, submitted to the Toward Translation of Nanotechnology Cancer Interventions (TTNCI) program,
is a continuation of our successful U01 CA218292 (09/2017-07/2022), funded through the NCI Alliance for
Nanotechnology in Cancer program. During the U01 project period, we demonstrated that our nanoparticles
derived from the plant virus cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) stimulate a potent antitumor immune response against
multiple tumor mouse models. Additionally, trials in companion dogs with melanoma, sarcoma, and breast cancer
demonstrate potent antitumor efficacy with our unique immunotherapy approach. CPMV is an intratumoral
injected in situ vaccine (ISV) technology, with an ability to induce durable immune-mediated antitumor
efficacy against treated and untreated tumors as well as immunological memory against recurrence.
Mechanistically, CPMV activates the innate immune system to improve processing of tumor-associated and
neoantigens, thereby resulting in a more functional adaptive antitumor immunity against antigens expressed by
the tumor. This results in remissions of treated and untreated malignant tumors, and protection from recurrence
via the adaptive arm and immune memory. Building on this strong foundation of data as well as intellectual
property, this project will focus on optimizing GMP manufacturing and pharmacology in murine tumor models
and canine patients to provide the foundational basis of future human oncology trials. The multi-PI leadership
team Steinmetz (UC San Diego), Fiering (Dartmouth) and Ranjan (OSU) brings complimentary expertise in
plant virus-based CPMV nanotechnology, cancer immunology, and veterinary oncology/immunotherapy trials.
Our team is also supported by a group of consultants with expertise in regulatory (Garnick, Mosaic IE Inc.),
pharmacology/toxicology (Luksic, Intrinsik), clinical (Garovoy, Mosaic IE Inc.) affairs, as well as experience
in vertical farming (Eisenberg, OPO). We believe that our strong team of collaborators can help establish the
future manufacture of the plant-derived biologic. We will fulfil the following Specific Aims: (1) Chemistry,
Manufacturing, and Control (CMC) method development for scalable manufacture and QAC of the CPMV-
ISV, (2) Pharmacology: Determine biodistribution, dosing, and toxicology of the CPMV-ISV drug candidate in
orthotopic and metastatic mouse models of melanoma; and (3) Canine trials: establish dosing and safety in
canine oncology trials in varying tumor types amenable for in situ vaccination (melanoma, sarcoma, and mast-
cell tumor). Through parallel trials in murine tumor models and dog patients, we will identify biopsy or blood
biomarkers for longitudinal monitoring of treatment response. Successful completion would position us for good
manufacturing practice (GMP) production of this plant virus-based biologic nanotechnology and to continue the
developmental path, e.g. through the NCI Experimental Therapeutics (NExT) program, thereby translating the
CPMV-based drug candidate into a human clinical trial and practice."
10891240,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of the proposed research is to provide a better understanding of how cilia move by dissecting
the structure and function of ciliary complexes that regulate dynein activity and ciliary motility. Cilia and flagella
are conserved and ubiquitous microtubule-based organelles with important roles in cell locomotion, fluid
transport, sensation, cell signaling, and development, which are critical processes for the survival and proper
function of many eukaryotic cells and tissues. In humans, defects in the motility and assembly of cilia are
responsible for numerous congenital diseases, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia, chronic respiratory disease,
infertility, brain developmental defects, congenital heart disease, and randomization of the left-right body axis.
Our previous studies of both inhibited and actively beating wild type and mutant cilia have opened a new window
into the functional organization of motile cilia. However, long-standing fundamental questions remain, for
example, about how regulatory signals change dynein’s activity on a molecular level, what are the roles of the
different regulatory complexes during ciliary motility, and how dyneins are spatially and temporally coordinated
to generate the oscillatory beating typical for cilia. Building on a strong premise of both published and preliminary
data, this proposal directly addresses these critical open questions through three specific aims that are directed
at (Aim 1) revealing the proteome and near-atomic resolution structure of the full-length radial spoke RS3 in
mouse respiratory cilia, (Aim 2) understanding the functional roles of the regulatory ATPase domain of DRC11
– a nexin-dynein regulatory complex subunit – for proper regulation of ciliary motility, and (Aim 3) characterizing
ciliary components that assemble only on specific doublets to ascertain if their inherently asymmetric distribution
contributes to generating ciliary beating and/or different waveforms. We use a powerful and innovative
combination of modern approaches, including a multi-scale imaging approach that combines near-atomic
resolution cryo-EM single particle analysis, cryo-electron tomography to image mutant cilia and tagged proteins
with molecular resolution, and expansion light microscopy to determine the doublet-specific distribution of
specific ciliary proteins. We expect that our combined studies will provide important new conceptual and
mechanistic insights into ciliary motility and regulation, which will also impact our understanding of ciliary
diseases."
10895335,"ABSTRACT
The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is a major intercellular signaling pathway important for embryonic
development and adult tissue homeostasis. Errors in Hh signaling are linked to several newborn birth defects
such as skeletal malformations and craniofacial defects, and associated with multiple tumors including basal
cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma. An important but poorly understood aspect of vertebrate Hh signaling is
the strict requirement of a microtubule-based organelle known as the primary cilium. While we now have a
wealth of data on the “parts-list” of proteins involved in the Hh signaling, the molecular mechanisms underlying
cilia-mediated signal transduction remains poorly understood. Our overall goal is to fill this major knowledge
gap and provide a biochemical framework for the Hh signaling pathway by reconstituting key reaction of this
pathway from its components. For this research, we will build on our experience in integrating single-molecule
imaging methods with biochemical assays and cell biological readouts to connect the biochemical properties of
the protein components to their cellular function. In this proposal, we focus a key step of the Hh signal
transduction pathway which is the establishment of signaling complexes at the base and the tip of the cilia, as
is needed for the proper activation or repression of the transcription factor Gli, the major effector of the Hh
pathway. Here, we will: (1) define these protein-protein interactions through a series of reconstitution studies
and determine how they restrict the Gli binding to the nuclear import machinery and (2) analyze the dynamics
of key pathway proteins in the cilium using high-resolution real-time imaging. Together, these studies will
define how Gli is regulated through dynamic transit between protein complexes at defined cytoplasmic
locations. We expect that our findings will not only advance our understanding of the basic biology of this
important signal transduction pathway but also shed light on how mutations in pathway components contribute
to developmental disorders and human cancers."
10895338,"While it was initially believed that only a minority of CRC are driven by inflammation, studies showing that
treatment with anti-inflammatory medications may prevent or delay the development of CRC in hereditary and
sporadic cases, clearly identify inflammation as a key driver in the development and progression of all types of
CRC. Yet, it is still unclear what are the mechanisms that in the complex intestinal environment contribute to the
activation of the inflammatory pathways that initiate CRC.
The intestine holds a delicate balance between host protection and control of excessive inflammation, and we
posit that a dysregulated communication between the epithelial and the immune component of the intestinal
barrier may link a sub-acute state of inflammation and CRC initiation. The complement system is emerging as
an important player in the gastrointestinal tract. Specifically, the complement anaphylatoxin C3a and its receptor,
C3aR, regulate the immune and epithelial compartments in the intestine and exert antibacterial properties. By
mining publicly available datasets, we found that C3aR is down-regulated in patients with CRC and the fact that
this down-regulation occurs already in stage 1 tumors, suggests that it may be an early event during CRC
development. By crossing C3aR-/- mice with the APCMin/+ mice, that carry a mutation in the apc gene, similarly
to the majority of human CRC, we showed that C3aR is protective in CRC. Indeed, while in APCMin/+ mice tumors
mostly developed in the small intestine, in APCMin/+/C3aR-/- mice tumorigenesis dramatically shifted almost
exclusively to the colon. We also found intestinal barrier dysfunction and microbial dysbiosis in mice lacking
C3aR, suggesting that C3aR may be a novel gatekeeper in intestinal homeostasis. However, it is currently
unknown how C3aR contributes to CRC development.
We hypothesize that loss of C3aR causes intestinal barrier dysfunction by affecting the communication between
epithelial and immune cells. This then leads to development of microbiota-driven inflammatory immune
responses that promote the development of CRC. To test this hypothesis we propose:
1) to investigate how loss of C3aR affects the epithelial component of the intestinal barrier and the
communication with the immune cells; 2) To investigate the contribution of C3aR on immune, non immune cell
types, and microbiota to CRC development; 3) To investigate the C3aR status in human pre-invasive lesions
and CRC. Bone marrow chimera in combination with single cell high dimensional analysis of immune infiltrates
using mass cytometry and REAPseq will determine the contribution of C3aR on immune and non immune cells
to colon inflammation and CRC development and progression. We will assess how C3aR down-regulation affects
human CRC and survival by using human specimens from our well characterized patient cohorts. As loss of
C3aR represents an early event during CRC, identifying the mechanisms linking loss of C3aR to the development
of CRC will not only further our understanding of CRC but is highly significant for the prevention of CRC."
10895391,"The overall goal of research in the Geri lab is to map protein interactomes using discovery technologies that
provide orders of magnitude improvements in spatiotemporal resolution over the current state-of-the-art. The
motivation for this work is that advancing the resolution of protein interactome discovery technology beyond key
milestones, such as single cell and single protein thresholds, will have a field-wide impact analogous to similar
advances in transcriptomics and microscopy. The first three years of work in the lab will be focused on creating
new technologies by combining photocatalytic proximity labeling, in which light-powered catalysts attached to an
affinity handle drive the crosslinking of synthetic affinity probes with nearby proteins, with patterned light and
interaction-gated activation to simultaneously enforce multiple dimensions of specificity. The fourth and fifth
years of work will focus on applying the mature technologies. The overall strategy is divided along two thrusts,
in which labeling specificity is obtained through extrinsic optical control or intrinsic chemical control, and has
been designed to be programmatically robust by minimizing project interdependency. Intrinsically selective
systems will exploit the high spatial resolution of photocatalytic labeling (5 nm) and use “split” systems that
operate when defined protein targets are in proximity. Initial work will use natively expressed orphan peptides as
proximity labeling loci to discover their currently unknown receptors. The effort will cover thousands of peptides
by using label free ion mobility mass spectrometry for proteomics, maximally leveraged by using optimized
labeling probe designs. Split systems will combine multiple photocatalysts targeted to different proteins of interest
to make colocalization a dimension of specificity, and will be initially applied to map proteins present at membrane
junctions. Extrinsically controlled systems will enable subcellular resolution labeling in human tissue sections
and ms-resolution temporal control for the study of transient protein interactions. Both approaches are enabled
by combining optical tools for spatiotemporal control of light itself with the total and instantaneously responsive
(<1µs) dependence between photocatalytic efficiency and the local supply of light, and each allow for a three
order of magnitude increase in resolution vs current tools. Spatially selective labeling will focus on identifying
protein interactions unique to cell subpopulations in human tissues, with initial studies focusing on discovering
location-conditional interactions driving lymphocyte function in human tonsil and thymus. Later studies will focus
on discovering interactome differences between translationally relevant tissue samples. Temporally resolved
labeling will combine optogenetic tools and photocatalytic proximity labeling to synchronize and interrogate
transient protein interactions. The power of this approach will be fully exploited by studying exocytosis in neurons
with millisecond resolution, one of the fastest dynamic biological processes known. Successful development and
deployment of these systems for protein interaction discovery will enable the study of large interactome spaces
for the first time, and is expected to have a broad impact on the molecular biology community."
10895393,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Many young adults engage in heavy drinking and in turn experience negative consequences (e.g., severe injury,
overdose). While personalized feedback interventions (PFIs) show promise among college students, non-
college young adults are often excluded from research, effect sizes tend to be small to medium, gains are not
usually maintained, and improvements in engagement and potential for reach are needed. Mobile technology
can be harnessed to deliver intervention, but many mHealth platforms are not theoretically based or rigorously
developed and tested. Preliminary work suggests that the morning after drinking may represent a “teachable
moment” not yet exploited for harm reduction. We propose to examine mornings after drinking as an optimal
time to provide repeated, personalized feedback with the goal of reducing hazardous drinking. Specifically, we
will further develop and pilot test a novel theory-based PFI for heavy drinking young adults. Innovations include
mobile delivery of feedback in multiple doses that occur close in time to drinking; choice of feedback; feedback
informed by daily, mobile assessment of recent key drinking events; and use of personalized and dynamic goal
setting to guide behavior change. In line with principles of the transtheoretical model (e.g., developing
discrepancy), intervention strategies include personalized feedback (e.g., prior night blood alcohol concentration,
consequences) contrasted with both drinking goals set at baseline and corrective normative feedback (e.g., how
last night’s drinking compares to peers). We have promising preliminary data on this intervention; however, prior
pilot participants included only college students. Further, they were paid for compliance with the daily surveys
that informed their feedback, but engagement in the absence of monetary reward is essential to scalability. In
the proposed study, we will incorporate end-user feedback on ways to increase engagement, and manipulate
payment in order to determine engagement with a more scalable (i.e., unpaid) daily PFI. First, a refined version
of our mobile daily PFI will be delivered in an open trial to 20 heavy drinking young adults (50% non-college).
After four weeks of daily intervention, participants will return for individual interviews to inform further refinement
of the intervention content. Finally, 132 participants (50% non-college) will be randomized to one of three groups:
PFI with monetary incentives for daily surveys, PFI without monetary incentives, or survey assessment only. We
will examine recruitment rates, retention rates, confirmation of intervention content delivery/intake, response
rates to daily surveys, data quality, and ratings of intervention value. We will test whether these indicators of
engagement differ between those who do and do not receive monetary incentives for daily surveys. Further,
baseline, post-test, and 3-month follow-up assessments will allow us to estimate effect sizes for PFI vs control
differences in drinks per week, frequency of heavy drinking, and negative consequences. The results of the
proposed research will result in a novel and scalable intervention for alcohol misuse among young adults, with
potential to have an important impact on the public health problem of high-risk drinking."
10895394,"Abstract/Project Summary
Falls among adults ≥ 65 years are a leading cause of morbidity, mortality, and high healthcare costs. Clinical
guidelines indicate that all healthcare providers should conduct annual falls prevention (FP) by screening all
older adults and assessing and intervening for those at risk. FP efforts using CDC’s STEADI (Stopping Elderly
Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries) are used in primary care, but barriers limit uptake and sustainability. Physical
therapists (PTs) are trained and qualified healthcare providers who can provide FP within their scope of
practice and have more one-on-one time and frequent follow-up compared to primary care, positioning them to
incorporate STEADI in outpatient rehab (rehab). Yet, studies indicate PTs are not providing FP to at-risk older
adults in rehab. We will examine how to best support uptake of STEADI and address this gap through the
following aims: (1) Identify clinic-, provider-, and patient-level barriers to and facilitators of implementing
STEADI in rehab; (2) Develop implementation strategies to support the adoption of STEADI in rehab; (3) Pilot
test the impact of implementation strategies for STEADI in rehab on implementation outcomes (clinic- and
provider-level) and explore clinical outcomes. We will use innovative methods, including implementation
science (IS) and mixed-methods approaches (Aims 1 and 3) and a stakeholder-driven evidence-based quality
improvement (EBQI) process (Aim 2). Dr. Vincenzo’s background, career development plan, and mentor
support make her an excellent Beeson award candidate. She is an Associate Professor of Physical Therapy
and Geriatrics, and a board-certified clinical specialist in geriatric physical therapy with an MPH and PhD in
exercise science. She has been a leader in aging and FP research for the past 8 years. Her career
development objectives complement the proposed research aims. She will obtain training, mentorship, and
skills in IS, mixed methods research (used in IS), leadership, and geriatric research. The University of
Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) is an ideal environment for her career development and research.
UAMS and its Translational Research Institute (TRI) supported Dr. Vincenzo’s career through a KL2 award and
will continue to provide training, equipment, consultation, and mentoring. The UAMS Center for Implementation
Research, led by Geoffrey Curran, PhD (primary mentor), will support her career development and mentored
research in IS. Jeanne Wei, MD, PhD (advisor), UAMS Institute on Aging executive director, will support
development in geriatric research. Co-mentors Jonathan Bean, MD, MPH, and Jennifer Brach, PhD, PT, are

10893581,"Project Summary/Abstract
Vascular cells are constantly subjected to physical forces associated with the rhythmic activities of the heart,
which combined with the individual geometry of vessels further imposes oscillatory, disturbed, or laminar shear
stresses on endothelial cells. These hemodynamic forces dictate the phenotype and gene expression profile of
endothelial cells in different regions of the arterial tree making them athero-protective or athero-prone. Due to
the impact of distinct types of flow in the onset of vascular pathology, significant effort has been placed in
identifying mechanosensing proteins and transcriptional profiles linked to different types of shear stress. In
contrast, less emphasis has been given to how forces at the cell surface are transmitted to the nucleus,
impacting nuclear shape, nuclear pore function, and chromatin organization and integrity in the vasculature,
which is the focus of this application. I found that oscillatory and disturbed flow have a progressive deleterious
effect in nuclear shape, which is exacerbated by loss of vimentin. Based on this and other preliminary data, I
hypothesize that Vimentin is critical for maintaining nuclear shape and chromatin integrity in regions of oscillatory
and disturbed flow in the endothelium. Using endothelial cells in vitro for mechanistic studies and vimentin null
mice for in vivo validation, I will complete an in-depth characterization of changes in nuclear integrity and function
in dysmorphic nuclei associated with aging and loss of vimentin. I will begin with a detailed characterization of
nuclear shape, nuclear membrane integrity, and function (via analysis of nuclear-cytoplasmic transport) in ECs
under non-laminar flow both in vivo, in the aortic endothelium, and in vitro using live-cell imaging, and atomic
force microscopy. I also will characterize vimentin kinetics, including its post-translational modifications, under
non-laminar flow (Aim 1). To assess shifts in transcriptional and signaling networks, I will use scRNA sequencing
and proteomics to identify and validate the vimentin interactome. I will examine the consequence of vimentin
loss on proteins of the Linker of Nucleoskeleton to Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex which directly or indirectly
interact with vimentin and are involved in direct force transmission to the nucleus (Aim 2). Finally, I will evaluate
how loss of vimentin alters endothelial chromatin integrity and epigenetic states using ATAC-sequencing to
provide evidence of vimentin’s critical function in maintaining chromatin homeostasis in the vasculature (Aim 3).
Through the completion of this proposed work, I will significantly expand my toolkit of techniques, skills, and
concepts while actively contributing to clarify the impact of physical forces on the endothelial nucleus. I am also
looking forward to broadening my skills in working with large datasets including analysis, distillation of information
and deriving new questions. As part of this process, I will pursue several interactions and scientific connections
with centers and collaborators within and outside my institution that will contribute to the advancement and
completion of this work, my scientific training, and prepare me for the next stage of my career."

As the most signiﬁcant risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias, aging causes the gradual
decline of speciﬁc cognitive abilities, like spatial memory, reducing independence and quality of life.1-3
However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying aging-mediated cognitive decline remain unclear, limiting
the development of therapies that extend the brain's healthspan.2 To advance our mechanistic understanding
of spatial memory decline in healthy and diseased brain aging, the proposed study will simultaneously
characterize and then correlate molecular, cellular, and circuit-level changes in the medial entorhinal cortex
(MEC), a brain region critical for spatial memory and impacted by molecular pathology in pre-clinical AD.4,5 In
young rodents and primates, MEC neuron ﬁring patterns represent position, speed, head direction, and
environmental landmarks, facilitating goal-directed navigation and spatial memory.6-12 How MEC spatial coding
changes and functionally supports spatial memory in aged animals is unknown. To address this, I propose to
record from MEC neurons at high density using Neuropixels probes as young and aged mice navigate virtual-
reality (VR) environments. I will quantify how aging impacts single-unit MEC properties, such as position- and
speed-coding ﬁdelity and stability, and, in turn, spatial memory, measured as the rate of learning and
alternating between rewarded VR locations (Aim 1). In young animals, theta rhythm organizes MEC activity
and supports spatial memory, but its functional status in aged animals is not understood. Thus, I will also
analyze how aging impacts theta-rhythmic coordination of activity across populations of MEC neurons (Aim 2).
After recording, I will deﬁne gene expression changes with age in MEC neurons using single nucleus RNA-
sequencing (snRNAseq) (Aim 3). Ultimately, I will correlate altered gene expression with MEC coding and
spatial memory dysfunction to identify targets for future therapies to rejuvenate the aging brain and to treat
age-modulated dementias like AD. Given my previous experience investigating molecular changes in aging
and neurodegeneration that compromise hippocampus-dependent spatial memory, I am well-equipped to
execute these experiments. Pursuing these aims will also cultivate new skills necessary for me to excel as
future independent investigator, including robustly collecting and analyzing large-scale neural and
transcriptomic datasets. I will conduct this work under the sponsorship of Lisa Giocomo, PhD: a global expert
in electrophysiology and the neural systems that support navigation and spatial memory. As a collaborator and
a co-sponsor, respectively, Saul Villeda, PhD and Tony Wyss-Coray, PhD will contribute expertise leveraging
large-scale molecular datasets to generate insights about brain aging. Their collective support and Stanford's
rigorous training environment will ensure this project's completion and my development into an innovative
physician scientist empowered to develop therapies that ameliorate brain aging and neurodegeneration."
10893590,"ABSTRACT
 Liver failure is a major cause of death worldwide. Hepatic mitochondrial depolarization (mtDepo) is one of
the earliest responses to ethanol and likely is the first in a chain of events leading to subsequent liver disease.
Initially, mtDepo in response to ethanol facilitates more rapid two-step oxidation of ethanol and its toxic metabolite
acetaldehyde (AcAld) to acetate. I hypothesize that mtDepo underlies a swift increase in alcohol
metabolism (SIAM) after acute ethanol administration that is an adaptive response to eliminate ethanol
more rapidly. Chronically, the response becomes maladaptive leading to disordered mitophagy and hepatic
inflammation and fibrosis. Furthermore, I hypothesize that mtDepo after EtOH is brought about via mitochondrial
uncoupling due to proton leaks through either the adenosine nucleotide translocator (ANT1/2), the mitochondrial
F1FO-ATP synthase, uncoupling proteins (UCPs) or mitochondrial permeability transition (PT) pores. Since
mtDepo leads to elimination of mitochondria by mitophagy, I also hypothesize that recovery from mtDepo
after ethanol involves mitochondrial biogenesis. In two Specific Aims, I will: 1) Characterize hepatocyte
mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in relation to mitochondrial depolarization and
repolarization after acute ethanol. I will assess time-dependent changes in OCR and mitochondrial membrane
potential (ΔΨ) of hepatocytes freshly isolated from ethanol-treated and untreated mice using Seahorse
extracellular flux analysis, Hansatech oximetry, and confocal microscopy of fluorescent ΔΨ indicators. By
injecting in vivo prior to hepatocyte isolation MitoTracker dyes, fluorophores that label only polarized
mitochondria, I will identify hepatocytes having undergone mtDepo in vivo in relation to mtDepo and
repolarization in vitro. To address my mechanistic hypotheses, I will assess how specific inhibitors of ANT, ATP
synthase, UCPs, and PT pores reverse/prevent ethanol-induced mtDepo and increased OCR. 2) Assess the
role of mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy in recovery from mtDepo after acute ethanol. As mice
metabolically eliminate ethanol, hepatocytes recover from mtDepo. In Mitotimer mice, newly synthesized DsRed-
E5 fluoresces green but over time (12-24 h) shifts irreversibly to red fluorescence. If repolarization of preexisting
mitochondria occurs after ethanol, then Mitotimer fluorescence should be predominantly red in mitochondria
recovering from mtDepo. If repolarization results from mitochondrial biogenesis, then recovering mitochondria
will fluoresce green. I expect that repolarization of preexisting mitochondria and biogenesis of new mitochondria
will both contribute to recovery from mtDepo after acute ethanol. Together, Aims 1 and 2 will characterize key
mechanisms in the hepatic mitochondrial response to ethanol, as well as identify the basis for recovery. This
fundamental knowledge could lead to development of new therapeutics to treat and prevent alcoholic liver
disease."

NAD+ is biosynthesized mainly through the salvage pathway and is central for cellular homeostasis and energy
production. Deficiency of NAD+ results in disruption of cellular functions, leading to decreased ability to
regenerate and repair. In heart failure (HF), the heart undergoes metabolic disruption leading to redox imbalance
with increased NADH/NAD+ ratio. Therefore, we hypothesized that “Activating NAD+ plays a central role in
attenuating Heart failure.” Current therapeutics manage the disease symptoms, however, do not address the
core issues of HF. Based on our innovation with US patents and new preliminary data, Nampt activator P7C3 is
a prototype for generation of new pharmacological class of small molecules for cardioprotection. Using medicinal
chemistry, 3D-SAR, cell permeability and drug design approaches we will activate NAD+ by P7C3-based novel
small molecules for attenuating HF. A combination and tiered approach will be utilized for evaluating and
narrowing down the new compound pipeline using in vitro models, followed with efficacy studies. Initial screening
through in vitro assay will identify the molecules that are of high affinity and activity. Subsequently, 8-9 new small
molecules will be tested using ex vivo Langendorff system for evaluating the cardiac changes, and NAD+
generation capacity. Finally, 1-2 lead small molecule(s) will be tested using in vivo system with preclinical model
of HF using isoproterenol infusion, alternate HF models include db/db and MI to evaluate the pharmacological
specificity by using a combination of cardiac-specific Nampt KO and wildtype (C57Bl/6J) mice for demonstrating
the increased function with NAD+ activation in HF. The milestone-based approach for R61 phase will be utilized
for medicinal chemistry, including design and synthesis of new small molecules, in vitro Nampt activity, cell
permeability and toxicity, and assessment of therapeutic candidate's ex vivo. Whereas, in the R33 phase, we
will perform pre-clinical assessment and pharmacological evaluation of 1-2 lead small molecule(s) in vivo. The
proposal provides a systematic plan for continuous assessment and refinement of project management to
develop P7C3-based small molecules for testing and refinement to achieve the milestones in a timely manner.
The University of South Florida is a top producer of patents and is highly supportive with cost matching during
R33 phase. In addition, the USF hosts incubator companies which along with pharmaceutical research
companies in Tampa Bay area have shown interest and support for this project. The PI is an expert and well
known in the region with pharmaceutical incubator companies and has received Florida High Tech Corridor
matching awards and therefore anticipate developing the lead compounds for commercialization through the
next stage of development. Overall, the successful completion of the project will allow new product development
with rigorous and robust evaluation along with project management of novel small molecules for therapeutic
development and discovery of innovative new class of “NAD+ activators” for translational development."
10893436,"Adolescent and young adults (AYA) with cancer and survivors have psychosocial needs that are distinct from
older adults, with reproductive health being a chief concern. Reproductive health for AYA patients with cancer
and survivors includes potential infertility and need for fertility preservation counseling as well as other
interrelated components such as romantic partnering, body image, sexuality, sexual identity and orientation,
contraception, and psychosexual adjustment that vary in intensity of concern based on whether the AYA is in
treatment or in survivorship. While oncologist physicians primarily treat the disease, allied health professionals
(AHPs) involved in the care of AYA including, but not limited to, nurses, social workers, psychologists, and
physician assistants often provide psychosocial care, health education, and information related to reproductive
health that can impact AYA patients' and survivors decision-making and quality of life. AHPs need
communication skills on these issues and resources to identify and facilitate referrals for additional services.
Further, we have identified new ethical issues that our trainees encounter such as the challenges of discussing
fertility with patients with a poor prognosis, lack of concordance on fertility preservation between minors and
parents or between adult partners, and the growing use of posthumous assisted reproduction.
 Our previous R25 programs ENRICH (Educating Nurses in Reproductive Health Issues in Cancer Health)
and ECHO (Enriching Communication skills for Health professionals in Oncofertility) has proven successful in
training and skill building for AHPS with 712 learners to date. ECHO is a proven, evidenced-based program
demonstrating short and intermediate term impacts on knowledge, perceived confidence, and communication
skills. In the proposed renewal application, we seek to expand and extend ECHO in key curricula areas and
develop a new cohort of “train the trainers” from our previous ENRICH and ECHO trainees in a new program
entitled TORCH (Trainers in Oncofertility Reproductive Communication and Health). ECHO will continue to
provide reproductive health communication skills training with expanded curricula in two areas: Sexual and
Gender Minorities and Bioethics. TORCH will train prior learners to educate others in the practice setting on the
principles of ECHO. Our approaches capitalize on advanced web-based learning technologies we have already
developed to facilitate increased interactive learning and skill building. The (ECHO-TORCH) program aims are
to: Train AHPs over the 5 year period of the ECHO training Program; Refine and implement the ECHO program
to facilitate knowledge about and skills to address reproductive health needs of AYA oncology patients via a
web-based learning community; Evaluate the impact of the ECHO and TORCH program at the participant and
workplace level (e.g., policies, referrals, numbers trained);. Develop a network of AHPs trainers who disseminate
ECHO content"
10893437,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a significant public health problem, yet treatments demonstrate only modest
efficacy, likely due to the the profound phenotypic heterogeneity of AUD. In order to improve the efficacy of AUD
treatments, it is imperative to better characterize this heterogeneity which may, in turn, elucidate clearer
treatment targets for precision medicine approaches. This likely requires shifting conceptualizations of AUD away
from clinical description and towards etiologic mechanisms, an approach embodied by the goals of some modern
conceputalizations of AUD, such as the Addiction Research Domain Criteria (AARDoC) and Addictions
Neuroclinical Assessment (ANA). However, current research suggests that AARDoC and ANA suffer from
important shortcomings, including limited clinical efficiency, and may therefore benefit from further development,
refinement, and validation. To address these shortcomings, the proposed project aims to (a) empirically test the
models articulated by modern conceptual AUD etiological frameworks, including the ANA, and (b) derive a
mechanism-based computerized adaptive test (CAT) assessment of AUD developed using principles of objective
test construction and community-based participatory research strategies. First, a candidate set of self-report
items indexing 13 etiologic domains articulated by the Etiologic, Theory-Based, Ontogenetic Hierarchical (ETOH)
framework of AUD mechanisms, which serves as a recent extension of AARDoC/ANA, will be derived from the
literature and two rounds of cognitive interviews will be used to refine the item set among a diverse group of
participants (N = 50) with hazardous or harmful alcohol use. Next, items will be administered to a combined
community and clinical sample (N = 1,200) to empirically test the structure of items and determine the best-fitting
model. Item response theory will then be used to calibrate the items for the purpose of building a CAT for each
of the domains identified (e.g., reward, cognitive control, negative emotionality). Using the refined and calibrated
item set and domain-specific CATs, data will be collected from an additional independent sample of heavy
drinkers (N = 100). Ecological momentary assessment over 14 days and a follow-up assessment will also be
conducted with the goal of evaluating the psychometric properties of the CATs in ecologically valid contexts and
over time. Specifically, to determine if the domain-specific CATs demonstrate validity (e.g., convergent,
discriminant, predictive) and reliability (e.g., test-retest) across diverse patient populations and sex/gender
groups. All research aims will be conducted alongside and in consultation with individuals with lived experience
of AUD to ensure the measure is acceptable, feasible, and adequately contextualized. This project is consistent
with NIAAA's Strategic Plan, specifically Goal 1 (Identify mechanisms of alcohol-related pathology) and Goal 2
(Improve diagnosis and tracking of AUD). The resulting measure also has the potential to support progress
towards Goal 4 (Develop and improve treatments for AUD) by facilitating the assessment of mechanisms that
may serve as viable targets in AUD treatments, including behavioral and pharmacological interventions."

Heart failure (HF) is the leading cause of hospitalization in adults aged 65 and older. More than 3 million
hospitalizations occur each year in older adults with HF and recurrent hospitalizations after discharge are
common, costly, and often preventable. For more than a decade, 30-day hospital readmissions have received
considerable attention as an actionable target to improve quality of care and reduce costs in the older-adult
(Medicare) population. Despite these investments, high rates of (re)hospitalization continue to put enormous
strain on the U.S. healthcare system and on those suffering from the disease. We argue that these strategies
have been largely ineffective because they focus on a single snapshot of a patient’s risk of hospitalization (30-
day readmission) and do not consider the majority of hospitalizations that occur over the course of the illness.
Therefore, efforts to predict and ultimately lower hospital readmissions in older adults will continue to fall short
until the full progession of hospitalizations are recognized and addressed. In response to this urgent need, our
study will address three critically unanswered questions: What are the most common patterns of hospitalization
that occur in older adults diagnosed with HF? Who are the patients most likely to follow these patterns of
hospitalization? And what are the factors that can help prevent hospitalizations during the course of treatment?
Drawing from a life course perspective and using data from a nationally-representative longitudinal study of
older adults, Medicare claims, and electronic health records, our proposed aims are threefold: First, we will
classify the major trajectories of hospitalization that occur in older adults diagnosed with HF. This aim will
provide evidence of how the number and timing of hospitalizations vary among HF patients over the course of
their illness. Second, we will examine how a wide array of demographic, socioeconomic, psychosocial,
behavioral, health-, and hospital-related factors are associated with patterns of hospitalization in HF patients.
This aim will allow us to determine key patient characteristics that can be assessed at the time of diagnosis to
predict a person’s probability of having a given trajectory of admissions over the course of their illness. Third,
we will identify factors that may reduce hospitalizations during the course of HF treatment. Our final aim will
examine a similarly wide range of factors that may alter the course of a trajectory (i.e., timing and/or number) of
hospitalizations, particularly among patients who experience high numbers of hospitalizations and/or face
critical periods of risk. Bringing together a strong team of interdisciplinary investigators, the results from this
project will have enormous potential to inform the design, targeting, and timing of interventions that are most
likely to succeed in reducing the significant burden of hospitalizations in older adults."

10869947,"Epigenetic landscapes restrict the developmental potential of differentiated cells, but their deregulation allows
cancer cells to de-differentiate into transcriptionally heterogeneous cell states. This transcriptional heterogeneity
and phenotypic plasticity define many cancers, including melanoma, and are thought to be the root cause of
metastatic spread. Although this plasticity often correlates with cancer progression and poor prognosis in
patients, it is still unclear how epigenetic changes erode developmental constraints to allow cells to acquire a
spectrum of biological features as they interconvert between transcriptionally distinctive cell states.
 By analyzing the DNA methylation profiles of primary and metastatic cutaneous melanomas from human
patients we discovered an alternative promoter of the nuclear receptor NR2F2 becomes de-methylated in
metastatic melanomas. This epigenetic change allows NR2F2-isoform 2 – expressed in neural crest cells and
silenced when they differentiate into melanocytes – to become re-expressed. Preliminary functional studies
suggest NR2F2-isoform 2 expression is critical for metastasis but not primary melanoma growth and it affects
neural crest and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition associated gene sets. Based on these studies, we
hypothesize that de-repression of NR2F2-isoform 2 elicits transcriptional changes that influence the
phenotypic heterogeneity that defines melanoma cells, allowing a subset of these cells to disseminate
and metastasize to distant organs. To test this hypothesis, we propose to:
 • inhibit or promote NR2F2-isoform 2 promoter methylation in mouse and patient-derived melanoma models
 to measure changes in melanoma heterogeneity and metastatic potential;
 • identify transcriptional networks that are influenced by NR2F2-isoform 2 and its partners; and
 • correlate the expression of NR2F2-isoform 2, its transcriptional co-factors and targets in primary patient
 samples with their metastatic recurrence after primary melanoma resection.
Successful completion of this project promises to significantly impact both the melanoma and metastasis fields
because it will:
 • provide a conceptual framework for how epigenetic de-regulation of an alternative transcription factor isoform
 influences the de-differentiation of melanoma cells into phenotypically heterogeneous cell states;
 • identify the cell state responsible for metastatic progression in early-stage tumors; and
 • identify prognostic markers and therapeutic targets.
These will allow us to predict, prevent, or treat metastatic progression in early-stage melanoma patients, reducing
morbidity and mortality in patients with recurrent melanoma, while sparing tumor-free patients from toxic side
effects and cost of unnecessary interventions."

Project Summary/Abstract
Despite the benefits of combined antiretroviral treatment (ART) with dual activity against HIV
and HBV, the differences in outcome between HIV/HBV co-infected and HBV mono-infected
populations still persist. Our current understanding of the degree of immunological recovery
with therapy in these two groups, in particular in terms of hepatic immune responses is scarce,
identifying a significant knowledge gap and a barrier to the development of effective functional
cures. Recent technical advances, including the use of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-
seq) and high-throughput single cell analysis along with fine needle aspirates (FNAs) of the
liver from appropriately matched clinical cohorts provide new exciting opportunities to probe
hepatic versus peripheral immune signatures. These innovative approaches will be applied to
ascertain the transcriptional landscape, proteomic and functional features of immune cell
populations in the liver and peripheral blood between HIV/HBV co-infected versus HBV mono-
infected patients at an entirely new level of resolution. Particular emphasis will be placed on
Natural Killer (NK) cells with adaptive properties and unique subpopulations of NK cells with
‘memory’ features enriched in the liver. These specialised subpopulations that arise in
response to chronic viral infections and following vaccination with HIV-encoded envelope
protein and endowed with enhanced functionality hold tremendous potential for effective
control of virus replication. Therefore, clinical exploitation of adaptive NK cells represents a
transformative approach to augment therapy of chronic viral infection. We aim to develop a
robust and scalable platform for the expansion of adaptive NK cells with enhanced
functionality and predictable selectivity that could circumvent many of the limitations inherent
to the various immunotherapeutic approaches tested so far, representing a novel avenue for
new or complementary curative strategies."

Identifying novelty or familiarity of the environment is required for spatial navigation and influences forming and
maintaining internal spatial maps. This process of identifying an environment as novel or familiar and forming
the appropriate spatial map is impaired in aging rodents and in rodent models of Alzheimer’s disease and
temporal lobe epilepsy, possibly reflecting spatial processing deficits in patient populations. Recently identified
spatial novelty signals from the supramammillary area to the hippocampal dentate gyrus (SuM→DG) shape
spatial processing in the hippocampus; however, what signals influence SuM spatial novelty signals is
unknown.
This proposal investigates a novel hippocampal CA1 GABAergic projection to the SuM and its potential role in
signaling spatial recognition and suppressing SuM spatial novelty signals. I term these cells HIPS
(hippocampal inhibitory cells projecting to the supramammillary area), and my preliminary data indicates their
fibers are near SuM→DG neurons. This proposal tests the hypothesis that HIPS signal spatial recognition,
inhibit SuM→DG neurons, and influence spatial processing. I am proposing three aims to analyze the
functional connectivity, behavioral impact, and in vivo activity of HIPS. I will utilize slice electrophysiology
combined with optogenetic stimulation of HIPS to analyze HIPS connections to SuM→DG neurons and other
neurons of the SuM (Aim 1) to test if HIPS have functional, inhibitory connections to the SuM and to test if
HIPS preferentially inhibit SuM→DG neurons. To test HIPS impact on behavior and memory, I will apply in vivo
optogenetics to stimulate HIPS in behavioral tasks which vary spatial and non-spatial familiarity and novelty
(Aim 2). I will additionally use head-mounted miniature microscopes to perform in vivo calcium imaging of HIPS
in freely behaving mice to test if HIPS’ activity reflects spatial recognition (Aim 3).
This proposal provides insight into a novel hippocampal GABAergic projection and potential circuits involved in
spatial recognition. This work also gives me the excellent opportunity to train in analysis of cells, circuits, and
behavior using techniques which have all been successfully applied in the lab of my sponsor, Dr. Esther Krook-
Magnuson. My sponsor and co-sponsor, Dr. David Redish, will fully support me in the knowledge and technical
skills required for the proposal, and they are each committed to my development of professional skills needed
for an academic research career. Their support combined with the resources of the University of Minnesota

10870099,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A hallmark of adaptive immunity is mono-allelic expression (allelic exclusion) of B and T cell antigen receptor
proteins, which is thought to allow highly-specific immune responses and inhibit autoimmunity. Allelic exclusion
is achieved via mono-allelic initiation of RAG1/RAG2 (RAG) nuclease-mediated V gene segment recombination,
followed by protein from a V(D)J rearrangement signaling permanent feedback inhibition of V recombination on
the other allele. A shortcoming of this control is that it needs time for completion of recombination, expression
and signaling of protein, and changes on the second allele. The applicant demonstrated that RAG DNA double
strand breaks (DSBs) induced during Vk-to-Jk recombination in pre-B cells signal via the ATM kinase to inhibit
Rag1/Rag2 expression, Jk accessibility, and RAG cleavage of the other allele until after the first allele is repaired.
He showed that ATM deficiency in mice increases bi-allelic Igk IgH, or TCRb expression. While these data imply
that ATM enforces allelic exclusion by signaling DSB feedback inhibition of V recombination, they neither prove
this model nor rule out a role for ATM-stimulated DSB repair. The applicant shows new data that ATM enforces
Igk allelic exclusion by signaling via the NFkB essential modulator (NEMO) protein, with inhibition of Rag1/Rag2
transcription likely key for inter-allelic control of Vk recombination. The applicant shows that RAG DSBs during
IgH D-to-J recombination in pro-B cells or TCRb D-to-J, TCRg, and/or TCRd recombination in DN thymocytes do
not require ATM to repress Rag1/Rag2 expression. However, these RAG TCR DSBs signal via ATM to repress
expression of a Vb region anti-sense long non-coding RNA, which the applicant shows is expressed only in DN
cells where Vb and Db-Jb segments interact and rearrange over vast genomic distances. Based on these data,
the applicant hypothesizes that RAG DSBs feedback inhibit V(D)J recombination through complementary
mechanisms, including cell type-specific signaling pathways that repress Rag1/Rag2 transcription and antigen
receptor locus-specific alterations that suppress V rearrangements. He proposes two independent aims to test
fundamental aspects of his model. Aim 1 proposes to elucidate how RAG DSBs induced during different types
of rearrangements in different cell types signal repression of Rag1/Rag2 transcription to coordinate initiation of
V-to-(D)J recombination between alleles and thereby enforce allelic exclusion. Aim 2 proposes to determine the
role of V region anti-sense long non-coding RNAs in promoting long-range V-to-(D)J rearrangements and serving
as a DSB-responsive switch to transiently inhibit these rearrangements and thereby orchestrate allelic exclusion.
The proposed work will employ powerful mouse models to rigorously elucidate mechanisms by which RAG DSBs
trigger transient feedback inhibition of V recombination to help enforce allelic exclusion. The project will provide
novel mechanistic insights into one understudied and one completely novel line of research in the field, the latter
relevant to the biology all cells. Beyond advancing understanding of a hallmark of adaptive immunity, the findings
could identify mechanisms important for suppressing autoimmunity and/or lymphoid malignancies."

Genetic differences in cholesterol metabolism are major contributors to the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD),
which is the leading cause of death in the USA. Unraveling the genetics of cholesterol has continued to yield
promising therapeutics for heart disease. Nonetheless, the genetics of cholesterol levels are far from completely
understood-- there are dozens to hundreds of genomic regions whose variation meaningfully alters cholesterol
levels in the population, yet we can only explain the genetic basis of a small fraction of these loci. We have
established a powerful approach combining CRISPR screening, gene network analysis, and human biobank
coding variant burden analysis to dissect the genetics of cholesterol uptake and efflux. Through this pipeline, we
have identified dozens of new genes that contribute to LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) uptake in cellular models and
for which coding variants alter serum LDL-C levels in the population. In this proposal, we will refine and extend
this pipeline to develop a coherent understanding of the variants, genes, and pathways underlying cholesterol
uptake and efflux.
In Aim 1, we pioneer a novel pipeline combining CRISPR screening, gene network analysis, and human biobank
burden analysis to characterize ~500 genes we have found to alter cellular LDL-C uptake. We will develop a
sensitive approach to extract the effects of rare coding variants on serum LDL-C levels using large exome
sequencing biobank cohorts. We will group LDL-C uptake-altering genes into pathways through a combination
of CRISPR screening and gene network analysis. We will perform mechanistic follow-up of novel candidate LDL-
C-altering pathways in cellular and mouse in vivo models. In Aim 2, we will pioneer a new, more sensitive
approach to CRISPR base editing screens to identify GWAS-associated variants that alter LDL-C uptake in liver
cells. We will then use a suite of computational and experimental tools we have developed dissect the cis-
regulatory mechanisms by which these variants act and connect them to trans-regulatory inputs controlling them.
We expect to connect transcriptional drivers of hepatocyte LDL-C uptake with their cis-regulatory GWAS-
associated variant targets and downstream LDL-C uptake-altering genes, shedding light on how human genetic
variation influences serum LDL-C level. In Aim 3, we will use the pipeline of CRISPR-Cas9 screening and human
biobank analysis to identify genes and pathways associated with monocyte/macrophage reverse cholesterol
transport, a process thought to be important in CAD risk but which is incompletely understood at the genetic
level. We will dissect disease-relevant genetic mechanisms involved in reverse cholesterol transport, helping to
define the role of macrophage efflux in CAD risk.
In sum, through high-throughput CRISPR screening followed by mechanistic follow-up, we will provide the most
extensive experimental and computational analyses to date of the non-coding loci, genes, and pathways that

Female cigarette smokers have been shown to be more sensitive than males to non-nicotine sensory cues,
which may explain lower rates of smoking cessation and lowered response to nicotine replacement therapies
among females. Additionally, evidence suggests females have higher use of non-tobacco e-cigarette flavors
and value flavor availability. This proposal seeks to elucidate how sex may influence the sensory perception of
the popular e-cigarette flavor components, sweetness and cooling, and how this impacts appeal and
reinforcing efficacy. We plan to examine sensory perception, appeal, reinforcing efficacy of three e-cigarette
flavors (sweet flavor, cooling flavor, and unflavored) in an e-cigarette with moderate nicotine concentration
when presented alone (Aim 1) and concurrently (Aim 2). We hypothesize that compared to an unflavored e-
cigarette liquid, sweet and cooling flavor components will be generally rated as more appealing and reinforcing
among both males and females, but females will have more pronounced differences in appeal and reinforcing
efficacy of sweet and cooling flavors compared to the unflavored e-liquid (Aim 1). Additionally, we hypothesize
that females compared to males will work harder and demonstrate greater abuse liability for flavored e-liquids
in nicotine containing e-cigarettes when concurrently available with unflavored e-liquids in nicotine containing
e-cigarettes (Aim 2). The outcomes of this project will provide new information about how the difference in
response by sex to the non-nicotine sensory cues of flavor inform e-cigarette use and behavior. Regulatory
efforts to restrict popular flavor components, like sweet and/or cooling flavors in e-cigarettes may have
potentially a greater impact on female cigarette smokers than males on use of e-cigarettes as a potential harm
reduction tool.
Through expert mentoring, directed readings, formal coursework and seminars, direct experimental training,
attendance at scientific meetings, manuscript and grant preparation, expertise to conduct the proposed
research will be gained in the following areas: (1) chemosensory psychophysics as it relates to tobacco
regulatory science, (2) sex-related research as it relates to tobacco regulatory science, and (3) advanced
statistical training aimed at developing data analysis techniques to investigate sex differences & flavored
tobacco product use. Taken together, this research project and training plan will provide an important
framework for career development in tobacco regulatory science."

PIK3CA is the most frequently mutated oncogene in human cancer. PI3Kα inhibitors are a new standard of
care in PIK3CA mutant ER+ metastatic breast cancer (ER+ MBC) and some patients have durable responses.
In this proposal, I capitalize on our recent discovery of a novel mechanism of oncogene activation by double
PIK3CA mutations. We have demonstrated that double PIK3CA mutations are frequent across all PIK3CA
mutant cancers, occur at recurrent amino acid positions, and are in cis on the same allele. Double mutations
activate PI3K signaling and growth more than single hotspot mutations in vitro and in vivo, and biochemically
activate PI3K through disruption of p85 inhibition and increased membrane binding. Double mutations increase
sensitivity to PI3Kα inhibition in cells and in PIK3CA mutant ER+ MBC patients. Our work has uncovered a
hierarchical model for the activation and inhibition of PI3K based on mutation number (Vasan, et al. Science
2019). I will test the hypotheses that this hierarchical model extends to PI3K regulation, crosstalk with the
estrogen receptor, and activation of novel AKT substrates. I will use recombinant double mutant PI3K
complexes reconstituted with Ras and RTK to dissect the mechanisms of regulation (Aim 1.1) and the
mechanisms of cellular generation of PIP3 (Aim 1.2). I will leverage knockin and overexpression cellular
models to measure activation and inhibition of double mutant ER+ breast cancer (Aim 2.1) and modulation of
ER-dependent transcription (Aim 2.2). These experiments will be performed in vitro, in vivo, in patient
samples, and under PI3K inhibitor treatment. I will utilize unbiased phosphoproteomics on double mutant cells
to credential new AKT protein kinase substrates (Aim 3.1) including the KMT family of histone lysine
methyltransferases (Aim 3.2). Together these aims will validate our hierarchical model of oncogene activation
by double PIK3CA mutants across a wide variety of cellular and biological processes and will lead to new
strategies to inhibit PI3K including testing PI3Kα inhibitors in multiple PIK3CA mutant patients. I am an
Assistant Attending with the Breast Medicine Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC),

10895552,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposed study is motivated by the public health importance of aortic stenosis (AS), a common form of
valvular heart disease that is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Once symptomatic, survival is
a dismal 50% at 1-year if left untreated. Clinical symptoms develop once cardiac compensatory mechanisms
fail, indicating the need for aortic valve replacement (AVR), but because AS primarily affects the elderly,
symptoms are often incorrectly attributed to comorbid conditions, advanced age, or both—resulting in delayed
treatment. While most patients that eventually undergo AVR experience improvements in symptoms and
survival, nearly half of patients die within the first year after AVR or fail to reap the symptom and health status
improvements for which they underwent AVR. Our research suggests that irreversible cardiac remodeling and
injury related to delayed treatment contribute to these poor clinical outcomes, highlighting the unmet need for
objective and sensitive measures to inform clinical decisions regarding the timing of AVR. Our long-term goal is
to develop and implement an omics-based precision medicine approach for identifying patients with severe AS
at-risk for irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury who would benefit from earlier AVR, and our central
hypothesis is that multi-omic signatures reflective of dimensions of cardiac structure and function will identify
irreversible cardiac remodeling and therefore predict the clinical response to AVR. Our prior work and
preliminary studies provide strong support for our hypothesis and demonstrate that our experienced
multidisciplinary team is uniquely qualified to complete the proposed study. We have identified metabolomic
signatures that relate strongly to measures of cardiac function and structure and predict mortality after AVR,
and also proteomic signatures relating to cardiac function that differentiate severe AS and associate with
mortality. Within this proposal, we adopt a longitudinal systems biology approach that leverages the latest in
proteomic and metabolomic (multi-omic) sciences to: discover, test, and cross-validate multi-omic signatures of
cardiac function and structure in patients with severe AS (Aim 1); characterize longitudinal multi-omic
signatures and associations with changes in cardiac structure and function after AVR (Aim 2); and evaluate the
accuracy with which multi-omic signatures predict response to AVR (Aim 3). Our approach will enable us to
identify multi-omic signatures of irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury in patients with severe AS. These
data will support the development of new precision medicine-based strategies for identifying patients who
would benefit from earlier clinical intervention in an effort to reduce mortality and maximize health after AVR."
10895555,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Persons with advanced Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias present unique challenges for the
healthcare system; they typically have complex chronic illness trajectories that encompass both cognitive and
functional impairments. They are also subject to inadequate symptom control. Caring for a patient at home with
dementia poses particular challenges for family caregivers who may suffer depression, increased caregiver
burden, and may ultimately be dissatisfied with the care their loved ones receive. Palliative care, which is not
the same thing as hospice or end-of-life care, is suited to meet the needs of these patients and their
caregivers. “Palliative Care at Home for Patients with Dementia” (PCAH) will be a four-hospital, single-blinded,
randomized-controlled, clinical trial of an innovative model of home-based palliative care for older adults with
dementia and their caregivers. Intervention patients will be cared for by a pyramid of palliative care focused
providers, the core of which comprises specially trained community health workers (CHW), social workers
(SW), and registered nurses (RN). These providers are supported by a palliative care advanced practice nurse
(APN) and physician (MD). This innovative model is more generalizable than traditional palliative care teams,
which are centered on the scarce and expensive resources of specialty-trained MDs or APNs. Our model is
unique in combining traditional medical (MD, APN, RN) and psychosocial/community-focused providers (CHW,
SW) to provide specialized care within a palliative care context, strengthen connections to resources in
patients’ local environment, and is highly responsive to the cultural context in which the patient/caregiver dyad
make their decisions about healthcare. Intervention patients will receive regular and comprehensive
assessments by the community health worker, nurse, and social worker. Together, the team will use these
assessments to create comprehensive, individualized, care plans to address patients’ physical, psychosocial
and functional needs; caregivers’ needs; improve understanding around illness, medications, and goals of
care; and help coordinate services. The PCAH team will continue to work with the patient / caregiver though
face-to-face visits (in person or via video) and (at least) weekly phone calls for 12 months. We will enroll and
randomize 150 dyads of patients with advanced dementia and their caregivers (total 300 subjects) to receive
either the intervention or an augmented control (visits to the caregiver from a CHW without training in dementia
or palliative care). Patients with advanced dementia (defined as a global deterioration scale >6) with recent ED
or hospital visits and poor functional status will be eligible for enrollment. We will determine if the intervention:
improves symptom control in persons with dementia; decreases hospital admissions and patient days in the
hospital; and decreases caregiver burden and depression while improving caregiver satisfaction with care. In
exploratory analyses we will determine if the intervention decreases costs. Our model has the potential to
improve care for thousands of Americans with dementia and their caregivers."

Adaptive behaviors emerge from neuronal networks by dynamically regulating functional connectomes. Based
on an underlying anatomical connectome, a functional connectome is the configuration of effective synaptic
connections that underlies a pattern of neuronal activity during a specific behavior. Unique combinations of
neurons activate specific functional connectomes, thereby generating a behavior (a combinatoric code). By
combining neural network and biomechanical modeling, intracellular recording, and newly developed large-scale
recording techniques, we will analyze functional connectomes and their combinatoric control of behavior, and
how local plasticity and global dynamics mediate feeding behavior, which is controlled by a small brain system.
The research will be performed by a multidisciplinary team consisting of Drs. J. Byrne (U. Texas, Houston), C.
Chestek (U. Michigan, Ann Arbor), H. Chiel (CWRU), E. Cropper (Mt. Sinai), A. Susswein (Bar Ilan U.), P.
Thomas (CWRU) and K. Weiss (Mt. Sinai). The project will: 1) develop a predictive neuromechanical model that
incorporates a biomechanical model of the feeding musculature with a computational model of the feeding neural
circuitry; 2) use large-scale and intracellular recording techniques to analyze the functional connectome and
combinatoric control for choices among different feeding behaviors in response to sensory stimuli; and 3) use
these recording techniques to analyze the ways in which the functional connectome and its combinatoric control
are reconfigured by modulatory factors, motivation, and learning. We also will examine the ways in which arousal
and satiation change the bias of the functional connectome and thus alter behavior, and the ways in which learning
may add or remove elements of the functional connectome as an animal modifies behavior to respond to changes
in the environment. The results will provide insights into how processes at multiple levels of neural organization
contribute to regulation of behavior. Such studies in a small brain model system will provide insights that will help
guide future investigations in more complex systems, such as vertebrates and humans."

Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease with a five-year survival rate below 10%. One of the main factors
underscoring this low survival rate is the lack of effective clinical treatments. Like most cancers, metabolic
processes in pancreatic cancer cells are altered to facilitate macromolecular biosynthesis and protect against
intra and extracellular stressors. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a byproduct of metabolism and represent
a notable metabolic stress to pancreatic cancer cells. Previously, we described a new metabolic pathway in
pancreatic cancer, mediated by cytosolic glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 1 (GOT1), that is used to
manage ROS by facilitating the coordination of cytosolic and mitochondrial metabolism and maintaining
glutathione (GSH) pools.
Ferroptosis is a recently described form of iron-dependent, non-apoptotic cell death caused by lipid
peroxidation and mediated by loss of GSH pools. We found that GOT1 inhibition potentiated the activity of
known ferroptotic agents. Further, we also discovered that GOT1 inhibition can engage ferroptosis when nodes
in cysteine metabolism are inhibited. In this research proposal, we will determine how GOT1 inhibition
promotes ferroptosis. Mechanistic insight from these studies will then be used to selectively target pancreatic
cancers for ferroptotic cell death. This will be accomplished using metabolomics techniques in combination
with genetic and pharmacological inhibitors of metabolism. In parallel, we will test combinations of ferroptotic
agents with GOT1 inhibition in human patient-derived 3D culture models and in orthotopic mouse models to
determine the translation value. Given the safety profile of GOT1 and some ferroptosis-inducers, the profound
sensitivity of this combination in pancreatic cancer cells, and the desperate need for new strategies to treat
pancreatic cancer, there is now a critical need to understand mechanistically what confers sensitivity to these
combinations. Such insights may provide strategies to promote redox imbalance in pancreatic cancer, paving
the way for tumor-selective, ferroptosis-based therapies."

One of the greatest added values of the HU CFAR has been facilitated member access to new and emerging
technologies. Science is accelerated by changes in technology, and the evolution of flow cytometric, imaging
and genomic techniques continues at a rapid pace. However, access to such technologies and associated
computational methodologies is an ever increasing and challenging barrier to individual investigators.
Acquisition and optimization of instrumentation and softwares and making them accessible remains the
primary focus of the HU CFAR Advanced Lab Technologies Core (ALTC). Making these cutting-edge
technologies available to HU CFAR users adds critically needed value to their studies of HIV reservoir and
cure, virus-host interactions, therapeutic interventions, and vaccine development. The consolidated ALTC

The ALTC also continues to focus on providing critical individualized technical support to Early Career
Investigators (ECIs), including 20 Developmental and Mentoring Core awardees. At the current time, much of
the identified need for members is in the capture of information regarding the phenotypic and functional state of
individual cells, indexing these samples, and then capitalizing on this precious biomaterial to develop a
comprehensive picture of the genomic landscape that exists in particular disease states. To ensure that all
Harvard CFAR laboratories have access to this remarkable analytical power, this core will facilitate access to

10896971,"Project summary: In the US, aging related diseases and health disparities are frequently observed; the
differences in disease incidence and outcomes are thought to reflect the interplay of socioeconomic factors,
access to health care, culture, diet, the environment, and population-specific genetics/biology. To address this
issue, educational and socio-behavioral changes are needed. These changes can be facilitated by diversifying
the aging related research and educational workforce. Moreover, the rapid growth and accumulation of
specialized knowledge in today’s biomedical fields, combined with health issues that persist among certain
groups within the US population, emphasize the need to diversify this workforce. Based on national statistics,
the numbers of PhD graduates from underrepresented backgrounds are low and have not changed appreciably
over three decades, despite efforts from various funding agencies, including the NIH. Several national reports
point out factors that challenge underrepresented students in graduate and biomedical programs in achieving
terminal degrees. Therefore, we propose to build an Alabama State University (ASU)-Auburn University
(AU) R25 Partnership to provide aging focused educational modules and to expose underserved
students to a summer research experience, thereby accelerating the development of scientists/health
care providers from underserved backgrounds. By leveraging the educational and research infrastructure of
the AU (Auburn, AL) and educational programs of Historically Black College and University (HBCU)-minority-
serving ASU (Montgomery, AL), we have developed a persistent, multi-faceted strategy, combining
multidisciplinary and inter-institutional education and basic aging related research projects, to train
undergraduate students from underrepresented communities. The proposed aging education and research
experience will be available to rising juniors and rising seniors majoring in biomedical disciplines. As part of this
R25 program, introductory aging related educational modules (online module development) and basic research
training will be offered to selected students at ASU during academic year while aging research experiences will
be provided at the AU. Each year, the program will support 10 students (recruited from ASU). During academic
year with continuous and consistent engagement, the selected students at ASU will participate in enrichment
activities, including education; mentoring (research and pre-professional); scientific writing seminars; technical,
bioethics, and scientific workshops; and training for presentations. During summer, these students will perform
aging related research at AU for 10 weeks. Each year, all students will make presentations during either a reginal
or national Scientific Symposium. In summary, this proposed program at ASU and AU will train students from
underrepresented communities and advance the national goal of increasing diversity in the US biomedical
sciences workforce, particularly in aging research."

disease remain largely undetermined. Our preliminary results in mice infected by chimeric HIV, EcoHIV, show
that CBD has both anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive functions in the brain; strikingly the canonical
innate antiviral effector, interferon (IFN)-, was reduced in brains of infected CBD treated mice. Directly
relevant to this RFA, we show that CBD increases HIV expression in mouse brain up to 10-fold. Moreover,
despite anti-inflammatory effects of CBD alone, the drug failed to mitigate HIV mediated inflammatory gene
expression. These results suggest that CBD use can increase HIV expression in PLWH and thereby
exacerbate HIV-related diseases including NCI. We hypothesize that increased HIV brain infection by CBD
results from its impairment of antiviral immunity including IFN functions. The Specific Aims are to: 1)
Optimize CBD mediated increase in EcoHIV brain infection and assay its consequences in mouse behavioral
tests including responses in the presence of antiretroviral drugs and during chronic infection, tests of CB
receptor participation using knockout mice, and pilot HIV burden/ expression studies from brains of deceased

infected mice, QPCR for measurement of virus burden in tissues, behavioral tests of learning, isolation and
functional evaluation of mononuclear cells from the brain, brain cell lineage specific RNA seq, mechanistic
studies of CBD effects upon IFN signaling pathways and epigenetic changes determining IFN responsive gene

10896978,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Osteoarthritis of the knee is one of the most common causes of chronic pain in the US, and a common reason
that patients take long-term opioids for pain. Total knee arthroplasty is often used to treat advanced knee
osteoarthritis, with nearly a million patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty in the US each year. Many
patients who undergo total knee arthroplasty are taking opioids preoperatively. However, preoperative opioid
use is associated with worse postoperative pain, higher complication rates, and higher postoperative opioid
use. Even low dose opioids can induce dependence and hyperalgesia, so postoperative pain can be harder to
control in patients who have been taking chronic opioids, which can then lead to more difficult rehabilitation
after surgery. Tapering opioids preoperatively holds potential to improve outcomes in total knee arthroplasty by
counteracting these negative effects of opioids. However, the existing literature on preoperative opioid taper is
limited. Several small retrospective studies have suggested a benefit, but detailed preoperative taper protocols
have not been published, and high quality prospective studies have not been conducted. This proposal looks to
advance the field of preoperative opioid tapering. Aim 1 will develop and refine a preoperative opioid taper
protocol for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Aim 2 will assess the feasibility of preoperative opioid
taper intervention in a pilot randomized trial. At the completion of the pilot trial in Aim 2, the intervention will be
ready to be tested for efficacy in a multicenter randomized control trial as the next step in this research. The
overall goal of this 4-year Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) proposal is
to support Kevin Riggs, MD, MPH to become an independent investigator in the field of improving arthroplasty
outcomes, with a focus on pain and opioid use. This award will provide comprehensive mentoring, training, and
research experience to facilitate Dr. Riggs’s progression toward becoming an independent investigator.
Specifically, Dr. Riggs will gain expertise in developing interventions, clinical trial design, and evaluation of
functional status and other patient-reported outcome measures. This will position Dr. Riggs to become a leader
in improving surgical outcomes for patients undergoing arthroplasty."

de novo transcription. This remarkable feat has given my lab a unique vantage from which to study post-
transcriptional regulation. Surprisingly, we found that many mRNA transcripts which exhibit cell-specific
patterning also localize to discrete subcellular structures such as biomolecular condensates or membranes. My
lab aims to understand how subcellular mRNA patterning arises mechanistically, how it functionally
links to protein production, and how it impacts development. Recent advances have identified 190,000
localized mRNA transcripts found at 44 subcellular locales across 65 species (RNALocate Database). These
transcripts include many that impact human neurobiology and whose mislocalization is associated with
disease. Many more represent mRNAs that accumulate at cellular regions through unknown mechanisms and
for undefined purposes, underscoring the potential for new discoveries that we aim to make.
 In the first funding phase, my group determined mechanisms that localize mRNAs to P granules
(cytoplasmic condensates important for germline development and fertility). Transcripts that associate with P
granules undergo either temporary sequestration or permanent decay. In the next phase, we will address
the signals, mechanisms, and dynamics that distinguish P granule-associated mRNA sequestration
from decay. Specifically, we will differentiate between competing models explaining how the conserved
transcript nos-2 (nanos) exits P granules and initiates its translation to ensure fertility.
 Previously, we identified several mRNA transcripts that localize to membranes along with the proteins
they encode, a finding echoed in other organisms. Among these were erm-1 a member of a conserved family
of cytoskeletal membrane linker proteins that impacts cell shape and cancer. We found that erm-1’s mRNA
localization is translation-dependent. Next, we will address the mechanisms and principles explaining
how and why complexes of translating erm-1 move to membranes. We will also use genomics to
characterize the membrane-enriched transcriptome to better understand localized translation at membranes.
 Maternal mRNA transcripts undergo decay in early embryos often creating cell-specific patterns that
direct cell differentiation. In the first funding cycle, we demonstrated a requirement for the RNA binding protein
SPN-4 in the clearance and cell-specificity of some transcripts. In the next phase, we will determine how
SPN-4 shapes the transcriptome and works in concert with other mechanisms of mRNA clearance.
 The sum of these projects will be to create an overarching research program aimed at
describing how mRNA transcripts organize spatially within the cell and how that organization can
impact gene expression and embryogenesis."

Health challenges linked to human aging take a tremendous toll on society. Physical and cognitive decline limit
the quality of life for the elderly and their caregivers. Aging is the major risk factor for, and possible cause of,
cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disease. Without question, the promotion of healthy aging with
extended resistance to decline and disease should be a major objective of current medical research.
Fortunately, tremendous progress has been made in the biology of aging field and the science is poised to be
translated into preclinical and clinical science.
Simple animals models such as the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have been at the heart of this success.
Many genes and chemical compound interventions that modulate aging processes are likely to act similarly in
humans. The goal of the proposed work is to continue, and expand, efforts of a co-operative scientific group
involving three closely interacting laboratories who coordinately test pharmacological interventions for their
ability to extend healthy aging and promote longevity in nematodes. A specific emphasis of this integrated
super-group is to test promising compound on a collection of natural variants of the Caenorhabditis genus,
which together represent the extensive genetic heterogeneity in the human population. The idea is that
treatments that confer positive outcomes across a diverse population will have an increased chance of being
effective in humans.
The emphasis of this specific proposal is the screening of test compounds for the capacity to promote longevity
and health across a genetically diverse test set. We will consider compounds via a public access portal, from
leads in the literature, and from high throughput chemical screens for longevity. Our labs will also develop and
test utility of engineered deletions of genes encoding fundamental executors of proteostasis, metabolism,
intercellular signaling and mitochondrial maintenance in diverse genetic backgrounds for compound evaluation.
By creating “at risk’ strains impaired in conserved hallmarks of aging, we might increase the dynamic range for
identifying anti-aging therapies. Finally, we will identify direct target mechanisms for the most effective
compounds aiding their translation. Overall, we will participate in a unique team project that has the power to
define pharmacological interventions that robustly promote strong healthspan across a varied population, with
implications for development of therapies that promote healthy human aging."

Alcohol- (ALD) and non-alcoholic fatty (NAFLD) liver disease are the two leading etiologies of liver disease,
accounting for more than 50% of liver-related mortality, and both rapidly rising in incidence. ALD and NAFLD
are histologically indistinguishable, but clinically stratified by distinct alcohol thresholds—yet, alcohol use and
metabolic risk often co-exist in individuals. Despite the frequent intersection of these risks, the longitudinal
effects of alcohol use and metabolic risk over time on liver disease progression are understudied. An improved
understanding of these interactions, particularly among different individual profiles (i.e. age, sex, race), can
inform personalized algorithms for fibrosis assessment and surveillance, and individualized thresholds for
alcohol use interventions. Investigation of novel biomarkers (e.g. proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9
[PCSK9]) may lead to precision-interventions to prevent and treat liver disease. To address these knowledge
gaps, we will leverage CARDIA (a large biracial cohort with 35 years of prospective alcohol and metabolic
data) amplified by serial Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) testing of previously banked serum samples. The
scientific aims are to: (i) identify trajectories and thresholds of alcohol use and obesity, associated with
presence and progression of liver fibrosis (Aim 1); (ii) develop sex- and race-specific models to identify
individuals at highest risk of liver disease, by demographic, metabolic, and alcohol profiles (Aim 1a); (iii) assess
the role of null PCSK9 alleles on liver fibrosis by demographic, metabolic, and alcohol profiles (Aim 2). The
training goals, which will be achieved through formal courses, workshops, didactics, hands-on experience and
structured mentorship, are to: (i) develop expertise in metabolic risks and inter-relatedness with alcohol; (ii)
learn advanced biostatistical methods in multi-level interactions and longitudinal analyses (e.g. trajectory and
JoinPoint); (iii) acquire knowledge in translational biomarkers and genetic epidemiology, focused on clinical
interventions. These scientific aims and training goals are made possible by a rich scientific environment at
University of Southern California, access to a unique prospective community-based cohort (CARDIA), and a
strong multidisciplinary mentorship team consisting of Dr. Terrault (chronic liver diseases, clinical and
translational studies, clinical trials expert), Dr. Mack (advanced biostatistics, genetic epidemiology, clinical trials
expert), and Dr. Leventhal (alcohol and addiction, longitudinal studies expert). All mentors have significant
experience with K to R-mentorship, and will ensure Dr. Lee’s achievement in milestones that will lead to his
position as a productive independent investigator. This research will set the stage for future NIH R-funded
studies focused on personalized approaches to the screening and prognostication within the ALD/NAFLD
intersection, leveraging expertise in observational (complex longitudinal biostatistics) and translational
(biomarkers, genetic epidemiology) research, in addition to a pilot clinical trial of anti-PCSK9 in ALD."
10897296,"Summary
 There is a gap in the knowledge about how chondrocytes lose their phenotype and matrix production
capacity during in vitro expansion. This gap in knowledge stems from the paucity of studies that directly
interrogate chondrocyte genome architecture and transcriptional profiles in single cells to capture the inherent
heterogeneity of cell differentiation. To fill this unmet gap, we will use state-of-the-art super-resolution imaging,
single cell RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq), high-throughput RNA-FISH (MERFISH) and metabolic labeling
(FUNCAT) technologies to relate, on a cell-by-cell level, the chromatin nano-structure, transcriptional output,
epigenetic modifications and matrix production capacity of single chondrocytes expanded in culture under
different epigenetic and chemo-physical cues. We will further develop machine learning models to predict
chondrocyte phenotype using super-resolution images of chondrocyte chromatin nano-structure. Our central
hypothesis is that there are distinct chromatin nano-structural arrangements and transcriptional signatures
associated with chondrocytes that have high matrix production capacity, and that chromatin nano-structure can
be manipulated in a predictive manner via the combination of epigenetic and chemo-physical cues to improve
chondrocyte therapeutic potential. The basis for this hypothesis is our preliminary super-resolution data of
chromatin nano-structure in in vitro expanded chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells grown on substrates
of varying stiffness and subjected to various chemical cues. The proposed work is significant as it will generate
new knowledge about how chromatin nano-structure and epigenetic landscape regulates matrix production
capacity of chondrocytes and how this capacity can be enhanced through manipulation of chromatin and
epigenetic states. Our Aims are:
matrix
 whether chromatin nano-structure and transcription are predictive of chondrocyte
production capacity
Aim 1: Determine
 Aim 2: Determine how chemo-physical and epigenetic cues impact transitions in chromatin nano-
structure and matrix production in chondrocytes
 Aim 3: Determine whether predicted cues improve chondrocyte therapeutic efficacy
In summary, we expect to contribute to the identification of new in vitro expansion conditions that maintain
naïve chondrocyte phenotype and enhance their therapeutic potential. The proposed research is innovative as
it represents a drastic departure from the status quo by applying multi-faceted, single-cell based imaging and
sequencing technologies to determine the relationship between chondrocyte chromatin and epigenetic state,
transcriptional activities, and matrix production. If successful, this work may change clinical practice by providing
improved cell populations for cartilage repair."

Background: South Africa is a unique, high-risk environment for the emergence of novel drug-resistant strains
of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Novel drug-resistant Mtb strains are often identified only after they have
achieved sustained transmission and dispersed into larger geographic areas away from their origin location.
Strategies for early detection of drug-resistant Mtb strains, at the critical juncture between outbreak and
epidemic, are lacking. Candidate: I am infectious disease physician and epidemiologist, with experience in
genomic epidemiology, mathematical modeling, and field-level public health research and health service
delivery. My research employs multiple data sources (including geolocated microbial genomic data and mobile
phone-associated movement data) to understand how epidemics emerge and spread. The overarching objective
of my work is to improve and innovate strategies for surveillance and containment of drug-resistant infections,
focused on malaria and tuberculosis. Training: I am seeking career development support to pursue my long-
term goal of becoming an independent NIH-funded physician scientist. To achieve my research and career goals,
I will pursue additional training in Bayesian statistics, spatial population genetics, network science, and research
management skills. Mentors and Environment: Dr. Caroline Buckee, a global leader in infectious disease
epidemiology and mobility-informed infectious disease modeling, will oversee my research and training activities
as primary mentor. Dr. Barun Mathema, a scientific expert in the tuberculosis genomic epidemiology and
tuberculosis transmission, will provide focused scientific support as my co-mentors. Key collaborators on this
project include Dr. Shaheed Vally Omar (surveillance for drug-resistant TB in South Africa), Dr. Ted Cohen
(mathematical modeling and epidemiology of tuberculosis), Dr. Sheetal Silal (agent-based modeling of infectious
disease dynamics), and Dr. Sarita Shah (TB surveillance and control). Dr. Marc Lipsitch, Dr. Yonatan Grad, Dr.
Louise Ivers, Dr. Neil Schluger, and Dr. Frank Tanser will form a Scientific Advisory Board, who will provide
annual feedback on my research and training activities. I will train and conduct research activities during the K08
award at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics.
Research: I will examine novel strategies for early detection of drug-resistant Mtb in South Africa through
research activities under three specific aims: (1) Using geolocated Mtb genomic data to estimate likely origin
locations and transmission hubs for multiple drug-resistant Mtb strains currently circulating in South Africa; (2)
Developing an individual-based computational model of Mtb transmission in South Africa incorporating human
mobility data and Mtb within-host evolution; (3) Evaluating multiple candidate surveillance strategies for early
detection and containment of novel drug-resistant strains of Mtb using individual-based modeling."
10897058,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Currently, no accurate prognostic model of posttraumatic stress following trauma exposure for emergency
department (ED) patients is available at the point-of-care without requiring clinical screening or diagnostic
interviews. The proposed research is based on the rationale that the 139 million annual ED visits provide a
critical window to proactively plan risk-based follow-up care at an early stage, where patients are still in contact
with the health care system. While clinical interviews are still the gold standard to screen for acute stress
symptoms following trauma exposure, their feasibility in clinical practice as routine screenings in the ED is
severely limited given the acute care priorities in the ED. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to
develop a prognostic model that is accurate, scalable, practical, and feasible with low additional burden on the
highly taxed ED procedures. The overall objective is to use advanced computational methods to extract
objective markers for posttraumatic stress from video and audio data to build a clinical readout at the point-of-
care that will enable ED clinicians to prognosticate the risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that voice and speech content, head movement, pupil dilation,
gaze, and facial landmark features of emotion provide probabilistic information that will allow us to identify
digital biomarkers for PTSD. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims directed at analyzing
digital biomarkers to predict 1) who is at risk to develop PTSD and 2) to combine digital biomarkers with
routinely available electronic health records to predict at the point of care who will develop PTSD one month
after ED discharge to plan follow-up specialty care and who is at risk for chronic PTSD. This proposed
prospective longitudinal study will chart PTSD symptoms in a cohort of 350 trauma survivors. The proposed
research is of high clinically significance. The prognostic model will facilitate risk-targeted early interventions
for curtailing delayed treatment, assist clinicians in prioritizing treatment allocation and reduce downstream
health care costs. This research project aims to deliver an objective, accurate, and reliable digital measure for
patients’ well-being. Such digital biomarkers will enable more efficient discharge planning and will promote
early prevention strategies. The mental besides the physical well-being of trauma-survivors admitted to the ED
after a life-threatening event is of high value and is the foundation of a well-functioning, high-quality emergency
care system. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, future disasters, or other large-scale emergencies underscore the
critical need to support highly charged EDs through computational methods to better determine risks of long-
term mental health care needs without disrupting the standard operating procedures of acute care."

Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable cancer of terminally differentiated plasma cells (PC),
characterized by abundant immunoglobulin (Ig) synthesis. Most PC are short lived and die only a few
days after differentiation through unclear molecular mechanisms. MM pathogenesis also remain elusive
with no single genetic driver mutation, but pervasive DNA damage. We have previously shown
increased cargo of polyubiquitinated (polyUb) proteins and decreased proteasome activity in
differentiating B lymphocytes and we hypothesized proteotoxicity as driver of PC death. By using
absolute mass spectrometry (AQUA) to quantify ubiquitin (Ub) in the same B cell differentiation model,
our preliminary data show that 60% free Ub depletion occurs in PC compared to resting B cells,
concomitantly with maximal Ig secretion and apoptosis. Second, we discovered that cells surviving long
term post differentiation can be identified and display markers of ongoing DNA damage. As Ub is
necessary for proper DNA damage response (DDR), polyUb protein degradation and DDR compete for
the same Ub pool. Based on our work, we propose a unifying model for short-lived PC death and MM
pathogenesis centered on critical Ub depletion. Our core hypothesis is that in PC, proteotoxic stress
secondary to sustained Ig synthesis, leads to free Ub depletion thus causing impaired DDR. Most PC
will be unable to recover from this crisis, however a small subset of genomically unstable PC may
survive, presumably due to accumulation of survival promoting mutations, constituting a premalignant
state for MM. We further hypothesize that Ub gene Ubc may be a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor
genes in B cell malignancies. Herein, the applicant, Dr. Giada Bianchi, presents a comprehensive plan
to test these hypotheses articulated in 2 specific aims: (1) to probe a causative link between Ig synthesis,
Ub depletion and apoptosis in PC; and (2) to evaluate whether Ub depletion is sufficient to cause
genomic instability in PC and drive MM pathogenesis. Data gathered during the course of our
investigation will provide novel data regarding the biology of normal and malignant PC and potentially
uncover a novel oncogenic mechanism - functional depletion of Ub - with applicability to other
malignancies and opportunity for innovative, molecularly targeted therapies. To this end, Dr. Bianchi
has carefully selected a mentoring committee and collaborators who are world-renowned experts in Ub,
MM, DDR, proteomics and B cell biology. Such team will provide knowledge, models and technologies
to render the testing of Dr. Bianchi’s hypotheses feasible within the proposed 5-year frame. The
applicant’s mentoring committee has furthermore designed a detailed career plan based on regular
meeting, attendance of workshops, classes and international meetings which will further accelerate the
trajectory of Dr. Bianchi to become an independent investigator in cancer biology in the next 5 years."

This is a competitive continuation application of our Brown University R25 program “Promoting Research
Training During Psychiatry Residency.” Exciting advances in basic and clinical psychiatry/neuroscience and
genomics hold the promise of revealing the causes and potential new treatments for mental illnesses.
However, a critical shortage of physician-scientists poses a threat to our ability to advance and translate
discoveries from basic science into effective prevention and treatment approaches. The overarching goal of
our Research Training Program (RTP) is to train the next generation of psychiatry residents to design and
conduct rigorous, innovative and impactful research and develop successful careers as independently funded
research-oriented physician-scientists in psychiatry/neuroscience. In the first five years of this program we
have achieved our recruitment and training goals, and our residents have been remarkably successful with
their research and early career development. Conducting innovative and rigorous research, our RTP residents
have presented and published their findings widely and in top-tier journals. RTP residents have successfully
competed for travel and poster awards, and their research projects have been funded by numerous national
and local research funding awards. Our program combines an intensive longitudinal mentored research
experience with an individualized research didactic curriculum and career development activities in a rich,
multidisciplinary environment at Brown University. The cohesive program leadership team and Advisory
Committee balance research and clinical training, monitor research and career development progress, and
solicit feedback for program improvement. This application seeks to carry out the following aims: 1) Continue to
recruit and train highly-qualified psychiatry residents to develop independent research careers, and 2) Build
upon our existing successful program to further support resident research and career development with new
and innovative components. Continuation of funding for this program would enable us to train 10 research-
focused residents (two per year) over the next 5 years, thereby expanding the number of highly trained
physician scientists in research domains central to the NIMH mission. The outstanding research training
environment in psychiatry and brain science at Brown, characterized by internationally recognized, externally
funded, innovative research programs and investigators, cross-disciplinary collaborations, and exceptionally
well-qualified and dedicated mentors, makes our psychiatry residency an ideal environment in which to train
the next generation of physician-scientists in psychiatry and neuroscience."

support the research program of Dr. Manjula Kurella Tamura, a nephrologist at Stanford
University and Director of the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Geriatric Research and Education
Clinical Center. The candidate leads a multi-disciplinary research program which is focused on
patient-centered outcomes of dialysis treatment in older adults. Her research program,
comprised of a health services component and an interventions component, has been
supported by five federally funded awards during the past five years, and has produced an
extensive portfolio of work to support hypothesis driven mentee research. During this time, the
candidate’s research program has provided training opportunities for 13 junior investigators who
have successfully obtained funding, published research in high-impact journals, and transitioned
into academic positions. In this K24 application, her overarching goal is to grow and sustain this
program by: (1) enhancing her skills as a research mentor by obtaining training in key areas,
and (2) using her research as a platform to mentor trainees from a range of disciplines, and (3)
extending her research to evaluate treatment trade-offs earlier in the course of kidney disease.
Recent clinical trials demonstrate that intensive versus standard blood pressure targets reduce
mortality and cardiovascular events, but at the expense of kidney function. The scientific goal of
this application is to evaluate the comparative harms and benefits of intensive versus standard
hypertension treatment and hypertension deprescribing on kidney end-points in two real world
older adult cohorts. The secondary goal is to demonstrate the application of novel analytical
approaches that extend causal effects from randomized trials to older and sicker populations.
The candidate’s mentoring program will integrate resources from the breadth of training
programs at Stanford and VA Palo Alto, with unique opportunities tailored to the career
development of scientists in aging research."

Rural populations in the U.S. have disproportionately higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and
type 2 diabetes (T2D) compared to urban populations. Many rural communities also have greater risk factor
burden than urban communities including unhealthier diet, higher rates of physical inactivity, obesity, and
smoking, and higher prevalence of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperglycemia. Compounding
these are poor socioeconomic conditions and limited health resources. Hispanic residents of rural communities
may experience worse CVD and T2D disease and risk burden than non-Hispanic residents due to higher rates
of poverty, lower educational attainment, and greater barriers accessing resources. U.S. Hispanics have
among the highest rates of T2D of any racial or ethnic group. Culturally responsive lifestyle modification
interventions are needed to reduce T2D and CVD risk in rural Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations.
Modification strategies commonly target individuals and, while these may result in behavior change immediate
post-intervention, sustained engagement in healthy behaviors is seldom achieved. Family engagement in
lifestyle interventions may support sustained engagement in healthy behaviors especially in rural and Hispanic
populations that often have greater reliance on family members for social support. We will conduct a
randomized controlled trial to compare the effects of a dyadic intervention, Heart of the Family, to an active
control intervention. We will compare 3-month (short-term) and 12-month (long-term) impact of the Heart of the
Family intervention on biological and behavioral T2D and CVD risk factors and evaluate whether ethnicity
moderates intervention effects. We will also examine how each active intervention dyad member’s
engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors and level of support for their partner’s engagement in healthy
lifestyle behaviors affects their own and their partner’s outcomes. A family focused intervention may better
support long-term engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors to reduce T2D and CVD risk among at-risk rural
Hispanics and non-Hispanics. Further, this community-based intervention has significant potential for broad
implementation to successfully address T2D and CVD health disparities across U.S. Hispanic communities."

Nearly one in four women in India experience perinatal depression, which occurs during pregnancy or the
postpartum period. Preventing perinatal depression (PND) is important for the health of the mother and child as
untreated PND is associated with long-lasting consequences such as an increased risk of suicide, impaired
parenting, and adverse impacts on offspring. Dyadic or marital relationship-level risk factors such as low social
support from the husband, inequitable couples’ relationship dynamics, and unequal decision-making are
significant risk factors for perinatal depression. Couples-based interventions tested in high-income settings
focused on mutable risk factors such as couples' relationship quality and social support have been shown to be
effective in preventing perinatal depression. To date, depression interventions in low-income settings have
primarily focused on treating pregnant women who are already experiencing depression, and limited trials have
investigated preventive approaches. Further, there is a dearth of preventive trials addressing dyadic
determinants by targeting couples. The goal of this K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award application is to
culturally adapt evidence-based intervention(s) as a couples-based intervention and conduct a pilot
randomized controlled trial to assess feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy among primiparous
(first-time pregnant) couples in rural central India. To achieve the mentored K99 phase and career transition to
an independent investigator, I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team with expertise in perinatal
mental health, couples-based intervention development, implementation science and cross-cultural
intervention adaptation, and dyadic skills. During the mentored phase (K99), I will pursue the following training
and research objectives: (1) gain proficiency in dyadic data analysis with couples, (2) enhance my knowledge
of perinatal mental health, and (3) acquire expertise in implementation science. The knowledge and skills
gained in the mentored K99 phase will be instrumental in achieving the specific aims of the R00 phase, which
are to: (1) Identify primiparous couples’ needs and preferences, and barriers and facilitators to engaging
husbands, in a couples-based intervention to prevent PND; (2) Adapt evidence-based intervention(s) for
couples to improve spousal support, shared decision-making, and couples’ relationship dynamics in the
perinatal period to prevent PND; and (3) Assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the
adapted couples-based intervention through a pilot randomized controlled trial. I will use the results of the pilot
to refine the intervention and develop an R01 proposal for a randomized controlled trial with a larger sample
and longer follow-up, to assess the impact on long-term maternal and child health outcomes. The proposed
training, and research plan in this K99/R00 application will prepare me for an independent research career
focused on developing and adapting couples-based interventions to address dyadic determinants to improve
maternal and newborn, and child health."

Innate immunity is crucial for human health and is primarily regulated by post-translational modifications, such
as ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like (ubl) modifiers. Specifically, Tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25), is an

modulating innate immunity through the immunoreceptors Retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptors (RLRs).
Despite a general understanding of the role TRIM25 plays in the ubiquitination of RIG-I, little is known about the
role TRIM25 plays in ISGylation of RLRs and how TRIM25 selects between either process. Further, a new viral
mode of antagonism of TRIM25 by the Human Papilloma Virus have been discovered but have not been defined

nine-fold from 379,000 in 2012 to 3.5 million by 2060. Latinos represent 18% of the U.S. population and almost
twice that number in California. Latinos lag behind Whites and African-Americans in education and healthcare
insurance, and have cardiovascular, metabolic, and other disease burdens that exceed those of Whites;
however, Latino life-expectancy at birth surpasses that of Whites by over 3-years giving them greater exposure
to age-related risk of ADRD. Though they have greater life-time risk, Latinos are less likely to present for
possible diagnosis and intervention because of cultural differences in reporting behavioral, cognitive, and
functional deficits. Furthermore, they are less likely to be diagnosed accurately because methods used to
diagnose AD were largely developed and validated in relatively homogeneous, well-educated, White, English-
speaking populations, including state-of-the-art clinical, neuropsychological, and neurological procedures
which may not work effectively with monolingual Spanish-speaking or Spanish-English bilingual older Latinos.
Thus, there is a need for AD-related research in older Latinos to overcome barriers to effective screening,
assessment, diagnosis and treatment of early and preclinical disease. There is also a need to better
understand factors that impede or facilitate participation of older Latinos in AD-related research, including
awareness of AD and its clinical features, level of concern about the consequences of AD and burden of care,
and willingness to participate in research including procedures such as sampling of biomarkers, genetics, and
autopsy. To address these needs, the overall aims of the Latino Core are to develop methods, tools and
strategies to 1) improve clinic and community-based memory screening in support of better health care for
Latinos with ADRD and their recruitment into the ADRC Clinical Core cohort and volunteer registry, 2) improve
objective neuropsychological assessment for detecting and tracking preclinical AD, MCI and the transition to
AD in older Latinos, and to develop new tests and refine existing tests for these purposes, and 3) improve
acquisition and interpretation of self-reported cognitive decline, language proficiency, degree of bilingualism,
and attitudes towards ADRD research participation. The Latino Core will ensure that the ADRC is well
positioned to study ADRD in this significant yet underserved portion of the population, filling critical gaps in
scientific knowledge essential for reducing the disparities related to ADRD diagnosis, treatment and care facing
Latinos in our San Diego community and beyond. Systematic study of AD in this diverse group will lead to
unique insights and improved understanding of the consequences of AD in general (in all populations)."

human cell-based disease modeling strategies from cohorts of Center participants, experimental services,
hands-on training, and protocols for establishing and validating cell models. The iPSC Core aims to grow and
diversify its biorepository and extend its technical portfolio by implementing five specific aims. First, the Core
will continue to work with the Clinical Core to isolate somatic skin fibroblasts from participants, and reprogram
these into iPSC, which undergo rigorous quality control, cataloging, and banking, in order to facilitate
prolonged sharing and to support the needs of research projects (Aim 1). Because the Latino population is
more likely to develop AD but remains understudied, the Core will focus on generating a diverse selection of

Next, the iPSC Core will extend its services to generate isogenic iPSC lines with genome editing on demand,
and provide organoid differentiation services and training for iPSC research on ADRD (Aim 3). Further, by
implementing an ‘observatory’ for induced neurons (iNs) directly converted from participants’ fibroblasts, the

combat ADRD."
10867537,"Ischemic stroke, in which blood flow to part of the brain is blocked, is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. In stroke survivors, neuronal death in the ischemic core is accompanied by functional alterations to spared brain regions. Synaptic changes in these spared regions may contribute to deficits and/or reflect mechanisms of spontaneous recovery, but a complete picture of how, when, and where synapses are modified after stroke is lacking. Under typical conditions, regulate synapses post and pre synaptically respectively. Post-synaptically, chronic changes to spike rate induce compensatory changes that homeostatically return firing rates to baseline levels. Pre-synaptically, sleep/wake states regulate both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, but in opposite directions: sleep decreases excitation and increases inhibition, driving an oscillation of the excitation/inhibition (E/I) ratio across the 24h day. Neuronal activity levels and behavioral sleep/wake states are both altered following stroke, raising the possibility that these changes drive synaptic modifications that are either compensatory or pathological. In this proposal, we will investigate how altered spiking activity and behavioral arousal states impact synaptic function in multiple brain regions and at different time points following photothrombotic stroke in mice."
10867538,"Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability and death in the US. One of the contributing factors to this 
is the lack of FDA approved treatments for chronic stroke. Aside from tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), 
there are no other approved therapeutics with disease modifying effects; current therapy is entirely focused 
on symptom management and rehabilitation. This is in part due to the lack of understanding of the 
underlying mechanisms involved, as well as the difficulty of delivering therapeutics through the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) and into the brain. This project aims to address both of these difficulties through the 
development of a human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) derived model of the BBB incorporating 
hiPSC derived brain microvascular endothelial like cells (BMECs), astrocytes, and neurons. Using a 3D 
microvessel platform ischemia will be modeled using perturbations in shear flow, oxygen concentration, 
and nutrient availability. The resultant phenotype of the cells will be investigated using live cell microscopy 
to measure permeability of fluorescent tracer molecules, as well as morphological changes in the cells. 
Using this model, as well as a simplified 2D model of ischemia, a library of antibodies will be screened for 
improved targeting and delivery to the human ischemic brain. Finally, the antibodies identified in the screen 
will be tested for efficacy in delivering known non-brain penetrant neuroprotectant growth factors to the 
ischemic brain both in the in vitro model and in a mouse model of stroke. In summary, this project will 
establish a human specific model of the BBB during ischemic stroke and identify antibodies that are able to 
specifically target and deliver therapeutics to the ischemic region of the brain."
10869336,"Project Summary/Abstract
Mitochondrial dysfunction is the main mechanism contributing to cell death and tissue damage in cerebral
ischemia-reperfusion injury (I/R). Calcium-induced mitochondrial swelling, uncoupling of respiration, and cell
death occur in mammals under hypoxic conditions of I/R. These changes are due to the activation of the
mitochondrial megachannel also known as the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). Remarkably,
the embryos of the mysterious organism, brine shrimp Artemia franciscana, tolerate anoxic conditions for several
years and were reported to lack hypoxia and Ca2+-activated mPTP opening. mPTP was at the center of scientific
research for several decades and it still remains one of the most mysterious phenomena in biology today due to
the lack of information about its exact molecular composition, structure, and regulatory mechanisms. Recently,
mammalian ATP synthase was shown to undergo calcium-induced conformational changes to form an
uncoupling channel with the biophysical properties of mPTP. In this proposal, we will use single-particle cryo-
electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to identify the high-resolution structure and activation/inactivation mechanisms
of Artemia franciscana ATP synthase. These studies will reveal the distinct structural features of Artemia ATP
synthase that prevent the Ca2+ and hypoxia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death in this organism.
Successful completion of this proposal will help to unlock the development of specific and potent therapeutic
compounds targeting mammalian ATP synthase leak channel for treating I/R injury and other mPTP-related
diseases."
10872142,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Biological processes on nuclear DNA occur in the context of chromatin. The precise regulation of transcription,
DNA replication, and DNA damage repair requires dynamic control of histone mobility orchestrated by chromatin
regulation. The multiple roles of chromatin regulation in neurodevelopment are being unraveled. Recent studies
have revealed that cell fate specification, neural plasticity, and circuit formation are mediated, in part, by
chromatin. Mechanistically, chromatin modulates these developmental processes via transcriptomic regulation.
Chromatin, however, also plays an essential role in genome maintenance. Genome integrity is particularly
important in rapidly dividing stem cells, including neural progenitor cells (NPCs). DNA replication and DSB repair
each occur in the context of chromatin, which must be reorganized for all transactions on DNA, including
replication fork progression, DSB detection, and recruitment of DNA repair factors. These processes are
mediated by chromatin remodelers – ATP-dependent protein complexes that can reposition nucleosomes on
DNA, evict nucleosomes from DNA, or exchange histone subunits, thus controlling the accessibility, flexibility,
and mobility of chromatin. In striking contrast to the well-known transcriptional roles of chromatin, the equally
important functions of chromatin regulation in genome maintenance are virtually unexplored in neural
development. Here, the proposed work builds on our recent paper on the chromatin remodeler Ino80 (Keil et al.,
2020), in which we find dissociable roles for Ino80 in YY1-associated transcriptional regulation and homologous
recombination (HR) DNA repair in cortical NPCs. Notably, impaired DNA repair is the driver of neuroanatomical
phenotypes following Ino80 deletion, thus demonstrating that this underexplored role of chromatin can effect
neurodevelopmental consequences. Importantly, Ino80’s DNA repair function is not unique among chromatin
remodelers. In this application, we seek to investigate a potentially wider role of chromatin remodeling in DNA
damage and repair in NPCs. We will apply our expertise in chromatin biology, DNA damage repair, functional
genomics, and genetics to: 1) dissect distinct chromatin remodeling functions in transcriptional regulation versus
genome maintenance; 2) determine the mechanisms of chromatin remodeling functions in DNA replication and
damage repair; and 3) assess the brain somatic genome consequences of chromatin remodeling dysfunction.
Recent human genetic findings have convergently implicated chromatin dysregulation in neurodevelopmental
disorders. Here, we propose that, in addition to transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling plays an equally
important role in genome stability across NPC divisions. This aspect of chromatin function is largely unexplored
in brain development. Our study will address this important gap in the field and mechanistically dissect the distinct
roles of chromatin remodeling in transcriptional regulation versus genome maintenance in neurodevelopment."
10870624,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cerebrovascular disease is the 2nd leading cause of mortality in the world showing 17.2% in 2019. Approximately
795,000 strokes occur in the US every year, which are projected to expand to 1.25 million cases by 2025. Current
approaches to treat intracranial blood vessels include medical, surgical, and endovascular methods. Among
them, endovascular technologies with clot retriever thrombectomy devices, flow diverters, and embolization coils,
etc. have been widely used to treat cerebrovascular disease since they are less invasive, more effective, and
less risky. The typical endovascular sequence uses a micro guidewire to access target lesions, followed by
tracking a catheter over the wire. However, even skilled interventionalists often encounter difficulties in
translating proximal catheter/guidewire movements into anticipated movements at its distal end due mainly to
unpredictable jerky and whipping motions of the pre-bent guidewire tip, particularly while navigating narrow and
winding pathways. These issues cause prolonged operational procedures that increase the risk to expose
interventionalists and patients to a high level of harmful X-ray radiation. To mitigate these issues in the current
endovascular procedures, automated steering methods of guidewires have been introduced. As of today,
however, a clinically practical solution for an ultra-low profile, simple, remotely controlled, automated steerable
guidewire for neurointerventional procedures, which does not need to alter the materials or increase the overall
dimensions in commercial endovascular products, is lacking.
In this project, we will develop an innovative 𝜇Robot-guided system that allows for easy and rapid delivery of
guidewires in challenging tortuous and complex neurovascular anatomy. The proposed 𝜇Robot is based on
acoustic streaming that generates sufficient forces to steer guidewires three dimensionally and can be easily
integrated to the distal tip of existing commercial guidewires. Steering the proposed 𝜇Robot guidewires can be
achieved by simply switching the frequency and amplitude of acoustic waves from a static, compact, remote
acoustic source (similar to the clinically well-proven ultrasound imaging probe), not requiring any bulky actuator
or robotic arm. Thus, the overall system is ultra-low profile, cost-effective, and safe to the human body, being
expected to allow for full robotic/telerobotic neurovascular interventions substantially reducing the total procedure
time and thus minimizing the exposure to harmful X-ray radiation. To materialize the proposed innovated
concept, task plans are established (1) to determine design parameters in 𝜇Robot guidewires using a commercial
CFD (computational fluid dynamics) package, (2) to fabricate 𝜇Robot prototypes utilizing a 2-photon
polymerization-based 3-D printer, (3) to integrate fabricated 𝜇Robot prototypes to commercial guidewires and
characterize their steering motions, and (4) to assess the maneuverability performance of the 𝜇Robot guidewire
using a preclinical in vitro test platform that accurately replicates complex human cerebral artery environments."

The ND INBRE has been highly successful in meeting the 4 central goals expected from all INBRE
programs as detailed in the Request for Applications. The overall goal of the administrative core is to
continue and enhance the success of the ND INBRE program. The leadership of the administrative core
will continue the success in priming the pipeline of the next generation of research and health
professionals through the promotion of undergraduate research. The new funding cycle will start our
quest to go from our current support of over 1,000 undergraduates in research to our new goal of 2,000
students. New additions to the internal advisory committee (IAC) will add strength to our goal of
providing diversity, equity and inclusion of under-served in ND. The administrative core is expanding its
promotion of STEM activities in the middle and high schools through a community-based partnership
with the North Dakota Science Teachers Association. The program will add each year to the 3,000
students already supported by the ND INBRE to compete in the Science and Engineering Fairs. The
administrative core will continue to provide multiple forums for students and faculty to interact and
network with their peers. Two of these forms are focused on American Indian research and health
disparities, one on the campus of Cankdeska Cikana Community College. The administrative core,
through its interactions with the IAC, will continue to enhance research infrastructure that increases the
research base and capacity. The ND INBRE’s participation in the CTR Dakota Cancer Collaborative on
Translational Activity and on the SHARP Hub represents over 30 million dollars in extramural activity.
The highly successful evaluation of the program, especially as it applies to student career outcomes, will

 3 In experimental studies, direct inhibition of the snake venom toxin secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) results
 4 in significant improvements in sPLA2-mediated toxicities, but the benefits of sPLA2 inhibition in humans bitten
 5 by snakes remains unknown. Ophirex is a Public Benefit Corporation whose mission is to reduce death and
 6 disability from snakebite envenoming (SBE) through the development of varespladib, a highly potent inhibitor of
 7 snake venom sPLA2. Snake venom sPLA2 and sPLA2-like proteins are found in 95% of medically important
 8 venomous snakes worldwide and thought to be found in all venomous snakes native to the United States. These
 9 proteins are key contributors to neuromuscular paralysis, coagulopathy, cardiotoxicity, renal toxicity, and skeletal
10 muscle injury. Antibody therapies (“antivenoms”) have limited efficacy against sPLA2 because of the generally
11 low antigenicity of sPLA2 and because of physiologic barriers to the entry of antibodies into important
12 compartments (e.g., muscle, neuromotor junctions). Varespladib has been found to rescue mice and pigs from
13 lethal envenoming from a variety of species of snake, even when given at a point in time when antivenom is no
14 longer able to rescue the animals. Varespladib also acts synergistically with antivenom: In preclinical studies,
15 the combination of varespladib and antivenom results in greater inhibition of sPLA2 and greater protective
16 benefits from a range of sPLA2-mediated toxicities than would be expected from summing the benefits of the
17 two therapies on their own. The overarching goal of this project is to conduct research to support regulatory
18 approval of an intravenous formulation of varespladib for SBE. This will be achieved through the completion of
19 a Phase IIb double-blind randomized controlled trial of varespladib in 110 patients bitten by venomous snakes
20 and receiving care at sites in the U.S. and India. All patients will receive standard of care treatment, including
21 antivenom. Patients will receive a continuous infusion of varespladib or normal saline for at least 6 hours. After
22 6 hours of whenever they are clinically stable and able to tolerate oral medication, patients will be switched to
23 oral treatment with varespladib-methyl or placebo. The total duration of treatment will be 7 days. The primary
24 outcome will be the change from baseline to the average at 3 and 6 hours of the Snakebite Severity Score, which
25 assesses key snake venom toxicities of the hematologic, neurologic, renal, cardiovascular, and pulmonary
26 systems. The proposed work will also utilize two innovative approaches to expanding the findings from the trial
27 to other important populations: (1) Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling will be used to identify an
28 appropriate dosing strategy in pediatric patients and to enhance available pediatric safety and efficacy data; and
29 (2) A simulation model will be used to estimate the clinical effect of varespladib in patients bitten by snake species
30 not well-represented in the trial. The results of the proposed work will be used to support regulatory approval
31 with the potential to transform the paradigm for snakebite treatment and to save thousands of lives each year."
10873868,"Project Summary
Homologous recombination (HR) maintains genomic stability through high-fidelity repair of DNA double-stranded
breaks (DSB) and other complex DNA damage that is induced directly or indirectly by common anti-tumor agents
including ionizing radiation, topoisomerase-targeted drugs, interstrand crosslinking agents, and those causing
replication forks stalling. HR defects bear dual significance for cancer by first leading to genomic instability and
increased cancer predisposition. Moreover, HR defects cause specific cellular vulnerabilities that can be
exploited therapeutically either by traditional DNA damage-based treatment or by targeted treatment for example
by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibition. The overarching goal is to elucidate the mechanisms of HR. This
application focuses on a central HR intermediate, the displacement loop (D-loop), which represents the
branchpoint for the HR sub-pathways. The Specific Aims are:
Aim 1: Define D-loop length in cells and the role of Rdh54 in D-loop metabolism
We will take biochemical (Aim 1A) and genetic approaches (Aim 1B) to determine for the first time the length of
D-loops using a newly developed assay that maps D-loops at single molecule resolution. In Aim 1C, we will
determine the role of Rdh54 in controlling D-loop length and crossover outcome.
Aim 2: Delineate the role of human RAD54B in HR
In testing the model of functional cooperation with RAD54, we will determine the role of RAD54B in HR by using
a biochemical approach to determine its role in RAD51-mediated recombination using established and newly
developed assays (Aim 2A). In Aim 2B, we extend these studies to human cells based on preliminary data
showing a specific role of RAD54B in synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA). In Aim 2C, we will adapt
novel assays to human cells, determine D-loop length, and test the effect of RAD54B on D-loop levels and length
to determine the mechanisms of crossover avoidance.
Aim 3: Determine the roles of RECQ1 and RECQ5 in D-loop editing and crossover control
D-loops are a central HR intermediate and highly dynamic. We surmise that D-loops encompass a diverse set
of structures explaining the existence of multiple D-loop editing pathways. Based on exciting preliminary data,
we will focus on RECQ1 as a novel player acting in concert with RECQ5 in SDSA. We will determine the
mechanisms RECQ1 and RECQ5 in SDSA using a biochemical in vitro reconstitution approach (Aim 3A)
complemented by genetic and cell biological approaches in Aim 3B."
10873869,"This proposal is a competing renewal application for continuing support of a T32 training grant entitled “Virus-
host interactions: a multi-scale training program.” The program, formerly called Molecular Biology of
Eukaryotic Viruses, was established at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) in 1988. During its 30-year
history, the goal of this program has been to broadly train Ph.D. graduate students in the fundamental aspects
of molecular and cellular virology as they relate to virus-host interactions, viral pathogenesis, regulation of
viral gene expression, virus structure/proteomics, and applications of virus/phage technologies. During the
current review period (9/14-8/19), eight predoctoral students were supported by this training program. For the
upcoming budget period, three pre-doctoral trainee positions are requested, consistent with previous
renewals of this program. Due to evolving faculty research expertise and the emergence of new virus/phage-
related disciplines, the scope of proposed training areas will be broadened to also include interdisciplinary
research and training programs in host responses to viral infections, bacteriophages in the human microbiome
and the environment, and mathematical modeling of virus dynamics. There are 13 faculty mentors for this
program, representing eight academic departments at UCI. Nearly all faculty members from these
departments participate in the Cellular and Molecular Biosciences graduate program (CMB) at UCI, which
oversees recruitment, admission, and first-year training of predoctoral students. The majority of the T32
training grant trainees are part of the Immunology and Microbiology focus area in the CMB program. Three
of the training preceptors are affiliated with the Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, and research
in these labs will focus on (i) viruses/bacteriophages in the environment, (ii) viruses associated with the human
microbiome, and (iii) in vivo virus dynamics. All trainees in the proposed training program will take formal
course work that includes an integrated set of core courses in molecular virology/pathogenesis, phage-host
interactions, mathematical modeling of virus spread, and a Virology Journal Club as well as electives and
seminar courses in their areas of research specialization. The virology training faculty have major research
strengths in virus-host interactions including the immune response to viral infections, regulation of viral gene
expression, structural virology and viral proteomics, viral pathogenesis, control of emerging virus infections,
viruses/bacteriophages in the human and environmental microbiome, modeling of virus populations,
molecular evolution of viruses, virus gene therapy, and drug delivery via viral vectors. Our research programs
cover a wide range of DNA and RNA viruses, including herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, vaccinia

Introduction: We propose to Identify the mechanisms by which an intestinal Th17 immune response
contributes to severe and recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) and explore the immune
mechanism by which fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) protects.
Hypothesis: Th17 cells contribute to severe CDI and to recurrence.
Premise: Failure of antibiotic treatment of CDI (i.e. death or recurrence) is due to a gut Th17 immune
response.
Significance: C. difficile is the leading cause of hospital-acquired infection in the United States. One in five
patients with CDI fails antibiotic treatment and as a result suffers a recurrent infection or death. This proposal
will explore if immunotherapy would improve treatment of CDI, specifically by testing the importance of gut
Th17 immune responses in CDI severity and recurrence
Investigators: Dr. William Petri at the University of Virginia has discovered that Type-17 immunity causes
more severe disease during CDI. This has included showing that IL-23 knockout mice have increased
survival, reduced neutrophil influx, and reduced tissue pathology (Buonomo et al 2013), that the Th17
polarizing cytokines IL-6 and IL-23 are associated with more severe disease in humans, that type 2
immunity protects by countering Th17 (Frisbee et al 2019), and that adoptive transfer of Th17 cells is
sufficient to enhance CDI mortality (Saleh et al 2019). He is joined by Dr. Ann Hays who directs the
complicated C. difficile clinic at UVA and the biostatistical expertise of Dr. Jennie Ma.
Innovation: The proposed research by testing if Th17 cells have a role in severe CDI as well as recurrent
CDI will be paradigm shifting, as this is a field of research that in the past has focused on targeting the
bacterium or the microbiota for therapy. This proposal will instead test if the induction of a Th17 immune
response in addition to the bacterium and microbiota are causing disease.
Approach:
Specific Aim 1: SEVERE CDI - Identify the mechanisms by which a Th17 immune response leads to severe
C. difficile infection (CDI)
Specific Aim 2: RECURRENT CDI - Test the role of Th17 cells and the Th17-recruiting chemokine CCL5 in
recurrent CDI
Specific Aim 3: FMT – Determine if FMT protects from primary and recurrent CDI by inducing IL-33 that
blocks the action of Th17.
Environment: Key to success are the complementary expertise of the Petri lab in the mucosal immunology
of enteric infections, and the clinical expertise in FMT for complicated C. difficile infection of Dr. Ann Hays."
10873978,"Project Summary: Functional analysis of the Clp Protease Systems in Chlamydial Growth and
Differentiation
 Chlamydia is an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes a range of serious diseases in
humans. In developed countries, Chlamydia trachomatis is the primary cause of bacterial sexually transmitted
infections (STI). Indeed, recent reports from the Centers for Disease Control highlight the increasing incidence
of STIs, with chlamydia infections consistently outpacing all other types. In developing countries, C.
trachomatis is not only a significant cause of STI, but it is also responsible for the primary cause of infectious
preventable blindness, trachoma. The major concern of chlamydial infections is that they are often
asymptomatic and undiagnosed, which can lead to chronic sequelae. These include pelvic inflammatory
disease, tubal factor infertility, and reactive arthritis for C. trachomatis. Consequently, chlamydial diseases
remain a significant burden on health care systems around the world.
 In adapting to obligate intracellular growth, Chlamydia has significantly reduced its genome size and
eliminated genes from various pathways as it relies on the host cell for its metabolic needs. This pathogen
has also adapted to alternate between different functional and morphological forms during its normal growth,
also referred to as its developmental cycle. These observations, combined with its obligate intracellular
dependence, makes Chlamydia a difficult organism with which to work. However, recent development of
genetic tools to study chlamydiae mechanistically have significantly enhanced our understanding of this
pathogen. This proposal applies a combination of these new genetic techniques and classical biochemical
studies to evaluate the role of conserved protease systems in chlamydial growth and pathogenesis. The
hypothesis of the proposed work is that Chlamydia uses two separate protease systems to regulate its growth
and transition between developmental forms as well as to respond to stress. Major goals of the proposal
include (i) characterizing the function of the different protease systems both in vitro and in vivo and (ii)
identifying and validating substrates of these protease systems. Results will advance our understanding of
this important pathogen and lead to the design of novel therapeutic agents that are specific for Chlamydia.
This in turn will allow for minimal effects on normal flora for patients receiving treatment for this highly prevalent
disease."

10874233,"ABSTRACT - OVERALL
Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) is a prevalent in utero infection, affecting approximately 1 in 200 newborns
and leading to severe neurological impairment in 1 in 5 infected infants. Maternal CMV-specific adaptive
immunity is partially protective against cCMV infection, with reduced transmission rates observed in
chronically-infected women upon reinfection. However, challenges in CMV vaccine development include
limited understanding of viral and immunological factors involved in cCMV transmission, strategies to
counteract immune evasion mechanisms, and critical vaccine antigen targets. To address these challenges,
our team developed and refined a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of cCMV infection in rhesus monkeys,
which we demonstrated to closely mimic human transmission and fetal disease rates in our initial cycle of this
P01 Program. Surprisingly, immune responses following maternal infection did not predict transmission risk,
suggesting the need for pre-existing immunity different from natural infection. The NHP model also revealed T
cell trafficking to the maternal-fetal interface following maternal CMV infection, the limited role of the viral
pentameric glycoprotein complex in cCMV transmission, the role of Fc-mediated antibody responses in CMV
containment, and viral immune evasion mechanisms as important factors in reducing CMV dissemination.
Traditional vaccine approaches focused on neutralizing antibodies may be insufficient, prompting the
evaluation of novel CMV vaccine candidates in the NHP model. We hypothesize that disarming the virus by
eliciting immunity against key viral immune evasions and inducing cellular immunity at the maternal-fetal
interface will prevent cCMV transmission following primary infection during pregnancy. The studies proposed in
the renewal of this P01 Program will assess the role of CD8+ T cell responses at the maternal-fetal interface in
preventing cCMV transmission (Project 1), the impact of vaccine-induced immunity against viral immune
evasions, such as UL146 chemokine homologs (Project 2) and viral Fc receptors (Project 3), and test three
novel vaccines targeting each of these novel immune mechanisms. The Program's ultimate goal is to develop
an effective CMV vaccine, considering the limitations of previous approaches and targeting immune evasion
proteins while eliciting local immunity at the maternal-fetal interface. The research will employ NHP models,
placental organoid models, viral engineering, sequence analysis, and bioinformatics to de-risk these vaccine
concepts before advancing to human efficacy trials. The successful development of a CMV vaccine is crucial
for eliminating the most common infectious cause of birth defects and brain damage worldwide."

10874235,"ABSTRACT – MODEL SYSTEMS (MODS) CORE
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) poses a significant threat to children's health as a major cause of birth defects and
brain damage, yet an effective vaccine to prevent congenital CMV (cCMV) transmission remains elusive. Novel
strategies to protect against cCMV transmission and disease require tractable preclinical models to de-risk
clinical vaccine development. The Model Systems Core (MODS Core), led by Dr. Sallie Permar (contact PI)
along with collaborators across 3 national primate centers with enhanced special pathogen-free (SPF) rhesus
monkey breeding colonies, has established a highly relevant nonhuman primate (NHP) model in rhesus
monkeys (RM) that closely resembles human cCMV transmission and disease after acute rhesus CMV
(RhCMV) infection during pregnancy. However, conducting studies in RhCMV-free monkeys remains
challenging due to its endemicity in primate colonies. To address this, the MODS Core Specific Aims include;
1) Central coordination to ensure unbiased distribution and protocol adherence of studies in RhCMV-
seronegative dams and males among Projects, 2) Decoding of CMV-host interactions and viral placental cell
tropism in placental organoid and placentas from RM and humans after vaccination using high-resolution
transcriptomics and proteomics technologies, the MODS Core aims to identify cell-type specific gene
expression patterns, comparing CMV spread and pathogenesis between RMs and humans in highly relevant in
vitro organoid models and in vivo samples obtained from RMs and humans directly; 3) Advanced single-cell
and spatial multi-omic technologies to investigate CMV viral pathogenesis and mechanisms of vaccine efficacy
at the maternal-fetal interface, identifying candidate therapeutic and immunologic targets for developing better
vaccination and treatments to reduce and ameliorate vertical viral transmission. The MODS Core plays a
crucial role in coordinating NHP experiments, facilitating sample exchange, conducting single-cell level
placental analysis using organoid and placenta models, and providing primary and secondary endpoints for
data analysis. Ultimately, the MODS Core's comprehensive approach contributes to the development of
effective interventions to eliminate cCMV and serves as the backbone of the overall Program, de-risking novel
CMV vaccine candidates and discovering novel vaccine targets in a highly-relevant pre-clinical model."
10874236,"ABSTRACT – VIROLOGY CORE
The Virology Core will continue to support the ongoing research of the Program by providing customized
virological techniques and services performed at a centralized location using standard operating procedures to
ensure maximal data consistency. The services provided include virus mutant design and construction for
Projects 2 and 3, as well as viral stock production and quality control across all projects. Furthermore, the
core will be tasked with receiving all bodily fluids and tissues collected from rhesus macaques in virus
challenge experiments over the course of the Program to centrally store, process, and analyze samples. The
raw data will be stored centrally through the Admin Core to all project PIs for review and interpretation. The
Virology Core team is composed of a group of scientists with years of experience in diverse, non-overlapping
areas in basic and translational virology. We can offer guidance and support on a wide range of techniques,
including genomic engineering and virus production, tissue handling and processing, next generation
sequencing, and data analysis either for quality control purposes or to answer complex research questions
involving in vivo virus population analysis and virus evolution. Our pre-existing collaboration will allow us to rely
on exstablished, standard operating procedures (SOPs) and pipelines for rapid and reliable sample processing
and data generation. All members of the Virology Core are acquainted and have successfully worked together
for years in a highly collaborative environment to support intricate multicenter research studies involving NHPs.
Hence, the scientific members of the core are in constant communication, and issues and obstacles that might
arise over the course of the Program will be discussed, analyzed, and managed collaboratively in a timely
manner in close cooperation with the scientific leadership. If needed, the overall goals and responsibilities of
the Virology Core can be adjusted by the project administration. Should new techniques or procedures be
required for any project, the Virology Core team member with the most relevant expertise in the desired field of
research will be tasked with establishing these procedures for general use."
10874237,"ABSTRACT – IMMUNE DATA SCIENCE (IDS) CORE
The Immune Data Science (IDS) Core will be responsible for analysis of high-dimensional immune data sets
generated by Projects 1-3 and the Model Systems (MODS) Core. The objectives of the analysis are to
address 1) viral factors contributing to transmission, 2) immune factors contributing to blocking transmission, 3)
efficacy of passive immunization on blocking transmission, 4) efficacy of specific vaccines on blocking
transmission, 5) immunogenicity of specific vaccines, and 6) biomarkers associated with outcomes.
To address these objectives, we need to consider the data, outcomes, and experimental context. Data comes
in several categories that require different processing and analytic approaches: bulk (multiplexed cytokines,
antibody concentration, antibody function), single cell (flow cytometry, scRNA-seq), antigen receptor repertoire
(scTCR-seq), and spatial (spatial proteomics, spatial transcriptomics). The primary outcome is viral
transmission, defined as detectable CMV by qPCR on ൒ 2 technical replicates, but there are several other
outcomes of interest: maternal plasma viral load over time, shedding in urine and saliva, and dissemination
across multiple tissues and organ systems. Each set of data and outcomes comes with a specific context: viral
strain, immunocompetent or CD4 T cell-depleted Rhesus macaques (RM), and treatment (none, specific
vaccine, or HIG) administered.
The first aim (SA1) will develop computational biology pipelines for the processing, quality control, and
exploratory analysis of immune data sets only. SA1 will focus on 1) single cell data science applied to flow
cytometry and scRNA-seq data sets to identify immune cell types and their gene expression profiles, 2) antigen
receptor diversity analysis to identify abundant clonotypes related to their gene expression profiles and
immunodominant CMV epitopes, and 3) spatial biology, especially co-localization of virus and immune cells.
The computational biology pipelines will also generate informative features from these immune assays to be
used for downstream analysis. The second aim (SA2) will apply or develop statistical models to address the six
analytic objectives, which require linking data, context, and outcomes. In addition to standard statistical
analysis described in Projects 1-3, but centrally executed by the IDS Core for consistency, SA2 will focus on
1) developing a hierarchical Bayesian model to model the complex conditional dependency structure of viral
dissemination experiments, 2) extension of our powerful COMPASS framework for identification of cellular
immune correlates to include bulk data, and 3) hypothesis testing to rigorously evaluate spatial patterns of
variation and co-localization that inform us about viral transmission and vaccine mechanisms.
Overall, the IDS Core will serve as the quantitative hub of the overall Program, providing the quantitative
expertise and resources to analyze and interpret the complex experimental data."
10874238,"ABSTRACT - PROJECT 1
Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) is the most common infectious cause of sensorineural hearing loss and
neurological sequelae in the newborn. Efforts to achieve a maternal vaccine have not yet met with success, in
part due to an incomplete understanding of the correlates of protection. In Project 1, we will use a nonhuman
primate (NHP) model of cCMV in rhesus macaques (RMs) to interrogate systemic and tissue-level immune
determinants of placental CMV transmission at the maternal-fetal (M-F) interface. We hypothesize that an
effective cCMV vaccine will need to elicit a cellular response at the M-F interface that balances induction of
protective virus-specific immunity with prevention of immunopathology. We will investigate cellular immune
defenses at the M-F interface in infection and vaccine settings as follows. Aim 1: Characterize virus-host
immune interactions at the M-F interface in primary RhCMV infection and their role in cCMV outcome.
Placental tissues and cells from immunocompetent RM dams infected with RhCMV will be subjected to viral
and immunologic analysis using PCR, RNAScope, multiplex immunohistochemistry, spatial transcriptomics, sc-
RNASeq, and cellular assays for analysis of virus and host immune interactions at the M-F interface in the
presence or absence of cCMV transmission. Aim 2: Determine the immunogenicity and durability of single-
cycle (sc) RhCMV vaccines eliciting MHC-Ia-restricted “conventional” or MHC-II/MHC-E-restricted
“unconventional” virus-specific CD8+ T cells in female RMs and characterize their ability to induce vaccine-
specific T cell responses at the M-F interface. Breeding age CMV-seronegative dams vaccinated with a prime-
boost regimen of sc-RhCMV vaccines will be timed-mated and evaluated for vaccine-induced T lymphocyte
responses in tissues of the M-F interface at term gestation. Aim 3: Determine the protective effect of pre-
conception RhCMV vaccine-induced conventional and unconventional CD8+ T lymphocyte responses against
congenital transmission. Vaccinated, pregnant dams will be challenged with RhCMV in early 2nd trimester
gestation and monitored for protection against cCMV transmission. Aim 1 experiment animals will serve as
controls for vaccine groups in Projects 1-3. Project 1 will interact with the MODS Core for organoids, spatial
transcriptomics, and spatial proteomics; with the Virology Core for RhCMV challenge virus stocks, RhCMV
vaccines, quantitative PCR for RhCMV DNA, and viral sequencing; and with the IDS Core for data analysis,
including bioinformatics. Virus-specific immunity and T cell trafficking to the M-F interface is relevant to
understanding the type of tissue level immunity that a vaccine needs to protect against cCMV without inducing
harmful immunopathology and an adverse pregnancy outcome."
10874239,"ABSTRACT – PROJECT 2
Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection is the leading infectious cause of congenital defects and the
development of vaccines and treatments to prevent cCMV have long been recognized as top public health goals.
Unfortunately, vaccines targeting human CMV (HCMV) glycoproteins or based on attenuated HCMV have not
yet yielded a licensed vaccine, most likely since they were unable to provide immunity against infection that is
better than the limited immunity provided by natural infection. The overall goal of this project is to explore a
novel and innovative approach to prevent cCMV infection by targeting the function of viral chemokine-like
proteins. This approach is based on the suprising finding that rhesus CMV (RhCMV) lacking the UL146 family of
viral CXC chemokine-like proteins shows highly limited dissemination, reduced plasma viremia and delayed
shedding during primary infection of rhesus macaques (RM). Since viral dissemination is essential for congenital
infection, we hypothesize that UL146 family members are required for transmission to the fetus, and that
interfering with their role in dissemination could prevent congenital infection. The goals of this project are
therefore to identify and characterize the UL146 family proteins required for dissemination and congenital
infection and to develop UL146 family targeting strategies to prevent congenital infection. In Aim 1 we will
determine which of the six RhCMV UL146 family proteins are required for dissemination, and whether HCMV
UL146 and/or UL147 can substitute for their RhCMV homologs. Since this family displays homology to host
chemokines, we will also examine the chemokine structural requirements for dissemination. We will begin
characterizing possible mechanisms of dissemination by studying UL146-mediated spreading in placental
organoid cultures and by characterizing how the cellular microenvironment is affected by viral chemokines using
immunohistochemistry and single cell transcriptomics and proteomics. In Aim 2 we will examine dissemination
of UL146 family-deleted RhCMV to tissues upon intravenous inoculation during primary infection and
transmission to the fetus in CD4+ T cell depleted dams. We will additionally examine whether the minimal set of
UL146 family members required for dissemination can restore congenital infection. In Aim 3 we will evaluate
whether UL146 family proteins are immunogenic during primary infection and whether immunization against the
minimal set of UL146 family members required for dissemination will limit dissemination upon primary infection.
Finally, we will determine whether IgG from these immunized animals can protect against congenital infection,
either on their own or in combination with IgG treatments evaluated in Project 3. We expect that a limited number
of UL146 family members support viral dissemination and congenital infection and that anti-UL146 immunity can
limit dissemination and congenital infection. By providing a better understanding of the function of viral CXC
chemokine-like proteins in the context of viral primary and congenital infection we expect to provide new avenues
for prevention or therapies of primary and congenital CMV infection."
10874240,"ABSTRACT – PROJECT 3
Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) is the most common in utero infection, affecting approximately 1 in
every 200 newborns and causing devastating neurologic impairment in 1 in 5 infected infants. Placental
transmission of CMV is significantly reduced in women experiencing reinfection (3-4%) compared to
women experiencing CMV infection for the first time during pregnancy (30-40%), suggesting that
maternal CMV-specific adaptive immunity can protect against cCMV infection. However, to effectively
reduce cCMV prevalence, the protective effects of vaccine-elicited immunity must supersede that of
natural immunity. Several challenges have limited CMV vaccine development, including the numerous
immune evasion mechanisms of the virus. One of these mechanisms is viral Fc receptors (vFcȖRs) that
bind the Fc region of IgG, which our team showed in vitro to interfere with host Fc-mediated antibody
effector functions that we showed to be critical immune factors for preventing cCMV transmission. In
our model of primary CMV infection in pregnant rhesus macaques (RM), we identified three vFcȖRs
encoded by rhesus CMV (RhCMV). Utilizing an engineered vFcȖR-deleted RhCMV, we determined that
while the 'vFcȖR virus could reach a similar peak viremia as the parental full-length virus (FL-RhCMV),
it was cleared from the blood significantly earlier. Conversely, CD4+ T cell depletion of pregnant RM
dams and subsequent infection with 'vFcȖR restored viremia to FL-RhCMV levels. While this revealed
that placental transmission does not require the presence of vFcȖRs, it highlights their role in limiting
antibody effectiveness in vivo. Therefore, the goal of this project is to develop and test CMV vaccine
strategies that will interrupt the action of vFcȖRs in cCMV transmission in the RM model. We
hypothesize that addition of passive or active vaccination against RhCMV vFcȖRs to an entry
glycoprotein-based vaccine strategy will enhance plasma Fc receptor-mediated IgG functions and
protect against cCMV transmission in a nonhuman primate model. Specifically, we will define immunity
against vFcȖRs in natural immunity and after immunization (Aim 1), define the impact of passive
antibodies against vFcȖRs on the protective effect of pre-existing anti-RhCMV antibodies on cCMV
transmission (Aim 2), and determine the ability of inclusion of vFcȖR antigens with a viral entry
glycoprotein (gB) mRNA-LNP vaccine to enhance protection against cCMV in the RM model (Aim 3).
This preclinical assessment of a novel CMV vaccine strategy will inform and de-risk potential human
clinical trials seeking to reduce the most common infectious cause of birth defects and brain damage."

Overall Component
Health outcomes are affected by myriad mechanisms, including behaviors. An important question is how such
behaviors might be influenced in ways that improve health outcomes on a broad population-wide scale. The
NBER Roybal Center explores this question by conducting clinical trials with analytic and theoretical foundations
in the behavioral sciences. All trials implemented by the Center have appropriate sample sizes and sufficient
statistical power to contribute important learnings about the mechanisms that drive behavior change and
interventions that may change behavior. The interventions are selected to the cost-effective and scalable, with
the potential to progress through the NIH Stage Model during the Center’s life. Our Center focuses primarily on
efficacy (Stage 2-3) and effectiveness (Stage 4) testing; some trials also involve elements of intervention
development and preliminary tests (Stage 1) and implementation research (Stage 5). Among the major
categories of research we plan to conduct are ways to increase healthy behaviors (e.g., increase uptake of
vaccinations, improve diet and exercise regimens), decrease unhealthy behaviors (e.g., smoking cessation), and
improve provider decision-making. A cross-cutting theme of our Center is to study the way socioeconomic
disparities contribute to inequality of health outcomes, and to explore interventions that best serve disadvantaged
and vulnerable populations. The research plan is strengthened by a partnership with Geisinger Clinic, a non-
profit health care network and insurer with a rich history of innovative delivery reforms and experimental research
to improve population health in an active, well-integrated, health care delivery and community health setting. The
NBER-Geisinger partnership provides the core infrastructure for implementing experimental interventions on-
site with an engaged and committed health care delivery partner. The Center also engages a collaborative
network of leading behavioral scientists and other experts who conduct clinical trials, share research activities
and findings, and collaborate on joint projects. The Center is currently in its fifteenth year and we seek to renew
the Center for another five years."
10890046,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The FMR1 premutation (PM) affects ~1 in 150 women and ~1 in 470 men in the United States, and can have a
significant effect on physical and mental health. Forty percent of males and 16% of female PM carriers are
diagnosed with fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) between 55-60 years of age, though who
will manifest the disease is unknown. FXTAS is characterized by executive dysfunction, gait ataxia, and intention
tremor. In the absence of clear markers of disease progression among PM carriers, it is essential to characterize
language. Language predicts neurocognitive decline in related conditions (e.g., Alzheimer’s) 10-20 years prior
to diagnosis. Language is a promising candidate marker of FXTAS as female PM carriers show age-related
changes in pragmatics and lexical-semantics, which have been linked to executive dysfunction. Executive
function and language difficulties may adversely impact quality of life. No studies to date have examined
language among both male and female PM carriers, limiting our understanding of potential preclinical markers
of FXTAS. As a first step, the proposed project will comprehensively examine language among PM carriers in
comparison to healthy controls. Without such data, this severely limits our ability to (a) fully understand the impact
of the FMR1 PM, (b) examine cognitive correlates implicated in FXTAS (i.e., executive dysfunction), and (c)
understand the implications of language use and executive dysfunction on quality of life. This proposal addresses
these limitations with three aims: 1) Examine pragmatic and lexical-semantic language among male and female
PM carriers in comparison to healthy age- and sex- matched controls; 2) evaluate interactions of age and
executive functioning on language; and 3) assess interactions between language and executive function on
quality of life. This study will be completed virtually with a cross-sectional sample of 60 PM carriers (30 males,
30 females) without FXTAS and 40 healthy age- and sex-matched controls (20 males, 20 females) between the
ages of 35-55. Participants from across the U.S. will be recruited. Participants will complete virtual language
elicitation and executive function tasks, and self-report measures of executive function and quality of life. Results
from this proposal are expected to inform the nature of language differences among PM carriers compared to
controls. It is also expected that age and executive function will interact to adversely influence pragmatic and
lexical-semantic language in PM carriers but not controls, which would implicate potential neurocognitive decline.
Finally, we anticipate that poorer language and executive functions will adversely affect quality of life among PM
carriers. This proposal is consistent with the mission of the National Institutes of Health to enhance health and
reduce disability by expanding our understanding of a neurodegenerative condition associated with a common
genetic variant, the FMR1 PM. It also contributes to the strategic mission of the National Institute on Deafness
and Other Communication Disorders by informing knowledge on the basis of language impairments among
individuals with neurodegenerative disorders and links with quality of life."
10890091,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Viruses cause an array of disease manifestations ranging from acute respiratory disease, intestinal diarrhea,
hemorrhagic fevers, hepatitis, cancer, chronic autoimmune disease and in some instances death. In 1995,
human herpesvirus 8(HHV8)/Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) was identified and hypothesized
to be associated with cancer in humans. Since then, an accumulation of scientific evidence substantiates KSHV
as the etiological agent responsible for classical and acquired immunodeficiency disease syndrome (AIDS)-
related Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), as well as other lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs) in immunocompetent and
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected humans. Despite all the scientific evidence it is difficult to fully
understand how the virus causes disease without the ability to follow a natural infection. As such, alternative in
vivo models that are readily accessible and can recapitulate KSHV infection and associated disease are
absolutely needed to identify viral determinants of pathogenesis and how these specific determinants, either viral
open reading frames (ORFs) or other viral-encoded macromolecules, are involved in KSHV-mediated
pathogenesis. Here, we propose to utilize a closely related and relevant virus that can manifest similar biological
outcomes in its natural host. The genome of the virus, rhesus rhadinovirus (RRV), has been characterized and
shown to be essentially colinear and encode most of the viral ORFs thought to be associated with pathogenesis.
More importantly, in vivo studies show that RRV infection of its natural host recapitulates many, if not most, of
the properties of KSHV, including persistence and LPDs. The long-term goals of the proposed research project
are to elucidate how KSHV interacts with its host, utilizing RRV and experimental infection of its host. This will
be accomplished by generating novel RRV recombinants followed by a series of in vitro analyses to characterize
the recombinants, and finally experimental in vivo infections and characterization of the host immune response
to recombinant virus infection. Importantly, in vitro samples and in vivo samples will be molecularly analyzed by
single-cell RNA sequencing, total RNA sequencing and Nanostring Technologies to define molecular and cellular
pathways affected by the unique viruses. Combining these types of in vitro and in vivo experiments to address
viral pathogenesis will enable researchers to dissect how viruses cause infection and disease in susceptible
populations and how scientists can shift the pendulum in favor of the host."

This K23 award application requests support for the career development of Dr. Benjamin Wright, Assistant
Professor in the Division of Allergy, Asthma and Clinical Immunology at Mayo Clinic Arizona. The candidate’s
overall goal is to become an independent, clinician-investigator and improve the health of individuals with
eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and food allergy through patient-oriented research. This award will provide the
training and support needed to accomplish this goal. Specifically, this proposal will enable Dr. Wright to
accomplish the following short-term career goals: (1) acquire training in methods and design of clinical studies
and trials in food allergy; (2) develop skills in basic/translational research techniques; (3) develop professional
skills necessary to lead a translational research team; and (4) gather preliminary data and biospecimens for a
subsequent R01 application and establish an independent research program in food allergy and eosinophilic
gastrointestinal disorders. Oral immunotherapy (OIT) is an emerging treatment for food allergy. Although most
patients can be successfully desensitized with OIT, many develop gastrointestinal side effects including EoE.
EoE is a chronic allergic condition associated with severe esophageal dysfunction. The specific goals of the
research proposal are to examine the mechanisms underlying the gastrointestinal side effects of OIT and to
develop a novel treatment strategy to prevent them. To accomplish this, we will perform a sub-study of a
placebo-controlled trial in patients with milk allergy treated with milk OIT with or without dupilumab. During the
trial, we will serially monitor eosinophilic inflammation, markers of esophageal barrier dysfunction, and immune
responses in peripheral blood and in the esophagus. To support Dr. Wright’s career development, he will
acquire skills in cellular immunology and complete a basic science internship focusing on cutting-edge
proteomic analysis of clinical samples. In addition, he will complete formal didactic coursework in clinical
research study design, biostatistics, and bioethics. Dr. Wright has assembled a mentoring committee
comprised of international experts in food allergy, EoE, proteomics, eosinophil biology, and type 2 immunity
uniquely suited to address the hypotheses set forth in this proposal and guide Dr. Wright’s career
development. This proposal combines the strength of the research environment at Mayo Clinic and an ongoing
collaboration with Stanford University that provides an ideal setting to pursue the aforementioned training and
research goals. At the conclusion of this program, Dr. Wright will have the skillset and experience required to
transition to independence and lead a translational research team. Successful completion of this project will
likely provide a major and sustained impact on the care of patients with food allergy by providing critical
insights into the pathogenesis of food allergy and EoE."
10890101,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over 150,000 infants acquire HIV-1 from their infected mothers primarily because combination antiretroviral
treatment (cART) remains inaccessible in some populations. Surprisingly even in the absence cART, only
around 20 – 30% of infants get HIV-1 from their mother although they are constantly exposed to the virus
during gestation, birth and breast feeding. Immune factors, such as maternal antibodies, likely prevent
transmission. Mother to child transmission (MTCT) cohorts are an ideal way to examine the impact of pre-
existing antibodies in preventing HIV-1 transmission in a natural setting because: 1) infants are reliably
exposed to the virus; 2) mothers pass their antibodies to the infant; and 3) samples can be obtained from both
the mother and the infant prior to and after transmission. Understanding the role of and the types of antibodies
that can prevent HIV-1 transmission remains one of the highest priorities especially for vaccine efforts. In
contrast to all animal models, MTCT investigations and antibody passive infusion clinical trials demonstrate
that pre-existing neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) do not provide significant protection against HIV-1 transmission.
The major difference among animal models and HIV-1 transmission is that humans are exposed to a diverse
swarm of HIV-1 variants, and some of the strains are neutralization resistant. In setting where the exposed
individual already possesses nAbs, they acquire neutralization resistant variants. In contrast, we show that
infants with pre-existing antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against their mother’s neutralization
resistant strains are less likely to acquire HIV-1, and they have lower morbidity up to 1 year after birth in the
absence of cART. We have further observed that transmission depends on both the preexisting ADCC breadth
and potency in the naïve exposed infant and the ADCC sensitivity of the variants circulating in the maternal
variants (exposure strains). We propose to provide more definitive support for the importance of ADCC during
MTCT by exploring if newly infected infants acquire ADCC resistant strains. We will further identify host factors
and virus characteristics that influence ADCC breadth and potency and ADCC susceptibility. We further
hypothesize that ADCC present in infected infants can eliminate cells with infectious virus that can produce
virus. Infants with higher ADCC against their autologous virus have a lower number of residual infected cells. A
smaller number of infected cells results in lower viremia and plasma inflammation, which decreases morbidity
and mortality in the absence of cART. Finally, we will use state of the art techniques to isolate and characterize
broad and potent ADCC antibodies. These studies will provide insights about the characteristics of these
antibodies and the potential novel ways to elicit them using state of the art vaccine methodologies. The
proposed studies will provide clarity about the selection pressure ADCC exerts during transmission, highlight
how pre-existing ADCC decreases mortality, and lead to the generation of novel protective antibodies.
Cumulatively, this work will provide new strategies for developing an effective HIV-1 vaccine."

Despite advances in early identification of and intervention for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD),
the long-term outcomes for children with ASD remain variable. As many as 40% of children with ASD are
minimally verbal at 9 years of age, and 75% of adults with ASD have persistent social communication (SC)
difficulties. Furthermore, as many as 70% of children with ASD have a co-occurring diagnosis of disruptive
behavior (DB) disorder. Parents play an important role in SC development and in the prevention of and
intervention for DB. As such, the overarching goal of the proposed study is to: (a) determine how best to
sequence two parent-mediated interventions: an SC intervention (Project ImPACT, Improving Parents as
Communication Teachers) and a DB intervention (Parent Training for Disruptive Behavior) and (b) examine
moderators and mediators of intervention outcomes. While evidence of efficacy and feasibility exist for both of
these interventions individually, an adaptive intervention approach that considers and optimizes both
interventions has not been evaluated. This type of adaptive intervention approach may be particularly needed
in parent-mediated interventions due to the cost, burden, and complexity of teaching parents to use multiple
intervention strategies. To determine the optimal intervention sequence that considers parent moderators and
parent use of intervention strategies, we propose a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART)
design in which we will initially randomly assign 184 children with ASD, between 18 and 36 months of age, to
receive either the SC or DB intervention. Following each respective manualized, 12-week intervention (first-
stage intervention; SC or DB), the interventionist will measure the parents' use of intervention strategies. At
this point, all parents will be re-randomized before starting the second-stage intervention. Second-stage
intervention decisions are designed to be responsive to parents' implementation of the first-stage intervention
strategies. That is, parents who are implementing the first-stage intervention strategies with high fidelity (high
implementers) will be re-randomized to receive the same intervention at a lower frequency (Reduce) or to
receive the other intervention (Switch). Parents who are implementing the first-stage intervention strategies
with low fidelity (low implementers) will be re-randomized to receive the same intervention with an additional
parent instructional method, such as modeling and in-vivo coaching or video feedback (Augment) or to receive
the other intervention (Switch). After 24 weeks of intervention (12 weeks for first stage, 12 weeks for second
stage), we will assess child SC skills, child DB, and family life participation in everyday activities. We will also
measure parent-child joint engagement continually during intervention to examine the extent to which joint
engagement mediates intervention outcomes. The proposed research is significant because if an intervention
for one domain (SC or DB) has an impact on the other, an intervention sequence that systematically includes
both interventions may have an even greater impact on both domains."

scales, ranging from the molecular level to the scale of entire microbial communities, in hopes of prolonging
the efficacy of current drugs or uncovering new potential therapies. In addition, it is critical to understand
how antibiotic resistance determinants evolve and spread in microbial populations. A number of recent
studies suggest that the response of cellular communities to antibiotics is often a collective phenomenon,
indicating that a detailed characterization of molecular mechanisms—while essential—may not be
sufficient to predict large-scale microbial behavior and evolution. In this proposal, we outline an integrated
research program aimed at understanding how collective interactions in bacterial communities impact the
dynamics and evolution of antibiotic resistance across multiple length scales, ranging from the large-scale
behavior of spatially extended communities to the single-cell architecture of biofilms. If successful, our
work will uncover new quantitative principles of microbial ecology, provide experimental model systems for
testing predictions of evolutionary theory, and clarify the role of community dynamics in shaping the
bacterial response to antibiotics. These results will enrich our understanding of how cellular cooperation is
disseminated in spatially complex environments, with potential implications for basic evolutionary biology
as well as other health-related fields, such as cancer biology, where multi-cellular coordination may
underlie disease. In the long term, the findings may even open the door to innovative therapies aimed at
destabilizing community structure in bacterial infections."

10891290,"Abstract: Linking specific phosphorylation events to distinct transcriptional states
The cellular behaviors that underlie health and disease are directed by signal transduction pathways that drive
gene expression. Linking signaling to specific gene expression is a fundamental goal of biology. Our ability to
identify causal links between specific phosphorylation events and the expression of certain genes would not only
better our comprehension of cellular decision-making, but would reveal a breadth of novel points of therapeutic
intervention for us to modulate cell functions and behaviors. We propose an innovative data-driven technology
solution through integrating global, temporally-resolved transcriptomic and phosphoproteomic data with
statistical modeling to systematically identify of signaling events predictive of context-specific gene sets. We will
validate the predicted links between phosphosites and specific gene expression programs employing novel
CRIPSR-mediated base editing technology to mutant individual phosphorylation sites at endogenous loci to
assess their impact on gene expression at an unprecedented scale, as well as corroborate using conventional
methods. As a model system, we will focus on cytokine induced signaling and gene expression in macrophages,
which are critical modulators of inflammation. Specifically, we will interrogate the cytokines IL-6 and IL-10, which
signal through common Janus kinases (JAKs) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)
transcription factors to promote contrasting pro- and anti-inflammatory functions, respectively. We will explore
the hypothesis that signaling events occurring outside of the JAK/STAT axis encode cytokine-induced
transcriptional diversity and can be targeted to modulate context-specific cytokine induced genes. Successful
completion of this proposal will provide a robust experimental and computational framework to identify and
perturb key phosphorylation events, and measure the specificity of signaling-to-transcription links that shape the
diversity of cellular responses. The workflow developed here will be broadly applied across a variety of stimulus,
cellular, and disease contexts, improving efficiency of the therapeutic development pipeline."
10892068,"AKI and CKD are highly prevalent diseases that are associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
Unfortunately, there are not currently any specific treatments for either of these conditions. Both diseases
are caused by a range of underlying diseases and processes. AKI, for example, can result from
hemodynamic, toxic, infectious, and immune insults to the kidney. In both AKI and CKD, the diagnosis is
based on changes in the serum creatinine and albuminuria, but these tests do not discriminate among the
various etiologies of injury. Thus, beyond detecting a reduction in kidney function, clinicians typically have
little information regarding the underlying pathologic process. Better understanding of the cellular and
molecular patterns in the kidneys of patients with AKI and CKD will provide key insights into these diseases
and will lead to new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. In recent years, multi-omics analyses have had
a major impact on our understanding of several fields, such as cancer biology, and have supported the
identification and development of new treatments. These same technologies could transform our
understanding of AKI and CKD, particularly when spatial resolution is complemented with proteomic and
transcriptomic cellular analyses. Although kidney biopsies are not usually performed in patients with AKI and
CKD, biopsy samples obtained through the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) offer a valuable
opportunity to analyze kidney tissue using state-of-the-art high-dimensional multi-omic platforms. We
propose to utilize complementary spatial protein and RNA technologies to generate comprehensive tissue
atlases for AKI and CKD. We will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1. Generate a kidney cellular map
via phenotypic and functional protein expression profiling. We will analyze biopsies using Multiplexed Ion
Beam Imaging (MIBI), which detects 40+ protein targets at single-cell resolution (250 nm) with tissue-specific
spatial information. Aim 2. Generate a kidney morphological map via phenotypic and functional gene
expression profiling. We will analyze biopsies using Visium Spatial Transcriptomics (ST), which provides the
whole transcriptome with morphological context. Aim 3. Generate an integrated cellular and molecular protein
and gene expression kidney atlas. We will apply statistical and bioinformatic approaches to integrate the
results from Aims 1 and 2 to create a composite map of the cellular protein and transcriptional expression
profiles in the kidney. To accomplish these goals, we have assembled a multidisciplinary research team that
includes nephrologists, renal pathologists, immunologists, and experts on multi-omics systems biology
analyses. The proposed experiments are expected to reveal subsets of AKI and CKD patients based on the
patterns of cells and molecular pathways present in the kidney, and to support identification of novel
candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets."

10892202,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is home to two-thirds of all people living with HIV (PLHIV). During the COVID-19
pandemic, HIV services in sub-Saharan Africa have been adapted to lower-contact alternatives that reduce
exposure to SARS-CoV-2, which maintained the effectiveness of some services but reduced the effectiveness
of others. For example, multi-month dispensing of antiretroviral therapy (ART) did not reduce retention or viral
load suppression, whereas many services involving navigation, social support, and mental health became less
effective when delivered in lower-contact manners. Three such services critical to achieving the HIV treatment
and prevention targets are HIV testing, treatment of depression, and ART adherence support. In-person HIV
counseling and testing was adapted into remote self-testing, with lower rates of linkage to care and
commensurate declines in HIV treatment initiation. In-person psychotherapy for depression (a condition
affecting 10-15% of PLHIV in SSA) was adapted into teletherapy, with reduced treatment completion and
effectiveness. In-person peer support for ART adherence was adapted into telephone and telehealth
adherence support, with lower rates of adherence and viral load suppression. As of mid-2021, SSA countries
continue to implement these lower-contact alternatives and lack evidence regarding when, and for whom,
higher-contact services should resume. We will partner with the Ministries of Health of Zambia and Kenya and
local NGOs to identify services that have been adapted into lower-contact alternatives and estimate (Aim 1)
incremental effectiveness at treating and preventing HIV, (Aim 2) incremental exposure to COVID-19,
tuberculosis, and influenza, and (Aim 3) which patients should use lower-contact services at what times. To
estimate incremental effectiveness, we will use program data to compare outcomes in terms of service-specific
indicators such as HIV tests performed, changes in depression scores, and changes in ART retention and viral
load suppression. Using an HIV transmission and progression model, we will translate these service-specific
indicators into comparable estimates of disability-adjusted life-years. To estimate SARS-CoV-2, tuberculosis,
and influenza exposure through different service alternatives, we will perform in-field visits to obtain
parameters for a Wells-Riley model of respiratory disease transmission. We will combine these estimates with
mathematical modeling to the risk of exposure under different pandemic conditions and the resulting risk to
health in terms of disability-adjusted life years. Finally, we will compare HIV-related benefits and SARS-CoV-2-
related risks for different COVID-19 pandemic conditions and patient sub-populations in order to determine
thresholds when higher-contact services should resume. We will furthermore establish targets for how much
the effectiveness of lower-contact services would need to improve in order to be widely recommended in the
era of COVID-19."

An estimated ~1.3 million adults and adolescents are living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection
in the USA of which 15% of them undiagnosed. The initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has
transformed AIDS from a fatal illness into a chronic and manageable disease. The presence of HIV infected
microglia and macrophage reservoirs in the central nervous system (CNS) and variable penetration of anti-
retroviral drugs across the blood brain barrier after cART are likely factors for the persistence of HIV associated
neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Drugs of abuse such as the potent psychostimulant methamphetamine (Meth)
that is abused by an estimated 30 million people in the world further minimize the efficacy of cART and in
conjunction with HIV exacerbate CNS pathology. Thus, significant gap in knowledge in the field is to better
understand the neuropathogenesis and the etiology of clinical outcomes observed in HIV+ patient’s dependent
on Meth abuse. The current grant proposal focuses on developing a human induced pluripotent stem cell based
cerebral organoid model to investigate underlying brain dysfunction during HIV/Meth interaction. Cerebral
organoids are 3-dimensional “mini brains” that can self-organize and recapitulate many milestone events seen
in in vivo brain development. Our recent study on generating a novel organoid model with the feasibility in
controlling the microglia ratio and microenvironment of organoid formation to recapitulate changes in brain
functions under various conditions (e.g. virus and viral infection-induced inflammation and synaptic pruning)
makes this model ideal for our proposed studies. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that Meth in
conjunction with HIV causes significant neuronal damage. The combination of microglia-containing cerebral
organoid model, extracellular vesicle biology, single-cell RNA-sequencing, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing
will decipher novel intercellular and molecular mechanisms and pathways that underlie abnormalities in neuronal
functions and connectivity caused by HIV infection. We will investigate this hypothesis under three specific aims:
Specific Aim 1 will examine neuronal function, synaptic and mitochondrial perturbations during HIV/meth
interactions in 3D microglia-containing cerebral organoid model; Specific Aim 2 will investigate the role of
extracellular vesicles in microglial organoids treated under HIV/meth conditions; and Specific Aim 3 will
characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying HIV infection-induced neuronal injury and further evaluate
our microglial organoid model as a reliable tool to identify molecular signatures of HAND. Our proposed
experiments will decipher molecular mechanisms, novel signaling events and molecular partners underlying the
neuronal injury in HAND. Through the series of the experiments we aim to present an easily scalable and
reproducible model to study HAND pathogenesis. The data obtained from these studies can be used to design
novel therapeutics to control HIV infection."

Lung transplantation is an effective and life-extending treatment for patients with advanced lung diseases.
However, improvements are needed in donor management, candidate selection, and recipient care to prevent
early postoperative complications and improve the long-term success of lung transplantation. To address these
unmet needs, the NHLBI is creating the multisite Lung Transplant Consortium (LTC) to conduct clinical and
mechanistic observational research across up to 8 clinical centers (CCs) and up to 24 individual sites. Central to
the success of the LTC is a single Data Coordinating Center (DCC) that will oversee consortium wide activities
including the development and implementation of a common protocol that will enroll approximately 3200 lung
transplant subjects prospectively collecting clinical data and serial biosamples to create a unique resource for
future research. With this application, the Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI), proposes to serve as the
administrative and operational home for the LTC DCC, partnering with the biorepository expertise and resources
of the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). The DCRI-Penn DCC brings unparalleled clinical lung transplant
subject matter expertise, longstanding prior experience coordinating multicenter research studies in lung
transplantation, and operational rigor in research oversight and biosample collection that will fully support and
enhance the LTC committee structure, common protocol design and implementation, and CC studies. The DCC
will be led by the Multiple Principal Investigator team of Drs. Palmer, Christie, and Neely, who together bring
considerable and complementary expertise in clinical and research aspects of lung transplant, data and statistical
methodology, leadership experience in the design, coordination, and publication of multicenter research studies
in lung transplant and lung diseases. The DCRI-Penn DCC team comprises additional experts in transplant
surgery, data management, regulatory affairs, site-based research oversight and monitoring, digital health,
patient engagement, web design and communication. Thus, the DCC team is optimally poised to collaboratively
partner with the NHLBI and CCs to complete the following Aims: 1) create LTC administrative infrastructure that
facilities efficient team communication, timely dissemination of study results and data, and public engagement,
including creation and maintenance of the LTC website that serves as a focal point for protected consortium
communication and engagement of the broader lung transplant community and key stakeholders 2) provide
thought leadership and operational input that ensures the efficient development of high-impact, operationally
feasible, and scientifically rigorous common protocol and CC studies, 3) oversee common protocol conduct
including use of a single IRB, site operations, robust collection of serial subject data and biosamples, monitoring
of data quality, and safety reporting in a manner that results in timely subject enrollment and ensures the rigor,
quality, and completeness of clinical data and biosamples."

field. We are also firmly committed to broad dissemination of implementation results. The AAMC
is ideally positioned for program success—and has the resources, expertise, and reach to
properly execute, assess, and promote wider scaling of this endeavor."
10892243,"There is abundant evidence that obesity confers increased risk for at least 13 forms of cancer. The
incidence of breast, colon, and liver cancer are all increased in obese populations, and the epidemiologic
evidence for the obesity-breast cancer connection is particularly strong. One in eight women will be diagnosed
with breast cancer during their lifetime. Breast cancer incidence increases approximately 10-fold for women
over the of age 60, compared to age 50 or younger. This increase in breast cancer risk is associated with an
increase in obesity. Indeed, obesity increases the risk of triple-negative breast cancer in premenopausal women
and estrogen receptor positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women. A rarer form of inflammatory breast
cancer is dramatically increased (up to 5-fold) in both groups. More importantly, obesity shortens disease-free
survival in both pre- and postmenopausal women. Patient mortality in breast cancer is primarily caused by distant
metastases. Obesity at the time of diagnosis is associated with increased risk of distant metastasis and mortality.
 Studies in rodents have confirmed these relationships, showing that dietary-induced obesity and high-fat
diets lead to increased incidence and growth of tumors in oncogene and carcinogen-induced breast cancers.
Despite this body of correlative evidence, the mechanisms of obesity-induced breast cancer risk remain poorly
understood. One possibility is that the obesity causes insulin resistance in the liver and compensatory elevation
in circulating insulin to control glucose levels. At the same time, other tissues, including tumors, may not be
insulin resistant and so are exposed to increased insulin signaling. Indeed, we have shown that reducing insulin
resistance by treating with omega-3 fatty acids reduces breast cancer growth in mice. We have also shown that
time-restricted feeding (TRF) versus unrestricted feeding of a high-fat diet improves insulin resistance despite
sustained obesity and equal caloric intake. Furthermore, we showed that TRF inhibited obesity-driven breast
tumor growth and corrected tumor circadian rhythms, and that the TRF impact on tumor growth was mediated
by reducing insulin levels. A number of important questions remain unanswered. Firstly, how does insulin drive
tumor growth? Is it a direct effect on the tumor cell, or on the microenvironment? Secondly, does correction of
the circadian rhythms in the tumor cell by TRF contribute to the reduced tumor growth? Thirdly, how do nutrients
and insulin entrain the circadian clock in tumors? Due to the link between obesity, insulin resistance and breast
cancer in pre- and postmenopausal women, and the translational potential of time-restricted feeding, we will
investigate the effect of deleting the insulin receptor, mTORC1 signaling, or components of the circadian clock
in tumor cells to test whether loss of these signals alters tumor growth in vivo and the response to TRF. We will
also test whether TRF enhances chemotherapy to inhibit tumor growth. Accumulating evidence from TRF-related
clinical studies support the translational relevance of our proposal. Translational, mechanistic findings from these
studies will impact on breast cancer prevention and therapy."
10885451,"The global burden of Alzheimer’s dementia and related disorders (ADRD) is growing in tandem with the
demographic transition toward an aged society where older adults ≥65 years old that are more vulnerable to
ADRD constitute a larger share of the general population. The fastest increase in ADRD and aging adults is
occurring in sub-Saharan Africa where persons 50+ years old living with chronic HIV infection (OPH+) on
combination antiretroviral therapy represent as much as 20% of older adults in some settings. OPH+ are at
further risk of adverse cognitive outcomes and potentially ADRD due to HIV- and HIV-treatment-related
biological and psychosocial risks such as gut-microbial dysbiosis, malnutrition, comorbid non-communicable
diseases and frailty. In regions with generalized HIV-epidemic, these multiple risks overlap providing both
variation and intensity of co-occurring potentially causal ADRD risk factors in the aging population and the
implication for ADRD prevalence rate and new onset ADRD is unknown. Presently, modifiable targets of
ADRD are few along with understanding of the mechanisms underlying potential ADRD risk factors.
 To inform strategies for preventing the onset and progression of ADRD in older populations, we focus on
gut microbial dysbiosis and vitamin D deficiency (VDD), including levels of bioactive VD, as modifiable ADRD
determinants. Both risk factors increase with advancing age and are magnified further among OPH+.
Specifically, we investigate how gut-microbial dysbiosis and low vitamin D impact inflammation (i.e., systemic,
intestinal and neuroinflammation) and thus ADRD risk in older adults with and without chronic HIV. We test the
hypothesis that: a) gut dysbiosis and VDD will be associated with cognitive dysfunction, higher ADRD risk, and
lower neuropsychological status and b) the effects of dysbiosis and VDD on ADRD risk is mediated by
inflammation and c) each risk factor’s relationship to ADRD will be modified by comorbid chronic HIV infection.
Our specific aims include:
1. a. To quantify the independent association between each risk factor (gut dysbiosis and VDD) and ADRD.
1. b. To test whether inflammation mediates the effects of each risk factor (dysbiosis and VDD) on ADRD.
2. To quantify the adverse synergy of gut dysbiosis and VDD in relationship to inflammation.
3. To examine whether HIV status is a modifier of the relationship of dysbiosis and VDD to ADRD risk.
Overall Impact: We will delineate how disruptions of VD metabolome and the gut-brain axis contribute to
higher ADRD rate through immune dysfunction in a large sample of older adults. The joint interrogation of
these risk factors is novel and directly enhances translational utility of this work since pockets of higher ADRD
risk will be identified and used to inform tailoring of future multimodal interventions based on differences in VD
metabolome, GMD, severity of inflammation, and comorbid HIV-infection."
10911387,"Project Summary
From a Drosophila mutant screen for defects in the formation of the embryonic neuromuscular junction (NMJ),
we have learned that mutations in components of the kinetochore complex are needed for the transformation
of a growth cone into a correctly shaped synaptic connection. Loss of these proteins also alters the structure of
sensory dendrites. In cultured mammalian neurons, kinetochore proteins also appear to guide development:
their knockdown by RNAi causes an excess of filipodia like protrusions to form on hippocampal dendrites. This
is a completely novel function for the kinetochore, a protein complex previously known only to function at the
centromere of chromosomes where it is required in dividing cells to “catch” and stabilize spindle microtubules
and thereby enable the segregation of chromosomes to the daughter cells. The neuronal phenptypes cannot
be explained by defects in chromosome mechanics and therefore we hypothesize a postmitotic function for a
“neuro-kinetochore”, a function that is likely to involve the same core property of the centromeric kinetochore:
the ability to bind to the plus-ends of microtubules and stabilize them. We propose to test the hypothesis that a
complex very much akin to that found at centromeres will function locally in post-mitotic neurons to assist in the
transformation of dynamic growth cone microtubules into stable bundles of synaptic microtubules and similarly
to stabilize dendritic microtubules and thereby arrest dendrite growth. The proposal makes use of the
advantages of both Drosophila and mammalian systems. Aim 1 of this proposal therefore seeks to characterize
in greater depth the nature of the defects at the embryonic fly NMJ and in hippocampal dendrites. Aim 2 delves
into the mechanism underlying the phenotype by asking whether structure function studies support the
hypothesis of a kinetochore-like structure that must bind to microtubules. Aim 3 focuses on the microtubule
cytoskeleton and asks whether there are defects in microtubule dynamics and stabilization in the mutants, and
how this novel role for kinetochore proteins fits into our knowledge of the processes that transform growth
cones into mature endings and determine the morphology of dendrites."
10891959,"Aging is the greatest single risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related diseases (ADRD). A
diagnosis of AD/ADRD reflects the progressive loss of memory, speech processing and visual/spatial abilities
as the brain deteriorates. People with AD/ADRD lose independence, and the loss of neurons leads to death as
the brain loses the ability to regulate bodily functions. Treatment options for people diagnosed with AD/ADRD
are limited and can have serious side effects. This is a significant problem, as lower rates of births and higher
life expectancy continues to transform the age structure of the US population, increasing the proportion of people
with advanced age (>65yr) and the number of people being diagnosed with AD/ADRD. The small, secreted
peptide adropin is a new lead for developing treatments for neurodegenerative conditions underlying dementia.
In adults aged 70 years or older, low circulating adropin concentrations associate with accelerated cognitive
decline. While the source of circulating adropin is not known, it is very highly expressed in the human nervous
system. Adropin expression in brain tissues shows strong, positive correlations with gene networks that are
involved in mitochondrial and neuronal functions, suggesting a link between adropin and how the brain uses
energy. Preclinical studies using mouse models suggest that reversing a decline in adropin expression with
natural aging delays or prevents mild cognitive impairment. This proposal address two critical gaps in knowledge.
First, whether low adropin levels are sufficient to accelerate cognitive decline is not known. Second, whether the
peptide is effective in severe mouse models of neurodegeneration has not been studied. AIM 1 determines
whether low adropin expression accelerates aging-related cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Cognitive
functions of adropin-deficient mice will be compared to wild-type controls up to 18 months of age (corresponding
to a human age of
56-69 years) using tests of spatial learning and memory. Biochemical signatures of
inflammation, mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunctions will also be assessed. AIM 2 determines whether
administration of synthetic adropin peptide to SAMP8 mice prevents or reverses cognitive impairment. SAMP8
mice exhibit many of the brain pathologies considered as ‘classical’ age-related and develop severe brain
inflammation, cognitive deficits, and behavioral changes around 12 months of age. The hypothesis that adropin
will improve cognition in this model of accelerated neurodegeneration is supported by strong preliminary data
showing reversal of cognitive impairment in 12-month-old SAMP8 mice treated for 2 weeks with the peptide. The
impact of treatment on neurochemical signatures of inflammation, mitochondrial and synaptic functions will also
be assessed. The results from these experiments will provide critical preclinical data that will inform future studies
of the role of this novel, important neuropeptide in risk of disease onset and treatment for dementia."
10867858,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Synaptic plasticity is a fundamental mechanism through which synapses can modify their communication efficacy
in response to neural activity patterns. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a well-studied form of synaptic plasticity
that creates a long-lasting strengthening of synaptic connections. LTP requires NMDA receptors, which activate
calcium-dependent signaling pathways that promote phosphorylation and insertion of synaptic AMPA receptors.
Weak stimulation induces a temporary potentiation known as early phase LTP, whereas a strong stimulus can
elicit a persistent strengthening termed late phase LTP. The late phase of LTP requires new protein translation
and well as new gene transcription. One of the most extensively studied activity-dependent transcription factors
is the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein (CREB). A major mode of
CREB activation occurs through phosphorylation of serine 133 (Ser133), which can be mediated by a variety of
synapse-to-nucleus signaling pathways and kinases. Upon phosphorylation, CREB binds to DNA sequences
known as cAMP response elements (CREs) and recruits co-activators to initiate gene transcription of numerous
target genes. CREB is canonically considered to be permanently residing in the nucleus within the brain, and
there is little recognition in the field of a potential extra-nuclear CREB function in the CNS. However, our novel
preliminary data suggest that CREB is found in both pre -and postsynaptic sites at excitatory synapses in
hippocampal neurons. To further investigate this surprising observation, Aim 1 of the proposal will conduct a
comprehensive CREB localization, epitope mapping, and phosphomapping study at pre- and postsynaptic sites,
using knockdown and knockout cells and tissues as specificity controls; test different pharmacological stimulation
paradigms using cultured neurons as well as electrophysiological LTP stimulation of hippocampal acute slices;
employ pharmacological approaches to inhibit various channels and kinases to determine mechanisms of
activation, and use STED superresolution microscopy to obtain a more precise view of CREB colocalization with
pre- and postsynaptic markers. To understand the function of CREB at synapses, Aim 2 will determine which
regions of CREB are required for targeting to synapses through deletion analysis, and use synapse-deficient
CREB mutants to determine the importance of synaptic CREB for gene expression as well as synaptic
morphology and transmission. We will also use unbiased mass spectrometry to determine additional CREB post-
translational modifications, isoforms, and protein-protein associations specifically in synaptosome fractions,
which will give insights into the functional pathways that CREB may be involved in synapses. These studies will
revise our view of CREB and expand the roles of transcription factors at synapses. This research has significance
for basic understanding of synaptic plasticity as well as promoting long-lasting plasticity in neurodegenerative
disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease."
10896010,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Modern cancer immunology research studies the complex interactions among the tumor, host immune system
and microbiome, and depends on an array of technologies that were unimaginable a decade ago. To design,
execute, and interpret experiments using these technologies, it is not sufficient for cancer researchers to
understand the biology of cancer; they must also understand the assay technology and the analysis methods
used to interpret the resulting data. The complexity presents a challenging task and a huge unmet need in the
education of cancer researchers, as what needs to be learned cuts across multiple disciplines: cancer biology,
immunology, microbiology, statistics and bioinformatics. To address this pressing knowledge gap for cancer
researchers, we propose a modular series of annual two-week summer courses that spans and integrates the
analysis of microbiome, immunology and cancer high-throughput data. These courses will include coverage of
the biology, assays, online resources, bioinformatics pipelines and statistical methods needed to rigorously
analyze and correctly interpret the results. Comprehensive educational material with integrated data sets from
the course will be made publicly available as scientific notebooks to cancer researchers everywhere."

10895891,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Clinical Core
The mission of the HU CFAR is to expand, promote, and facilitate collaborative innovative multidisciplinary
HIV/AIDS research among its members to bring an end to the HIV epidemic. Critical to this mission is the
Clinical Core, which provides essential resources to support and foster clinical and translational research
among clinical, social, behavioral, and basic scientists. The primary goals of the Clinical Core are to facilitate
access for investigators and prospective study participants to clinical research, to provide regulatory support to
CFAR investigators’ human studies research, to facilitate storage and access of specimens and research data
from people living with and without HIV, and to catalyze clinical and translational research at HU CFAR and
through inter-CFAR collaborations. These efforts include close linkages to and communication with
communities affected by HIV and engagement of research participants in underserved populations. Critically,
the services supported by the CFAR Clinical Core are either not funded or are inadequately funded by other
support mechanisms and, thus, the value added by this Core has been immense. In the past 5 years, the
Clinical Core has supported 47 NIH-funded investigators and 160 active NIH projects; importantly, 28% of the
investigators were Early Career Investigators. During this time, there have been 105 users of the Clinical Core
with over 306 documented instances of core services. Clinical Core resources were cited in 125 publications,
including in high-impact journals such as Nature, Nature Medicine, Science, Cell, Immunity, and the New
England Journal of Medicine. The impact of the Clinical Core extends well beyond Boston and Cambridge, by
providing a link to multiple international collaborating sites, both in terms of facilitating access to clinical
samples and through a series of innovative educational programs designed to enhance clinical research.
While the mission of the Clinical Core remains to facilitate clinical and translational research, the Core
continues to evolve and modify its programs to meet the emerging needs of investigators. To meet the ongoing
needs of CFAR investigators, promote scientific discovery and support the next generation of HIV researchers,
we will accomplish the following specific aims:1) Expand essential infrastructure support for CFAR
investigators conducting clinical and basic science research related to HIV infection, HIV-associated
comorbidities and coinfections, HIV prevention, and Ending the HIV Epidemic efforts. 2) Develop and provide
access to online resources for CFAR investigators and prospective study participants. 3) Support novel
educational and outreach programs designed to facilitate clinical and translational research at HU CFAR and
through inter-CFAR collaborations. 4) Provide mentorship and research guidance for Early Career
Investigators and those under-represented in medicine."

The Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core (B&B Core) is a cornerstone of the Harvard University Center for
AIDS Research (HU CFAR), consistently identified as one of the most important sources of value added. The
objectives of the B&B Core are closely linked to the overall CFAR mission: catalyze HIV research and enhance
the careers of Harvard-affiliated HIV investigators, with a particular emphasis on Early Career Investigators
(ECIs) and investigators Underrepresented in Medicine (URiMs) by providing biostatistics and bioinformatics
expertise for the planning, design, conduct, analysis, and reporting of HIV research (including laboratory,
animal, clinical, behavioral, prevention, outcomes, and implementation studies); assist in preparing grant
proposals; offer mentorship; and educate users in quantitative methods. The specific aims for the B&B Core
are: 1) Provide biostatistics/bioinformatics support for external and HU CFAR internal grant proposals. 2)
Provide biostatistics/bioinformatics assistance in study design and data analysis (whether part of a grant
proposal or not). 3) Provide database design assistance to ECIs/URiMs investigators considering the need for
future data sharing. 4) Provide user education in biostatistical and bioinformatics methods. 5) Provide
mentorship to ECIs and investigators who are URiMs. 6) Collaborate with and assist other HU CFAR Cores."
10895893,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Bio-Behavioral and Community Science Core
Since 2014, the Bio-Behavioral and Community Science Core has provided consultations and other support to
CFAR members for the design of research studies that utilize state-of-the-art methodologies to develop
interventions to limit HIV transmission, and increase serostatus awareness, engagement in care, and
medication adherence, while simultaneously addressing the social and structural factors that impede achieving
these goals. In the past grant cycle, the work of this Core has resulted in 10 HU CFAR Developmental awards
and 30 NIH K- or R-series awards, and multiple inter-CFAR collaborations during the current funding period.
The Core has played a major role in developing the following HU CFAR Scientific Working Groups: Substance
Use and HIV, Adolescence and HIV, HIV and Aging, and Reproductive Health for HIV-Affected Populations.
This Core has also been increasingly focused on community engagement, and its leadership is dedicated to
engaging affected communities in the research process and to engaging all key stakeholders about the need
for integration of bio-behavioral, social, and community-based research in HIV treatment, prevention, cure, and
vaccine development. Finally, the increased demand for consultations by this Core indicates a greater interest
in integrating this research. We propose a Bio-Behavioral and Community Science Core with the following
goals: 1) Provide consultive and mentoring services to HU CFAR members on bio-behavioral, social science,
and community science aspects of HIV prevention, treatment, IS and translational research both domestically
and in the global context. 2) Integrate behavioral and social science methodologies into existing HU CFAR
biomedical projects and other new cross-discipline projects.3) Provide consultative support for the
development of new IS studies, and to provide ongoing mentorship for investigators conducting IS research. 4)
Foster and maintain meaningful collaborations with communities disproportionately impacted by HIV, to inform
HIV prevention, treatment, and translational research across the CFAR and support the career development of
early-stage investigators from underserved communities. The Core will assist with grant proposals,
consultations on methods for qualitative research, intervention development, quantitative assessment
development, mixed-method research, and community-based participatory research."
10895963,"Although highly effective, biologics targeting IL-23/Th17 axis should be continuously injected to
suppress recurrence of psoriasis. My long-term goal is to cure psoriasis without recurrence guided by
personal immune tolerance. The overall objectives in this application are to (i) identify regulatory immune
cell interactions induced by anti-IL-23p19 antibody administration in the skin of patients whose psoriasis
is cleared without recurrence and (ii) develop pre-treatment predictive models for psoriasis patients that
anticipate disease recurrence after short-term anti-IL-23p19 antibody injection. The central hypothesis is
that IL-23p19 inhibition promotes regulatory immune cells in psoriasis patients whose disease is cleared
without recurrence, and their pre-treatment single-cell immune signatures are different from those of patients
whose disease recurs. The rationale for this project is that molecular evidence of immune tolerance
induction by IL-23p19 inhibition in human skin is likely to offer a strong clinical framework whereby new
strategies to prevent recurrence of chronic inflammatory diseases can be developed. The central hypothesis
will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Testing the hypothesis that regulatory immune cell
interactions are promoted by short-term anti-IL-23p19 antibody administration in the skin of psoriasis patients
whose disease becomes clear without recurrence; and 2) Developing predictive models with pretreatment
skin biopsy single-cell genomic data that anticipate long-term disease clearance off drug after
short-term anti-IL-23p19 antibody administration. To achieve the specific aims, we have recently developed
two innovative complementary single-cell approaches to obtain gene expression profiles of heterogeneous
immune cells from psoriasis and control skin without enzyme digestion. The first single-cell experimental
approach is microfluidic partitioning of emigrating cells from human skin after 48-hour incubation
in culture medium without enzyme digestion, which empowers single-cell transcriptomic profiling of
heterogeneous immune cells and keratinocytes in different layers of epidermis under ex vivo condition.
The second single-cell experimental approach is Combinatorial indexing RNA sequencing, developed by
the co-mentor of the proposal, which enables co-profiling transcriptome and single-cell chromatin accessibility.
At the completion of the proposed research, our expected outcomes are to have novel single-cell
genomic techniques to study immune cell interactions in human skin, defined single-cell gene signatures
of regulatory immune cells that are promoted by anti-IL-23p19 antibody administration in psoriasis skin,
and the ability to elucidate how pathologic immunity is suppressed at the single-cell level by highly effective
biologics. We also expect to have pre-treatment biomarkers that can predict long-term disease clearance
off drugs after short-term anti-IL-23p19 antibody administration."
10895967,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mitochondria are increasingly recognized as key players in a wide range of cellular and developmental processes,
such as cell signaling, stem cell self-renewal, and lineage commitment, beyond their canonical roles in
metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation. Such functional diversity is largely determined by the cell type-
specific mitochondrial features, including mitochondrial number, architecture, distribution, and interaction with
other subcellular organelles. These mitochondrial features are tightly regulated via mitochondrial fusion and
fission, collectively known as mitochondrial dynamics, the alteration of which will lead to changing mitochondrial
functions and activities in a cell type-specific manner, and thus impacts cell fate decision, particularly during
development and in stem cell differentiation. We found that upregulated mitochondrial respiration accompanied
by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) is required for postnatal spermatogonial stem cell differentiation.
However, such elevated ROS can increase mitochondrial DNA mutations that are deleterious to mitochondrial
fitness and cell functions. It remains elusive how stem cells properly balance mitochondrial activities to meet the
competing need for increased mitochondrial respiration during differentiation while maintaining mitochondrial
fitness. Our pilot data suggest that mitochondria fusion and fission are both upregulated in spermatogonial
differentiation, which is essential for sustaining proper male fertility. We thus propose to reveal a novel functional
mechanism of how spermatogonial differentiation and germ cell mitochondrial fitness are regulated by
concurrently accelerated and properly balanced mitochondrial fusion and fission. To achieve this goal, we will
integrate a series of genetically modified mouse models with in vitro spermatogonial differentiation and
transplantation approaches. Study findings will fundamentally advance research in both reproductive medicine
and mitochondrial biology by explaining how spermatogonial differentiation is regulated via stage-specific
mitofusion and fission, thereby unlocking a new area of discovery, namely, how mitochondrial function and health
are maintained so in order to support critical and unique events of mammalian development. In addition, by
revealing the impacts of mitochondrial dynamics on germ cell mitochondrial fitness, this project will critically
inform a novel strategy to treat impaired male fertility due to mitochondrial dysfunctions."

10897834,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Configurations of the gut microbiome and specific bacterial species are associated with CRC, and such data
provide fresh perspectives and insights into CRC susceptibility, response to therapy, and therapeutics. A central
challenge of cancer gut microbiome studies is to define the bioactive features of micro-organisms that influence
CRC susceptibility and progression. Fusobacterium nucleatum, a Gram-negative anaerobic bacterium, is a
normal constituent of the human oral microbiome. However, numerous studies now demonstrate that F.
nucleatum (Fn) is enriched in human colorectal adenomas and CRC compared to healthy colonic tissues, as
well as in stool from individuals with CRC, and that tumoral Fn-enrichment correlates with worse overall-survival,
progress-free survival and chemoresistance. My lab has been involved in studies detecting Fn in adenomas and
CRC, correlating fusobacterial presence with various CRC risk factors, and determining how Fn may contribute
to CRC using preclinical CRC models with a focus on its interactions with immune cells. Yet, much remains to
discover about the mechanisms by which Fn contributes to CRC. To date, the bulk of studies on Fn virulence
mechanisms in CRC have focused on its adhesins and its lipid polysaccharide. While such studies have revealed
important biology about Fn, there are additional mechanisms that may underlie Fn's contribution to CRC. In this
renewal proposal, we build upon our expertise with Fn, microbial metabolism, and immunology to further
understanding of how Fn contributes to CRC. Specifically, we will investigate the effects of three bioactivities, Fn
hydrogen sulfide production, short-chain fatty acids and Fic proteins, on the colonic epithelium and immune cells
in the evolving tumor microenvironment. In considering broader mechanisms used by but not exclusive to Fn,
we hope to extend the applicability of our findings to Fn-negative CRC and other malignancies."

This proposal support for a core-based scientist with our Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) as the
parent grant, seeks career stability for Dr. Kamiar Moin the Director of the Microscopy, Imaging and Cytometry
Resources core (MICR) of the Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI). MICR is the largest facility core of KCI and is
funded, in part, by the CCSG (P30-CA022453, Dr. Gerold Bepler PI/Unit Director; Dr. Moin is a co-investigator).
Dr. Moin established MICR in 1994 as the Confocal Imaging Core in the Cancer Center and provided cutting-
edge expertise and state-of-the-art technology in fluorescent microscopy, confocal microscopy and related
techniques. From the beginning with only a 200 ft2 space and one instrument, Dr. Moin has expanded and
significantly upgraded the MICR a number of times culminating into the current premier multimodal imaging and
flow cytometry service center with over 4000 ft2 space and 22 capital instruments. Dr. Moin’s mission through
MICR is to support and enhance the peer reviewed funded research activities of our scientific community whose
research requires advanced cytometry as well as cellular, tissue, and animal imaging and analysis. To fulfill this
mission, Dr. Moin strives to consistently meet several objectives, which are to: 1) provide expertise in analytical
methods development, technology development and validation, imaging and cytometry study design; 2)
provide collaboration and consultation for grant proposals and publications; 3) provide and maintain
state-of-the-art advanced instrumentation in flow cytometry, microscopy and imaging; 4) promote
opportunities for intra- and inter-programmatic interaction among our scientific members; 5) minimize
cost and effort for KCI investigators while increasing efficiency and 6) provide educational and training
opportunities in microscopy, imaging and flow cytometry. Dr. Moin is a nationally and internationally
recognized expert and leader in imaging and cytometry, evident by his service on 18 NIH study sections and
numerous presentations and workshops, with over 30 years of experience and more than two decades of facility
core management and administrative skills. His expertise in imaging and cytometry with a proven track record
in technology and methods development is critical to the CCSG and the 25 NCI funded investigator-initiated
research projects utilizing MICR. This application, if funded, will support 100% of his efforts and will offset some
of the costs incurred by the individual NCI funded projects by reducing the chargeback rates. The R50 will
provide career stability without dependence on individual grant and allows him to prioritize his effort on
those projects that require methodology and technology development. The funds requested for travel will
enable Dr. Moin to attend conferences in imaging and cytometry and/or core facility management meetings such
as the Association of the Biomolecular Research Facilities (ABRF), to continue his education in
imaging/cytometry and core management to be effective in his role to support the NCI funded projects."

 Patients whose lives have been permanently altered by limb loss are currently left with prosthetic
options for restoration of function, but these are not perfect. Prostheses are limited in sensation, articulation,
and integration, among other concerns. Complete restoration of the lost limb via therapeutic intervention
remains a distant goal of regenerative medicine. This goal would be made significantly more tangible if a clear
roadmap for how complex tetrapod limbs can be regenerated was elucidated. Such a roadmap would detail
possible sources of progenitor cells and the cues that activate them to proliferate as well as instructions for
how these substrate cells undergo the changes necessary for them to be competent to build a new limb and to
do so with morphological precision. Since humans, mice, and other mammals do not naturally regenerate full
limbs, the roadmap is not likely to arise from mammalian studies alone. However, salamanders, such as
axolotls, are profoundly regenerative and can completely replace amputated limbs with precision throughout
life, and, with experimentation, they thus offer a chance to build this roadmap.
 How processes that operate at the whole-body, systemic level to regulate progenitor cell activation and
blastema formation remain critical unsolved issues in the limb regeneration field. A blastema is the bud-like
structure that grows at the tip of the stump following amputation and contains the progenitor cells necessary to
build a new limb. The blastema is essential for regeneration, and, except for the distal-most dip of digits,
mammals do not form blastemas following limb amputation. Thus, understanding the controls, including the
system-wide responses and inputs, that govern progenitor cell activation and blastema formation in
salamanders is key to evaluating limitations observed in mammals. We hypothesize systemically-activated
cells promote local limb regeneration in axolotl salamanders. We further hypothesize that axolotls use the
hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) neuroendocrine system to stimulate systemic activation and that the
central nervous system coordinates injury responses to orchestrate limb regeneration. This project uses
modern tools, such as cell sorting and transplantation, paired scRNA-seq and ATAC-seq, and genome editing,
to understand the biology of systemically-activated cells. This project will also use implanted flexible-mesh
sensors and live neuronal activity recording for evaluating how the axolotl brain responds to limb amputation
and how its activity changes as limbs regenerate. This work will lay the basis for understanding how the CNS
may be required in the limb regeneration process. This project will provide important molecular and systems-
level insights into how a highly-regenerative tetrapod responds to amputation and, ultimately, grows a new
limb. It is therefore likely to have implications in regenerative medicine and evolutionary biology."

Aga Khan University (AKU) is a private, international, not-for-profit institution whose network of medical
centers and hospitals throughout East Africa and Central and South Asia grant unique access to populations not
served by any other health organizations in the world. AKU’s health networks offer an unprecedented
opportunity to engage some of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable populations and generate health data
that can drive effective, evidence-based interventions and policy to improve the health equity on a multinational
scale. To maximize the potential of these important health networks in their ability to conduct groundbreaking
research, AKU seeks funding to transform its existing research administration infrastructure through rigorous
capacity building and a broad revision of policies and procedures.
The specific aims of the proposed training program are: (1) To transform AKU’s policies and procedures
around the needs of grant-funded research; and (2) to build research administration capacity at AKU and
ultimately at other research institutions across Pakistan through the development and delivery of training
workshops.
Critical gaps in AKU’s current grants administration include a lack of widespread, shared knowledge of pre-
award proposal and budget development; post-award financial budget management, revision processes, and
tracking; financial reporting; metrics and data tracking; records retention and auditing processes; and ethics
compliance for U.S. funders. AKU also needs support identifying how to integrate and leverage data in its
existing systems to meet standards for compliance and reporting with U.S. funders.
The objectives for this project are to: (1) develop a strategic plan for improving research administration and
financial management of research projects, especially those sponsored by U.S. federal funders; (2) deliver
tailored training and educational resources to address critical knowledge gaps in the management and
administration of research sponsored by U.S. federal funders; (3) establish new business practices for improved
efficiency and transparency that better meet the standards and requirements of U.S. federal funders; and (4)
develop and disseminate key resources (new formalized business processes and procedures, an employee
reference manual, and training courses for internal and external stakeholders) to ensure understanding of,
compliance with, and long-term sustainability of improved business processes both within AKU and at other
institutions across Pakistan. These project objectives will be achieved through a collaborative, iterative
development process with the University of Washington (UW), a longtime partner, and will be supported by a
Working Group composed of senior managers and senior grants administrators from departments across AKU’s
Faculty of Health Sciences and an Advisory Board of senior AKU leaders who will ensure institution-wide
adoption of new processes, and long-term sustainability of this overall transformation program."

regarding the process of peripheral nerve regeneration have been elucidated. While the axonal regrowth process
has long been studied, it was noted recently that the regrowth and repair proceeds in tandem with Schwann cell
(SC) infiltration into the injured peripheral nerve defect. SC recruitment and directed migration has been a topic
of interest in our laboratories, with a focus on biased SC migration using topographical and ECM-mimicking
peptides. Our in vitro preliminary data shows a clear induction of directional SC migration using tethered
concentration gradients of both TGF-β peptide and YIGSR-peptide. Our in vivo preliminary data further
demonstrates that synthetic nanofibers support SC infiltration and maturation. Together, these data have
provided us with substantial motivation to further investigate mechanisms that mimic the neuroregenerative
process through the recruitment of SC. To pursue these goals, we have developed functional, degradable
polymers and versatile touch-spinning fabrication strategies to generate spatially-defined, bioactive, aligned
nanofiber conduits and we propose to use this platform to improve the regenerative capacity of injured peripheral
nerves. We believe that cell-free material solutions that enhance the endogenous repair process are
translationally-relevant and will provide the best options for translation of these functional conduits to the clinic
in the near term. We hypothesize that tethered, peptide-based bioactive factors in distinct concentration profiles,
in combination with topographical cues, will increase SC infiltration, and therefore, neuroregeneration, across
critical-sized gaps.

10869733,"Summary:
∆8-THC is a minor cannabinoid found in the cannabis plant, possibly as an artifact
resulting from non-enzymatic isomerization of a small amount of ∆9-THC. Outside of the
plant, ∆8-THC can be easily synthesized from CBD. As a result of federal and state
policy changes, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, and the absence of clear
guidance on the control status of ∆8-THC, manufacturers have produced large supplies
of this cannabinoid, which is now available to the public everywhere unregulated, in
spite of clear warning from the CDC and FDA to the possible risks of consuming ∆8-THC
containing products.
The synthetic process of converting hemp-derived CBD to ∆8-THC results in several
impurities in the marketed products. Our group has identified 15 impurities, eight of
them with no known pharmacological properties. The goal of this proposal is directed
toward the isolation and characterization of these impurities in sufficient supply to study
their pharmacology and their interaction with ∆8-THC. This will be achieved through the
following set of specific aims:
Aim 1: To scale up the isolation process for ∆8-THC products' impurities to prepare
enough supply for both in vitro and in vivo evaluation.
Aim 2: To assess the affinity, potency, and behavioral effects of ∆8-THC products'
impurities. This will be carried out using in vitro assays to study the binding affinity of
each impurity to human CB1, CB2, and GPR55 receptors. Efficacy and potency will be
evaluated using functional GTPγS and/or cAMP assays as well as calcium mobilization
assays in cultured neurons.
Further, in vivo testing of impurities' effects on body temperature, locomotion, catalepsy
and nociception will be evaluated in cohorts of male and female mice (tetrad assay).
Aim 3: To determine whether ∆8-THC impurities can potentiate, antagonize, or be
additive to the psychoactive effects of ∆8-THC through both in vitro and in vivo studies.
Our team has the necessary expertise to achieve these goals. At the conclusion of this
work, we will have a good understanding of the pharmacology of these impurities and
how they influence the effects of ∆8-THC."
10869741,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is characterized by a series of properties that tightly regulate the transport of
ions, molecules and cells between the blood vessel lumen and the brain parenchyma. This BBB is critical to
control the environment of the brain to allow for proper neuronal function, and to protect the brain from injury
and disease. Dysregulation of the BBB has been implicated in a variety of disorders including stroke,
Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. In addition, the BBB is a key obstacle to central nervous
system (CNS) drug delivery. The BBB has been extensively studied in a small number of model organisms
(mouse, zebrafish) in which endothelial cells form this barrier. Interestingly, several species have a BBB
formed instead by glial cells including invertebrates, elasmobranchs (sharks, rays and relatives) and sturgeons,
but very little is known about the molecular mechanisms of BBB function in these species. Furthermore, a lack
of correspondence between phylogenetic relationships and endothelial versus glial BBB suggests that the BBB
evolved independently several times. Hypotheses that may explain these observations include an ancestral
vertebrate with a glial BBB and independent evolution of the endothelial BBB at least six times (hypothesis A),
an ancestral vertebrate with an endothelial BBB and independent re-evolution of the glial BBB at least twice
(hypothesis B), or an ancestral vertebrate in which endothelial and glial cells each accomplished aspects of
BBB function, with current BBB diversity a result of a “push-and-pull” toward either extreme (hypothesis C).
Detailed molecular knowledge of the BBB in non-model organisms is required to better understand the
mechanisms underlying BBB function in vertebrates and their evolution. To achieve this we will employ single
nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) of brain tissue in fish species with an endothelial BBB (hagfish, trout,
zebrafish, and lungfish) and fish with a glial BBB (shark, ray, and sturgeon). We will also profile mouse and
octopus as outgroup comparators. This will allow us to define the molecular characteristics of endothelial and
glial cells in each species and perform a cross-species comparison of BBB-forming cell types. Furthermore, we
will examine BBB function and ultrastructure by injecting horseradish peroxidase (HRP) systemically into each
species and visualizing HRP localization with electron microscopy. Together, the proposed study will provide
unprecedented new information related to the molecular foundations of BBB function across life and will yield
new information on the evolution of the BBB. The resulting information may also reveal novel molecular targets
for CNS drug delivery and for treating BBB dysfunction in CNS disorders."

and unfathomable aggregate suffering. Unless the diseases can be effectively treated or prevented, increasing
prevalence in an aging population will escalate costs that the country will struggle to bear. With new
diagnostics and therapies emerging, there has never been a greater need or opportunity to pursue
groundbreaking ADRD research. This application for renewed funding of the UCSD Shiley-Marcos Alzheimer’s
Disease Research Center (ADRC) explicitly aligns with the National Alzheimer’s Planning Act (NAPA) and
builds on the Center’s 40-year legacy of dynamic research and engagement excellence. The Center’s
exceptionally rich academic and community environment, and its commitment to team-science and inclusion,
position it to work effectively as a member of the ADRC network toward achievement of national priorities. The
Center’s theme and foci are to explore markers, mechanisms, and models to better understand the
clinical and pathologic features and heterogeneity of ADRD, and to apply this new knowledge for a
diverse, aging population. In particular, we aspire to bring world-class translational neurosciences to the study
of heterogeneity and diversity in ADRD. We will develop and apply new markers and models, tailor community-
engagement approaches to foster greater participation of diverse populations, and advance culturally sensitive
practices in ADRD science relevant to Latinos – a growing demographic group in our region and in the U.S.
This work includes innovative human cell model work fostered by its iPSC Core and state-of-the-art
approaches in diversity science of its Latino Core that influences and spans Center activities. Integration
across all Cores is bolstered by strong institutional commitment to the Center’s continued success and to
cutting-edge, disruptive, transdisciplinary team-science. We propose the following overarching aims that reflect
and unify our activities in research, education, engagement, and sharing and synergizing with the ADRC
network. The Center will: 1) Support integrated, interactive Cores that conduct innovative, interdisciplinary,
inclusive team-science research to benefit the diversity of individuals affected by ADRD; 2) Educate, train, and
improve preparedness of a more diverse workforce; 3) Serve as a hub for scientific and community exchange
and support, applying synergistic Core efforts to engage, inform, and empower patient, caregiver, and research
communities; and, 4) Engage deeply in collaborative research across ADRCs and with other NIH-supported
initiatives, with special emphasis on applying Center strengths to complement those within the ADRC network
and extend its impact."

This proposal extends for a period of five years an interdisciplinary doctoral program begun in 1992, the Speech and
Hearing Bioscience and Technology (SHBT) program, which prepares scientists for innovative research careers in the
Speech and Hearing Sciences. Training is intended to enhance markedly the leadership potential of Speech and Hearing
researchers within both academia, industry, and organizations that set science policy. The basic premise of the program
is that today’s speech and hearing scientists must be fluent in a variety of physical, biological, clinical and cognitive
science disciplines to achieve the multidisciplinary advances that drive innovation. A keystone of the program is a
rigorous Core Curriculum that introduces trainees to these four aspects of speech and hearing. The program draws upon
the combined expertise of the faculties of Boston area institutions, including the Harvard Medical School, MIT, Boston
University and the Massachusetts General Hospital Institute of Health Professions (MGH-IHP).
 To date, nearly 140 students have graduated with a PhD from SHBT. Trainees have diverse undergraduate
backgrounds in the physical, engineering, biological or cognitive sciences, including some with traditional speech and
hearing backgrounds and AuD degrees. Training combines coursework and research rotations for the first two years
after which it concentrates on dissertation research, with the PhD degree expected after 5 to 6 years. The coursework
and research training combines a broad exposure to the many scientific disciplines relevant to speech and hearing
together with a deep understanding of the student’s chosen research area. An immersive clinical exposure at
Massachusetts Eye and Ear is a highlight of the didactic training program. Special attention is given to issues of integrity
and responsible conduct of research as well as training in methods to enhance reproducibility in research. A unique
collaboration with the MGH-IHP allows interested trainees to meet the requirements for clinical certification in speech-
language pathology through classes and clinical placements at this institution.
 Our ability to recruit trainees from underrepresented minorities has significantly increased over the past five years.
These efforts are being further enhanced through the recent appointment of a faculty Director of Diversity, Equity and
Inclusion, changes in admission procedures aimed at greater equity, and increased recruiting activities.
 A vast majority of our 140 graduates are pursuing research or research-related careers in health care, and half of
these have primary activities in the speech and hearing sciences. Many have faculty positions in basic science,
engineering, and clinical departments and are leading impactful research programs and successfully competing for
research grants. Some are combining research careers with clinical practice in otology, neurology, audiology or speech-
language pathology. Some are taking leadership roles in industries related to speech and hearing or in the broader
biotechnology field where they are developing assistive devices for communication disorders and drug therapies for
hearing loss."
10867262,"Project Summary/Abstract
The past decade has seen outstanding advances in the genetics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Most of
this progress has occurred by the study of rare genetic variation, especially de novo variation, with the Autism
Sequencing Consortium (ASC) playing a central role. The ASC represents a coordinated international effort to
identify ASD risk genes. In our most recent, unpublished, analyses of 72,410 individuals from ASD families, we
identified 185 genes associated with risk (FDR < 0.05). Some of these genes have been linked to a broad
array of developmental disorders, while others have not. Based on these results, we posit that some risk genes
alter the core features of ASD, while creating fewer perturbations to other features of development: discovery
of such genes will provide deeper insights into pathways disrupted in ASD. We will build on this progress by
analysis of sequence data from three resources: ASD subjects and families; subjects with other developmental
and neuropsychiatric disorders; and subjects from population samples. We plan new research focusing on
interpretation of rare variation, including single nucleotide variation (SNV), indels, and copy number variation
(CNV). Our key targets are inherited variants, including X-linked inherited variants, which to date have shown
very little signal, and missense variants, for which signal has been confined to highly conserved substitutions.
We anticipate doubling the number of ASD genes discovered, ~ 400, by increasing the number of families
analyzed and by refined methods to interpret inherited and missense variation. And, in parallel, we expect to
resolve critical aspects of ASD genetic architecture and to unveil key aspects of what makes ASD and its core
features – social deficits and restrictive and repetitive behaviors – different from other neurodevelopmental
disorders. To discover ASD risk genes with a distinct effect on ASD, we have the following specific aims: 1) To
amalgamate existing and emerging whole exome and whole genome sequence data; 2) To develop new
analytical methods and analyze the accumulated sequence data; and, 3) To contrast ASD and other
neurodevelopmental disorder risk genes, examining developmental profiles, cell types implicated, and whether
variants in the same gene differ in how they affect risk for ASD and other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric
disorders. With this new research we will accelerate our overall objective, which is the identification of ASD
genes, thereby facilitating our long-term goal of building the foundation from which therapeutic targets for ASD
emerge. Our rationale is that the identification of genes conferring significant risk to ASD and associated
neurodevelopmental disorders can form the basis of studies to understand pathogenesis, as well as the basis
for novel therapies. Our central hypothesis – formulated based on results over the past decade – is that rare
and common variation contributes additively to risk for ASD, but only certain rare variants confer substantial
risk. The research proposed is innovative, in our opinion, because it uses groundbreaking and novel statistical
methods for identifying risk variants for ASD."

Bioconductor is a crucial resource for statistical analysis and data management in cancer genomics research,
providing more than 2,200 open-source software and data packages. This software ecosystem is supported by
core data classes and methods that provide convenient representations and efficient operations for many kinds
of high-throughput omics data. Recent technical advances enable increasingly resolved study of the molecular
biology of cancer at the single-cell level, through combined assaying of DNA sequence, epigenetics, gene
expression, protein, and other aspects, even with spatial information. These developments present new
challenges in the complexity, size, and interpretability of data analysis. The overarching goal of this project is to
maintain and expand the core Bioconductor software infrastructure to meet these challenges, through the
following aims. First, we will maintain and expand infrastructure for multimodal experiments and spatial
transcriptomics, and connect the R/Bioconductor ecosystem with non-R image analysis tools to facilitate
statistical analysis of histopathology images in the context of spatial transcriptomics and other molecular data.
Second, we will transition Bioconductor’s data and annotation-sharing tools to a federated, language-agnostic
system that facilitates contribution and extension by the community, improves findability, enables automated
improvement in metadata, and enhances utility for non-R users. Third, we will create curated and integrated data
repositories that make key datasets more findable and usable, and drive the development of the planned new
data-sharing systems. Finally, we will develop a program of user training and new outreach approaches to
support the training of users and developers, including the creation of a large language model-based chatbot
and a cloud-based platform with persistent disks for courses and workshops. By fostering knowledge
dissemination and practical training, we aim to empower researchers with the necessary skills and resources to
leverage the enhanced capabilities of Bioconductor for advanced cancer genomics research."
10865484,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this K99/R00 project is to provide training to independence and enable the PI to test the hypothesis
that maternal-fetal exposures to environmental contaminants during early stages of fetal brain development
render the mature nervous system more susceptible to Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementia (ADRD).
Pregnant women are exposed to a large number of environmental contaminants in their daily life. Though the
placental-fetal barrier protects the fetus from most harm, some chemicals cross the barrier and can negatively
impact fetal development. The ‘Developmental Origins of Health and Disease’ hypothesis states that
developmental exposures are a trigger for life-long persistent effects, increasing the risk and susceptibility to
later-life age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as ADRD. These early-life exposures could permanently
change the homeostatic state of the nervous system in a way that seemingly retains normal structural
development but persistently alters function and disease-risk. We propose to develop an in vitro placental barrier
linked to human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) developing into forebrain neurons. The PI will assess
whether exposures found in cord blood can cross this in vitro barrier using mass spectrometry. Then, we will
study whether selected compounds (heavy metal, pesticide, plasticizer) induce a persistently altered homeostatic
state in developing neurons at early age using imaging techniques as well as assessment of functional outcomes
(through micro-electrode array recordings) and genetic and metabolic outcomes (using single-cell RNA
sequencing). Finally, the PI will combine both models and develop an integrated placental-barrier – forebrain
model and expose to selected compounds. Exposed cultures will be matured and persistency will be assessed
again. Findings will be compared between different culture ages and different classes of compounds to develop
persistency signatures and get better understanding on how different classes of compounds induce this
neurological health risk state. Completing this study will advance the PI’s training in important new directions
that are enabled by the expertise of their mentors and collaborators and will help the PI reach their goal of
becoming an independent scientist. The team of mentors and collaborators is composed of experts in the
following fields of: placental biology and barrier modelling, exposomics, physiology of healthy brain aging,
bioinformatics and statistics, and neuro(epi)genetics. In collaboration with mentors, the PI will develop critical
skills that are required for a successful transition into a position as independent academic researcher in neuro-
and reproductive toxicology. This training will be accomplished through a focused development plan consisting
of didactic courses, close collaboration with mentors and collaborators. At the conclusion of this proposal, the PI
will have developed a human stem cell derived forebrain model to study persistent neurotoxic effects of trans-
placental developmental exposures to environmental pollutants."
10868852,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Low back pain affects nearly half of all Americans per year and accounts for nearly three million annual
emergency department (ED) visits. In nearly two thirds of these visits, an opioid medication is administered or
prescribed, making low back pain the most common reason for opioid prescribing in the emergency care
setting and in the general population. Despite this medication-based treatment strategy, many patients with low
back pain continue to do poorly after an ED visit: nearly half of all patients report persistent functional
impairment at three months, and one in five patients report continued opioid use. Clearly there is a need for an
alternative treatment approach that improves low back pain symptoms and reduces the need to use opioid
medications. Multiple randomized trials have demonstrated that early referral to physical therapy in the
outpatient setting is efficacious for low back pain, but it is unknown whether these same benefits can be
extended to patients evaluated by physical therapists in ED settings – which differ from clinic-based settings
due to the acuity/severity of pain necessitating an emergency visit and accompanying psychosocial stressors.
We previously developed, pilot-tested, and refined an “embedded” ED physical therapy intervention protocol
for low back pain, in which a dedicated physical therapist is placed on the primary ED treatment team to
evaluate and treat patients with low back pain early in their overall treatment course. The ED physical therapist
uses a diagnosis-driven treatment protocol to deliver an integrated mind and body intervention grounded in a
biopsychosocial model of pain. In our preliminary work at a single site, ED patients that received ED physical
therapy, as compared to usual care, reported greater improvements in pain-related functioning and less use of
opioid medications over three months of follow-up. We now seek to evaluate whether this embedded ED
physical therapy intervention can be feasibly delivered with high fidelity at multiple other sites and demonstrate
that we can consistently collect electronic health record and patient-reported outcomes of interest. We will then
use the findings from this multi-site feasibility trial to justify and inform a full-scale multi-site cluster-randomized
clinical trial of an embedded ED physical therapy care model for low back pain."

Poor health literacy, medication non-adherence, and lack of interventions easily delivered by healthcare
providers negatively impact health outcomes in Hispanic patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Hispanics use
smartphones, download apps, and search online for health-related information more often than other groups in
the U.S.; however, health information found online and in existing digital apps can be misleading, difficult to
interpret, and is seldom individually tailored. A digital health app with individually tailored educational content
which is useable, engaging, and culturally adapted would likely improve comprehensive medication
management (CMM) delivery to older Hispanics with T2D by improving their understanding of the disease and
medications, and ultimately improve their health outcomes. The proposed project’s goal is therefore to
create a digital health app that will empower older Hispanics with T2D to manage their disease.
 Through previous funding, we developed a computer-delivered, individually-tailored, and culturally adapted
prototype health intervention consisting of three modules which target health literacy and aim to improve
adherence in older Hispanics with T2D. During preliminary testing, patients agreed that the modules were easy
to use, culturally appropriate, and relevant to their needs, while pharmacists agreed that the intervention could
streamline patient counseling and offered a tailored approach to provide CMM. In this proposal, we will
transform the prototype content into a modernized digital health app aimed at maximizing CMM in this patient
population by improving health literacy and medication adherence. Based on the preliminary testing, we
hypothesize that this digital health app will be useable and accepted by both the patients and their
pharmacists, and will improve medication adherence, hemoglobin A1c, and fasting glucose levels.
 Our proposal consists of two Specific Aims: 1) to refine and modernize previously developed health
intervention content and develop a digital health app for older Hispanic patients with T2D and their pharmacists
that is usable and accepted; and 2) to assess health outcomes by pilot testing the app in 40 Hispanic adults 50
years or older with T2D. The long-term goal is to create a digital health app to educate patients by
providing critical, individually tailored information in a secure format that is easy to use, cost-effective
and which will enable pharmacists to provide patient-tailored CMM. Following completion of the proposed
project, the refined digital health app will be ready for wider dissemination and testing in a larger-scale study.
Our team will also be prepared to conduct a large scale, robust, and pragmatic trial of the integration of the
digital health app into pharmacist patient care services to improve T2D medication use and health outcomes.
The results of this project will not only lead to a sustained, powerful influence on managing T2D, but will also
provide a foundational framework for ubiquitous application to different diseases, languages, and cultures that
can be leveraged by various healthcare providers to provide CMM in a systematic and efficient manner."

Title: Investigating spatial and temporal heterogeneity in mitochondria during aging using in vivo high-
content chemical imaging
The spatial and temporal regulation of mitochondria is critical for controlling various cellular processes, including
energy balance and metabolism, in specific locations and timeframes. Mitochondria have the ability to dynami-
cally adjust their shape, position, activity, and interactions with other cellular components, such as lipid droplets
(LDs), to fulfill the diverse functional requirements throughout an animal’s lifespan. However, the precise relation-
ship between these spatial and temporal changes in mitochondria and the physiological homeostasis of host cells
and mitochondria is not fully understood. To address this question, we have developed advanced in vivo chemi-
cal imaging techniques, specifically broadband coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (BCARS) and two-photon
fluorescence lifetime imaging (2p-FLIM), and a genetically-tractable platform utilizing the nematode Caenorhab-
ditis elegans as the model organism. While BCARS and 2p-FLIM provide organelle-resolved data with very high
information content associated with the metabolic states of subcellular compartments, the established in vivo
platform offers the opportunity to examine various conditions. Our research aims to unravel the heterogeneity of
mitochondria in different physiological states, including their interactions with LDs, subcellular localization, and
morphology in various tissues and cell types, and under different age and disease conditions within intact living
animals. The successful completion of our proposed studies is expected to significantly advance our understand-
ing of the intricate relationship between physiological homeostasis and mitochondrial dynamics. Furthermore, the
establishment of these novel imaging and analysis approaches will revolutionize the field of mitochondrial biology
by providing a groundbreaking tool for reliably examining mitochondrial heterogeneity in vivo."
10870876,"Project Summary PARP1 is a nuclear protein that is critically involved in cell stress responses. Its main
enzymatic function is to catalyze a protein posttranslational modification (PTM) known as Poly-ADP-ribosylation
(PARylation). In response to genotoxic stress, PARP1 binds to nicked DNA and is rapidly activated, resulting in
the synthesis of a large number of PARylated proteins and initiation of the DNA damage repair (DDR)
mechanisms. Recent evidence suggests that PARylation serves as a death signal in neurons. Importantly,
genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of PARP1 offers profound protection against brain dysfunction in
the animal models of many dementias, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis/ALS and frontotemporal dementia/FTD. C9orf72 repeat expansion is the most common genetic cause
of both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. PARP1 is a common disease modifier of
C9orf72-ALS/FTD, the inhibition of which (by pharmacological and genetic approaches) ameliorates
neurodegeneration in various models of C9orf72-ALS/FTD. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that
increased PARylation is a common pathological feature of ALS/FTD regardless of the underlying genetic causes.
Despite these findings, the PARylation landscape in C9orf72-ALS/FTD is poorly defined, and the underlying
mechanism by which deregulated PARylation contributes to C9orf72-ALS/FTD is elusive. To address this, we
will leverage our published work and the extensive experience of my lab. PARylation is a notorious PTM for
mass spectrometrists, because of its labile and heterogenous nature. We recently were able to overcome these
challenges, and develop a large-scale mass spectrometric approach towards comprehensive characterization of
the Asp- and Glu-PARylated proteome. Furthermore, we have elucidated the site-specific function of the
PARylation events on many important signaling proteins. Based on these results, we will develop a “bar-coding”
system for the multiplexed PARylation proteomic analyses. Using this approach, we will define, in a global,
quantitative and site-specific manner, the PARylation landscape in C9orf72-ALS/FTD (Aim 1). Then we will
generate the global protein expression profiles of C9orf72-ALS/FTD induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived
neurons (iPSNs), and identify the cell-specific PARylation events that are driven by cell-specific expression
patterns vs. cell-specific regulatory mechanisms (Aim 2). Finally, we will deploy bioinformatic tools to identify the
potentially functionally important PARylated proteins. These high priority hits will be subject to biochemical and
cell biology assays to understand their roles in C9orf72-ALS/FTD. We will also design and generate a web portal
for the dissemination of the quantitative proteomic results (Aim 3). The information garnered from these studies
will provide a fundamental understanding of the role of PARylation in C9orf72-ALS/FTD, paving the way for
targeting this pathway for the treatment of C9orf72-ALS/FTD, and more broadly, the other related dementias."

Our Genetics and Developmental Biology (GENETICSDEVBIO_T32) training program combines the expertise
of multiple Stanford departments to provide rigorous and innovative training in genetics and developmental
biology across a range of living systems. We believe that interdisciplinary training in genetics and
developmental biology is particularly urgent in 2021 and beyond. High-throughput sequencing and massive
studies of genetic variation are transforming much of biomedical research. However, connecting DNA
sequences to traits remains a key challenge in all fields. Our training program directly addresses the problem
of mapping genotypes to phenotypes through combined training in genetics, genomics, and experimental
methods for testing gene functions in a wide range of organisms.
The major training goals of the program are to:
1. Provide students with rigorous 5-year Ph.D. training at the forefront of modern genetics, genomics, and
 developmental research.
2. Develop fundamental skills in scientific thinking.
3. Develop skills required to manage and analyze scientific data in a rigorous and reproducible manner.
4. Train students to carry out scientific research ethically and responsibly.
5. Train students to effectively communicate findings in written and oral formats.
6. Advance basic and applied knowledge by training scientists who will consider a diverse range of
 questions, populations, and study systems in their research.
7. Encourage inclusion and diversity in our program and to provide inspiring role models for success.
We achieve these goals through an innovative combination of a joint computational and experimental training
camp; joint courses, retreats, seminar series, journal clubs, and research talks; formal and ongoing instruction
in ethics and rigorous design of experimental research; and monthly T32-specific “professional skills”
discussion meetings throughout graduate school. Our outstanding faculty and trainees have an exceptional
track record of combining techniques from different disciplines, and making major scientific advances that
improve our mechanistic understanding of basic biology and human health and disease."

Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) face many significant risks that are detrimental to their long-term well-
being and survival, including engaging in negative coping behaviors such as alcohol and drug use. 89% of YEH
report lifetime alcohol use, 77% marijuana use, and 48% report methamphetamine use. Drug and alcohol use
prevalence rates are 2 to 3 times higher among YEH than in their housed peers, leading to poorer mental health
and HIV outcomes for this population. Proximal risk factors for substance use in YEH include street victimization:
39% and 94% have been sexually or physically victimized, respectively; poor mental health: 80% and 74% meet
diagnostic criteria for PTSD and depression, respectively; and risky social networks: 62% of YEH report drug
use with a network member. Another risk factor for substance is affect regulation. Studies of general population
youth find that those with greater negative affect have higher rates of substance use. The role of affect regulation
has rarely been examined for YEH; thus, mediating mechanisms are unclear. It is possible that proximal risk
factors increase negative affect, leading to greater substance use among YEH. Understanding these linkages is
key to developing predictive models of coping. This project uses a socio-ecological framework to examine
linkages between Proximal risk factors, Affect regulation, and Coping behaviors. Specifically, we will identify
factors that influence positive vs. negative coping behavior for YEH to develop a data-driven intervention that: 1)
is relevant to this vulnerable population, and provides individualized support, and 2) can be sustainable outside
the research setting. Our team has pioneered the use of cellphones for ecological momentary assessment (EMA)
in public health research (Khan), and with YEH (Tyler and Olson). Increased cellphone ownership among YEH
alongside growth in urban WiFi hotspot coverage together create a public health opportunity leveraged in this
project's aims: 1) determine whether affect regulation mediates the relationship between YEHs’ proximal risk
factors and coping behaviors, achieved by analyzing survey data and EMA data on Proximal risk factors, Affect
regulation, and Coping behaviors collected via app-based responsive EMA (rEMA) in an observational cohort
study of N=300 YEH over 60 days; 2) develop a data-driven app-based just-in-time personal support intervention
(JIT-PSI) that delivers responsive messaging to mitigate negative coping in favor of positive coping. This aim is
achieved by developing predictive models of coping behavior based on machine learning analyses of Aim 1’s
survey and rEMA data; and conducting focus groups with N=30 YEH and meetings with N=15 agency staff to
design intervention messaging content responsive to a range of coping behaviors; 3) test the feasibility and
acceptability of the JIT-PSI, achieved by an observational cohort study of N=300 YEH over 60 days, using
surveys, alongside cellphone based rEMA, and JIT intervention delivery. Leveraging growing number of public
free WiFi hotspots and shrinking cellphone hardware costs, this project will yield significant public health impacts
by developing a sustainable, JIT behavioral intervention for the prevention of drug use among YEH."
10873983,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Opioid-related overdoses are now responsible for twice as many deaths per year as car accidents in the United
States. Encouraging downward trends in prescription opioid- and heroin-related mortality have been eclipsed
by rises in overdoses and deaths attributable to synthetic opioids and concomitant use of opioids and
stimulants. Nationally, the combined use of stimulants and opioids has nearly doubled in the past decade, and
more than tripled in Western states. At least half of individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) have another
substance use disorder (SUD), and polysubstance use is the clinical norm. Although the efficacy of several
treatments for SUDs, including OUD, has been established in rigorous randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the
people enrolled in these RCTs often differ from the populations those treatments are intended to reach. In
particular, little evidence supports the effectiveness of current SUD treatments for people who use multiple
substances. Consequently, understanding and enhancing the effects of SUD treatments for people with
polysubstance use remains a NIDA priority area (PAR-20-035). The proposed research addresses this critical
knowledge gap by combining cutting-edge data science methods with an innovative data-fusion technique,
transportability, to estimate what the results of SUD treatment trials would have been had they been conducted
in representative, clinically-relevant populations of individuals with OUD and stimulant use disorders (OUD +
StimUD). In Aim 1, I fuse data from National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network RCTs with the
National Survey on Drug Use and Health. I estimate the effectiveness of medications, contingency
management, motivational interviewing, counseling, and exercise to increase treatment initiation and retention
and reduce opioid and stimulant use in the adult, civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population with OUD +
StimUD. In my second Aim, I fuse the same clinical trial data with electronic health records to estimate the
effectiveness of interventions to increase treatment engagement and retention among patients with OUD +
StimUD in the Oregon Health & Science University health system. Through completing these aims, I estimate
the real-world effectiveness of treatments for individuals with OUD + StimUD. Clinicians and policymakers may
use the results to guide treatment selection to improve the health of these complex, vulnerable patients.
Through this award, I build upon my background in epidemiology and statistics to gain expertise in cutting-
edge data science and informatics methods. Combining causal inference, machine learning, and natural
language processing techniques maximizes the innovation, validity, impact, and reach of my research. I also
receive extensive instruction in clinical addiction medicine and build my leadership, grant writing, and scientific
communication skills. Each of these new skills are crucial to completing my research aims and developing
future high-impact, highly competitive research proposals leading to a successful independent research career
in addiction science."
10873984,"SUMMARY: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are important human pathogens, which cause seasonal epidemics and
sporadic pandemics. The ongoing threat posed by emerging zoonotic influenza viruses, for which humans are
immunologically naïve, represents a major global concern. Current influenza vaccines elicit narrow, strain-
specific immunity, are overly reliant on egg-based manufacturing, have a prolonged production process, and fail
to elicit robust cellular and humoral immune responses to multiple IAV antigens (Ags) simultaneously. The
variable effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccines, has highlighted the importance of investing in the early
pre-clinical evaluation of innovative vaccines which could elicit immune responses with increased breadth
against emerging viruses/variants. Efforts to develop a universal influenza virus vaccine, capable of providing
broad and long-lived protection against seasonal and pandemic subtypes, are focused on inducing immune
responses directed towards highly conserved epitopes on influenza virus Ags such as the stalk of the major
surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA), the neuraminidase (NA) or the internal nucleoprotein (NP).
In this R01, we will develop an innovative, optimized, universal influenza vaccine platform to overcome
issues associated with current vaccines. Preliminary data generated through R21 funding enabled the
identification of lead headless HAs for group 1 IAVs, and demonstrated that we can successfully encode at least
two Ags in a single expression cassette. We will now build upon these data and engineer bi- or tri-cistronic Ag
cassettes encoding our lead headless HAs in combination with NA and/or NP. We will augment and broaden
immune recognition of the immunosubdominant HA stalk, or long overlooked NA, by using employing a fusion-
Ag based molecular adjuvanting approach called “exosome-display”, which facilitates targeting of Ags to host-
derived extracellular vesicles including exosomes in vivo. Exosomes play important roles in the regulation of
immunity, and we have demonstrated that exosome-display can dramatically increase the immunogenicity of a
model Ag encoded by two distinct adenoviral (Ad) vector platforms. Optimized, “adjuvanted” Ag expression
cassettes will be engineered into Ad vectored vaccines with low seroprevalence in humans, allowing in vivo
tethering of Ag to host-derived exosomes. This could potentiate immune responses by increasing recognition of
the encoded Ag by the immune system. Finally, we will comprehensively evaluate and phenotype the immune
profile of these universal vaccines in single-shot regimens, and test efficacy in lethal challenge with heterologous
and heterosubtypic IAVs. Ad vectors have risen to prominence during the coronavirus pandemic, due to their
ease of manufacturing, cheap cost, the possibility for thermostabilization with minimal losses to immunogenicity
under cold-chain free conditions, making them ideal candidates for equitable global distribution. Therefore, the
Ad-based universal influenza vaccines described in this R01 would be suited to stockpiling for pandemic
preparedness, and could provide “universal” protection following a single shot."

 Support is requested for the 14th through 18th Annual Meetings of the Organization for the Study of Sex
Differences (OSSD). The 14th Annual Meeting of the OSSD will be held May 4-7, 2020 at the Marriott Hotel in
Marina del Rey, California, near the Los Angeles International Airport. Subsequent meetings are planned
annually beginning with San Antonio TX in 2021, and Calgary, Alberta, Canada in 2022. The mission of the
OSSD is to enhance knowledge of the biological basis of sex/gender differences and the contribution of sex as
a biological variable to health and disease by facilitating interdisciplinary communication and collaboration
among scientists and clinicians from diverse scientific and professional backgrounds. The primary goal of the
OSSD annual meeting is to provide a forum for scientists to explore aspects of sex differences research at the
genetic, molecular, cellular, organ, and systems levels in humans and model systems. The annual meeting
consists of one workshop, major Keynote and Capstone lectures, 16-20 parallel scientific symposia including a
New Investigators Symposium, and two poster sessions highlighting the work of new investigators and
trainees. The title for the OSSD 2020 meeting is “Sex Differences Across the Lifespan”, with a specific focus

Clinical outcomes in invasive gram-negative bacterial infections are determined by the interplay of patient,
treatment, and bacterial variables. Significant progress has been made in understanding patient and treatment
factors; however, little is known about how bacterial genetic variation influences patient outcomes. This is an
important gap in understanding microbial pathogenesis and limits the ability to identify drug targets critical in
human pathogenesis. To address this problem, the long-term goal is to interrogate bacterial pathogenesis in
humans by defining the impact of bacterial genetic variation on the outcome of patients with gram-negative
bacteremia. This knowledge can be leveraged to identify novel treatments. The career development plan
reflects this long-term goal as the emphasis is to develop quantitative and lab expertise to independently
identify and explore associations between bacterial genetics and patient outcomes. The objective in this
proposal is to characterize two putative pathogenicity islands (PPI), variably present in E. coli, that are
promising for their roles in pathogenesis and potential as drug targets. The two PPI were identified by the
applicant and encode genes homologous to a type III secretion system (T3SS) structural apparatus (PPI-1)
and translocases/adhesin (PPI-2). PPI-1/PPI-2 are not present in typical laboratory strains of E. coli and so
have not been significantly studied. Presence of PPI-1/PPI-2 associated with increased mortality in patients
with E. coli bacteremia, and deletions in PPI-1/PPI-2 allowed for complement-mediated killing of E. coli in
serum and impaired E. coli-host cell interactions (decreased invasion). Further, PPI-1/PPI-2 functioned as a
prognostic biomarker that improved ability to identify patients at high risk of mortality. The central hypothesis is
that PPI-1 and PPI-2 function together as a T3SS that mediates complement-mediated serum resistance and
tissue invasiveness to influence patient outcomes, and presence of PPI-1/PPI-2 provides prognostic value in
patients with E. coli BSI. This will be tested through two specific aims (SA): 1) Determine how PPI-1 and PPI-2
affect virulence to influence patient outcome, and 2) Define value of PPI-1 and PPI-2 genotype as prognostic
biomarkers for E. coli bacteremia. SA1 will identify how PPI-1/PPI-2 mediates resistance to complement
activation, verify that PPI-1/PPI-2 is a functional T3SS, and determine the relative contributions of serum killing
versus T3SS function to virulence. SA2 will use an existing external validation cohort to show that incorporating
bacterial genetics with clinical variables improves prognostic models of clinical outcomes in E. coli bacteremia.
Characterization of PPI-1/PPI-2 will increase our understanding of E. coli pathogenesis and pave the way for
novel therapeutics. For example, a protein in PPI-2 is homologous to a drug target that the applicant and
others previously exploited in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The skills and mentoring acquired during this award
will scaffold development into an independent clinician-scientist focused on the critical area of gram-negative
infections."

Radiation-Induced Immune Dysfunction (RIID) is a critical component of both acute and delayed effects of
radiation exposure, which causes a multi-organ failure (MOF) syndrome, operationally divided based upon timing
of clinical manifestations, as acute radiation syndrome (ARS) and delayed effects of acute radiation exposure
(DEARE). The immediate lethality of ARS is caused by bone marrow and intestinal failure, with subsequent
neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and loss of intestinal epithelial barrier, resulting in
bacteremia, septic shock, and systemic inflammatory response. To date, FDA-approved radiation
countermeasures are hematopoietic growth factors, such as, G-CSF, GM-CSF and Romiplostim that promote
myeloid regeneration in the marrow. Ionizing radiation (IR) can cause reversible and irreversible damage to the
immune system. Atomic bomb (A-bomb) survivors from Japan exhibited reduction in T helper cell subsets,
alterations in naïve and memory T and B lymphocyte numbers and function, increased levels of serum pro-
inflammatory cytokines, indicating significant residual injury and impairment of lymphocyte homeostasis in the
lymphoid organs.
We will investigate the immune landscape of regeneration in bone marrow, peripheral lymphoid organs (spleen,
thymus, and peritoneal lymph nodes) and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) of the intestine and lungs,
determine the functionality of antigen presenting cells, and whether IR induces mitochondrial dysfunction, inhibits
macro- and chaperone-mediated autophagy, and accelerates T cell immunosenescence and inflammation
following WBI under aim 1. We will also examine the regeneration of immune effector cells for mitochondrial
dysfunction, inhibition of autophagy, accelerated immunosenescence, T cell exhaustion and inflammation in
lymphocytes from peripheral lymphoid organs in mice exposed to IR and treated with radio-mitigators, TPOm or
Flt3L or G-CSF (as control), 1-day post-WBI in aim 2. Under aim 3 we will develop an immuno-conditioning
regimen to restore functional immune deficit for immunization protocols in radiation survivors, treated with or
without radio-mitigators. We will also examine the effects of metformin and p38/MAPK inhibitor to overcome T
cell immunosenescence as conditioning regimens with immunological outcomes measured by antigen-specific
IgM, IgG and Th1 and Th2 responses.
Relevance. Our proposal will define the functional radio-immunobiology of the regenerative immune system
after WBI in mice. Since the tissue targets of radiation injury are well studied, we can also correlate whether T
cell immunosenescence and dysfunction of myeloid population contributes to DEARE. These studies will provide
a blueprint for developing optimized immuno-conditioning regimens for immunization protocols in radiation
survivors that can be extended to immunocompromised and elderly population."

The University of Rochester is distinguishing itself as an internationally recognized center for excellence in
research and training the next generation of scientists studying the molecular bases of disease. However, with
increasingly rapid advancements in scientific techniques, the need for greater attention to rigor and
reproducibility in research, and the recognition that students use their PhD for diverse careers in the
biomedical sciences, there is a need to augment the institutional training of graduate students. Therefore, we
propose a T32-sponsored Training Program that will significantly enhance our institutional training activities to
better prepare students for a new era. Our proposed Training Program will develop students’ skills in initiating,
conducting, interpreting, and presenting rigorous and reproducible biomedical research with increasing self-
direction. Moreover, T32 mentors will guide students to become more collaborative, and to understand fields
ranging from cellular biology, to the molecular behavior of molecules, to computational analyses of large data
sets. We will teach students to think broadly in terms of career choices, and to be inculcated in the skills and
knowledge required for success in a professional environment. Our program will imbue trainees with an
appreciation for the value of diversity in the work force, with skills in the ethical conduct of research, and in
workplace professionalism. We will accomplish these goals through T32-sponsored courses and activities that
ensure a broad knowledge of emerging technologies, cutting edge methods, and skills required for rigorous
experimental design, execution, and communication of results. We propose novel programs for the training of
mentors and monitoring of mentee progress. These activities and learning opportunities will be integrated
throughout each student’s graduate experience, and not just during the 2-year appointment period. In addition,
we leverage the vast majority of proposed activities by making them available to all students, regardless of
training grant eligibility. We will develop skills in self-initiated investigation so that students can independently
enhance their foundational knowledge and skill sets as life-long learners. The proposed Training Program will
not only build on our 14-years of success with our existing T32, such as our centerpiece Graduate Women in
Science program, but also add many new essential elements to the existing training program."

Nearly 30% of children with cerebral palsy (CP) will have severe CP and will be unable to
functionally walk or self-propel a manual wheelchair. For these children, a powered wheelchair
(PWC) provides their only option for functional mobility and independence. PWCs have been
shown to provide functional, independent mobility for children who are unable to functionally
walk or self-propel a manual wheelchair. Despite these known benefits, PWC use is often
restricted to a small percentage of children who can quickly demonstrate proficient PWC skills
within a single 30-minute PWC trial using a generic PWC that may or may not meet their custom
safety and seating needs. The IndieTrainer System, developed in our Phase II National
Institutes of Health Small Business Innovation Research (NIH SBIR) grant, is comprised of a
mobility device that temporarily converts a manual wheelchair into a PWC, and a range of
simple video-based gamified training modules, each specifically designed to facilitate PWC
training. By temporarily converting a child’s manual wheelchair into a PWC, children remain in
their own manual wheelchair and use their own custom seating system while driving. Our pilot
work with the IndieTrainer System indicates that PWC skills training provided via the
IndieTrainer System may be a powerful tool to support children in learning PWC skills while
safely seated in their own customized manual wheelchair. In this project, we will conduct a 2-
arm, parallel group, single blinded, pre-test-post-test randomized controlled trial to test our
central hypothesis that an 8-week evidence-based PWC skills training intervention using the
IndieTrainer System will produce greater improvements in children’s PWC skills capacity
immediately after the 8-week intervention and at an 8-week follow-up assessment as compared
to the waitlist control group. Aim 1. Quantify and compare PWC skills capacity outcomes at
post-intervention and follow-up. Aim 2. Quantify and compare parental/caregiver perceptions of
change in their children’s PWC capacity from pre- to post-intervention. Aim 3. Quantify and
compare children’s perceptions of change in their PWC skills capacity from pre- to post-
intervention."

Alcohol use disorder is one of the major health concerns for veterans, as well as for the general
population. An integral part of the mission of the VA is to provide care for VA patients suffering
from alcohol and/or drug abuse problems with and without comorbid anxiety. The overall aim of
Dr. Pandey’s research program is to elucidate the epigenetic mechanisms that underlie the
pathophysiology of alcohol use disorder (AUD) and co-morbid anxiety disorders. Numerous
studies performed by Dr. Pandey’s laboratory have found that ethanol exposure results in
epigenetic alterations involving histone acetylation/methylation, DNA methylation, and non-
coding RNAs that modulate gene expression in the amygdala. The major focus of his
laboratory is the role of these epigenetic mechanisms and non-coding RNAs in
transcriptomic changes in specific neural circuitries, particularly in the amygdala, and
the subsequent induction of behavioral phenotypes that underlie ethanol withdrawal-
induced anxiety and the co-morbidity of anxiety and AUD. His lab investigates the
differential epigenetic effects of acute and chronic alcohol exposure and withdrawal in both
early-life and adult animal models, as well as in adult animals that were exposed to alcohol in
adolescence. These findings are then translated to humans using postmortem brains of
individuals with AUD and control subjects. In addition to his own laboratory’s research, Dr.
Pandey has programmed several events for the educational enrichment of next-
generation and current researchers in the field and is involved in many collaborative
studies with VA and UIC researchers. Taken together, these research projects are shaping
the field’s understanding of AUD and will inform the development of novel pharmacological
interventions for the treatment of AUD, with and without comorbid anxiety, in veterans and in the
general population."
10881722,"Novel agents that can overcome the immunological barrier to CD8+ T cell infiltration and effector function have
the potential to improve clinical outcomes for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. We have found
that targeting MNK kinases, which regulate mRNA translation, increases CD8+ T cell infiltration and expression
of T cell chemo-attractants. However, MNK inhibitors induce tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to express
the immunosuppressive protein Arginase-1, suggesting that MNK inhibitors polarize TAMs to cause CD8+ T cell
exhaustion. The main objective in this application is to identify mechanisms by which the MNK kinase pathway
regulates tumor infiltration by CD8+ T cells and modulates their effector function. The central hypothesis is that
targeting the MNK kinase pathway can overcome the immunological barriers to CD8+ T cell infiltration. A second
hypothesis is that MNK inhibitors demonstrate synergistic anti-tumor responses with therapies that overcome
CD8+ T cell exhaustion. Two specific aims are proposed: 1) Determine the mechanism by which the MNK kinase
pathway in cancer cells limits CD8+ T cell infiltration in PDAC tumors. 2) Determine the role of the MNK pathway
in TAMs and its regulation of the effector function of infiltrating CD8+ T cells in PDAC tumors. Under the first
aim, the mechanisms by which targeting the MNK pathway in PDAC cells increases T cell chemo-attractants will
be evaluated, focusing on the role of the downstream MNK target hnRNPA1. The effects of targeting hnRNPA1
in cancer cells on CD8+ T cell infiltration will also be assessed in the syngeneic orthotopic mouse model. In
additional studies, the effects of the combination therapy with a MNK inhibitor and an anti-PD-1 antibody on
CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation will be evaluated in the KPC transgenic mouse model of PDAC. For the
second aim, the contribution of MNK kinases and the MNK effector hnRNPA1 in macrophages to their
polarization and modulation of the CD8+ T cell effector function will be evaluated. The effects of combining MNK
and Arginase-1 inhibitors in ex vivo slice cultures of human PDAC tumors will also be assessed. In additional
studies, the efficacy of the triple regimen of a MNK inhibitor, an anti-PD-1 antibody, and an Arginase-1 inhibitor
will be evaluated in the KPC transgenic and the syngeneic orthotopic mouse models. There are several
innovative elements in this proposal, including novel concepts on the role of the MNK kinase pathway in
regulating CD8+ T cell infiltration and effector function, unique experimental approaches, and novel therapeutic
approaches to enhance immunotherapy responses in PDAC patients. This proposed research is significant
because it will have important clinical-translational implications and should result in the development of
mechanism-based novel combination therapies for PDAC patients."
10881724,"My primary research interests address chronic inflammatory lung disease, and the impact that behavioral and
environmental exposures play in the compromise of lung innate defense against pathologic lung infections and
injury. Utilizing pre-clinical mouse models and state-of-the-art molecular, biochemical, and cellular approaches,
I collaborate closely with pulmonologists who practice at the VA to conduct relevant pre-clinical research that
can be used to address current clinical concerns. I translate my findings to Veterans’ health using a well-
characterized human lung cell and tissue biobank obtained from our lung transplant program. We have an
existing cohort of Veterans with rural/agricultural occupational exposures to conduct relevant studies to our
service region. There are 3 major research projects currently underway that impact veterans’ health:
Malondialdehyde-acetaldehyde adducts and lung injury. Alcohol abuse causing increased susceptibility to
pneumonia has been known for over 200 years. Because the majority (>90%) individuals misusing alcohol
smoke cigarettes, we study the combination lung injury effects of both cigarettes and alcohol. We identified that
the lungs represent a unique environment for the formation of stable malondialdehyde-acetaldehyde protein
adducts (MAA adducts), but only under conditions of combined cigarette smoke and alcohol exposure. These
MAA adducts cause airway epithelial cell cilia slowing and impair the innate pathogen clearance from the lung.
Surfactant protein D (SPD) is a major lung protein that gets adducted when lung aldehyde concentrations are
elevated during combined smoke and alcohol exposure and SPD-MAA adducts are detected in the lung only in
drinkers who also smoke, leading to alterations in innate lung defense. (Funded by BX003635). Veterans-
centric COVID-19 research. The pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and clinical outcomes from COVID
19 are far worse in individuals with certain pre-existing conditions and those of advanced age. It is essential to
the health of Veterans to fully define which at-risk conditions particularly impact them and their unique needs to
empower clinical preventive care during this and future viral pandemics. Old age and alcohol misuse are
associated with cilia dysfunction. SPD has been documented to specifically bind to and neutralize the Spike
protein of coronavirus. We hypothesize that altered innate lung defense at the level of mucociliary clearance,
anti-microbial surfactants, and viral receptor function will negatively impact susceptibility and pathogenesis of
SARS-CoV-2, placing Veterans particularly in harm’s way. We are currently identifying differences in SARS-
CoV-2 infection responses between normal airway epithelium and lung macrophages and those cells collected
from individuals with COPD, with alcohol use disorder, or of old age. Defining the modalities of risk will
empower clinicians to make informed clinical preventive care decisions for Veterans (Funded by BX005413).
Agricultural organic dust-mediated lung injury. VISN 23 encompasses a region responsible for the largest
agricultural output in the nation. In collaboration with Omaha VA physician scientists, we have built a cohort of
Veterans with agricultural exposures to explore the impact of organic dusts on chronic lung inflammatory injury.
Using established mouse models, we have identified the therapeutic impact of IL-10 on lung repair from dust-
mediated injury. We are currently defining the mechanisms of action through an active NIOSH R01 study and
the Central States Center for Agricultural safety and Health (Funded by OH010162). With these innovative
research programs, I have been able to provide training and mentoring to many undergraduates, graduate
students, fellows, junior scientists and physicians at the Omaha VAMC and affiliated University of Nebraska
Medical Center (UNMC). Our efforts to investigate the underlying mechanisms and identify targets for
pulmonary disease have brought together physician scientists and basic scientists at the Omaha VA medical
center and UNMC, which has led to the development of a VA-funded live-animal microCT Core facility, which I
supervise and is the only such instrument in Omaha."

Posttraumatic distress disproportionately affects Latinx immigrants seeking asylum in the U.S. due to high
rates of trauma exposure in their home countries and continued trauma embedded in the asylum-seeking
experience. The proposed study will collect longitudinal data from 400 undocumented Latinx immigrant adults
seeking asylum in the U.S. to examine how trauma exposure at various stages— prior to, embedded in the
asylum-seeking experience, and while settling in the U.S.— concurrently and prospectively influences risk for
posttraumatic distress and quality of life via the biological pathway of inflammation. In collaboration with
established community partners, participants will be recruited from immigrant camps/shelters on both sides of
the Mexico-U.S. border. Follow-up data collected one year later, at which point the entire sample is expected to
be in the U.S. awaiting further immigration court hearings, will assess trauma exposure and discrimination
while settling in the U.S., posttraumatic distress, and quality of life. Using the inflammatory hypothesis of
persistent posttraumatic distress (Gill et al., 2009) as a conceptual framework, the proposed study incorporates
state-of-the-art biological markers and mixed methods to provide novel information about mechanisms that
underlie health risk and foster resilience across domains and levels. Specific Aim 1 is to concurrently and
prospectively evaluate the effect of trauma exposure prior to and embedded in the asylum-seeking experience
on immigrants’ posttraumatic distress and quality of life. Specific Aim 2 is to concurrently and prospectively
evaluate the effect of trauma exposure prior to and embedded in the asylum-seeking experience on
immigrants’ biological (immune) function, testing inflammation as a mechanism of health disparity. Specific Aim
3 is to identify factors within the sociocultural and personal environment domains (at individual/interpersonal
levels) that moderate links identified in Aim 2. Specific Aim 4 is to assess how (post-migration) trauma
exposure and discrimination while settling in the U.S. prospectively affect posttraumatic stress and quality of
life. Knowledge gained will (1) propel scientific evidence regarding how multi-domain, multi-level factors
influence the health of vulnerable populations with the goal of reducing existing disparities; (2) inform the
development of culture and context sensitive interventions; and (3) inform advocacy and policy efforts. This is
the first prospective, longitudinal study to use a multi-domain, multi-level approach including biology to identify
mechanisms of health risk and resilience among Latinx immigrants seeking asylum in the U.S. We innovate by
assessing how trauma exposure at various stages— prior to, embedded in the asylum-seeking experience,
and while settling in the U.S.— relates to disparities in health outcomes. Further, we probe new sources of
potential trauma for migrants including family separation, detention, and migration experiences in Mexico. By
innovatively studying resilience at the biological level in this population, this study takes the first steps towards
the development of novel therapeutics to address disparities in posttraumatic distress and quality of life."
10878038,"ABSTRACT
Acute kidney injury (AKI) most commonly occurs in the hospital setting. Hospital-acquired AKI accounts for 22%
of all cases worldwide, and nearly 50% of critically ill inpatients are estimated to suffer from AKI. AKI is associated
with high rates of morbidity and mortality, and causes 2 million deaths per year. The hospitalization cost of AKI
treatment in the US per year is approximately 24 billion. While the kidney may recover, the patients are at a
higher risk for subsequently developing chronic kidney disease (CKD). Other times, the acute injury is so severe
that there is no kidney recovery and ultimately end stage renal disease (ESRD) ensues. Patients that progress
to CKD have hospitalization costs of approximately 100 billion dollars a year in the US. A definitive and effective
treatment for AKI is still lacking, nor are there available interventions to decrease the risk of progression to CKD
after AKI. Current strategies focus on prevention, early diagnosis, and early interventions aimed at managing
the underlying etiologies and complications of AKI. Metabolic signaling during AKI has emerged as an exciting
and potentially druggable target to not only reverse but inhibit proximal tubule damage associated with AKI and
block the subsequent progression to CKD. The majority of metabolic studies in the literature have focused on
protecting the mitochondria, which are known to be damaged during AKI. However, we recently showed that
boosting peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation (FAO) protects against injury in two different mouse models of AKI.
Here, we exploited this protective mechanism by supplementing the diet with peroxisomally-targeted medium-
chain dicarboxylic fatty acids (DCAs). In ischemia/reperfusion injury and nephrotoxic (cisplatin) mouse AKI
models, 7 days of dietary supplementation with an 8-carbon DCA called octanedioc acid (DC8) dramatically
reduced kidney injury and improved function (Similar protection was seen with DC12). We recapitulated the injury
model in vitro, where DCAs conferred protection to human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTECs). We
propose that DCA is activated to coenzyme-A to form DCA-CoA, which undergoes two rounds of FAO chain-
shortening in peroxisomes to produce DC4-CoA, also known as succinyl-CoA. Peroxisomal succinyl-CoA
maintains high peroxisomal FAO enzyme activity via induction of a post-translational modification (PTM) called
lysine succinylation. Further, peroxisomal FAO enzyme activity hydrolyzes succinyl-CoA to succinate, which is
exported to mitochondria where it drives ATP synthesis through Complex II of the respiratory chain. We
hypothesize that this “quick energy” bolsters the kidney against injury, promoting recovery and limiting
progression to CKD. We expect that DCA metabolically shields the kidney against AKI via peroxisome-
mitochondria metabolic crosstalk this proposal will accelerate the clinical translation of DCA for AKI."

10890002,"In this study, we seek to improve assessment of critical safety and relationship skill domains by developing and
validating a novel measurement battery. Sensitive and objective tools that assess these domains are extremely
limited. This lack of established measurement tools poses a critical challenge to studies of the efficacy and
effectiveness of important safety interventions and relationship skill protocols, especially for populations uniquely
vulnerable to negative outcomes, such as adults on the autism spectrum (AA). The financial, emotional, and
physical costs of failing to adequately prepare individuals to navigate relationships safely and effectively has
been demonstrated across many diagnoses. Effectively measuring related behaviors—such as navigating
public/private boundaries, recognizing when others are interested in a relationship, determining the
trustworthiness of potential partners, judging situations for safety, using indirect communication, and taking the
perspective of others—is a critical task needed to accurately characterize the challenges of AA and other adults
with social difficulties and to track progress both over time and in response to adult social skills interventions.
We propose a battery of performance-based tools that target these skill domains via behavioral, eye tracking,
and psychophysiological responses to social information. The strength of this battery is the objectivity of the
chosen tools (e.g., behavioral responses, tracking eye movements, and heart rate) and their ecological validity
(i.e., mimicking everyday experiences such as using the internet, navigating dating apps, and engaging in various
types of relationships). The total length of the proposed project is three years. The measurement battery will be
presented at two time points (3 months apart) to a total of 200 adults (100 AA, 100 adults without autism). We
have three aims: (1) To examine the feasibility of acquisition of the proposed measures for AA; (2) To assess
the utility of the measurement battery for assessing social difficulties of the AA and non-ASD groups, and (3) To
validate the measures for use in clinical trials by examining (3a) their short term stability, (3b) convergent validity
with a measure of general social functioning, and (3c) demonstrate their utility as measures of target engagement
by confirming their correlation to outcome measures of romantic and sexual functioning. Achieving these aims
will provide a novel toolkit for investigators to use to measure social cognitive, behavioral, and physiological
changes in response to intervention programs for AA and, ultimately, populations with similar safety and
relationship skills deficits (e.g., intellectual disability, ADHD, social anxiety, schizophrenia)."

Abstract
This Catalyst project aims to removing a major bottleneck in understanding diabetes and its complications, by
developing the technologies to map diverse molecular interactions in the disease-relevant cells at the genomic
scale. These proposed technologies, collectively called PRACI (Protein, RNA, and chromatin interactions), will
enable a typical research lab to map genome-wide protein-protein, RNA-protein, RNA-RNA, and RNA-
DNA/chromatin interaction networks from a given cell type within 1 months’ time. PRACI enables typical labs to
compare molecular interaction networks between health and disease states. Without PRACI, genome-wide
mapping of even a single type of interactions from a disease-relevant cell type remains a formidable task.
I will systematically map molecular interactome changes related to diabetes related vascular complications, using
hyperglycemia and chronic inflammation-induced irreversible alterations vascular endothelial cells as a testbed
system. I anticipate to reveal which components of the multiscale molecular networks are responsible for the
sustained dysregulation of gene expression in dysfunctional endothelial cells. Such information will lead to new
perspectives to diabetic wound healing, given the established roles of endothelial dysfunction to diabetic wounds
and the relative accessibility of vasculature. I anticipate that these technologies and their enabled discoveries
will contribute to and inspire transformative changes in the study of Diabetes, Endocrinology, and Metabolic
Diseases."
10887723,"Perinatal brain injury resulting in intellectual impairment and cerebral palsy affects more than 10,000 infants
each year in the United States (1 to 3 per 1000 births). There is no therapy other than supportive care to
prevent brain damage in hypoxic-ischemic (HI) encephalopathy (HIE) in premature infants. Due to the
complex nature of the pathophysiological events, single-mechanism drug interventions in clinical studies
have failed, and there remains an unmet medical need for therapeutics that prevent secondary neuronal
damage. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) through activation of its high affinity receptor, TrkB, is a
key player in promoting learning, and therapeutic strategies to enhance BDNF signaling protect against HI-
induced injury. Treatment with systemic BDNF is limited by its short plasma half-life and poor brain
penetration. Our research has circumvented these limitations through the development of cyclized-peptides
targeting PSD-95, a TrkB associated synaptic scaffolding protein required for BDNF-induced signaling. We
developed a macrocyclic compound, Syn3, that specifically binds the PDZ3 domain of PSD-95. Syn3
increases the recruitment of PSD-95 to TrkB to augment prosurvival signaling. Attached to the macrocycle
is a cell–penetrating C-R(7) moiety that further mediates neuroprotection by reducing mitochondrial
membrane hyperpolarization and the generation of reactive oxygen species. In a series of preclinical
studies in a HI rodent model we found that Syn3 rapidly penetrates the CNS to reduce the degree of injury.
The overall goal is to investigate the efficacy of our newly defined neuroprotective and immunomodulatory
peptidomimetic, Syn3, to attenuate HI-related brain damage in the neonate. We hypothesize that
administration of the optimal dose of Syn3 during the therapeutic time window will reduce brain injury,
decrease neuronal and glial cell death, decrease apoptosis, free radical exposure and improve short and
long-term behavioral outcomes. In Aim 1 we will determine the optimal dose and therapeutic time window
for neuroprotection with Syn3 after HI related brain injury in the neonate. Aim 2 will assess the short and
long-term neuroprotective efficacy of Syn3 administration after HI related brain injury on molecular (Aim
2.1) and behavioral (Aim 2.2) outcomes."
10889019,"Although oral vancomycin (VAN) treatment failures in Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) are common,
antibiotic susceptibility testing is not conducted in the clinical setting. This has resulted in, and is in part due to,
the lack of established susceptibility measure(s) corresponding with clinical outcomes. Our long-term goal is to
develop clinically relevant microbiologic susceptibility measures that are predictive of patient outcomes in
patients with CDI. The objective of this proposal is to determine if VAN inhibitory or bactericidal concentrations
against C. difficile isolates are predictive of sustained clinical cure. The central hypothesis is that bactericidal
concentrations will be more discriminatory and clinically significant than inhibitory concentrations in predicting
outcomes. The rationale underlying this proposal is well supported by CDI pathophysiology, VAN drug
characteristics, and preliminary data. As CDI is a toxin-mediated disease, ongoing production of toxins
worsens clinical outcomes. Toxins are predominately produced during the stationary growth phase in which
cell wall synthesis slows, thereby decreasing VAN effectiveness and allowing for continued toxin production at
concentrations around the MIC. VAN MICs are also relatively non-discriminatory and generally cluster between
0.5-2 μg/mL. Isolates with the most common resistance mechanism, vanG-mediated resistance, are also
known to have disproportionately increased MBCs compared to MICs. The central hypothesis will be tested by
pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine the variance of VAN bactericidal concentrations stratified by C.
difficile MICs; 2) Determine if VAN bactericidal measures or MIC better predicts sustained clinical cure in
hospitalized patients given VAN for CDI. This project will prove innovative through challenging the current
clinical practice paradigm that VAN susceptibility testing is not needed for patients with CDI, through the
expansion of our valuable biobank of 600 patients with CDI that will enable future in-depth mechanistic studies,
and development of a high-throughput ATP assay to perform bactericidal concentration testing for future
studies. The proposed research is significant as CDI is the most common healthcare-acquire infection and
VAN is the most common antibiotic used to treat it; a VAN susceptibility measure corresponding with outcomes
is critical to ensuring optimal VAN use and desirable patient outcomes. The expected outcome will provide
valuable preliminary data allowing for a future stream of research into molecular diagnostics and point-of-care
susceptibility tests incorporate VAN susceptibility. Compared to the CLSI-recommended but labor-intensive
broth microdilution MBC method, the high-throughput ATP bioluminescence MBC assays will enable future
research studies and implementation into clinical microbiology labs. These studies also lay the foundation for
the PI to further expand into CDI translational research and become an independent researcher."
10890638,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Continuous flow left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) now rival heart transplant as the gold standard for
advanced heart failure. However, uncertainty persists over which patients are most likely to benefit from
treatment. New technologies for a more personalized approach to risk prediction and supported decision-
making are crucially needed to improve current clinical risk calculators and decision aids which lack the ability
to (a) calculate patients’ individualized and highly variable personalized risks, (b) communicate those risks to
patients in the context of their values and goals and discuss these factors with their health care team, and (c)
capitalize upon digitalized health systems and platforms to provide most expeditious and efficient updates to
rapidly-changing risk. This represents a significant gap in informed and high-quality decision making that also
potentially negatively affects health and clinical outcomes. The objective of this proposal is to improve patients’
informed and shared decision making about LVAD by providing a holistic and personalized clinical decision
support system for LVAD candidates that interactively guides their understanding of how available treatment
options align with their expressed values, given their personalized risk estimates, and provides them with a tool
to communicate these values to their clinical team. We will do this by updating and integrating a validated
online risk prediction and communication tool, the Cardiac Outcomes Risk Assessment (CORA)
developed by our colleagues at Cornell University, with our efficacy-tested decision aid (Deciding
Together) for LVAD. To accomplish this, in Aim 1 we will conduct in-depth qualitative interviews to identify
patients’ and physicians’ practical, ethical, and contextual considerations while using CORA, while our
colleagues at Cornell simultaneously update and (re-)validate the updated model against existing LVAD risk
prediction models, as well as integrate CORA with an adapted and digitalized version of our decision aid. In Aim
2, we will then translate patients' and physicians’ practical, ethical and contextual considerations into
concrete improvements to CORA and conduct acceptability/feasibility testing with patients and physicians
using the updated, validated system. These steps will culminate in Aim 3, a multi-site randomized controlled trial
to evaluate the impact of a personalized approach to clinical decision making on informed and values-
concordant choice and shared decision-making outcomes. This contribution will be significant because it
will address the urgent need to better identify and respond to the specific and dynamic nature of patient needs
in seeking advanced heart failure treatment. Our approach is innovative in that it harnesses state of the art
technology prediction models and LVAD decision support, synthesizing diverse expertise from a team of
bioengineers, computer scientists, leading heart failure cardiologists, decision scientists, and medical ethicists.
This five-year project is feasible in that it builds on 6 years of research on the development, implementation and
dissemination of LVAD decision support and a decade of research into accurate risk prediction models for LVAD."

The purpose of this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to provide the candidate with
the training and expertise needed to transition into an independent research career focused on intersectional
approaches to optimize HIV treatment and intervention. This K01 features a robust career development plan
and carefully linked research strategy. The overall objective of the research component of this K01 is to
examine how intersectional stigma and discrimination lead to inequalities in HIV treatment outcomes and
explore how resilience promotes engagement in HIV care among racially diverse women living with HIV who
use drugs (WLHIV-WUD) in the United States (US). This information will inform the selection and systematic
adaptation of an HIV-related evidence-based intervention (EBI) to facilitate engagement in care among
WLHIV-WUD. This will be achieved through the following three specific aims: 1) to assess the impact of stigma
and discrimination on inequalities in HIV treatment outcomes across intersections of drug use and race among
racially diverse WLHIV in the US; 2) to systematically adapt an HIV-related EBI to mitigate the impact of
intersectional stigma and discrimination and cultivate resilience to facilitate HIV care engagement among
racially diverse WLHIV-WUD in San Francisco, CA; and 3) to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the
adapted intersectionality-informed HIV care engagement intervention among racially diverse WLHIV-WUD in
San Francisco, CA. Dr. Jennifer Jain is the perfect candidate to conduct this research because of her strong
knowledge base in epidemiological methods and HIV and substance use research. During the 5-year award
period, Dr. Jain will achieve the following career development objectives: 1) gain content expertise in
intersectionality theory and research with an emphasis on HIV care engagement among WLHIV-WUD in the
US; 2) develop methodological expertise in advanced statistical techniques for quantitative intersectionality and
mixed methods; 3) acquire training in intervention science, including the adaptation and testing of evidence-
based interventions focused on HIV care engagement among WLHIV-WUD in the US; 4) build skills for a
successful independent research career, including grantsmanship, scientific manuscript writing and
collaborative cross-disciplinary research. This will be attained through the completion of a diverse set of
training activities including mentor-directed learning, formal course work, seminars, and real-world research
experience. The proposed research is highly consistent with current NIH priorities to: 1) conduct HIV-related
intersectional stigma research; 2) improve health outcomes among people living with HIV who use drugs; and
3) accelerate scientific discoveries in HIV/AIDS and substance use research. Moreover, this research supports
Dr. Jain’s pursuit of an independent career in research focused on intersectional approaches to enhance HIV
treatment and intervention among racially diverse WLHIV-WUD in the US."
10888501,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Each year ~1.6 million deaths are attributed to tuberculosis (TB) disease. This annual estimate of TB deaths does
not include post-TB mortality. Post-TB disease standardized mortality rates are ~4 times that of the general
population. One potential reason for this higher mortality is long-term adverse impacts of TB on metabolic health.
While diabetes is a well-established risk factor for adverse outcomes in persons with TB disease, recent evidence
suggests the relationship between TB and glycemic control is bidirectional. Over half of patients with TB disease
experience stress hyperglycemia, and persons recovered from TB disease remain at greater risk for diabetes,
dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease. Metabolic sequelae of TB disease may therefore be a major contributor
to elevated post-TB mortality. Improved understanding of the mechanisms linking TB disease to increased risk of
hyperglycemia and diabetes is needed to develop new therapies and interventions that improve post-TB metabolic
health and reduce mortality. To address key knowledge gaps, this research will leverage a unique NIAID-funded
clinical cohort (R01AI153152) of patients with TB from the country of Georgia. The parent cohort carefully
characterizes stress hyperglycemia and metabolic trajectories for 18 months during and after TB treatment,
including longitudinal measures of glucose control (HbA1c), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and visceral adiposity.
Using previously collected plasma samples, we will integrate data using cutting-edge ‘-omics’ platforms to gain
unparalleled insight into the impact of the metabolome, immune response, and immune-microbiota interface on
stress hyperglycemia and metabolic health during TB disease and after TB cure. This study will determine (1)
whether stress hyperglycemia in TB disease results from metabolic signals that drive immune activation and
influence insulin resistance; (2) if immunometabolic pathways remain dysregulated in some patients after TB cure,
increasing long-term metabolic risks; and (3) whether shifts in the microbiome-immune crosstalk in persons with
TB disease contribute to stress hyperglycemia and longer-term metabolic risks. Because patients with TB often
have subclinical or clinical TB for months to years before TB diagnosis, we theorize that this duration leads to long-
term shifts in the metabolome, chronic activation of inflammatory signaling cascades, and altered microbiome-
immune crosstalk, which, in turn, increase the risk of insulin resistance, lipid dysregulation, systemic glucose
intolerance, and eventually incident diabetes. This proposal will help to characterize the extent to which changes
in immunometabolism and the immune-microbiota interface in TB disease drive short and long-term metabolic
sequelae, which may be major contributors to post-TB mortality. Elucidating mechanistic linkages between TB and
hyperglycemia will allow our group to evaluate the utility of existing therapies aimed at improving metabolic health
in TB disease and identify new pathways that could be targeted to improve clinical outcomes during and after TB
treatment."
10889648,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is an autonomic and respiratory disorder caused by
mutations in the paired-like homeobox transcription factor gene, PHOX2B. CCHS patients have severe
episodes of hypoventilation, especially during sleep, that likely reflect reduced arousal and ventilatory
responses to high CO2. In CCHS, PHOX2B mutations commonly include polyalanine repeat mutations
(PARMs), with increasing severity associated with more extensive expansions, along with other loss-of-function
gene variants that yield particularly dire clinical presentations including various accompanying dysautonomia.
The neuropathology associated with CCHS-causing mutations in humans has not been delineated. In mice,
Phox2b is expressed in several brain-stem neurons that may be relevant for various clinical features of CCHS.
However, the respiratory chemosensory neurons of the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) are thought to be
particularly important for the alveolar hypoventilation and loss CO2-dependent reflexes, the two cardinal signs
of CCHS, because they are intrinsically CO2-sensitive, contribute to breathing and waking reflexes activated by
hypoventilation, and they are uniquely eliminated in mouse genetic models of CCHS. The transcriptional role
of Phox2b in RTN neurons, and how it contributes to respiratory regulation by those neurons has not been
determined. This proposal examines gene regulatory functions of wild type and polyalanine mutants of Phox2b
in RTN neurons, and the relevance of Phox2b-regulated genes for RTN function in respiratory control."

Decades of research and clinical observations have established that successful spatial navigation and memory
depend on the hippocampus and associated structures in the medial temporal lobe (MTL), including entorhinal,
perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices [1, 2]. It is thought that the supporting neuronal mechanisms rely on key
oscillatory patterns of activity within the MTL that change dynamically when navigating through an environment
[3-10]. However, traditional human neuroimaging methodologies do now allow for recording of MTL oscillatory
activity during spatial navigation let alone physical movement. The proposed project will implement a first-of-its-
kind platform for wireless deep brain recording and stimulation of MTL oscillatory activity during freely moving
behaviors to investigate the relationship between spatial navigation, memory, and oscillatory activity, using
intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) recordings in participants who are implanted with the Neuropace
Responsive Neurostimulator (RNS®) for clinical evaluation and treatment of epilepsy. The RNS device will allow
for the stimulation and recording of MTL iEEG activity during virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and
real world (RW) spatial navigation tasks with simultaneous recording full-body and eye position and movement
using wearable technologies. Together these studies will have access to 70 rare participants implanted with the
RNS system over the project period through an ongoing multi-institutional collaboration among clinical and basic
science leaders at UCLA, Stanford, and UCSF. Since our studies address basic questions about the role of
oscillations in memory, the results will allow for the bridging of findings between species and lay the scientific
foundation for helping future patients with diseases where memory is impaired such as Alzheimer’s disease and
epilepsy."
10891115,"Project Summary/Abstract
Hispanics are one of the fastest growing populations of older adults in the United States (U.S.). From 2019 to 2060, the
population of Hispanic older adults aged 65 years and over in the U.S. is projected to increase from 9% to 21%. Existing
literature suggests that Hispanic older adults experience health disparities across multiple sectors of the U.S. healthcare
system, including emergency medicine. Emergency medical services (EMS) provided in the prehospital setting, however,
are a largely understudied sector in the U.S. healthcare system, especially in the context of Hispanic older adults. EMS
serve as an important entry point into the U.S. healthcare system for Hispanic older adults who often have challenges
accessing preventive and diagnostic care. The objectives of the proposed dissertation are three-fold: 1) assess the
individual, neighborhood, and structural-level factors that impact the provision of EMS care by emergency medical
technicians and paramedics to Hispanic older adults; 2) examine the individual and neighborhood-level factors that impact
the provision of EMS to Hispanic older adults experiencing a high-acuity, time sensitive, cardiac-related 9-1-1
emergency; and 3) determine the individual and neighborhood-level factors that impact the provision of EMS for Hispanic
older adults experiencing a psychiatric-related 9-1-1 emergency, a type of call often triaged as low acuity. The National
Institute of Aging’s Health Disparities Framework provides the theoretical foundation for the three studies that comprise
this dissertation. The first study in this dissertation is a systematic literature review, an increasingly important approach to
synthesize existing literature and provide justification for future research. The second and third studies use data from three
sources, including the San Francisco Department of Emergency Management, San Francisco Department of Public
Health, and the 2020 and 2021 American Community Survey. The PRISMA 2020 guidelines and Covidence software
inform the completion of the systematic literature review, which addresses the first objective. Logistic regression and
multilevel modeling are used to: 1) examine the association between individual and neighborhood-level factors and high-
acuity, cardiac-related 9-1-1 emergency calls, which address the second objective; and 2) assess the association between
individual and neighborhood-level factors with low-acuity, psychiatric-related 9-1-1 emergency calls, which address the
third objective. Neighborhood in the second and third objectives refers to ZIP code as the level of geospatial analysis.
Stata 17.0 and R are used to run the statistical analyses in the second and third studies. The proposed dissertation will
offer insights on the provision of EMS to Hispanic older adults. The findings from this dissertation can inform ongoing
efforts to make the EMS system more accessible, age-friendly, and equitable."

Although breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in the world, recently, the survival rate has greatly improved.
With this improved survival rate, there is a growing population of obese, older adult breast cancer survivors facing unique
challenges and late effects on brain health. Breast cancer survivors suffer cognitive impairments before, during, and post-
treatment; more than one third experience persistent cognitive impairment lasting decades. Anxiety is the most common
psychological symptom among cancer survivors, and frequently unrecognized and undertreated in health care settings.
These survivors are also at increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease or dementia. There is unanimous consensus that physical
activity and alcohol consumption are key modifiable behaviors to improve the physical and mental health of cancer
survivors. Further, the American Cancer Society promotes increasing physical activity, and avoiding alcohol to manage
treatment-related cognitive impairment. Although the benefits of physical activity for cancer survivors are well-established,
the evidence is predominantly derived from guidelines-based, moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity. However,
survivors often do not meet guidelines for moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity, do not adhere to physical
activity interventions set at this intensity, and enjoy and prefer lighter-intensity activities. Much less is known about the
effects of light-intensity physical activity on cognitive function and anxiety symptoms, and the 2018 United States Physical
Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Scientific Report identified the need to determine the role and contribution of
light-intensity activity to diverse health outcomes as an overarching research need. Additionally, less is known about the
effects of physical activity interventions on changes in alcohol consumption. Recent findings indicate physical activity may
unintentionally increase alcohol consumption among cancer survivors. Increasing alcohol consumption places survivors at
increased risk of recurrence, and may confound the positive effects of physical activity. Therefore, in the process of
evaluating the effects of light-intensity physical activity on brain health outcomes among obese, older adult breast cancer
survivors, the effects on alcohol consumption should be evaluated as well, to avoid unintended consequences. The light-
intensity physical activity-breast cancer survivors (LIPA-BCS) trial addresses multiple knowledge gaps, with a primary and
secondary focus on improving cognitive function and anxiety symptoms. The proposed work builds on this existing
randomized controlled trial that randomizes obese, older adult breast cancer survivors 1-10 years post-breast cancer
treatment, to either 15 weeks of light-intensity physical activity, or usual care. I will take advantage of this existing clinical
trial to quantify and describe the effects on cognitive function, anxiety symptoms, and observe associated changes in alcohol
consumption. To achieve this aim, we will assess cognitive function, anxiety symptoms, and alcohol consumption both pre-
post, and utilizing ecological momentary assessments in 14-day bursts throughout the 15 week intervention. Through this
research experience, and proposed post-doctoral fellowship, I will learn about the conduct of high quality human clinical
trials among obese, older adult cancer survivors, and receive mentored training in ecological momentary assessments,
biostatistics, and becoming an independent investigator in exercise oncology."

Different magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners and different acquisition parameters can produce very
different images for the same patients. This is a significant issue when attempting to use MRIs in a quantitative
manner. Multiple studies have shown promise of quantitative analysis of breast MRIs to diagnose breast
tumors, predict patient outcomes, assess cancer risk, and even identify genomic signatures of cancers.
However, the issue of inhomogeneity of images hampers the progress of the research and clinical
implementation of these findings. In many cases one cannot utilize images from different sources to answer a
research question. Furthermore, predictive models developed at one institution may not generalize to other
institutions. While this is a well-recognized problem, there is currently no solution to it in breast MRI. Some
valid efforts have been undertaken in order to address this issue for other organs, predominantly brain.
However, the problem has not been solved for those organs neither and limited validation of the existing
methods in practical contexts hampers the implementation. Breast is a non-rigid organ with highly variable
composition making the harmonization of breast MRIs particularly challenging and making almost all prior
harmonization methods developed for brain not applicable. Given the urgent need for harmonization in
quantitative research, we propose three harmonization methods that allow for transforming an image acquired
using one scanner setup to assume appearance of another scanner setup. We introduce important technical
innovations to utilize cutting-edge convolutional neural networks for this task. Additionally, we propose a new
approach to the question that has not yet attracted significant systematic consideration: what makes a
harmonization algorithm successful or useful? We do not evaluate pixel-to-pixel match between the
harmonized image and a reference image which is the typical approach. This approach is impractical in breast
imaging since it requires ideally paired images, it does not deal well with expected image noise, and it does not
inform about specific limitations of the evaluated harmonization method. We propose an evaluation framework
that assesses harmonization algorithms in terms of different practical applications including radiomic analysis
and deep learning. The study will be conducted in collaboration between a machine learning scientists (Duke
and Yale), a breast MRI physicist (Cornell), a radiologist whose research focuses on MRI (Duke), and a
biostatistician (Duke). The proposed harmonization and evaluation methods do not require fully paired data
and do not make assumptions about tissue composition. Therefore, they will be applicable across other organs
once implemented with appropriate data for the organ. All harmonization and evaluation algorithms along with
the data will be made publicly available to spearhead further research on this crucial unsolved research topic."

Interest in cancer immunology has never been more intense. Breakthrough observations with inhibitory receptor
blockade, combined with ground breaking advances in the use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T
cell adoptive therapies have highlighted the critical need to further basic and translation research in cancer
immunology. While the pipeline of potential immunotherapeutic targets is growing, the pipeline of future cancer
immunologists is limited, in part due to significant demand in industry and academia. There is a critical need for
training programs that optimally prepare the next generation of cancer immunologists. Surprisingly, our Cancer
Immunology Training Program (CITP) at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine (UPSOM) is one of only
six NCI-supported T32s nationwide that focus entirely on cancer immunology. This makes our program
unique and essential. CITP, which has 5 pre- and 3 post-doctoral slots, is in its 20th year and we are seeking
support for the next five years. The goals of the CITP are to provide graduate students, fellows and physician
scientists with courses, research projects, exceptional environment and resources, and highly-qualified mentors
that will allow them to: (1) make a significant contribution to one of five areas of research focus covered by this
training program: (a) Inhibitory Mechanisms in the Tumor Microenvironment (TME), (b) Adaptive Immunity and
Cellular Interactions within the TME, (c) Innate, Environmental and Metabolic Modulation, (d) Promoting Immune
Responses to Tumors: Cell-Based Therapies & Vaccines, and (e) Systems Cancer Immunology; (2) gain a clear
understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms relevant to cancer immunology; (3) obtain a practical
understanding of the immunology of human cancer; (4) gain a clear conceptual understanding of all areas that
impact cancer immunology; and (5) develop critical career skills and managerial ability. Building thoughtfully on
what is a proven training program, we have made several enhancements, such as increasing the cancer
immunology-focus of our faculty (25 total). UPSOM and HCC have and continue to make an unprecedented
investment in cancer immunology. The training program exploits particular strengths at UPSOM, including an
exceptional NCI Comprehensive Cancer Center, a strong immuno-centric translational research base, an
outstanding Immunology Department that underpins strong basic research, and our graduate research program
(PMI). UPSOM has implemented effective programs to ensure outstanding training, with emphasis on increasing
the recruitment and retention of women and URMs. Our applicant pool is exceptional due to the success of our
PMI and MSTP graduate programs, highly sought-after clinical fellowships, and outstanding mentor pool. Over
the last 5 years, CITP has enrolled 24 trainees (Pre – 15; Post – 9), of which 13 were women (54%) and 3 were
URM (12.5%). Lastly, our trainees have been extremely successful in obtaining extramural/competitive
fellowships (14 total [58%]: F99/K00 [1], F32 [3], F31 [4], F30 [3], Damon-Runyon [1], St. Baldrick's [1],
Hartwell [1]). We are excited and eager to train the next generation of cancer immunologists."

Immuto Scientific Inc. is developing a robust, automated benchtop instrument to perform high-throughput
structural characterization of protein biotherapeutics in a fraction of time of traditional structural
characterization techniques such as x-ray crystallography and cryo-EM. Protein-based biotherapeutics (such
as antibodies, insulin, recombinant vaccines, etc.) are one of the most effective classes of modern medicines
for the treatment of a wide variety of diseases including cancers, autoimmunity/inflammation, genetic disorders,
and infectious diseases such as COVID-19. The biological function and physicochemical properties of
biotherapeutics are determined by their higher order structures (HOS)—the folding and three-dimensional
conformation that largely dictates function and stability. Therefore, it is imperative to analyze the three-
dimensional higher order structure of protein therapeutics at several stages of the drug development process
to ensure both safety and efficacy of the drug. Biopharmaceutical manufacturers are required to demonstrate
the consistency of the protein HOS conformation to the regulatory agencies. Moreover, identifying the binding
site of a therapeutic protein (such as a monoclonal antibody) to its corresponding antigen (known as epitope
mapping) is critical for the development of new antibody therapeutics, vaccines and diagnostics. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines require specific binding site information between a drug and its target for
the regulatory filing. Current techniques for protein HOS characterization and epitope mapping are complex,
resource intensive and can take up to 6-12 months to perform. Based on feedback received from over 300
customer pharmaceutical customers, we have developed a technology called Plasma Induced Modification to
Biomolecules (PLIMB) that addresses the need of the industry for routine structural, mass spectrometry-based
protein HOS analysis. PLIMB generates sub microsecond bursts of hydroxyl (OH) radicals from water to label
proteins in solution. The OH radicals covalently label the solvent accessible regions of the protein and
subsequent mass spectrometric analysis reveals single amino acid level structural information. With PLIMB,
HOS analysis and epitope mapping can be performed in under 48 hours where current techniques such as x-
ray crystallography and Cryo-EM takes several months to perform. In Phase II, we will first incorporate the
hydroxyl radical detection system that was designed in Phase I into a fully automated, manufacturable PLIMB
instrument, and then validate the PLIMB system for commercial use. Ultimately, PLIMB will be a revolutionary
new tool for pharmaceutical researchers that will provide new capabilities to better engineer highly effective
protein biotherapeutics and accelerate the drug discovery timeline."

Hailey Hailey Disease (HHD), also known as benign chronic pemphigus, is a rare, autosomal dominant skin
disorder that affects the adhesion of epidermal keratinocytes. HHD is characterized by painful, recurrent blistering
of the skin that occurs predominantly in skin folds such as armpits, groin and neck, accompanied by weeping,
crusting and frequent secondary fungal or bacterial infection. There is no specific therapy and symptoms are
generally treated topically with limited efficacy. As a result, HHD is frequently disabling and significantly
impacts the quality of life. HHD is caused by mutations in one allele of ATP2C1, the gene encoding the Secretory
Pathway Ca2+-ATPase SPCA1. However, the underlying disease driving mechanism is controversial and has been
variously attributed to haploinsufficiency, dominant negative functions or even localized loss of heterozygosity.
SPCA1 localizes uniquely to the Golgi apparatus where it is required to transport Ca2+ and Mn2+ ions into the
lumen for the proper sorting, processing and modification of cargo proteins. In keratinocytes, Ca2+ homeostasis
is central to differentiation, cell adhesion and barrier repair. Although not clearly understood, it is thought that
HHD is caused by disruption of desmosomal and adherens junctions (acantholysis) resulting from Ca2+ and/or
Mn2+ homeostasis defects. Despite the identification of this molecular genetic defect over two decades ago,
SPCA1 remains understudied and there has been no significant effort towards effective therapy for HHD. In
contrast, the structurally related Ca2+-ATPase SERCA has been successfully drugged with small molecule
activators, peptides and gene therapy vectors which are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of heart
disease, muscular dystrophy and other disorders. Encouraged by these recent developments, and in response to
FOA RFA-TR-22-030 for “Pilot Projects Investigating Understudied Proteins Associated with Rare Diseases” we
propose to develop a human keratinocyte model of mono-allelic mutation or deletion of ATP2C1 and clarify
disease mechanism (Aim 1) and test the efficacy of phenotype rescue with lentiviral mediated SPCA1 delivery
(Aim 2). If successful, these studies will pave the way for future therapeutic efforts to cure this rare and
debilitating disease."

This proposal comprises a five-year research and career development program for Melanie H. Smith, MD, PhD
to achieve independence as an investigator at the intersection of immunology and stromal biology in the human
synovium. Dr. Smith is an Assistant Attending Physician in the Division of Rheumatology at Hospital for Special
Surgery (HSS) and an Assistant Attending Professor of Medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York
City. She will conduct research under the joint mentorship of Dr. Laura Donlin (HSS) and Dr. Alexander Rudensky
(Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) focused on understanding the role of synovial fibroblasts in
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Dr. Smith will engage in career development activities including didactics, workshops
in grant writing and leadership, conferences, and acquisition of technical skills and scientific expertise. These
activities will be augmented through regular input from her scientific advisory team. This training grant will
generate key skills, data, and publications necessary to become an R01-funded independent investigator.
Synovial fibroblasts (FLS) are the most abundant resident cells in the synovium and are implicated in multiple
aspects of RA pathogenesis. FLS specifically within the synovial lining layer exhibit evidence of extensive
activation and are selectively defined by accessibility of AP-1 transcription factor motifs. Here we will test the
contributions of toll like receptor (TLR) ligands from the synovial fluid, and local expression of epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) ligands in activating AP-1 in FLS. The central hypothesis is that these activators of AP-
1, which are present in the synovial lining microenvironment, prime lining FLS to mount heightened responses
to cytokines derived from infiltrating leukocytes, and that AP-1 driven gene expression drives FLS functional
specialization. We will use primary human synovial fibroblasts both in culture and directly isolated from synovial
tissue along with selective agonists, targeted inhibitors and CRISPR interference to interrogate the mechanistic
basis and functional consequences of the FLS activation observed specifically in lining FLS. The significance of
this proposal lies in the identification of key factors responsible for FLS activation that may further the
development of FLS-targeted therapies in RA. This proposal is innovative in the investigation of non-cytokine
driven priming in the establishment of inflammatory memory and the identification of the specific transcription
factors involved using advanced sequencing methods as well as CRISPR in primary human FLS. Long-term, Dr.
Smith aims to apply the expertise gained in this proposal to identify environmental and inflammatory signals that
maintain and regulate synovial inflammation to improve treatment of RA."

neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, characterized by changes in behavior, we
hope to expand our understanding of the role of genes in behavior. Our molecular dissection of
gene function in single neurons between and across behavioral circuits has led to identification of
novel molecular mechanisms and genetic interactions in experience-dependent neuronal
plasticity and behavioral plasticity. Here we focus on synaptic cell adhesion molecule (sCAMs)
genes, including neurexins and neuroligins, which are extremely complex and redundant gene
families in vertebrates. The complexity and diversity of vertebrate neurons, circuits, and sCAM
genes have prevented simultaneous analysis at the genetic, molecular, circuit, and behavioral
resolution we hope to achieve. We propose to use C. elegans as a tractable experimental
system to simultaneously investigate the molecular and circuit mechanisms of many
synaptic adhesion genes in multiple behaviors. Our research plans over the coming years are
to expand the list of sCAM genes we are studying in depth to gain a more nuanced and complete
picture of the molecular coordination of sCAM genes in behavior. Using a suite of modern genetic
and neuroscience techniques we plan to 1) Identify networks of sCAM genes involved in multiple
foraging behaviors, 2) Define the cellular, subcellular, molecular, and temporal requirements of
each identified sCAM gene, and 3) Characterize the impact of each sCAM gene on the structure
and functional connectivity of a foraging circuit, all at single neuron resolution. Our top-down
approach relies heavily on using behavior as a readout of gene and circuit function, with the hope
this will provide a unique window into the genetic and molecular basis of behavior. Successful
completion of our work will result in a deeper understanding of the principles of neuronal circuit
formation, function, and behavioral output with implications across basic and disease-focused
disciplines. C. elegans are not only a uniquely tractable experimental model for the resolution of
experiments we propose, but also provide an inclusive experimental system to train/mentor
undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs at all levels of experience."
10895514,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
RUNT-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) is a master regulator of hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis.
RUNX1 mutations are identified in 10-20% of patients with acute myeloid leukemias (AML). RUNX1-mutant
AML is characterized by chemoresistance and poor prognosis. Lineage infidelity is prevalent in RUNX1-mutant
AML and has been proposed as a potential mechanism of therapeutic resistance. However, the mechanisms
by which RUNX1 mutations confer lineage infidelity in AML and the specific contribution of lineage infidelity to
the pathogenesis of RUNX1-mutant AML remain poorly understood. Leukemogenic RUNX1 mutations may
possess potential mutant-specific functionalities in leukemogenesis and lineage specification. NRAS mutations
are the most common co-mutated genes in RUNX1-mutant AML exhibiting lineage infidelity, suggesting that
NRAS mutations cooperate with pathogenic RUNX1 mutations to promote leukemogenesis and lineage
infidelity. Current preclinical models including inducible Runx1 null mice and germline Runx1 R174Q mutations
are not ideally suited to test this hypothesis. In this proposal, we will utilize a novel inducible, reversible
Runx1R174Q allele, alone or together with cooperating Nras disease alleles. This will allow us to characterize the
mutant-specific functionalities of RUNX1, the impact of comutations on leukemic transformation and lineage
infidelity, and address the requirement for RUNX1 mutations in leukemia initiation and maintenance. The
specific aims of this project are: 1) Characterize lineage infidelity, genetic heterogeneity and their prognostic
relevance in RUNX1-mutant AML. 2) Determine the mechanisms by which Runx1R174Q and Runx1R174Q +
NrasG12D induce leukemogenesis and lineage infidelity. 3) Investigate the necessity of Runx1R174Q mutations in
disease initiation and maintenance. These studies will lead to better understanding of disease mechanisms
and new modes of therapy, which will also shape the focus of my future independent lab.
Wenbin Xiao, MD, PhD, an Assistant Member at MSKCC, will conduct this project as part of a 4-year career
development plan, dedicating 75% of his time to research with remainder spent on clinical work. Wenbin is
mentored by Dr. Ross Levine, a world expert in hematologic malignancies. He is also advised by Drs. Omar
Abdel-Wahab, Kristian Helin and Richard Koche at MSKCC, and Dr. Ulrich Steidl at Albert Einstein College of

Statistics of MSKCC. Wenbin’s training will include gaining technical laboratory skills, knowledge in the novel
leukemia mouse model with dual recombinases, knowledge in the epigenetic regulation, and formal training in
bioinformatics. In the short term, the project goal is to publish two papers on the findings from this research. In
the long term, the goal is for developing a research program and obtaining R01 funding to become an
independent laboratory investigator in hematologic malignancies."
10895575,"Summary
Maternal diabetes induces congenial heart defects (CHDs) formation and the underlying mechanism is still
unclear. Maternal diabetes induces hypoxia in the developing embryo and short-term gestational hypoxia induces
CHDs. Hypoxia and DNA hypermethylation have been interlinked in human diseases. DNA hypermethylation is
implicated in CHDs including hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), a complex and severe CHD type. We found
that maternal diabetes enhanced hypoxia and increased DNA methylation in the developing heart. Hypoxia
inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) up-regulated the two de novo DNA methyltransferase (DNMT3a and DNMT3b)
in cardiac progenitors in the developing mouse hearts or derived from human inducible pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs). Blockage of DNA hypermethylation by removing DNMT3a and DNMT3b in early cardiac Nkx2.5+
progenitors ameliorated all CHD types in diabetic pregnancy. Thus, we hypothesize that maternal diabetes
induces hypoxia and triggers the activation of the hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) pathway,
which induces DNA hypermethylation by up-regulating DNMT3a/b. Inhibition of hypoxia, HIF-1α or DNA
hypermethylation or double DNMT3a/b deletion abrogates the functional deficits in cardiac progenitors
leading to CHD reduction and improvement of cardiomyocyte and cardiac function. First heart field
defects contribute to HLHS formation and cardiac dysfunction in this severe type of CHDs. To test our
hypothesis, we proposed three specific aims. Aim 1 will determine whether maternal diabetes-induced
hypoxia is responsible for DNA hypermethylation in early cardiac progenitors leading to CHD formation.
We will examine whether hypoxia increases DNA methylation in early cardiac progenitors by up-regulating
DNMT3a/b expression leading to CHDs in diabetic pregnancy. Aim 2 will investigate the role of maternal
diabetes-induced DNA hypermethylation in gene dysregulation that results in functional defects in early
cardiac progenitors and the first heart field. We will determine whether DNA hypermethylation in both heart
fields alters gene expression leading to CHDs and cardiomyocyte dysfunction in diabetic pregnancy by using
DNMT3a/b double deletion in early cardiac progenitors. Aim 3 will determine whether heightened HIF-1α
activity and consequent DNA hypermethylation contribute to cardiomyocyte dysfunction of HLHS in
diabetic pregnancy. We hypothesize that persistent activation of the HIF-1α pathway and DNA hypermethylation
contribute to cardiomyocyte dysfunction in maternal diabetes-induced CHDs. Successful completion will dissect
the critical role of hypoxia and DNA methylation in diabetes-induced CHDs and provide mechanistic insights for
improving cardiomyocyte function in CHD patients."
10895576,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neonatal stroke is an important cause of death and disability, and diagnosis is often delayed. There is
insufficient knowledge regarding repair mechanisms that occur in response to focal ischemia-reperfusion injury
that is the most common cause of early stroke. Angiogenesis, fibrosis, and perivascular cell repopulation occur
in close proximity, with paracrine signaling supporting endothelial cell interactions that are vital for repair.
Modulating this neurovascular niche may be a potential target for enhancing outcomes after ischemic injury in
the developing brain. Erythropoietin and cell-based therapies have emerged as promising delayed treatment
strategies for stroke, although the mechanism of their benefit is still not entirely clear. It is likely that dynamic
release of pro-angiogenic growth factors and activation of signaling pathways downstream of erythropoietin
receptor have differential effects on endothelial cell subtypes in distinct brain regions and at different time
points after injury. In addition, the defined role of local fibrosis in injury progression and repair following early
focal brain injury is unknown. Effectively inducing long-term, functional angiogenesis requires understanding
and mimicking mechanisms that occur in the developing brain. Our objectives are to understand local
angiogenesis and fibrosis in ischemic and peri-infarct regions following focal ischemia-reperfusion
injury in the developing brain, and to determine the mechanisms of regeneration and repair with
delayed erythropoietin by focusing on the vascular response. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that
endothelial tip cells at the vascular front are critical for angiogenesis following neonatal stroke, and that
delayed erythropoietin will enhance angiogenesis and alter endothelial cell-subtype gene expression profiles to
promote tip cell programs. In Aim 2, we will quantify fibroblasts and perivascular cells in the ischemic core and
peri-infarct penumbra in the acute, subacute, and chronic stages after stroke and determine how erythropoietin
signaling impacts local fibrosis and repair. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine and modify specific signaling
pathways to test the hypothesis that dynamic endothelial cell signaling modulated by erythropoietin is crucial
for promoting local angiogenesis following focal brain injury. This will determine critical, modifiable pathways
important for injury progression and repair following neonatal stroke. Our primary hypothesis is that delayed
erythropoietin treatment will promote vascular growth and remodeling, reduce subacute fibrosis and
astrocytic proliferation in the ischemic core, and enhance perivascular signaling to improve
histological and functional outcomes after neonatal stroke. Together, these three aims will explore the
roles of specific cellular subtypes and pathways in recovery after focal brain injury, with the broader goal of
optimizing therapeutic strategies to improve long-term outcomes after a common cause of full-term brain injury
that currently has no therapy."
10895577,"ABSTRACT
The plasticity and functional diversity of regulatory T cells (Tregs) is essential for the maintenance of healthy
immunity but it is also exploited in disease. We have described a subset of Tregs that express high levels of β-
catenin and promote inflammation. The frequency of these Tregs is increased in inflammatory bowel diseases
(and mouse colitis), colon cancer (and mouse polyposis), as well as in multiple sclerosis (and mouse EAE).
Expression of a dominant active β-catenin, or ablation of Tcf-1 in Tregs both foster expression of Rorγt the
canonical transcription factor of the Th17 lineage, and promote a Th17 differentiation signature. In the
mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) of healthy mice, we identified at least 5 transcriptionally distinct activated
clusters of Tregs. One of these clusters is defined by expression of Rorγt and has prominent Th17
differentiation characteristics. In Tcf-1 deficient Tregs the Th17 differentiation profile expanded to all other
clusters, and the RORγt cluster increased in frequency. The Tcf-1 deficient Tregs in spite of being more Th17
like, suppressed T-cells, however they failed to suppress inflammation. This indicates a bifurcation of Treg
suppressive functions and begs the question, of whether it involves a co-operation between TCF-1 and Foxp3.
We have found that, TCF-1 and Foxp3 co-bind enhancer elements of genes involved in T cell activation and
Th17 differentiation. β-catenin induces newly accessible chromatin regions at these enhancers and
upregulates the expression of the associated genes. Moreover, the E-box binding protein HEB works together
with TCF-1 and potentially also Foxp3 to regulate these genes, since Treg specific ablation of both TCF-1 and
HEB (but not each one alone) rescues inflammatory and autoimmune pathologies associated with β-catenin
activation in Tregs. Consistently, HEB regulates RORγt, represses Foxp3 and peripheral Treg development. Our
findings are in line with the notion that FoxP3 directly activates or represses transcription, in a context- and
partner-dependent manner. They further implicate β-catenin, TCF-1, and HEB in partnering with Foxp3 to
independently regulate the diverse Treg suppressive activities. Based on these findings we hypothesize that,
Wnt/β-catenin signaling differentially regulates Treg suppressive functions and diversity, by controlling
access of Foxp3 and HEB to select chromatin sites bound by Tcf-1. To address this hypothesis in specific
Aim 1 we will determine the role of β-catenin and Tcf-1 in preparing the epigenetic landscape for Foxp3 binding
and in shaping Treg cell type diversity. In specific Aim 2 we will determine the role secreted Wnt ligands in
defining the functional properties of colon infiltrating Tregs. The proposed studies will elucidate fundamental co-
operations/antagonisms between TFs that regulate Treg properties in health, and how microenvironment
queues like Wnts exploit them in disease settings. The expected findings have the potential to inform novel
diagnostic and therapeutic tools for autoimmunity and cancer."
10895578,"Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is the gold standard treatment for patients with diffuse, multi-vessel
coronary artery disease, with >350,000 surgeries performed each year in the USA. Due to the limited availability
of arterial grafts, saphenous vein grafts (SVG) are used in >95% of patients. Despite advances in surgical
technique and post-surgical management, SVG stenoses and occlusions occur at alarmingly high rates: 5-10%
of SVGs fail within one month after surgery, 25% within 12-18 months, and 40-50% within 10 years, resulting in
significant morbidity and mortality. Currently, there are no clinically available means to prevent SVG failure
following CABG beyond optimal medical therapy. Mechanical stimuli, including hemodynamic loads and
associated vessel wall deformations and stresses, are known to contribute to the cell-mediated structural
changes leading to SVG failure, yet, the precise mechanobiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. In
preliminary studies, we quantified mechanical stimuli in CABG simulations, identifying hemodynamic markers
associated with SVG stenosis. Importantly, we introduced the first computational growth and remodeling (G&R)
framework that can delineate adaptive vs. maladaptive responses of vein grafts, incorporating optimization to
accelerate parameter estimation. With this model, we then predicted that an external bioabsorbable sheath,
present over a short post-operative period, could mitigate intermediate-term graft failure. Our scientific premise
is supported by a preliminary in vivo ovine study. Our collaborative multi-disciplinary team will address this
critical unmet need through tightly integrated computational model-driven design, experimental, and
clinical approaches to uncover arterialization mechanisms and evaluate a novel bioabsorbable sheath
device for SVG failure prevention. In Aim 1, we will develop the first G&R model of SVG arterialization
incorporating inflammation. We will inform and validate the model with data from a longitudinal rabbit surgical
study, in which we will perform surgery to interpose a jugular graft in the carotid artery. In Aim 2, we will
synthesize these data and models into a first-of-its-kind 3D fluid-solid-growth (FSG) simulator to predict SVG
disease progression, validated against an independent subset of animal data. To further inform our models, we
will characterize human SVG tissue with biaxial tissue testing. We will increase rigor by incorporating uncertainty
quantification. In Aim 3, we will design, optimize and evaluate a novel external sheath device for the prevention
of SVG failure, integrating in silico and large animal in vivo studies. We will rapidly 3D print sheath designs from
a unique class of bioabsorbable elastomeric materials with tunable degradation rates. This proposal brings
together a multidisciplinary team with expertise in cardiovascular simulation, vascular mechanobiology,
optimization, imaging, biomaterials, additive manufacturing, and clinical cardiovascular care as well as a track
record of joint publications, funding, and open-source software. Our ultimate goal is to improve outcomes of
CABG patients via prediction and prevention of SVG failure, for whom there are limited treatment options."
10867103,"We propose to develop a new microscope for connectomes with the potential to reduce the
price of a connectomic voxel by order(s) of magnitude. We will focus on a relatively unexplored
type of EM microcopy based on excitation of photoelectrons by UV light and their detection
with standard widefield EM optics (PEEM). Simply, PEEMs for connectomes can combine the
reliability of SEM imaging with the thruput of TEM imaging. We have demonstrated for the first
time that PEEMs can see synapse and we have designed a tailored PEEM microscope with
strong UV excitation from lasers and direct EM detectors that can work at Gigahertz imaging
rates. We will explore collecting 1000s of ultra-thin brain slices (UTBS) using two state of the art
automated approaches, the ATUM and Mag-C. We will optimize this pipeline, extending our
current sample preparation to support such imaging rates, adding Gas Cluster Ion milling to
improve the Z-resolution of PEEM connectomes, and, by designing, developing, and integrating
a new generation of fast stages that keep up with imaging rates. Finally, we will instantiate auto-
acquisition and quality assurance algorithms, e.g., auto-focus, auto-sigmate, etc. to facilitate
the imaging and collection of 1000s of ultrathin brain sections. We provide clear metrics for
success and achieving those milestones, we argue, could revolutionize how EM conenctomes
are made."

Patients who require intensive care unit (ICU) level of care frequently develop hospital-acquired
functional decline, a new or worsening loss of ability to perform self-care activities that is
associated with prolonged periods in immobility. This morbidity is potentially preventable
through initiating mobility interventions in the ICU using a multidisciplinary, evidence-based
intervention to maintain functional status. While guidelines for ICU patients' physical activity
exist, timely identification of patients suitable for activity interventions is an ongoing challenge
due to the dynamic nature of critical illness and the number of locations in the electronic health
record (EHR) that clinicians need to click in and out of to synthesize patient data. There is,
therefore, a critical need to develop an effective clinical decision support system (CDSS)
interface in the EHR for efficient identification of patients appropriate for physical activity
interventions and coordination of patient-specific activity plans within the ICU team. Our long-
term goal is to accelerate the development and implementation of clinically useful CDSS to
prevent hospital-acquired functional decline. Our overall objective is to develop a CDSS
interface for consistent patient-specific translation of evidence-based physical activity
interventions for ICU settings, and evaluate its usability, usefulness, cognitive workload,
acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness on decision-making outcomes. The proposed project
has two phases and four specific aims. In Phase 1 (R21), we will develop a useable, useful, and
acceptable CDSS prototype by conducting clinician interviews and a user-centered design
approach (R21 Aim 1), and identify clinical workflow considerations, potential barriers, and
implementation strategies in preparation for evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of the
CDSS (R21 Aim 2). In Phase 2 (R33), we will evaluate the CDSS usability, cognitive workload,
acceptability, and effectiveness for activity guideline adoption in a simulated EHR environment
(R33 Aim 3) and on two ICU units in one tertiary care hospital (R33 Aim 4). The results are
expected to have an important positive impact by providing strong justification for a subsequent
multi-site pragmatic R01-level clinical trial to scale the concurrent use of patient data with
guideline recommendations at the point of care to deliver evidence-based interventions to
reduce hospital-acquired functional decline at its negative, costly outcomes."

10896278,"Several challenges exist in the conduct of EHR-based translational research. First, CTSA hubs vary
substantially in their capacity to address challenges in EHR data collection, data quality, data harmonization,
methodology for deep phenotyping, maintaining patient privacy, variability in ontology, and limited ability to
transfer data beyond institutional firewalls. Second, there is an unmet need for readily available, easily
accessed informatics tools that facilitate EHR-based research and can be rapidly disseminated and
implemented across all CTSA hubs. Third, CTSA hubs seek guidance on the complicated data use
agreements (DUAs) and governance needed to enable data sharing and analysis of shared data. With funding
from NCATS, we created a federated system, the ACT Network, that crafted a broad DUA and stood-up local
clinical data warehouses (CDWs) at 57 CTSA hubs, created an information superhighway to query the CDWs
that include >142M patients, and democratized data access for cohort discovery to all CTSA hub investigators.
We initially developed ACT to support the planning and design of multisite clinical trials, which it did well and
additionally highlighted the potential value of EHR data for deeper analysis. While the ACT Network has limited
analytic capacity in its present form, we will now address this opportunity to fully leverage the research
potential of EHR data from almost half the US population through Evolve to Next-Gen ACT (ENACT). We will
create a user-friendly collaborative research and computing environment with cutting edge analytical methods.
We will start with tools and a dashboard to monitor data quality, provide guidance to individual sites to improve
data quality, and provide contextual reports that help investigators interpret their data. We will also apply
natural language processing to extract clinical concept data from reports and notes in the EHR, provide user-
friendly interfaces that are interoperable with common data models (i2b2, OMOP, PCORnet), expand
ontologies (lifestyle factors, genetic variants, retired codes), and provide other sophisticated informatics tools,
including those developed by our team and by others. In parallel, we will create a platform and provide
statistical and machine learning capacity that clinical and translational scientists can apply to EHR data, either
through federated analyses or, for more complex compute-intensive analyses, in a temporary enclave. We
envision leveraging these informatics tools and EHR data to enable clinicians to generate evidence that can be
applied to improve patient care. With every step, we will design for dissemination and sustainability to foster a
learning informatics system. We will prioritize unmet needs among stakeholders, solicit input on the desired
features, and ensure that ENACT satisfies the needs of targeted end users. We will leverage the I-Corps@
NCATS program for customer discovery, beta testing, and business model development for sustainability. We
will collect data through pilot trials of each tool and resource that will be used to create marketing materials and
to develop sustainability models that include cost-recovery based on real-world time and effort required."
10896344,"Project Summary
There are no reliable methods to stabilize proteins with high accuracy. Currently available methods have
standard errors between observed and predicted effects of mutations on protein stability that range from 1 to 3
kcal/mol. Given the importance of protein stability for biomedical applications such as the shelf-life and
immunogenicity of protein-based pharmaceuticals, development of reliable methods to stabilize proteins with
high accuracy is critical. To address this deficit in current knowledge, we have developed EmCAST (Empirical
C-Alpha Stability Tool) and have shown that it can double the stability of a small three helix bundle, UBA(1),
with four mutations. For a set of eight single, double, triple, and quadruple mutant variants that contain
combinations of these four mutations, the average error between predicted and observed stability was 0.13
kcal/mol, a vast improvement over existing methods to predict stabilizing mutations. EmCAST relies on two
important innovations: 1) use of an empirical potential derived from a database of the alpha carbon (C)
dihedral angle preferences for all possible four-residue sequences extracted from the 2018 release of the
Protein Data Bank and 2) selection of surface-exposed sites for introduction of stabilizing mutations. In the
proposed work, we will demonstrate that EmCAST can be an effective tool to stabilize a broad range of protein
folds and that it can be used to tune the position of protein conformational switches and hence control protein
function. We will also release, maintain, and upgrade a web service so that the protein biochemistry community
can readily access and use this valuable tool.
We will accomplish these goals in the context of the following Aims:
 • In Aim 1, Rational Stabilization of Pure  and  Domains, we will show that EmCAST can stabilize a
 set of four additional helical domains with high accuracy and that it can also be applied to stabilization
 of -sheet domains. Predicted stabilizations for these proteins range from 2.5 to 6 kcal/mol.
 • In Aim 2, Stabilization of Mixed / Domains and Large Folds, we apply EmCAST to stabilize a set
 of four more complex folds that include both -helix and -sheet structure with sequence lengths up to
 270 amino acids. EmCAST predicts stabilizations of 3 to 5 kcal/mol for the selected proteins.
 • In Aim 3, Regulating Loop Dynamics and Tuning the Position of Conformational Switches, we
 will show that EmCAST can be applied to differential stabilization of alternate conformers of proteins,
 allowing for tuning of protein function."
10896345,"Many brain disorders manifest impaired synaptic integrity, stability, and experience-dependent selection,
resulting in wiring deficits and perturbed function. Unfortunately, our ability to monitor synaptic or circuit failures
as they occur has been hindered by the difficulty of visualizing synapses in vivo. Here we propose in vivo
monitoring of the ‘order of operations’ in excitatory synapse formation and elimination, and identifying the steps
and molecules controlling experience-dependent synapse selection. We focus on the visual system, where there
is a well-characterized toolkit for manipulating experience. We hypothesize that the dynamics of a synapse's
assembly and disassembly, and its propensity to remodel, are intimately linked to its connection identity and
proteomic content. To test this, we propose the following aims: Aim1: To track the structural remodeling of
excitatory synapses and how it relates to their afferent input specificity and proteomic content. We will
label LGN or LP thalamic inputs onto the full dendritic arbor of single L2/3 pyramidal neurons in mouse visual
cortex, track their daily dynamics and their response to visual deprivation, and analyze their proteomic content
in relation to dynamic history and afferent identity. To this purpose, we will implement triple color two-photon
microscopy to simultaneously track, in vivo, both pre- and postsynaptic elements of excitatory synapses, followed
by Magnified Analysis of Proteome (MAP), a combination of tissue clearing and expansion microscopy, for super
resolution analysis of synaptic protein content across the entire neuron. Aim 2: To dissect, at a molecular
level, experience-dependent selection and stabilization of excitatory synapses. CPG15/neuritin is an
activity-regulated gene product critical for synapse stabilization and maturation. In vivo imaging in WT and
CPG15 knockout mice revealed that while spine formation occurs normally in the absence of visual experience
or CPG15, in both cases PSD95 recruitment to nascent spines is deficient. CPG15 expression in the absence
of activity is sufficient to restore normal PSD95 recruitment and spine stabilization, suggesting it acts as an
activity-dependent synapse selector. A puzzling aspect in this scenario is that CPG15 is extracellular while
PSD95 is intracellular, and neither has a transmembrane domain. Interestingly, CPG15 was previously identified
as part of the AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) proteome. Yet, CPG15's mechanism of action remains
unclear. To probe CPG15's synaptic function, we will map the minimal CPG15 binding domain on the AMPAR,
and test whether preventing its interaction with CPG15 effects AMPAR interaction with stargazin, an adaptor
molecule that is essential for delivering, inserting, and retaining functional receptors at the PSD. To probe how
CPG15 binding influences AMPAR stability at the synapse and how this, in turn, effects synaptic presence of its
downstream interacting proteins, stargazin and PSD95, we will develop an in vitro assay for synaptic AMPAR
mobility. Finally, we will ask how loss of CPG15, as a surrogate of experience, impacts the molecular sequence
of synapse formation, stabilization, and maturation in vivo, using two photon microscopy followed by MAP."
10896346,"The Role of Master Epigenetic Regulators in Ocular Chemical Injury
SUMMARY
Mustard vesicants including sulfur mustard (SM) and nitrogen mustard (NM) cause severe respiratory, skin,
and ocular injuries. They have been used as a chemical weapon in the warfare and also impose a potential
threat to civilians as they could be used by the terrorists' attack. Ocular injuries in particular corneal injury were
prevalent in SM-exposed victims. Inflammation, neovascularization and fibrosis are three major problems and
players in mustard-induced corneal injury, yet the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown, which limits
the development of effective managements for the disease. The BET (bromodomain and extra-terminal
domain) family proteins, including universally expressed BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4 and testis-specific BRDt, are
epigenetic readers. They recognize and bind to acetylated lysine (KAc) within the N-terminal tail protruding
from the histone core of the nucleosome, and act as scaffold proteins to recruit transcription factors and the
positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex, which phosphorylates and releases paused RNA
polymerase II (RNAPII) to transcript the transcription factor-targeted genes. The BETs play a key role in
inflammation, neovascularization and fibrosis in many disease but their role in ocular chemical injury is
unknown. We now provide compelling evidence suggesting that BETs have a key role in corneal mustard injury
and propose to further explore this novel mechanism. We will test the hypothesis that NM injury induces
corneal inflammation, neovascularization and fibrosis via activation of master epigenetic regulator BETs using
mouse and rabbit models, selective BTE inhibitors, state of the art in vivo ocular imaging techniques including
optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) and OCT-angiography (OCT-A), and genomic profiling and
immunohistochemistry approaches. The proposed work will allow us to define the role of BETs in mustard-
induced injury by characterizing the contributions of BD1 and BD2 in corneal injury, elucidating the underlying
mechanisms, and testing whether BET inhibition could effectively treat acute and delayed injury. Considering
the success that has been reported in developing BET blockers with acceptable safety profiles and promising
efficacy in several phase I and II clinical trials, BET inhibitors may offer high translational potentials for being
tested and eventually used in clinical studies."
10896347,"ABSTRACT
Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory infections in young children,
immunocompromised persons, and the elderly, resulting in high morbidity and mortality. Few studies have
investigated why HMPV is more severe in the elderly. This proposal aims to fill this knowledge gap about
HMPV pathogenesis. My preliminary data discovered that aged mice infected with HMPV exhibit delayed viral
clearance, increased lung inflammation, and increased CD8+ HMPV-tetramer+ cells co-expressing the
inhibitory markers PD-1, TIM-3, and LAG-3. I hypothesize that severe HMPV infection in the elderly is
caused by impairment of the CD8+ T cell response. In Aim 1, I will investigate the intrinsic causes of the
CD8+ T cell impairment observed in the aged host infected with HMPV using 10X Multiomics studies on murine
lung directly ex vivo and syngeneic transplants. 10X Multiomics will elucidate age-related epigenetic changes
in CD8+ T cells while syngeneic transplants will transfer young CD8+ T cells into an aged host and vice versa to
determine if CD8+ T cells are the primary immune cells causing the impaired immune response to HMPV (i.e.
increased weight loss, clinical severity, delayed viral clearance). In Aim 2, I will investigate extrinsic causes of
the CD8+ T cell impairment, namely by alveolar macrophages (AMs). I will use a 21-color multispectral flow
cytometry panel to enumerate M1 and M2 macrophage populations in the aged host. In vitro co-culture and
transwell assays of AMs and CD8+ T cells will determine if AMs directly impair CD8+ T cells. Selective depletion
of AMs in aged mice and adoptive transfer of young macrophages will determine how AMs contribute to the
impaired immune response in the aged host. 10X Multiomics will also be performed in this aim to investigate
the age-related epigenetic changes in AMs that may contribute to their aberrant M2 accumulation, which I have
also observed in my preliminary data.
This proposal aims to understand the mechanistic differences in the aged host response to HMPV,
which will help elucidate why HMPV infection in the elderly is more severe. These studies have the potential to
translate into the clinical setting and contribute to better management and treatment for HMPV infection, such
as immunomodulation. Identifying molecular targets in the aged host will guide development of a safe and
effective vaccine against HMPV for all at-risk populations.
In addition, this proposal has tremendous training opportunities, contributing towards my career goals of
becoming a clinician scientist and independent principal investigator in immunology and infectious disease."

While ~25% of school-age children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) achieve an HbA1c of <7.5%, the majority of
school-age children do not and are at a higher risk for T1D-related complications. Achieving optimal T1D self-
care is currently the only direct pathway to better HbA1c and even with the addition of modern therapeutic
modalities (e.g., hybrid closed loop), T1D self-care is a complex, time-consuming, and relentless task. School-
age children need support from their parents to effectively manage T1D and therefore both parents and youth
with T1D are vulnerable to Diabetes Distress (DD). Presently, the American Diabetes Association (ADA)
Standards of Care recommend assessment of DD during routine diabetes clinic visits in youth and their
caregivers starting when youth are ~8-years-old. Unfortunately, while DD screening may be an ADA Care
Standard, there are no practical and evidence-based screen-to-treat programs for clinics to adopt to meet this
Standard of Care. We submit this new R01 in response to RFA-DK-19-021, Treating Diabetes Distress to
Improve Glycemic Outcomes in Type 1 Diabetes. Our objective is to test the feasibility and acceptability of a
novel, practical, and scalable screen-to-treat program for DD in school-age children and their parents (called
Remedy to Diabetes Distress [R2D2]) and to test the initial efficacy of R2D2 to reduce DD to improve children's
glycemic control. Our specific aims are: 1) Define and iteratively refine our new screen-to-treat program (R2D2)
for DD in school-age families in order to maximize feasibility and acceptability to stakeholders, and 2) Establish
initial efficacy of R2D2 to reduce parent and child DD to improve child glycemic control. To enhance scientific
rigor, we will use the ORBIT Model for Behavioral Intervention Development to guide our study design. The
ORBIT Model proposes a phased approach using a series of small, cost-effective studies to determine clinically-
meaningful targets and to test a treatment's acceptability and initial efficacy before embarking on a large clinical
trial. For ORBIT Phase 1a: Define, we will conduct a brief longitudinal study to establish cut-points for clinically
relevant DD in parents and school-age children, engage clinic Quality Improvement teams to develop a practical
clinic-based screening approach, and use crowdsourcing techniques to obtain family input on a new mHealth
treatment. For ORBIT Phase 1b: Refine, we will test implementation of our R2D2 screening program across
multiple clinics and we will conduct a small trial to identify an initially efficacious and practical mHealth treatment
delivery approach for R2D2. Finally, for ORBIT Phase 2a, we will continue to screen for DD in clinic and recruit
families who report clinically relevant DD into a Proof of Concept Pilot to examine whether ameliorating parent
and/or child DD leads to improved child glycemic control. We believe our study optimally responds to the FOA
because our: 1-research team is multidisciplinary and includes a true partnership between a behavioral scientist
and a diabetologist, 2-R2D2 screen-to-treat program reflects a practical approach that could realistically occur
in clinic, 3-use of Implementation Science will further enhance future sustainability and dissemination of R2D2."

In the next year, approximately 22,000 Americans will develop glioblastoma (GBM) and nearly the same number
will die from it. Further, we can reliably predict that of the 22,000 new cases, 8,500 will be in females while the
remaining 13,500 cases will be in males. Moreover, while the median survival for female GBM patients next year
is expected to be between 17 and 22 months, for males it will be closer to 16 months. The molecular bases for
these consistent and significant sex differences in incidence and survival are unexplained. In the absence of an
explanation, it is impossible to fully know what the implications of sex differences are for modeling GBM in the
laboratory and for treating GBM in the clinic. Identifying targetable mechanisms underlying sex differences in
survival are the focus of this project, and our goal is to improve outcomes for all GBM patients. Building on our
published and preliminary studies supported during the prior funding period of this RO1, we now hypothesize
that sex differences in cellular senescence contribute to the sex disparity in glioblastoma (GBM)
incidence and survival. As radiation or chemotherapy induced senescence is a mechanism of stopping tumor
growth, we will focus on the mechanisms that endow female cells with greater ability to undergo senescence
than their male counterparts in response to DNA damage. While cellular senescence has been extensively
studied in normal and pathological states, studies in cancer have focused almost exclusively on fibroblast and
bone marrow stromal cell senescence in breast and prostate cancer models. There has been little to no
investigation of the role that cellular senescence plays in brain tumor promotion or treatment response, or any
focus on sex differences in cellular senescence. We have two Specific Aims in which we will build on our prior
success and utilize the extensively validated model systems for studying sex differences in GBM that we
developed. We will apply innovative genomic technologies to define the contributions of sex differences in p21
and Rb functions to the induction of senescence, and will determine whether Brd4 and sex-specific epigenetics
are required for sex differences in astrocyte and GBM cell senescence and the senescence-associated secretory
phenotype."
10896353,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Research into cognitive impairments and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) suggests that
exposure to enriching or stimulating social contexts – i.e., social complexity – may slow age-related cognitive
decline and delay the onset or progression of ADRD. Most research in this area has considered how social
complexity in either the proximal (e.g., social network, social activities) or distal (e.g., neighborhood) contexts
shape cognition. Additionally, prior research on social complexity and cognition is conducted largely separately
from existing physiological frameworks for understanding cognitive aging and ADRD. Through this K01, Dr.
Alyssa Goldman will integrate existing research on the roles of sensory systems and inflammation in shaping
cognitive decline and ADRD, and examine how these associations are informed by changes in both proximal
and distal social complexity over time. Dr. Goldman’s long-term goal is to lead a social science research program
that uses innovative approaches to better understand the social pathways of cognitive functioning and ADRD.
The K01 Award will support this goal by extending her prior training as a sociologist, developing her
understanding of and skills in: (1) the physiology of cognitive aging, ADRD, sensory functioning, and
inflammation, (2) the objective assessment of cognition, sensory functioning, and inflammation through large-
scale, in-home survey methods, (3) advanced methods for longitudinal analysis, and (4) grant writing and
professional development. In parallel with this training, this project has three research aims: (1) to determine
how changes in exposure to proximal and distal social complexity collectively shape cognition and ADRD, (2) to
determine how proximal and distal social complexity are associated with olfaction, in ways that may shape
trajectories of cognition and ADRD, and (3) to determine how proximal and distal social complexity are
associated with inflammation, in ways that may explain changes in cognition and ADRD. The training and
research goals of this proposal will be overseen by a mentorship committee of accomplished experts in cognition
and ADRD, sensory systems, chronic inflammation, and aging and the social context. This study will generate
new insights on the collective impact of proximal and distal social factors on cognitive decline and ADRD. Further,
this study will examine how social complexity shapes trajectories of olfaction and inflammation as mechanisms
in the relationship between social complexity and cognitive health in a nationally-representative sample of older
adults. These physiological frameworks of cognition and ADRD have yet to be contextualized in terms of social
factors. This study will develop innovative measures of social network change, which are largely undertheorized,
and that can be applied to future studies of cognitive aging and other health trajectories. The training and
research activities of this award will equip Dr. Goldman with the skills to succeed as an independent investigator
of the social context of sensory systems, disease processes, and their relationships with cognition and ADRD."

Inflammatory and infectious diseases are among the leading causes of death worldwide. Coordination and
regulation of immune defenses are essential to combating infection and preventing aberrant inflammatory
responses. This is especially important within the gastrointestinal tract where potential pathogens must be
differentiated from commensal microbes. Deleterious alterations in our gut microbial community (dysbiosis) are
associated with numerous diseases. At the forefront of host-microbe interactions are intestinal cells which act as
a critical barrier and interface with our luminal environment. Intestinal cells possess a repertoire of innate immune
receptors and defense mechanisms, allowing them to directly respond to and modulate gut bacteria. Thus, they
are thought to play a critical role in establishing and maintaining the beneficial symbiotic relationships we develop
with our gut microbiota. Remarkably, several fundamental processes underlying these host-microbe interactions
remain poorly understood, including how intestinal cells differentiate between commensals and pathogens or
which intestinal cell responses promote commensal selection in the gut. The long-term objective of this proposal
is to determine how intestinal cells directly contribute to the selection and maintenance of commensal gut
bacteria. The proposed research approaches this objective by leveraging the tractability and simplicity of the
model organism C. elegans to provide the fine-scale spatial resolution needed to dissect the intricacies
underlying host-microbe interactions. C. elegans is a model of intestinal development and innate immunity that
also harbors a diverse gut microbiome in natura, making C. elegans an excellent system for studying microbial-
induced innate immune responses. Aim 1 will determine how bacteria- and community-specific immune
responses are organized in the intestine by evaluating the transcriptional response of intestinal cells to
commensal and pathogenic gut bacteria using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). This will reveal unique
innate immune signatures among intestinal cells throughout the gut based on bacterial exposure. Preliminary
evidence from our embryo scRNA-seq dataset highlight several spatially distinct immune genes including the C-
type lectins (CLECs), which have a well-defined role in bacterial recognition in mammals. Aim 2 will determine
how intestinal cells regulate commensal colonization in the gut by testing the role of innate immune receptors,
specifically CLECs, in selecting for and maintaining commensal bacteria. Using a combination of molecular
biology and microscopy techniques, aim 2 will elucidate the cohorts of CLECs required to recognize and respond
to commensal gut bacteria. Results from this proposed investigation will clarify how innate immunity is regulated
on a transcriptional level throughout the intestine and how it contributes to the selection and maintenance of
host-microbe relationships in the gut. By combining the tractability of C. elegans with innovative mechanistic
analysis we will move the C. elegans research community forward and, importantly, reveal conserved pathways
enabling the creation of generalizable concepts not limited solely to C. elegans."

Psychiatric disorders are highly prevalent following kidney transplantation (KT) and significantly reduce the
survival and quality of life of KT recipients. KT is a severely limited resource, and extensive efforts are made by
transplant programs to anticipate post-KT co-morbidities. However, major depressive disorder (MDD) and post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) both have ~20% point prevalence in KT recipients. The overarching aim of this
proposal is to systematically investigate genomic, clinical, and psychosocial contributors to MDD and PTSD
following KT. The specific aims are: 1) generate a retrospective electronic health record-based cohort of KT
recipients to characterize biopsychosocial risk factors for psychiatric disorders post-KT; 2) establish a
prospective cohort of KT candidates to follow trajectories of psychiatric symptoms and risk factors; and 3)
develop a predictive model for psychiatric disorders in KT recipients. Kidney disease disproportionately impacts
traditional minorities, and most KT recipients are not of European ancestry. When calculating genetic risk score
for KT recipients, I will leverage new and diverse training sets and a growing toolkit of genomic methods to
appropriately estimate genetic risk across ancestry. I anticipate that this work will improve our ability to
understand and mitigate risk of psychiatric disorders for kidney disease patients more broadly and will
build on efforts to apply genomic data to patients with non-European ancestry.
Dr. Nash is a physician-scientist deeply committed to her primary career goal of improving the mental health of
severely ill patients, with an emphasis on those awaiting or living with a solid organ transplant. Her long-term
research goal is to build clinical registries with genomic data to elucidate risk factors and etiology of psychiatric
disorders in solid organ transplant recipients that will inform the future ideal of personalized, targeted, and pre-
emptive treatment for those at risk for psychiatric co-morbidities. Dr. Nash has a PhD in biological chemistry with
a strong scientific background, is a fellowship-trained Psychiatrist, and now requires training in clinical research
and psychiatric genetics to accomplish her goals as an independently funded investigator. The research outlined
in this proposal will provide the necessary training in 1) the design, management, and statistical analysis of
clinical databases; 2) survey methodology to capture psychological traits during prospective cohort studies; and
3) GWAS data interpretation and calculation of genetic risk scores. Dr. Nash has built a core mentorship team
consisting of Dr. Samantha Meltzer-Brody (co-lead mentor), a physician-scientist and internationally recognized
expert in mood disorders; Dr. Patrick Sullivan (co-lead mentor), a world-renowned psychiatric geneticist; Dr. Yun
Li (co-mentor), a statistical geneticist who developed core methods for genomics, including imputation and
genetic association; and Dr. David Gerber (co-mentor), Chief of Abdominal Transplant at UNC who has
published widely in the field including work examining survival benefits and long-term outcomes for transplant
patients. Their combined mentorship will allow Dr. Nash to succeed as an independent investigator."
10896477,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the proposed work, the Hunstad laboratory at Washington University will employ new models of urinary tract
infection (UTI) in female, androgenized female, and male mice to determine molecular mechanisms by which
host androgen exposure promotes uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) pyelonephritis as well as renal
scarring, a common sequela of upper-tract UTI. Our recent findings indicate that the influence of sex, including
androgen exposure, on these common bacterial infections is more complex than previously appreciated.
Using newly developed and optimized models of UTI in mice, we recently demonstrated that androgen
exposure is associated with increased risk for chronic cystitis and high-titer pyelonephritis, as well as formation
of renal abscesses, in both male and female hosts. These findings correlate with epidemiologic data revealing
higher morbidity and mortality in men who do suffer complicated UTI (compared with women), and higher
incidence of UTI in women with a common hyperandrogenic condition (polycystic ovary syndrome). Moreover,
we have demonstrated a separable effect of androgens on renal fibrosis (scarring), a common complication of
pyelonephritis in children that can contribute to long-term sequelae such as hypertension and risk for chronic
kidney disease. On the basis of these findings, we hypothesize that fundamental sex differences impact the
host-pathogen interaction and cellular responses in pyelonephritis, thereby influencing pathogenicity,
resolution, and subsequent renal scarring. To interrogate this hypothesis, and building on our published work,
we will first comprehensively define host-sex-specific virulence requirements and sex influences on the host-
pathogen interaction through single-nucleus RNA-seq, hybrid capture-enhanced bacterial RNA-seq, and
insertion-site sequencing experiments on the infected kidney, in collaboration with MPI Dr. Earl and
collaborator Dr. Humphreys. Candidate sex-discrepant host pathways and bacterial virulence factors will be
confirmed and interrogated using germline and conditional knockout mice, bacterial mutants, and an array of
bacterial pathogenesis studies. We will also define the molecular pathways underlying renal fibrosis following
pyelonephritis, and how these pathways are modulated by sex and/or by androgen exposure at varying times
before, during, and after UTI. In total, the proposed work will leverage new preclinical models and an array of
conventional and cutting-edge experimental techniques. Our results will illuminate sex-specific host-pathogen
interactions in the infected kidney and identify UPEC virulence factors important in sex-dependent outcomes of
upper-tract UTI. In addition, our preclinical findings will also be translationally relevant to recurrent UTI and
renal scarring in human patient populations."

Ischemic stroke affects around 1 in 1600 to 4000 births, has the highest incidence in neonates and infants (<
one year of age), and may cause neurological sequalae, including motor and cognitive deficits. Infection and
immune responses are a major risk factor for pediatric stroke, but no immune-directed therapies are available.
In fact, supportive measures remain the mainstay of pediatric stroke care, since the lytic treatment carries a
high in neonates with fragile cerebrovascular vessels. In this project, we will use a murine model of pediatric
stroke, with and without lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-sensitization, to test the pathological roles of neutrophils
and monocytes towards the development of immunomodulation therapies.
Aim 1: To clarify how immune cells breach the pial/glia limitans barrier in pediatric LPS/stroke. We will use flow
cytometry and single-cell RNA-Seq analysis to determine the compositions and transcriptome of immune cells
in the meninges after LPS/stroke, and test whether anti-MMP9 treatment prevents the neutrophil influx.
Aim 2: To test whether there are two waves of monocytic infiltrates with distinct functions in pediatric stroke. We
will use CCR2-CreER mice to track monocytic infiltrates and single-cell RNA-Seq analysis, as well as, block the
influx of monocytes at different stage after stroke to address this issue.
Aim 3: To determine what constitutes the meninges-incurred pathogenicity of neutrophils after pediatric
LPS/stroke. Our RNA-Seq results suggest that neutrophils acquire IL-36gamma, a novel family of the IL-1
family cytokine, in the meninges. We will validate these findings and test the benefits of anti-IL36R treatment.
Successful completion of this project will shed insights into the mechanisms of pediatric ischemic stroke and
whether neutrophil/monocyte-targeted immunomodulation therapies could provide better clinical management."
10869798,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cell-cell interactions mediated by cell-surface proteins (CSPs) are central to human physiology, controlling
assembly and maintenance of organs and tissues. The human genome has about 3700 genes encoding CSPs.
In collaboration with a group at Stanford, one of the P.I.s conducted in vitro extracellular “interactome” screens
that defined binding partners for 550 human CSPs, and he is currently working on a global in vitro screen. Such
screens, which use soluble extracellular domain (ECD) fusion proteins, are most useful for single-
transmembrane (TM) CSPs. Many CSPs with multiple TM domains, such as G protein-coupled receptors, have
ECDs composed of discontinuous loops, making it difficult to express them in a soluble form. There are about
1700 genes encoding such CSPs. Identification of binding partners for multi-span CSPs will require the use of
screens in which intact proteins are expressed on cellular or vesicular membranes. We plan to develop
technology for a “library-on-library” cell-based screen for CSP interactions that can identify many binding partners
in a single experiment. We hope to use this method to define interactions for CSPs expressed in the human
nervous system. Our proposed method uses a new technology, developed by the other P.I., for making
engineered extracellular vesicles, called eVLPs, that display single CSPs at high density on their surfaces. We
plan to make a pool of eVLPs, each of which encapsulates a unique RNA barcode. Each eVLP will display one
member of a library of target CSPs. In parallel, we will generate a cell library in which each cell expresses one
CSP from the library. The eVLP pool will be mixed with the cell library, and we will select cells that have fused
with an eVLP whose displayed CSP binds to the CSP on the cell surface. Fusion after binding is catalyzed by a
mutant VSVG protein, and leads to expression of a fluorescent marker. We will then analyze the sorted cells by
single-cell RNA sequencing. By recovering the barcode sequence, which identifies the CSP on the donor eVLP,
and the sequence of the CSP expressed by the recipient cell, we will identify candidate CSP interactions that
can later be validated using other methods. We plan to attain these objectives of this application through the
following Specific Aims. Aim 1: Efficiently incorporate barcode RNAs into eVLPs. Aim 2: Use eVLPs to conduct
pilot screens to identify known ligand-receptor pairs. We will determine whether interactions between a CSP on
an eVLP and a CSP on recipient cells can lead to membrane fusion and allow sorting and sequencing of cells
transduced by the eVLP. We will conduct a small pilot screen to determine if the cell-based screen can identify
interactions that we previously found through in vitro screens. The expected outcome of the proposed research
will be the development of a new method for library-on-library cell-based interactome screening. This will have
a significant positive impact, in that it will allow our group and others to identify many new ligand-receptor
interactions in the nervous system and elsewhere. Some of these interactions might define new therapeutic
targets."

Rigorous research on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) care to improve outcomes encompasses intensive investigations
on care contexts, care partners, models of care, and a variety of interventions designed to improve disease
management and outcomes for persons with AD and related dementias and their care partners. As one of the
few geriatrics-based ADRCs, the Wisconsin ADRC has a strong track record of developing and supporting
rigorous care-focused AD research, launching the first ‘AD Care Research Core (Core H)’ in the past renewal
cycle (2019). Since then, Core H has successfully met its initial objectives, 1) recruiting a registry of well-
characterized patients across all stages of AD and their care partners and establishing a linkage with health
record data; 2) growing infrastructure across a variety of clinical systems to facilitate translational AD care
research; and 3) supporting development of a rich array of multi-disciplinary consultant expertise spanning all
facets of care research and, particularly, AD-disparities aligned social exposome inquiry as a key resource
leveraged by the full ADRC network. Core H remains systematically integrated with other Cores, offering an
unparalleled opportunity to investigate highly innovative, rigorous research questions that straddle the fields of
AD biomarkers, diagnostics, and clinical care. Core H will continue to support new collaborations focusing on
diverse settings that span the continuum of AD care from diagnosis to advanced disease. Specific Aims are:
Aim 1: Care Research Infrastructure: 1a) Continue to provide and diversify ready collaborations with “research
ready” clinical settings to facilitate AD care-focused research to advance the development and testing of care
approaches across diverse settings and populations reflective of the full spectrum of AD care priorities; 1b)
Strategically expand the established Care Core Registry of individuals with AD and their care partners to address
under-studied care contexts/settings in the dementia care process and provide opportunities for plasma
biomarker (Core G) and brain donation (Core D); 1c) Maintain electronic health record linkages to existing well-
characterized ADRC subject cohorts and merge with AD biomarker (plasma, CSF, neuroimaging) and cognition
data. Aim 2: Context of Care (Exposome) Research Infrastructure: Advance integration of AD-disparities
aligned social exposome approaches pertinent to the study of AD disease processes, management, and receipt
of care across the ADRC network through continued investment in aligned Core H resources. Aim 3:
Methodology, Training, and Consultation: 3a) Develop and nationally disseminate resources for AD care and
care partner research engagement; 3b) Provide training to UW-Madison investigators and staff on AD care
research methods; 3c) Provide pre- and post-award consultation to investigators implementing and/or planning
AD care research studies and assist in grant preparation, study design, and startup. Through these aims, Core
H will provide comprehensive AD care research support towards enhanced rigor, quality, and advancement of
the field, which will directly lead to improvements in outcomes for persons with AD and their care partners."

This K01 mentored training grant is designed to support Dr. Jinjing Liu in becoming an independent
investigator in the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) field. The proposal’s scientific and training goals center on the
study of the neurobiological basis of pathological social aggression in AD. Pathological social aggression
appears in 30-50% of AD patients, impacting their quality of life, causing distress for caregivers, and imposing
immense socioeconomic burden. Yet the neural mechanisms that contribute to social aggressive behavior,
particularly within the context of AD, remain largely unknown and options to treat aggression in AD patients are
limited. Under non-disease conditions, socially aggressive behavior is the result of complex signal integration
involving information about internal state (social motivation, anxiety) and social stimuli (familiarity/novelty/threat
perception). Classical lesion studies as well as more recent neurophysiological studies implicate the lateral
septum (LS) in the control of this behavior. However, we do not understand the circuit-level mechanisms, nor
do we know how AD-related pathology disrupts its function. This proposal’s overarching goal is to identify
these circuits so that we may identify therapeutic targets for social dysfunction associated with AD. Existing
literature and preliminary data support a hypothesis that AD-related pathology disrupts a specific
extrahippocampal projection (CA2 to LSi pathway) by impairing neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) function within
this circuit. The proposed work will test this hypothesis by (1) establishing the role of the intermediate lateral
septum (LSi) as a key integrator of cognitive information coming from the hippocampus (CA2) and OXT-
sensitive inputs about internal motivation and anxiety state; (2) determining how AD-related pathology impacts
CA2LSi circuitry to disrupt the normal regulation of social aggressive behavior; and (3) exploring the
translational potential of enhanced OXT signaling in the LSi to restore circuit function and improve behavioral
outcomes. The approach is innovative and achieves technical training goals by leveraging an array of modern
neuronal recording and manipulation techniques, including Patch-seq, in combination with neural tracing and
the use of a novel optically-sensitive caged OXT reagent developed in our lab that can achieve closed-loop
spatiotemporal control over OXT release when combined with large-scale in vivo recording. The mentor team
includes experts Dr. Richard Tsien (biophysics and synaptic physiology); Dr. Arjun Masurkar (clinical
manifestations and mechanisms of AD); and Dr. György Buzsáki (systems and computational neuroscience).
Building off extensive expertise in synaptic and ion channel physiology and animal behavior Dr. Liu will pursue
this work under the guidance of her mentors to advance her long-term career goal of establishing an
independent research program studying how neuromodulation at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels
contributes to symptoms of AD."
10868923,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
The breakdown of hydroxyproline, a component of collagen within our bodies and in the meat that we consume,
is a significant contributor to glyoxylate and oxalate levels. We have shown in normal individuals and patients
with primary hyperoxaluria (PH) that hydroxyproline is converted to oxalate (18% for PH1, 47% for PH3, and
33% for PH3). These values are the largest known contribution to oxalate formation for any metabolite studied
to date. We hypothesize that blocking the hydroxyproline pathway with a drug will significantly lower the
glyoxylate and oxalate burden of PH2 and PH3 patients, for which there are no available therapies. The target
of this study is the first enzyme in the hydroxyproline degradation pathway, hydroxyproline dehydrogenase
(HYPDH). A drug that blocks HYPDH activity would prevent the formation of downstream metabolites that
contribute to oxalate levels. This strategy is supported by the observation that individuals that are deficient in
HYPDH are normal and safely excrete the excess hydroxyproline into their urine. Our team has made the HYPDH
knockout mouse (Prodh2 gene) and shown that the mice are healthy and not affected by HYPDH deficiency.
Moreover, we have shown that the HYPDH knockout in the PH2 mouse model protects the mice from oxalate
production from hydroxyproline. Thus, inhibition of HYPDH shows promise for the prevention and treatment of
PH. Our team has already performed high throughput screening assays and identified potent inhibitors of
HYPDH. These inhibitors require further optimization to improve potency, selectivity, and drug-like properties.
The proposed research program will combine our biochemical, cellular, structural biology, computational, and
medicinal chemistry expertise to optimize the compounds. The following specific aims illustrate the iterative
compound progression plan that will be employed: (Aim 1) to design and synthesize compounds that will explore
the structure-activity-relationship (SAR) properties of HYPDH inhibitor scaffolds; (Aim 2) to determine the
biochemical and cellular properties of HYPDH inhibitors; (Aim 3) to apply computational and structural biology
approaches to determine the binding mode of HYPDH inhibitors to inform compound design and synthesis; and
(Aim 4) to determine the efficacy of HYPDH inhibitors in a variety of PH mouse models."
10870593,"Alphaviruses include important and emerging human pathogens such as encephalitic viruses and the
arthritogenic chikungunya virus. In spite of their importance, there are currently no licensed antiviral therapies
or vaccines. New approaches and information are needed to develop antiviral strategies.
 Alphaviruses are small enveloped viruses with highly ordered structures. The nucleocapsid core
contains the plus-sense RNA genome packaged within a capsid protein shell. The core is surrounded by the
virus envelope, which contains an organized array of the E2 and E1 transmembrane proteins. The structure
and function of the virus and viral proteins have been extensively characterized. However, there is
comparatively little information on the role of host proteins in the virus life cycle, in particular for steps such as
the uncoating of the incoming viral RNA during entry, the assembly and transport of the nascent nucleocapsid,
and the budding of virus particles from the plasma membrane. We used an innovative approach to identify host
proteins that specifically associate with the capsid/nucleocapsid during infection. The approach is based on
biotinylation of the capsid protein in alphavirus-infected cells, chemical crosslinking, specific capsid protein
retrieval under denaturing conditions, release of crosslinked cellular proteins, and identification of significant
host protein association by mass spectrometry. These candidate host factors were evaluated by siRNA
depletion for effects on infection by two different alphaviruses. Based on extensive preliminary results, we
propose to characterize 4 host proteins for their previously unidentified pro-viral roles in alphavirus infection.
 The specific aims are:
 1. Define the role of novel host proteins in the alphavirus exit pathway. Depletion of two host
proteins inhibited alphavirus spread but did not affect primary infection or envelope protein expression at the
cell surface. DARS is the cytoplasmic aspartyl tRNA synthetase, and part of the dynamic multi-tRNA
synthetase complex (MSC). Its depletion phenotype suggests that DARS plays a role in steps other than
protein synthesis, perhaps involving the MSC. YWHAB is a member of the family of 14-3-3 adaptor proteins,
which can regulate protein-protein interactions and protein modifications. We will use our established panel of
assays to define the role of DARS and YWHAB in the virus exit pathway.
 2. Define the role of novel host proteins in early steps in the alphavirus life cycle. Depletion of
two host proteins inhibited both virus spread and primary infection, but did not inhibit viral RNA replication. We
will perform mechanistic studies to define the differential roles of Rab1B and b spectrin in virus infection.
 The results of these studies will provide fundamental information on host proteins involved in the
alphavirus life cycle, and potential new targets for antiviral strategies."
10873201,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a sudden decrease of kidney function that is almost always reversible. While
reversible, AKI is serious and often requires hospitalization. The economic burden is also substantial, estimated
at $5-24 billion annually in the USA. Although AKI can arise within already-hospitalized patients (“hospital-
acquired AKI”), an unknown proportion of AKI initiates outside of the hospital (“community-acquired AKI”). One
potential contributor to the incidence of community-acquired AKI is exposure to high ambient temperatures,
which is thought to impact kidneys largely through volume depletion. Motivated by increasing concerns about
climate change, population-level studies using administrative health data have consistently reported positive
associations between outdoor heat (high temperatures and heat waves) and emergency department (ED) visits
and hospitalizations for AKI. A key limitation of existing studies is the identification of AKI cases through
International Classification of Disease (ICD) discharge diagnosis coding. Code-classified AKI, while specific, is
not a sensitive marker of AKI; it misses a high percentage of total cases. Moreover, it does not distinguish
community-acquired from hospital-acquired AKI, cannot assess AKI severity, and does not provide information
on patient context. In addition to these limitations, the majority of population-level studies have relied on spatially
crude measures of temperature (e.g., from one or a few monitoring sites) that do not fully capture important
urban heat dynamics. As a whole, the misclassification in both AKI outcome and heat exposure contribute to a
lack of understanding of the true effect of outdoor heat on AKI. This project is motivated by the need for (1)
improved outcome assessment, (2) improved exposure assessment, and (3) the identification of heat-vulnerable
populations that can be protected via targeted interventions. To address these needs, we will analyze a highly
detailed clinical database of over 1.5 million electronic medical records in Atlanta, Georgia for 2013-2021 linked
to a high-resolution, state-of-the-art exposure product that will developed as part of this project. For
ascertainment of AKI cases, we will consider ICD diagnosis codes - reflecting what has been used in the heat-
AKI literature – as well as via assessment of a KDIGO (Kidney Disease Improving Global Initiative)-based serum
creatine (SCr) definition comparing ED ‘first-measured’ SCr to baseline values. The KDIGO definition will enable
a specific assessment of community-acquired AKI and severity (i.e., stage). In Aim 1, we will develop of a rich
database of ED visits, heat exposure metrics at patient residential address, and individual- and area-level
sociodemographic and health risk factors. In Aims 2 and 3, we will estimate associations of short-term outdoor
heat exposure and AKI, and will identify individual- and area-level risk factors that increase vulnerability to
outdoor heat-related AKI. This work will fill major gaps in the epidemiology of outdoor heat and AKI that will
ultimately support targeted outreach and education activities, guide improvements in clinical care, and provide
inputs for quantitative risk assessment and economic evaluation of heat-health impacts."

The Americans with Disability Act (ADA) requires that healthcare organizations and providers ensure that
patients with disabilities receive equal access to healthcare services, facilities and programs. While the ADA
was passed more than 30 years ago, research demonstrates that persons with disabilities continue to
experience significant health and healthcare disparities. Persons with communication disabilities, who
represent >14% of the US population, experience specific challenges to patient-centered communication, an
essential component of high-quality care as outlined by the National Academy of Medicine report “Crossing the
Quality Chasm”.
Documentation of patients’ demographic information (e.g., race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and gender
identity) and social data (e.g., Social Determinants of Health) in electronic health records (EHR) has been
recognized by healthcare organizations, policy makers and advocates as a necessary step towards advancing
healthcare equity. Unfortunately, most healthcare organizations do not consistently or comprehensively
document patients’ disability status within the EHR. Consistent and accurate documentation of disability status
is needed to track the quality of care delivered to patients with communication disabilities and to identify
patients who need disability accommodations required by the ADA.
This project aims to adapt and evaluate the effects of an implementation support package of strategies to
assist primary care clinics in (1) documenting patients’ communication disability and accommodation needs in
the EHR and (2) providing communication disability accommodations. In Aim 1 we will employ Implementation
Mapping Adapt, which will allow us to review existing literature and build upon what is already known about
implementation of documentation of other demographic data. With a stakeholder panel, we will adapt an
implementation support package for documentation of communication disability status and provision of
communication accommodations in the primary care setting. Our final product will be a multi-component, multi-
level implementation support package designed for use in varying contexts. In Aim 2 and 3, we will conduct a
multi-method, Hybrid Type III effectiveness-implementation trial across 9 clinics in 3 healthcare systems:
UCHealth, Denver Health (a safety net health system), and Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, IL. The primary
care clinics will be diverse (e.g., urban, rural, women’s health, and geriatric clinics) to maximize learnings
across different contexts. Our outcomes will be guided by the PRISM/RE-AIM framework, with our primary
outcomes being the Reach of documentation of patients’ disability status (Aim 2) and the Adoption of provision
of disability accommodations (Aim 3.) The study findings will inform a support package with scalable strategies
that can be adapted and generalized to other types of disabilities."
10873315,"PROJECT SUMMARY
At least 15.4 million opioid prescriptions in the United States are provided each year during surgical care.
Excessive and risky perioperative opioid prescribing patterns are common and increase the risk of opioid
overdose, addiction, diversion, and persistent opioid use. To mitigate these harms, policymakers and payers in
most states have enacted policies that restrict opioid prescribing for acute pain or mandate clinicians to review
prescription drug monitoring program databases before prescribing opioids (PDMP use mandates). To date, few
studies have rigorously assessed the intended and unintended effects of these policies in the context of surgical
care. In this 4-year study, we will use quasi-experimental methods to examine the impact of opioid prescribing
limits and PDMP use mandates on perioperative opioid prescribing, high-risk prescribing, opioid-related adverse
events, and patient-reported outcomes. First, we will use commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid claims databases
to evaluate the effect of state opioid prescribing limits and to assess variation in effects by policy feature, patient
population, procedure, and prescriber (Aim 1). Second, we will evaluate the effect of state PDMP use mandates
and examine heterogeneity in effects using the same claims databases (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine the
impact of a major Michigan insurer’s opioid prescribing limit and Michigan’s PDMP use mandate on opioid
prescribing and patient-reported outcomes after surgery, using a novel linkage between a statewide registry of
surgical patients and the state PDMP database (Aim 3). Our findings will directly inform efforts to mitigate
morbidity from perioperative opioid prescribing and close critical knowledge gaps needed to optimize future
policy design. For example, if opioid prescribing limits and PDMP use mandates have reduced perioperative
opioid prescribing with minimal unintended effects, policymakers should consider implementing these policies
more broadly. However, if the policies have not reduced perioperative opioid prescribing or have had substantial
unintended effects, other approaches may be needed. Ultimately, this proposal will contribute to the development
of well-designed policies that balance the need for safe opioid prescribing with the need for effective
postoperative pain management."

Despite these advances that provide survival gains, there is still no cure for CRPC. Resistance to
enzalutamide occurs frequently and the mechanisms are incompletely understood. Hence, dissecting the
specific adaptive/resistant pathways that are responsible for drug resistance in CRPC and identifying novel
strategies targeting these pathways will dramatically impact the care of men with CRPC. Lin28, a RNA
binding protein, acts as an oncogene inducing cell proliferation and transformation. Lin28 suppresses let-7,
a miRNA involved in suppressing androgen signaling. Our preliminary data suggest that Lin28 promotes
castration resistant prostate cancer progression and is associated with resistance to androgen ablation
treatment. Lin28 is upregulated in prostate cancer and its expression correlates with advanced tumor stage.
Together, these studies underscore the importance of Lin28 in promoting prostate cancer progression and
resistance to enzalutamide, suggesting that targeting Lin28 may provide novel therapeutic opportunities for
prostate cancer. This proposal will determine the roles of Lin28 in resistance to enzalutamide, and explore
the potential of targeting Lin28 to overcome resistance. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1. Examine
the roles of Lin28 in the development of resistance to enzalutamide. 2. Determine molecular mechanisms
underlying Lin28-mediated resistance to enzalutamide. 3. Evaluate targeting Lin28 to overcome resistance
to enzalutamide treatment. The proposed studies will identify and characterize a novel resistance
mechanism involving Lin28 and evaluate targeting Lin28 to overcome resistance to enzalutamide treatment."

Our Veteran population has higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus and increased risk for developing
cardiovascular diseases (CVD) as compared to general population. Since diabetes is generally associated with
hypercholesterolemia, aggressive lowering of plasma LDL-cholesterol (<100mg/dL) is recommended for diabetic
patients. Achieving these stringent goals and reaching the targeted low LDL cholesterol levels in high risk
patients remains challenging. Thus, novel and superior therapeutic intervention is warranted to manage
hypercholesterolemia in patients with high risk for CVDs. Over the past 15 years, my studies have primarily
focused on investigating the roles of the gut in the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis in the body with a
goal to effectively manage hypercholesterolemia and associated diseases. Our studies have yielded several
novel mechanistic insights in regulation of intestinal cholesterol transporter NPC1L1. The increase in NPC1L1
expression in diseases such as diabetes mellitus enhances cholesterol absorption and contributes to the
associated hypercholesterolemia. Zetia (ezetimibe), the drug which inhibits NPC1L1 activity, decreases
cholesterol levels in the blood. However, recent studies supported the principle of “the lower is better” for plasma
cholesterol. Since ezetimibe only blocks NPC1L1 activity, decreasing NPC1L1 expression along with ezetimibe
represents an attractive therapeutic approach for a further reduction in plasma cholesterol. In this regard, our
studies were first of its kind to identify two Sterol Response Elements in the NPC1L1 promoter sequence and
showed that NPC1L1 expression is increased by the Sterol Response Element Binding Protein SREBP2. We
have also recently shown that NPC1L1 expression in the intestine is sensitive to alterations in DNA methylation.
Further, we have generated a novel transgenic mouse with intestine-specific overexpression of SREBP2 that
represents a unique tool to examine the contributions of the intestine to cholesterol homeostasis. Our studies
showed that this the activation of SREBP2 in the intestine only was sufficient to induce hypercholesterolemia
and increased susceptibility to diet-induced liver injury. Our studies also demonstrated an increase in the
stemness of intestinal epithelial cells by the overactivation of SREBP2. Our group contributed to the studies that
led to a breakthrough discovery showing that NPC1L1 cholesterol transporter mediates the infection with
hepatitis C virus. These studies resulted in an invention: New Indication for Ezetimibe and other NPC1L1-
inhibitors as treatment for hepatitis C virus infection. Our studies pertaining to investigating intestinal cholesterol
absorption have been continuously funded by a Merit Review grant from the VA since 2009. Ongoing studies in
the laboratory are also focused on investigating the molecular regulation of ileal bile acid absorption and the
contribution of its deregulation to the development of liver diseases (funded by R01 from NIH). Recently, we
have developed several state-of-the art innovative methods such as measuring bile acid transport in real time
and in living cells as well as click chemistry based metabolic approached using alkyne cholesterol. Our future
studies are directed at unraveling novel pathways encompassing gut-liver interaction in health and metabolic
diseases. My research interests are very well complemented by my active involvement in teaching and education
mission at the VA as well as at the affiliate University. I have mentored a number of undergrad and grad students,
physician scientists, GI Fellows and I am also the primary mentor on F30 predoctoral fellowship for VA based
MD/PhD candidate (F30 DK117535). My research program has established strong active collaborations with
other VA based investigators from multiple disciplines that align with the mission of VA in advancing the research
for the care of our veterans. Notably, the risk for CVD is significantly higher in veterans as compared to the
general population. Therefore, my research program to find novel means to decrease plasma cholesterol is
timely and directly relevant to the health of veterans in general and, particularly, veterans with diabetes mellitus."

10881671,"Project Summary/Abstract: Role of hypocretin in opiate addiction and withdrawal
Major causes of the opiate crisis are the addictive nature of opiates and the negative physiological and
psychological effects of withdrawal that lead to relapse. These effects persist for months or years after the last
dose is taken. In recent work we have found what may be the largest change in neuronal morphology in the
brain of human heroin addicts; an average 54% increase in the number of neurons producing detectable
levels of hypocretin (Hcrt, orexin), and an average 32% shrinkage in the volume of hypocretin neurons.
Adjacent melanin concentrating hormone neurons do not change in number or size. We saw a similar long-
lasting increase in the number of detected hypocretin cells and a shrinkage of these neurons, accompanied by
elevated levels of brain hypocretin, in wild-type mice after longterm, but not short term, morphine
administration. The increase in hypocretin cell number is not due to neurogenesis, but rather to increased
production of hypocretin in neurons that do not produce detectable levels of these peptides under baseline
conditions. Our pilot data, using a newly developed transgenic mouse in which hypocretin neurons can be
selectively deleted (DTA-Hcrt mice), shows that removal of hypocretin neurons greatly reduces withdrawal
symptoms and the expression of the molecular markers Fos and DeltaFosB in addiction related regions.
These preliminary findings suggest that a blockade of hypocretin receptors, a decrease in of the activity of
hypocretin neurons, or a reduction of elevated hypocretin neuronal number back to baseline levels would aid
in withdrawal and prevent relapse in human opiate addicts. We propose to identify the opiate receptors
responsible for the changes in hypocretin cell number and size. We will record from hypocretin neurons in
freely moving animals using our chronic unit recording technique to determine, for the first time, how the
response of these cells to systemic morphine changes with addiction and withdrawal. We will determine how
the newly identifiable hypocretin producing cells induced by opiate administration differ from the baseline
population in distribution, projection, and co-transmitters. We will determine the changes in the receptor and
membrane physiology of hypocretin neurons produced by opiates using in vitro techniques. In our prior
work we found that human narcolepsy is caused by an average 90% loss of hypocretin cells. Of great interest,
is that human narcoleptics rarely abuse or escalate dosage of therapeutic drugs, even though the
amphetamines, methylphenidate and gamma hydroxy-butyrate that they take daily to reverse symptoms are
frequently abused in the non-narcoleptic population. The increased activity of hypocretin neurons that we
find in mice after morphine administration, the greatly increased number of hypocretin cells in human
addicts, and the greatly decreased number of hypocretin cells in narcoleptics, who are resistant to
drug addiction, suggests that hypocretin neurons have a major role in maintaining opiate addiction and
relapse. Manipulation of hypocretin neurons may be the key to facilitating withdrawal in addicts."

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The UCLA CTSI TL1 Program goal is the training of T3/T4 researchers to enable the translation of evidence to
practice and to the community. Trainees will learn the skills and methods needed to develop, implement, and
continuously improve healthcare and public system-based interventions that lead to improved population health
outcomes. Our current program has formally integrated community partners into predoctoral training
experiences; bolstered career development support; launched a new biomedical informatics graduate program;
and developed an implementation and dissemination science curriculum. Our program now includes: (1)
predoctoral training for trainees obtaining the PhD in Health Policy and Management; (2) postdoctoral training
for physicians and nurses preparing for T4 research careers; and (3) pre- and postdoctoral training in biomedical
informatics and data science. These investments have yielded substantial value: 54 pre- and postdoctoral
trainees have been supported thus far, and 98% of pre- and postdoctoral graduates currently conduct
translational research in healthcare systems, public health, or health policy organizations. Our program is helping
diversify the translational workforce: 28% of our trainees are underrepresented minorities and 61% are women.
We are strengthening the TL1 Program with biomedical informatics and data science training. We embark on
this next phase with regional partners, which include the Los Angeles County Health Agency, UCLA Health
System, and Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. Our program provides pathways for pre- and postdoctoral trainees,
preparing them to incorporate scientific discovery into clinical care in order to improve health. The TL1 Program
has four aims: 1) To implement a T3/T4 focused pre- and postdoctoral curriculum that provides training
in the competencies required for successful translational and team science research in health-related
learning systems, 2) To provide mentorship, career development, T1-T4 team science exemplars and
learning system-embedded structured research experiences for T3/T4 trainees, 3) To engage all Hub
partners to facilitate diverse trainee recruitment and contribution to the growth of the translational
research environment, 4) To implement training that facilitates communication among CTSI trainees
across the T1-T4 spectrum, enabling them to become effective translational science team members and
leaders."
10890007,"ABSTRACT
Cancer is a disease mostly caused by accumulation of somatic alterations on DNA. These alterations can disrupt
tumor suppressors, activate oncogenes, and create new genes with novel functions. Many alterations and genes
can serve as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis, and some can be targeted by drugs. High-throughput
sequencing technologies have enabled rapid discovery of genes which contribute to disease progression and
drug response. The past few years have seen an explosion in the rate of genome sequencing. The main focus of
cancer research has been on detecting point mutations, copy number changes and expression changes of protein-
coding genes. In addition to the protein-coding genes, there are tens of thousands of non-coding RNAs
(ncRNAs) in the human genome that are less well-understood. Some of them are known to play important roles
in normal cellular processes, and a small subset can promote tumor growth, metastasis and drug resistance.
More importantly, some ncRNAs are of clinical significance as they can be used as biomarkers and/or drug
targets. However, the vast majority of ncRNAs have unknown functions and their contributions to cancer
remain unclear. In this study, we will perform a genome-wide screen for novel cancer-driving ncRNAs
leveraging existing large-scale data from several national and international cancer-genome-sequencing
consortia. In tumor tissue, the normal functions of ncRNAs can be perturbed by different types of somatic
alterations, for instance point mutations, DNA copy changes, genomic rearrangements, epigenetic changes, etc.
Investigation of each of these diverse types of alterations requires specialized analytic approaches. To identify
novel cancer-driving ncRNAs, we will specifically focus on a less well-studied type of alterations—genomic
rearrangements. They include deletions, duplications, inversions, translocations and other more complex forms.
A main consequence of genomic rearrangements is that they can shuffle the DNA content in the genome. We
hypothesize that tumor-specific somatic genome rearrangements can reorganize ncRNAs and contribute to
tumorigenesis. For example, we will systematically screen for new regulatory functions operating upon
ncRNAs by relocation of regulatory elements in the genome due to somatic genome rearrangements. We will
also screen for new ncRNA species created by shuffling of DNA fragments, which carry novel functions and
contribute to tumorigenesis. Evolutionarily, exon shuffling has been an important mechanism to form new
genes. Multiple complementary strategies will be implemented to overcome various scientific and technical
challenges. Our study can lead to the discoveries of novel oncogenic ncRNAs, new biomarkers and potential
drug targets, and reveal novel cellular process regulations in both normal and diseased conditions."
10890008,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Caspase-1 is a cysteine protease that catalyzes the maturation of cytokines and plays critical roles in the innate
and adaptive immune response to pathogenic stimuli. Misregulation of caspase-1 is associated with various
autoimmune diseases and cancer. Similarly, caspase-2 is a cysteine protease that is important for regulating
the cellular response to stresses that cause DNA damage, such as chemotherapy. Both caspase-1 and caspase-
2 are activated by structurally similar sensor proteins that sense intracellular perturbations and mount
appropriate responses, but the molecular mechanism of how the sensors are activated and then in turn activate
their respective proteases, is not well understood. A series of germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors
sense conserved features of pathogens, and assemble into multiprotein complexes called inflammasomes,
which recruit and activate caspase-1. The consensus model for caspase-1 activation is that inflammasomes are
first activated then they in turn activate caspase-1. Our preliminary data suggests that caspase-1 plays a role in
inflammasome activation, which in turn activates more caspase-1, however, the molecular mechanism is
unknown. The goal during the K99 mentored phase, is to determine the role caspase-1 plays in inflammasome
activation. Specifically, we will determine the activation mechanism of the ZU5 domain-containing
inflammasomes, CARD8 and NLRP1. During the independent R00 phase, we will then apply the training from
the mentored phase to determine the activation mechanism of another ZU5 domain-containing sensor that
activates caspase-2 in response to genotoxic stress, PIDD. Our central hypothesis is that the ZU5 domain-
containing sensor proteins are activated in a similar manner, in which the proteases they activate participate in
sensor activation, which in turn activates more protease. To accomplish these goals, I have carefully assembled
a highly complementary advisory team with the scientific and mentoring skills needed to guide my path to
research independence. The completion of this work will further our understanding of pyroptosis and apoptosis
regulation and could potentially advance therapeutic development efforts for a variety of human diseases."
10890010,"Mechanisms of Ovarian Endocrine Disruption at Single-Cell Resolution
Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are exogenous chemicals that interfere with endogenous hormone
synthesis, metabolism and signaling. EDC exposure during early gonadal development is suspected to play a
role in ovarian dysgenesis later in life. Advancing understanding of endocrine disruption at the molecular and
cellular level is essential for determining possible developmental origins of adult-onset reproductive disease.
This demands sensitive in vivo models with short lifespans and innovative analytical tools to detect genetic
perturbations induced by chemical exposures. The Japanese medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) is among the most
studied experimental models used in EDC screening for developmental and reproductive effects. Not only is
the medaka genome extensively annotated compared to other fish models, but it shares chromosomal sex
determination, hormone receptor sequence homology, and sex hormone signaling axes with humans.
Exposure to estrogen-contaminated water during ovarian development causes significantly delayed oocyte
maturation and reduced egg production in adult medaka. However, specific mechanisms by which
heterogenous cell populations of the developing ovary respond to estrogenic chemicals remain unclear.
This proposal seeks to investigate how early developmental exposures to xenoestrogens alter gene regulation
networks in differentiating ovarian cells, and which long-term transcriptional changes are associated with
decreased female fertility. My working hypothesis is that early life stage exposures to estrogenic DDTs
induce long-term transcriptional effects in ovarian somatic gonad cells, reducing fertility later in life. I
will investigate this hypothesis by exposing medaka to environmentally relevant levels of o,p’-
dichlorodiethyltrichloroethane (o,p’-DDT), an estrogenic isomer of the legacy organochlorine pesticide that
remains a persistent public health concern. Exposures will occur during a key window of ovarian development
to define organizational effects at the functional, cellular, and transcriptional levels.
Aim 1 will define the long-term reproductive consequences of o,p’-DDT exposures during an early window of
ovarian differentiation using functional breeding assessments and targeted quantification of estrogen- and
steroidogenesis-related genes. Aim 2 will use single cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) to gain a
comprehensive view of which ovarian somatic cell types and gene regulatory networks (both steroid hormone-
dependent and hormone-independent), are permanently altered by early stage o,p’-DDT exposure.
The proposed work will elucidate lasting functional and molecular changes induced by xenoestrogens during
ovarian differentiation and follicular assembly in medaka, which aligns with fetal ovarian development in
humans. Comprehensive identification of DDT-inducible genes may reveal novel exposure biomarkers and
plausible mechanisms of endocrine and reproductive diseases."
10890023,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Dengue viruses cause more human morbidity than any other arbovirus, underscoring the public health
urgency of making safe and effective dengue vaccines available in endemic settings, in alignment with NIAID
priorities. This critical need will be addressed by testing the safety and protective efficacy of NIAID's lead
tetravalent, live attenuated dengue vaccine candidate, TV005, in adults in dengue-endemic Bangladesh
through a vaccine-challenge trial based on the Dengue Controlled Human Infection Model (D-CHIM). Our
central hypothesis is that vaccination with TV005 will protect against infection with a live, recombinant dengue
2 challenge virus (DENV-2), with DENV-2 viremia following challenge as the primary efficacy endpoint. In
addition to extensive Phase I and II trials leading to the development of TV005, our team has used a similar
vaccine-challenge design to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TV005 in dengue-naïve U.S. adults, which was
well-tolerated and >99% efficacious in preventing viremia. The next critical step for NIAID's promising vaccine
is to test its safety and efficacy in a dengue-endemic setting. In this study, 224 healthy adult volunteers, both
dengue-exposed and -naïve, will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 (vaccine: placebo) to receive TV005 followed
by inpatient challenge with DENV-2 at 6 or 24 months post-vaccination. To test our central hypothesis, we will
pursue the following Specific Aims: Aim 1A) Determine, in a dengue endemic population, the protective
efficacy of TV005 vaccine against dengue infection induced by a live, recombinant DENV-2 challenge virus
(rDEN2∆30-7169) administered 6 or 24 months after vaccination; Aim 1B) Evaluate the safety of TV005 and
the DEN-2 challenge virus in a dengue endemic population; and Aim 2) Use predictive modeling to identify
baseline and post-vaccination immune phenotype(s) that predict TV005 efficacy and safety to better
understand response to vaccination and protective immunity, and to inform future study design for dengue
vaccine development in endemic settings. In contrast to large-scale field trails, the D-CHIM will provide early
vaccine efficacy and safety signals while enrolling a minimal number of volunteers, and contribute to our
understanding of the immune response to both vaccination and challenge in an endemic setting through
statistical modeling of vaccine impact."
10890025,"Viruses have evolved elegant strategies to manipulate host cell machinery and rewire core cellular pathways to
facilitate productive infection, including enhancing metabolic output and maintaining cell viability. To accomplish
this, viruses exert an extensive network of dynamic molecular interactions with cellular organelles. As the
functions of organelles are intimately associated with the regulation of their composition, shape, and localization,
the control of organelle structure-function relationships is at the core of clarifying the outcome of an infection.
While many examples of virus-induced organelle remodeling have been described, very little is understood about
how organelle structures engender specific functions. Our lab has characterized a previously unrecognized
aspect of viral infection, which is that human viruses globally control organelle remodeling by dramatically
rewiring inter- and intra-organelle membrane contact sites (MCS). Using a hybrid quantitative proteomics and
super resolution microscopy approach, we demonstrated exquisite reorganization in MCS networks engaged by
a broad range of human viruses, including both ancient (herpesviruses) and rapidly adapting (influenza and beta-
coronavirus) viruses. We further discovered that infection with the ubiquitous herpesvirus human
cytomegalovirus (HCMV) triggers a new specialized MCS structure, mitochondria-ER encapsulations that we
termed MENC. We determined that HCMV infection drives predominantly fission at the mitochondrial periphery,
and that the fragmented mitochondria enter MENCs and retain their bioenergetic activity. How the infection
induces MENC formation and the function of this newly reported structure remain unknown. We propose that
MENCs provide a unifying explanation for the longstanding paradox of how certain viruses such as HCMV
increase mitochondrial bioenergetic output, despite inducing mitochondrial fragmentation. Our central hypothesis
is that HCMV remodels inter- and intra-organelle connections, generating MENCs, which act to protect and
stabilize the bioenergetic capacity of fragmented mitochondria. Using a multidisciplinary approach that combines
molecular virology with cutting-edge approaches in quantitative proteomics, live super resolution microscopy,
ultrastructural electron microscopy, metabolomics, and lipidomics, in Aim 1, we will define the mechanisms
underlying the formation and function of MENCs during HCMV infection. In Aim 2, we will establish what
signaling cues from HCMV-induced three-way contacts among the ER, mitochondria, and lysosome stimulate
peripheral mitochondria fission and elevate bioenergetic respiration. In Aim 3, we will characterize the viral
factors that coordinate ER-mitochondria MCS rewiring. Collectively, our study will link newly discovered aspects
of virus-orchestrated MCS networking to new two-way and three-way organelle structure-function relationships
that underlie fundamental cellular mechanisms, including mitochondrial bioenergetics and autophagic turnover.
In doing so, our study will open research areas in how viruses exploit the functional capacities of remodeled
organelles for infection, which have broad implications for viral pathogenesis and metabolic disorders."
10890026,"Project Summary/Abstract
The ways in which vocal fold (VF) vibratory behavior and resulting voice quality (VQ) perception differ across
vowel categories and the co-articulatory variations of connected speech are unknown and largely unexplored.
Furthermore, phonatory adjustments during connected speech (possible variations in voicing onsets and
offsets and articulatory transitions) may provide important clinical information that can guide diagnostic
protocols, may correspond closely with perceived handicap, and may represent functionally-relevant
treatment targets. The overall goal of the proposed research is to discover and quantify physiological
mechanisms underlying normal and abnormal VF behavior and establish their relationships to VQ perception
in connected speech. This innovative proposal leverages the expertise of a multidisciplinary team and
develops a comprehensive framework linking vocal physiology and perception with improved measurement
approaches, methods, and analyses that account for the effects of co-articulation in connected speech.
Abnormalities in pre-, post-, and peri-phonatory vibratory behavior are physiological hallmarks of voice
disorders. Aim 1 will leverage precise, automated physiological measures of phonatory onset (pre-), offset
(post-), and variation in VF phase asymmetry (peri-) to characterize VF vibratory behavior in uniform vowel-
consonant-vowel (VCV) utterances with a controlled phonetic context. Aim 2 will establish relationship
between these physiological measures and dimension-specific VQ perception in VCV utterances, using ratio-
level matching tasks with physical units (e.g., dB) and biologically inspired computational models grounded
in psychoacoustics and auditory-perception. These evaluative methods overcome technical and
methodological limitations of conventional perceptual and acoustic methods. Aim 3 will evaluate and validate
the three physiological measures in connected speech and discover new physiological signatures currently
unknown through the use of novel and powerful machine-learning models that include as inputs physiological
measures derived from high-speed videoendoscopy. Aim 4 will use automated, efficient dimension-specific
computational models to evaluate VQ in connected speech and to discover physiological signatures that are
related to VQ perception through machine learning. The unique combination of machine learning with
computational models of VQ perception that are specific to VQ dimensions, rather than just overall severity,
can effectively deal with the massive data associated with connected speech and high-speed videoendoscopy.
Knowledge gained from this pre-translational research has the potential to improve our understanding of voice
pathology and to substantially advance functional assessment and treatment outcomes for millions of people
with hypo- and hyper-adductory voice disorders."

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) represents a chronic progressive process which leads to significant
morbidity and mortality. RA is driven by both inflammatory and stromal pathologies, and while
current therapies improve inflammation, there are not effective treatments targeting fibroblasts
and bone pathology in RA. The CD47 pathway can affect both immune cell phagocytosis
through SIRP-a signaling and stromal pathology through TSP-1 signaling. This study will define
the role of CD47 signaling in patient biospecimens and mouse models of arthritis, and assess the
utility of combinations of anti-CD47 therapy and biologics in RA. Our central hypothesis is that
CD47 is critical to RA pathogenesis and that its blockade will ameliorate or reverse
inflammatory arthritis and bone erosion. We will test this hypothesis through three specific
aims. Aim 1 will characterize the role of the CD47 signaling through TSP-1 and SIRP-a in
patients with RA through histologic analysis, single cell RNA sequencing, and synovial organoid
cultures. Aim 2 will assess whether CD47 is required for inflammatory arthritis by assessing
arthritis, bone outcomes, and cellular function in mice deficient in CD47 after inducing arthritis.
Aim 3 will determine the effectiveness of CD47 inhibition in combination with biologic therapies
in treating arthritis first using an in vitro drug screen and then testing the most promising
candidate therapy in vivo. The proposed research is significant both because it will substantially
improve understanding of RA biology, and because it has the potential to identify novel
therapeutic strategies which can treat both inflammatory and stromal pathways in RA."

This proposal aims to elucidate the mechanisms by which normal and pathological erythropoiesis exerts
systemic effects on iron metabolism and other metabolic processes. Activation of erythropoiesis by erythropoietin
(EPO) causes rapid suppression of hepcidin, with consequent increase in iron absorption and the release of iron
from stores. We discovered erythroferrone (ERFE), a hormone produced by erythroblasts, as the principal
mediator that acutely matches the iron supply to the changing requirements of erythropoiesis. ERFE is proposed
to bind to and inactivate bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) that regulate hepcidin transcription. In anemias
with ineffective erythropoiesis, increased ERFE concentrations may not only contribute to iron overload and
worsen ineffective erythropoiesis but also promote other systemic manifestations. In this proposal, we will
expand the study of the mechanism of action of ERFE, define the set of BMP ligands targeted by ERFE, and
conduct a detailed structure-function study. Also, we constructed transgenic mouse lines that overexpress
graded levels of ERFE in erythroblasts and develop proportional iron overload and other systemic manifestations
of anemias with ineffective erythropoiesis. We will use these mice to analyze the hematological and non-
hematological consequences of excessive ERFE. The specific aims of the proposed project are:
1. Characterize the structural determinants of ERFE bioactivity and the interaction of ERFE with BMPs.
 We will define all the members of the BMP family targeted by murine and human ERFE using assays for
 both bioactivity and direct physical interaction. We will define the bioactive segment of ERFE and perform
 complete structure-function analysis of the specific amino acids required for ERFE bioactivity.
2. Analyze the hematological effects of increased ERFE concentrations in vivo. In mouse models of
 graded ERFE overexpression, we will analyze the effect of ERFE on iron loading and erythropoiesis, and
 identify which effects are independent of hepcidin. To study the effects of high ERFE in β-thalassemia, we
 will introduce the ERFE transgene into the th3/+ model of β-thalassemia and examine erythropoiesis and
 iron overload. Finally, we will test the ability of a therapeutic anti-ERFE Mab to reverse the effects of ERFE.
3. Elucidate the nonhematological effects of increased ERFE concentrations in vivo. Using transgenic
 ERFE mice, we will define the effects of ERFE on the brain, somatic growth, bone and adipose tissues, and
 renal development, all of which were affected in our preliminary characterization.
Successful completion of the proposed studies will answer longstanding questions about a fundamental aspect
of human and vertebrate biology, the mechanism by which the supply of iron is matched to the varying iron
requirements of erythropoiesis. The work will provide important insights into the pathogenesis of iron overload
in β-thalassemia and other anemias with ineffective erythropoiesis, globally very common diseases, and enhance
the understanding of the mechanisms that cause the debilitating systemic effects of these diseases."

 Diabetes and nicotine use are significant public health problems that produce compounded health
consequences, particularly in women. The proposed team of neuroscientists employ rodent models to provide a
better understanding of the underlying factors that promote nicotine use in persons with metabolic disorders,
such as diabetes. Our prior pre-clinical work has established that the rewarding effects of nicotine are greater in
rodents that display a disruption in insulin signaling, the primary mediator of diabetes. This work has raised
important additional questions regarding whether the development of insulin resistance (IR) or other indices of
metabolic syndrome coincide with or predict greater nicotine dependence in females versus males. Also, the
effects of nicotine exposure on the emergence of various biomarkers of metabolic syndrome are unclear.
Importantly, there is also a lack of information on the efficacy of medications that reduce IR or serve as nicotine
cessation agents on the development of nicotine dependence in rodent models of Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. To
address these issues, Aim 1 will assess sex- and time-dependent changes in IR, plasma biomarkers of metabolic
syndrome, and behavioral indices of nicotine dependence that include escalation of nicotine self-administration
and withdrawal severity. Aim 1 will use a procedure that will examine the natural emergence of IR following
chronic access to a high fat diet (HFD). We will also include HFD-fed rats that receive a pharmacological
intervention that accelerates the induction of IR. Aim 2 will assess the efficacy of various pharmacotherapies for
diabetes (insulin, exenatide, glucophage, and bromocriptine) or smoking cessation (bupropion and varenicline)
on the same measures collected in Aim 1 using rodent models of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. The scientific
premise is that the development of IR will coincide with the escalation of nicotine intake and greater withdrawal
severity in both types of diabetic rats. We anticipate that diabetic females will display the greatest escalation of
nicotine intake and more intense withdrawal symptoms than males. Also, pharmacological interventions that
treat IR will suppress the development of nicotine dependence in diabetic rats. These studies are rigorous
because they incorporate rodent models of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes and will assess time-dependent changes
in nicotine dependence and various biomarkers of metabolic syndrome. The proposed work is significant
because the results will advance our understanding of the relationship between various biomarkers of metabolic
syndrome and the development of nicotine dependence. Our work will also inform how nicotine exposure alters
various biomarkers of metabolic syndrome that lead to diabetes. Lastly, our results will inform the effectiveness
of clinically approved pharmacotherapies in reducing the risk of nicotine use in persons with diabetes. This is in
line with the mission of NIH to improve the lives of persons suffering from debilitating diseases, particularly in
patients inflicted by compounded health consequences produced by diabetes and nicotine use."

 There is a higher incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC) in individuals self-identifying as Black
race compared to all other races and ethnicities in the US. Previous studies comparing self-identified Black vs
self-identified White CRC frozen samples have detected significant differences in gene expression and indicate
that self-identified race is significantly associated with differences in CRC biology. However, the list of DEGs
generated independently from each individual study shows limited overlap. This is likely because of the small
sample sizes for each dataset, with the largest set being the TCGA data set with ~60 self-identified Black
samples. Complex environmental and germline genomic factors contribute to the DEGs and other biological
results. However, a major barrier to disentangling these factors is accessing large numbers of CRC tissues
annotated for potentially confounding co-variables linked to self-identified racial categories. To conduct such a
study we propose to demonstrate the feasibility of assembling a multi-disciplinary research team to analyze a
large (>1000) self-identified Black/ African Ancestry (AA) vs. White/European Ancestry (EA) formalin fixed
paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue samples archived at Stony Brook University Hospital (SBUH), Kings County
Hospital Center (KCHC/NYCH+H) and Henry Ford Hospital (HFH). CXCL10 will be the initial DEG target since
this is one of the few DEGs identified by more than one RNA-sequence dataset. CXCL10 is an interferon gamma
inducible protein that is a T-cell attractant and has been positively associated with T-cell infiltration in CRC and
with post-operative progress free survival. The reduced expression of CXCL10 in self-identified Black CRC vs.
White CRC could therefore potentially link self-identified racial differences in CRC immunologic transcriptional
profiles and CRC outcomes. Data from the Broad single cell (sc) RNA sequence (seq) data portal revealed that
myeloid cells and particularly macrophage cell subtypes are a major source of CXCL10 expression in CRC
tumors. However, no information on racial categories was made available for this scRNA dataset. A recent
analysis of the TCGA data revealed that macrophage signature transcripts are also reduced in self-identified
Black vs. White CRC (10) but it remains to be demonstrated whether macrophage signature transcripts are
colocalized with the CXCL10 transcripts in the same cell. In Aim 1, spatial profiling of CXCL10 expression in
CRC FFPE sections using RNAScopeTM in situ hybridization will be piloted to evaluate the hypothesis that
CXCL10 expressing macrophages are reduced in self-identified Black vs. White CRC. In Aim 2, annotation of
CRC FFPE tissues with respect to potentially confounding co-variables, (including estimates of ancestry
admixture and mismatch repair- immunohistochemistry results) will be harmonized, with the overarching goal of
conducting multivariable analyses of racial effects on CRC cancer biology."

 Ion channels are the fundamental building blocks determining cellular activity and in particular neuronal
excitability. The most elementary processes in the nervous system, such as action potential firing and synaptic
transmission, depend on their function. Coordinated activation of distinct types of ion channels enables
information transfer through complex circuits and neural networks. Addressing the need for intensive research
training in this field, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory will offer the annual three-week course on Ion Channels in
Synaptic & Neural Circuit Physiology, as part of its postgraduate summer training program in neurobiology
(2024-2028).
 The primary goal of this course is to demonstrate, through lectures and laboratory work, the different
properties of ion channels that enable neurons to perform unique physiological functions in a variety of neural
systems. The course focuses on: voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels at central and peripheral synapses;
synaptic integration and plasticity; neural circuit function in vitro and in vivo; and optogenetic strategies for circuit
manipulation. The laboratory component of the course introduces students to electrophysiological approaches
for the study of ion channels in their native environments. The course provides trainees with hands-on experience
in using patch-clamp electrophysiology to examine single channel activity in cultured cells, ion channel
biophysics in acutely dissociated neurons, action potential firing and synaptic integration, plasticity and circuit
dynamics in acute brain slices and in vivo. Different types of recordings will be used (e.g. cell-attached, whole-
cell dendritic and somatic patch, voltage- and current-clamp modes) and the advantages and limitations of each
method will be discussed in relation to specific scientific questions. The course will also provide practical
experience in cellular and circuit manipulation techniques (i.e. pharmacological, electrophysiological and
optogenetic) both in vitro and in vivo.
 The lead instructors are chosen on the basis of their training, contributions to and knowledge of the field.
In turn, they invite lecturers who have made significant contributions in their fields to give up-to-the-minute reports
on the underlying technology and their current research. The trainees are chosen by the course faculty from
larger pools of applicants and range from graduate students to senior investigators. This intensive research
training program enrolls a diverse cadre of researchers who can immediately transfer techniques and concepts
learned during the course to their own research projects and interests. The faculty are encouraged to present
relevant methodological approaches in the broader context of brain function and mental health research. Their
presence is not limited to the classroom: each speaker spends a significant amount of time in the laboratory to
provide a unique learning opportunity for the attendees of the course. Methods and concepts taught in the course
are disseminated to the wider research community through the publication of laboratory manuals and online
resources."

This proposal for a mentored career development award consists of a training and research plan to facilitate Dr.
Zackary Falls' transition to an independent investigator focusing on translational bioinformatics for patient tailored
predictive analytics related to opioid addiction severity. The opioid epidemic is a major concern in the United
States that is exacerbated due to the high prevalence of prescribing two or more drugs to patients living with
opioid use disorder, which increases the likelihood of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) occurring in these patients.
Knowing and predicting drug–drug interactions (DDIs) and resulting ADRs is critical for the safety of patients, but
ADR prediction software tools used in clinical practice have many limitations. Firstly, most DDI databases used
in these software tools are incomplete because they incorporate only pair–wise DDIs. Additionally, most software
tools do not incorporate biological mechanism of action information for the drugs and omit relevant patient–
speciﬁc clinical data such as diagnoses, tobacco use, etc. Dr. Falls aims to exceed the efﬁcacy of these software
with the creation of embedded representations for each patient's prescription proﬁle, leveraging both drug–protein
interaction knowledge about the prescription drugs and patient level clinical data pertaining to polypharmacy and
ADRs. The speciﬁc aims of this research are to predict and validate novel off–target proteins for opioids and
other commonly co–prescribed medications (Aim 1), extract polypharmacy interactions and ADR relationships
from electronic health records of opioid prescription patients (Aim 2), and design a patient personalized software
that uses deep–learning architecture to predict severe ADRs caused by opioid related polypharmacy interactions
(Aim 3) to be integrated with clinical decision support systems for the beneﬁt of patients and clinicians. The ap-
plicant has detailed a rigorous plan containing three career development goals for gaining the skills and expertise
to accomplish his research aims. These goals include: Goal 1. Gain knowledge in addiction research and phar-
macology as it relates to opioid use, Goal 2. Acquire advanced statistical analysis skills for clinical datasets, and
Goal 3. Increase understanding of graph theory and knowledge graph implementation. The team of mentors and
collaborators that has been assembled by Dr. Falls, including Prof. Ram Samudrala as primary mentor, perfectly
accounts for expertise in research areas that the applicant will be investigating and have knowledge in domains
that complement his own understandings to aid in the career development aspect of this proposal. Dr. Falls has
the aptitude, creativity, and perseverance to become an excellent researcher. The support of this K01, guidance
from his terriﬁc team of mentors and collaborators, and the inﬂuence of a rich research environment will enable
him to further develop his skills and knowledge. He will surely accomplish all of his career development goals
and research aims, become a successful independent investigator, and ﬂourish in his career."
10892076,"Project Summary/Abstract
Heart failure (HF) significantly impairs quality of life and contributes to over 1 million hospital admissions per
year. Cardiac decompensation remains the most frequent cause of hospitalization. The Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services has thus identified decreasing heart failure hospitalizations as a key priority. Identifying
precipitants of HF exacerbation could provide actionable targets for reducing HF admissions and improving
QOL. Psychological stress can precipitate myocardial ischemia, cardiac arrhythmia, and left ventricular
dysfunction - even in patients with HF, and we have identified a high-risk profile. Furthermore, targeting this
profile in clinical trials has reduced event risk. Studies also show that chronic psychological stress may
increase overall risk for HF hospitalization. The absence of a non-invasive metric that captures cardiac
decompensation in HF patients has however, impeded the identification of psychological experiences
as acute precipitants that contribute to HF decompensation and hospitalization. The imperative to
reduce HF hospitalizations has spurred technological innovations to capture early stages of decompensation
and more rapid outpatient interventions. The wireless hemodynamic monitor (e.g., CardioMEMS,) is one such
innovation. These monitors are implanted in the pulmonary artery and directly measure pulmonary artery
pressure (PAP), providing a metric of decompensation and hospitalization risk. Our preliminary data suggest
that PAP is higher in situations of high sympathetic activity, and that anxiety and stress are also associated
with higher PAP. The increasing use of these monitors thus provides a unique opportunity to identify
and risk stratify HF patients for whom stress may contribute to HF exacerbation. We propose to leverage
this new technology in a mechanistic clinical trial to: (Aim 1a) determine the effect of acute laboratory stress on
momentary PAP, and (Aim 1b) determine the relationship of daily stress and negative emotion to daily PAP as
captured by ecological momentary assessment (EMA). For Aim 2 we will determine the relationship of stress-
induced PAP increase to HF exacerbation; and for Aim 3 we will explore markers of heterogeneity in the PAP
response to stress, including markers of disease severity, sleep quality, and psychosocial factors to identify a
risk profile. CardioMEMS-implanted HF patients will be randomized within the laboratory stress protocol that
we have developed, during which PAP will be measured continuously. Patients will then complete our
smartphone 'app' based, daily EMA for stress exposures and negative experiences over a six-month period
during clinically prescribed daily measurement of PAP. Patients will also complete assessment of
psychosocial factors and related biomarkers of stress susceptibility. Clinical trials targeting stress induced
cardiac syndromes have shown promise for reducing morbidity and mortality. This study will demonstrate how
the new CardioMEMS technology can help identify precipitants as actionable targets for specific patients,
thereby contributing to reduced hospitalization, and better patient centered outcomes."

Diabetes affects more than 30 million people in the United States, with 90-95% having type 2 diabetes. Diabetic
retinopathy, one of the most serious complications of diabetes, is the leading cause of blindness. While diet,
exercise and medications have been cornerstones of diabetes treatment to control glucose levels, the influence
of sleep and circadian regulation on metabolic control are increasingly recognized as potential targets of future
preventive treatment strategies. Recent work discovered that there is a dysfunction of the melanopsin-expressing
intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) in patients with diabetic retinopathy. These ipRGCs
are a crucial part of entraining (synchronizing) the circadian system, which influences melatonin secretion and
regulates sleep/wake timing and metabolic physiology. Recent data indicate that individuals with diabetic
retinopathy show abnormalities in ipRGC function and abnormal melatonin physiology. The novel hypothesis
we propose to test is that ipRGC dysfunction associated with type 2 diabetes and diabetic retinopathy leads to
disturbances in sleep and circadian regulation, which further adversely affects their metabolic control and could
accelerate disease progression. Further, we hypothesize that melatonin supplementation will disrupt this vicious
cycle. The proposed study will comprehensively examine ipRGC function via pupillometry in patients with type 2
diabetes with and without diabetic retinopathy. These groups will provide a range of ipRGC function. Sleep
duration and quality (via wrist actigraphy), at-home electroencephalography (EEG), polysomnography, nocturnal
melatonin secretion (measured from urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin), circadian regulation (24-hour blood sampling
for melatonin and cortisol) and standard metabolic outcomes (hemoglobinA1c, fasting glucose, 24-hour mean
glucose levels from continuous glucose monitoring) will be the outcomes and examined as a function of ipRGC
function. Then, patients with diabetic retinopathy will be randomized to receive nightly melatonin
supplementation or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary outcomes will be assessed at the end of the study which
include sleep as measured by actigraphy and circadian regulation as assessed by 24-hour hormone sampling.
Glucose parameters will also be assessed (hemoglobinA1c, fasting glucose, 24-hour mean glucose levels from
continuous glucose monitoring). The proposed study will advance our understanding of the relationship between
ipRGC function and the nonvisual health of people with diabetes, and provide evidence of potential benefits of
melatonin in patients with diabetic retinopathy. These data will be highly relevant given the current epidemic of
diabetes and diabetic retinopathy, and will inform potential therapeutic interventions, leading to improve disease
outcomes in these patients."
10892149,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Inhibitors of the nuclear enzyme PARP1 (PARPi) are in clinical use and advanced trials as therapeutics for
cancers with DNA damage repair defects. PARP1 is a highly abundant protein that shapes chromatin structure,
but upon detecting damaged DNA becomes enzymatically active and builds chains of poly(ADP)-ribose (PAR)
on itself. PARylation of other nuclear proteins such as histones is mediated by the recently discovered Histone
PARylation Factor 1 (HPF1). PARylation relaxes compact chromatin and serves as a signal to recruit the DNA
repair machinery, but access of the DNA damage repair machinery also relies on the action of ATP-dependent
chromatin remodeling factors and histone chaperones. The efficacy of PARP inhibitors in cancer patients is
attributed to synthetic lethality: Simultaneously shutting down PARP-mediated DNA repair in patients with
deficiencies in DNA repair pathways (i.e. BRCA1/2 negative) or with induced DNA damage (i.e. chemo- or
radiotherapy), leads to overwhelming DNA damage and cancer cell death. Despite the success of existing
inhibitors of PARP1, high effective dosages, poor correlation of drug efficacy with inhibition of PARP1 activity in
cancer cells, and resistance to PARPi suggest room for improvement.
Our goal is to use rigorous quantitative, structural, and mechanistic approaches to investigate how PARP1
interacts differently with damaged vs. intact DNA in the context of chromatin, and in the presence or absence of
its accessory protein HPF1. We aim to discover whether next-generation PARPi should be optimized for binding
more tightly to the PARP1-HPF1 complex, or instead prevent this complex from forming, and whether these
properties should differ for different clinical applications (i.e. cancer vs. cardiovascular or neurological diseases).
We also seek to investigate whether selective inhibition of the DNA-bound active conformation of PARP1 is a
potential approach to lowering the amount of drug one would need to administer, by illuminating the
conformational diversity of PARP1 bound to intact vs. damaged chromatin through structural biology. Finally, we
will determine the effect of PARylation on the ability of chromatin remodelers to provide better access to the DNA
repair machinery. Our mechanistic studies will yield key insights into how to design better screens or assays for
the development of more selective and mechanism-based PARP inhibitors. Altogether our proposed research
will inform the development of the next generation of PARP inhibitors for use in cancer therapy."
10892151,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) have emerged as key suppressor cells that inhibit effector
immunity both in tumors and in the TB granuloma. In addition, MDSCs have been implicated in HIV progression.
We recently demonstrated that high glutamine (Gln) levels in the tumor microenvironment (TME) foster
immunotolerance and tumor progression. Furthermore, we showed that inhibitors of glutamine metabolism
demonstrate potent anticancer activity in part by reprogramming MDSCs to pro-inflammatory M1-type
macrophages. Based on seminal work from Marcus Horwitz at UCLA from 1994-2005 which demonstrated the
essentiality of a secreted Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) glutamine synthase and therapeutic benefit with Gln
synthase inhibitors in animal models, we investigated whether high Gln levels in the TB granuloma may similarly
suppress host immune function.
 In a three-way collaboration between a tumor immunobiologist (Powell), a chemist with expertise in Gln
metabolism (Slusher), and a TB expert (Bishai), we have evaluated novel Gln metabolism inhibitors that are
active anticancer drugs for their effectiveness against TB. In contrast to the earlier work of Horwitz et al., we
focused on Gln metabolism inhibitors with improved safety profiles and bioavailability, some of which are
currently entering human clinical trials as anticancer agents.
 We observed potent anti-TB activity with Gln metabolism inhibitors in mice with both reductions in Mtb organ
burden and prolongation of survival. This was accompanied by significant reductions in lung MDSCs, a
corresponding increase in pro-inflammatory M1-type macrophages, and an increase in activated CD8 T cells in
murine TB. Our central scientific premises are that (i) a novel Mtb virulence mechanism is release of excess
Gln within granulomas leading to MDSC expansion and an immunotolerant microenvironment that enables
pathogen survival and (ii) that Gln metabolism inhibitors may represent a valuable host-directed therapy (HDT)
approach for the treatment of TB via MDSC inhibition and enhancement of effector T cell immunity.
 This application will further define the immunosuppressive roles Gln in the TB granuloma and also investigate
a panel of new Gln metabolism inhibitors as TB therapeutics. In Aim 1 we will assess novel Gln metabolism
inhibitors for their anti-TB therapeutic efficacy using validated animal models. In Aim 2 we will assess the impact
of Gln metabolism inhibitors on myeloid cell populations--including MDSCs--during murine Mtb infection. And
in Aim 3 we will evaluate the impact of Gln metabolism inhibitors on lymphoid cell activity during murine Mtb
infection. These studies may pave the way for Gln metabolism inhibitors that are currently being developed as
anticancer drugs to be repurposed as host-directed therapies for TB and TB-HIV."

 Acoustic communication is crucial for social interactions in many species, including humans.
Understanding the neural underpinnings that govern the production and processing of communication sounds is
paramount to advance the fields of auditory neuroscience and social behavior. Studies investigating speech and
sound processing in humans have mostly implemented non-invasive methods, leaving a gap in knowledge about
underlying neural mechanisms. My project bridges this gap by exploiting scientific advantages of echolocating
bats, mammals that produce and process a rich repertoire of acoustic signals, to investigate the circuits that
contribute to the discrimination of complex sounds that carry different meanings. Bats are social mammals with
well-developed audio-vocal systems and produce ultrasonic vocalizations for navigation and social
communication, providing a distinct opportunity to study the pathways, molecules and brain regions, which
enable complex sound processing. Aim 1 combines behavior and neurophysiology to investigate the specific
acoustic features of communication calls that are key to evoke behavioral responses and the neural systems
involved in sound discrimination. Aim 2 combines psychophysical, neurophysiological, and pharmacological
inactivation methods to study the midbrain-amygdala circuit's role in mediating discrimination of sounds that
show overlap in spectro-temporal features but carry different semantic content. Aim 3 investigates circuit
phenomena in a social context by combining neurophysiological recordings and targeted pharmacological
inactivation in freely interacting bats. The overarching hypothesis of this research program is that social-
emotional processing of auditory stimuli through a midbrain-amygdala circuit mediates the discrimination of
sounds that carry different meaning. The significance of this project resides in the extraordinary scientific
opportunities to bridge studies of auditory behaviors, single neuron recordings, circuit dissection and
computational modeling in a mammalian model. This work will contribute key new knowledge of natural sound
processing mechanisms in mammals that could inform a deeper understanding of human auditory
communication disorders. Johns Hopkins University offers an outstanding environment to conduct this project,
as it provides access to world class research facilities, seminars and workshops offered by the Center for Hearing
and Balance, the Center for Language and Speech Processing; along with an extraordinary network of mentors
and collaborators who will provide training and guidance to ensure the success of this project."
10887605,"Project Summary/Abstract
The goal of this project is to investigate the neural mechanisms whereby perceptual information guides the
choice of where to look next; speciﬁcally, we propose to record neuronal activity during urgent decision making
to examine with ﬁne temporal resolution how perception informs motor planning. Neuroscientists normally
study choice behavior with tasks in which a perceptual judgment is made and is followed by a motor report, but
this approach has limitations. First, it allows various covert factors such as attention, anticipation, or task difﬁ-
culty to be traded against each other, creating ambiguities that cannot be resolved via standard psychophysical
metrics, i.e., reaction time and choice accuracy. And second, serialization suppresses the rapid, reciprocal inter-
action between perceptual analysis and motor planning from which informed saccadic choices normally arise.
Our approach is based on a recently developed task in which decisions are urgent and both of these problems
are minimized. Our framework also includes a heuristic, physiologically grounded model that reproduces the
subjects' rich behavior with great detail. Thus, we propose to study how perception informs motor planning
using time pressure to engage these processes within their natural time scale and dynamics, and relate them
quantitatively to psychophysical performance. Oculomotor activity will be recorded from monkeys trained to
perform several variants of our urgent choice paradigm. In Aim 1 we will investigate the relationship between
exogenous (or bottom-up) attention and motor planning by varying the relative salience of target and distracter
during an urgent choice. We hypothesize that the reﬂexive, salience-driven form of attention acts through two
speciﬁc mechanisms: acceleration of ongoing motor plans that are spatially congruent with it, and halting of
those plans that are spatially incongruent. In Aim 2 we will investigate the relationship between attention,
motor planning, and accumulation of sensory evidence by training monkeys to perform an urgent version of
the well known random-dot motion discrimination task. In this case, because the locations of the two choice
targets are dissociated from that of the stimulus to be discriminated, we expect to observe a tradeoff between
stimulus-driven activity (signaling the deployment of attention to the stimulus) and target-driven activity (sig-
naling the impending eye movement). Our previous and current preliminary results indicate that we will be
able to resolve exquisitely orchestrated interactions between perceptual signals and ongoing motor activity that
unfold very rapidly, within a few tens of ms, and are otherwise experimentally inaccessible. We will exploit
this capability to draw essential functional distinctions between the frontal eye ﬁeld (FEF) and the lateral intra-
parietal area (LIP), and to determine the distinct contributions of classical cell types (visual, visuomotor, and
motor) to perceptually guided choices within each of these key oculomotor structures. This work will provide
critical insight about how perceptual information is dynamically incorporated into ongoing motor activity, and
how this interaction determines saccadic-choice performance."
10885287,"Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and future treatments are likely to be
most effective in early stages, prior to the onset of dementia. The first detectable pathology in AD is the
accumulation of a 42 amino acid Aβ peptide (Aβ42) in extracellular plaques in the brain. This amyloid deposition,
which is the characteristic feature of AD, occurs decades before clinical onset of dementia. The availability of
biomarkers is crucial for early detection of, and monitoring of, the progression of AD. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
concentrations of Aβ42 in AD patients are lower than controls and correlate with the amount of plaque determined
either by positron emission tomography or at autopsy. Blood assays for Aβ42 would clearly be preferable, but
are more problematic. Currently a ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40 is used. A significant problem with plasma Aβ42/40
measurement is that Aβ is also produced by extracerebral tissues that are not affected by AD. Biomarkers, such
as phosphorylated tau peptides, have been employed, together with Aβ42/40 ratio for defining AD.
What is urgently needed are better blood biomarkers of AD, in particular one that mirrors the state of amyloid in
the brain. Our hypothesis is that measurement of the levels of a newly identified, i.e previously unreported,
covalently crosslinked Aβ peptide dimer will provide this biomarker. Elucidation of the structure of this novel
crosslinked Aβ dimer has recently been achieved in our laboratories, and its structure has been proven by
independent synthesis. We were able to determine the structure of this crosslink as a result of an ongoing, well-
established collaboration between our groups on age-related protein crosslinking. Importantly, this novel
crosslink forms spontaneously, is abundant in brain, and covalent crosslinking of two adjacent Aβ peptides can
occur only once fibrils are intimately aligned within amyloid in the brain. It is therefore amyloid-specific and cannot
form in extracerebral tissues. Crucially, the Aβ dimer fraction from brain, has been shown to be neurotoxic in
several bioassays. Under the same conditions, the Aβ monomer was quite inert. Therefore, unlike other currently
used biomarkers, levels of blood Aβ dimer may reflect damage that is occurring in the brain of AD patients. Our
ultimate aim is to make monoclonal antibodies to this crosslink to enable its specific detection. Manufacture of
these monoclonal antibodies and development of an ELISA assay for use in potential bioassays, forms the major
part of this NOSI proposal. A bioassay specific for a brain-derived neurotoxic form of Aβ would be a major
advance in AD diagnosis."

 Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare and devastating connective tissue disorder that results in fibrosis and
vascular abnormalities that can affect the skin, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, heart, and kidneys. The underlying
mechanisms are complex and largely unknown, and no effective treatment exists to stop the progression of
fibrosis in SSc or reverse it. Interstitial lung disease ILD) associated with SSc is a leading cause of death inSSc
patients. The focus of this proposal is on the epigenetic regulation of KLF4, a transcription factor with anti-fibrotic
function in pulmonary fibroblasts (pFBs). KLF4 is downregulated during active fibrosis. The goal is to identify
targetable epigenetic factors regulating KLF4 as premises to develop effective therapies for SSc-ILD. To
accomplish this, Dr. Renaud will (1) determine the involvement of HDAC(s) in the transcriptional repression of
KLF4 in pFBs, (2) build a comprehensive regulatory network based on differentially expressed (DE) genes,
microRNAs, and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) to identify and validate the role of miRNAs and lncRNAs in
the regulation of KLF4 and (3) track KLF4 regulation within the different cell types and subpopulations of
fibroblasts present in lung tissues.
 Dr. Renaud is a molecular/cellular biologist in the Division of Rheumatology at the Medical University of
South Carolina (MUSC). Her long-term career goal is to become an independent translational researcher in
fibrosis with a specific interest in epigenetic factors that regulate early phases of fibrosis. To facilitate her
transition into an independent investigator, she seeks to further her training in bioinformatics and computational
tools for the analysis of single-cell RNAseq data, and in the field of network biology. Dr. Renaud’s successful
transition to an independent career will be supported by (1) her primary mentor Dr. Feghali-Bostwick an authority
in SSc research with an excellent track record of mentorship, (2) an advisory committee with the relevant
expertise, (3) institutional centers and cores, and (4) the Department of Medicine’s support and robust
mentorship program.
 By defining the epigenetic factors responsible for KLF4 downregulation in SSc-ILD, therapeutic strategies
aiming to restore antifibrotic levels of KLF4 can be developed to prevent, stop, and possibly reverse the
progression of fibrosis. The results of this proposal will provide critical preliminary data supporting extramural
applications. The proposed training will enable Dr. Renaud to achieve her long-term objective of becoming an
independent investigator."

Recent advances in single-cell transcriptomic methods have revealed an incredible diversity of
neuronal subtypes. This presents a challenge for understanding substance use disorders
because these subtypes can only be identified in post mortem brain tissue, but substance use
disorders occur only in living humans. One of the key unsolved problems is how to link these
numerous transcriptomically-defined neuronal subtypes to their functional roles in drug addiction
in the intact brain. In this proposal, we take first steps toward bridging this gap. First, we will use
innovative optogenetic and electrophysiological techniques to record neuronal activity from
genetically identified cell types in the nucleus accumbens during oral opioid self-administration
in mice. We will also take the converse approach, using innovative optical methods to label
neuronal subpopulations that are active during different phases of opioid self-administration,
then identifying their transcriptomic profiles post mortem using a novel in situ sequencing
method. We also describe plans to extend these techniques for compatibility with advanced in
vivo multiphoton imaging and single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic studies. We expect this
project will open new lines of exploration in substance use disorders and contribute broadly to
understanding the relationship between neuronal gene regulation and functional roles in opioid
addiction, which may identify new therapeutic targets."

The Department of Neurology at UCSF has been the institutional sponsor for the R25 program at UCSF over
the past 10 years and is the home department for this application renewal. Neurology, Neurosurgery, and
Neuropathology have supported outstanding research training candidates through this program.
The Department of Neurology has an excellent record for attracting outstanding medical students destined for
neurology. Out of 280 applications from US medical graduates for 10 adult neurology positions in 2018, we
were fortunate to match all 10 positions to the top seventeen applicants on our rank list. The department
aspires to train the next generation of national neurology leaders, and our neurology residency graduates
transition in high numbers to long-term academic careers as laboratory investigators, clinical science (patient-
based) investigators, and university-based clinician teachers.
The opening of the Sandler Neurology Research Building at the Mission Bay campus (see facilities below) in
2012 has resulted in greatly expanded opportunities for research trainees and collaboration between laboratory
research programs in a common space and with nearby research programs (e.g., Gladstone Institute, VA
Laboratories at Mission Bay). The intellectual environment is productive and exciting for trainees. Monthly
multidisciplinary conferences (e.g., Brain Club and Grand Rounds) host speakers who discuss translational
science issues that attract both clinicians and bench scientists, many of these programs are specifically
directed at the level of the trainee. These conferences are followed often by an opportunity to informally mix
with colleagues who have diverse clinical and scientific interests.
The R25 has been a crucial linchpin for the development of research skills by our talented young physician-
scientists in neurology, neurosurgery, and neuropathology at UCSF. In an era of increased competition for
limited resources, the R25 has become a reliable source of encouragement as well as a stable NIH program
for ensuring that our most talented early career neuroscientists are well-supported and well-mentored."

This national study addresses the most salient psychosocial causes of the reversal in the
decline in midlife mortality for U.S. white non-Hispanics of lower educational attainment since
1998, largely due to death rates from drug and alcohol poisoning and suicide. The specific aims
are to 1. Empirically demonstrate the associations between individual chronic stressors and
community-level stressors, alcohol and drug abuse, and health outcomes over time among
middle-aged whites compared to non-Hispanic blacks linked with educational attainment and 2.
Model the salient mediators and moderators of the relationships between chronic stressors,
alcohol and drug abuse, and health outcomes in middle-aged individuals, including social-
psychological factors (perceived achievement limitations compared to salient reference group),
social engagement (social support, political engagement, religious involvement, marital/partner
status) and access to and utilization of health, mental health and substance abuse services. Our
theoretical model embodies factors derived from reference group theory, social engagement
versus anomie and lack of access to health, mental health and substance abuse services to
treat stressor-derived symptomatology which may be alternatively self-medicated with alcohol
and drugs and negatively impact health. Our hypotheses will be tested by conducting a
longitudinal four wave mail survey (N=2500 at wave 1). We will utilize a nationwide address-
based sample of middle-aged adults (40-60), oversampling by race, educational attainment and
rural versus urban/suburban location. Data analytical techniques will include structural equation
modelling and longitudinal growth curve analyses. Qualitative interviews with a small sub-
sample of respondents (N=40) will explore how and why the main hypothesized factors predict
alcohol and drug abuse and diminished health over time differentially for whites compared to
non-Hispanic blacks. The findings from this study will contribute to the formulation of evidence-
based social policies and treatment interventions with the most promise for halting increased
midlife mortality in an understudied group at high risk for alcohol and drug abuse."
10893625,"Whereas lipidomics assays in peripheral blood are relatively well-established, the application of spatially-
resolved lipidomics in the brain is novel. Bulk lipidomics studies have revealed potential differences in lipid
metabolism across aging and disease, but the regional and cell type-specificity of these changes remains
unresolved. In particular, given that the brain comprises numerous cell types of multiple lineages with tightly
regulated spatial organization and inter-connections, it is likely the lipid profiles, metabolism, and dysregulation
are all dramatically non-uniform across the brain. Thus, we propose to provide a map of this non-uniformity in
brain tissue would move the field forward substantially in terms of having a universal reference, much as the
Allen mouse brain atlas revolutionized researchers' ability to query spatial patterns of gene expression in the
brain. We believe that a lipidomics atlas will be transformative in a similar way, especially given the increased
focus on lipid dysregulation in neurodegenerative disease. We will test the hypothesis that deficits in the acyl
chain remodeling pathway may underlie the changes in metabolic profile such as fatty acid metabolism and
functional effects mediated by genes ABCA7, PICALM and BIN1 which have recently been identified
associated with Late Onset AD genetic risk. Our continuing studies on phosphoinositide metabolism and the
gene network including Synaptojanin1 (Synj1) are highly relevant to PICALM, a phosphoinoistide binding
protein, and BIN1, also known as amphiphysin2, which interacts with Synj1 and is likely to mediate
phosphoinositide signaling. ABCA7 interestingly, has been shown to transport lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) a
major biochemical intermediate of the Land's cycle and acyl chain remodeling. Recently, ABCA7
haplodefeciency has been shown to disrupt microglia function. It is clear that functional studies to understand
phospholipid regional brain distribution, cell specificity and roles in cell-specific functions are critical for gaining
understanding of these genes as well as the pathogenesis and disease progression of AD. Ultimately, we will
identify biomarkers based on lipids which are dysregulated in brain and show correlated (positive or negative)
dysregulation in plasma, which is tractable in the clinic. We hypothesize that re-programming of lipid
metabolism is likely to be based on early changes in the Lands Cycle, acyl chain remodeling. This early and
stereotypically altered metabolic shift in the lipid profile could ultimately be used for biomarker or therapeutic
target discovery in AD. Successful completion of these studies will lead to system-wide, biological insight into
the contribution of lipid metabolism to Alzheimer's Disease and validation of a lipid discovery platform which
can be applied to future studies for development of biomarkers as well as therapeutic targets."
10895347,"Ependymomas in children mainly arise in the hindbrain/ posterior fossa (PF) and carry high morbidity and
mortality. Despite decades of clinical trials, mainstay treatment still remains surgery and adjuvant radiation,
that are not curative. PF ependymomas are unique as more than 80% of tumors do not bear recurrent genetic
alterations. Instead, they are epigenetically driven. They are classified into group-A (PFAs) tumors defined by
an epigenetic state of global reduction of the repressive mark H3K27me3 and group-B (PFBs) tumors that do
not show a reduction in H3K27me3. PFAs mainly occur in infants and young children and exhibit a dismal
prognosis, while PFB tumors are mainly observed in adolescents and adults and bear an excellent prognosis.
Reduced H3K27me3 in PFAs is mediated by a protein termed EZHIP (EZH inhibitory protein) that suppresses
the function of the H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2. However, how EZHIP drives the pathogenesis of PFAs
remains unknown. A central hallmark of cancer is reprograming of cellular metabolism by oncogenes, which
enables increased uptake and metabolism of nutrients such as glucose by tumors. Moreover, Metabolic and
epigenetic pathways are intimately linked and metabolites can directly impact epigenetic modifications. For
example, the metabolite α-ketoglutarate (αKG) is a critical cofactor for the H3K27 histone lysine demethylases
(KDMs) that can drive global reduction of H3K27me3. Our preliminary data show that EZHIP enhances
glycolysis and TCA cycle to produce high αKG levels. Our overarching hypothesis is that EZHIP epigenetically
rewires cellular metabolism to increase αKG production that is required to maintain low H3K27me3 levels.
Consequently, suppressing this epigenetic/ metabolic pathway will be therapeutic. Two specific aims will
address our hypothesis: Aim 1. Elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which EZHIP enhances glycolysis and
TCA cycle metabolism. Aim 2. Determine the therapeutic potential of targeting an integrated metabolic/
epigenetic pathway to combat these tumors. The combination of these two aims will address significant gaps in
our understanding of PFAs and lay the groundwork to develop effective treatments."

 DNASU is a 11 year old non-profit, academic-based repository that provides academia, industry and the
government with a wide variety of plasmids including specialized vectors, regulatory genetic sequences, and
genes from 1,269 organisms, with many complete genome collections, including the first complete human set.
Users access the repository through our website, https://dnasu.org/, where they can: view pertinent clone,
gene and vector information; order clones; and utilize link-outs to reach external resources such as protocols
and publications. DNASU acquires plasmids both through in-house production by our high throughput cloning
pipeline and through deposition by outside research groups. In addition, we partnered with the Protein
Structure Initiative (PSI), for whom we performed full-length sequence verification and annotation on plasmids
from multiple PSI centers before distributing them. Distribution is initiated when a user visits DNASU to request
selected construct(s). Technicians subculture and ship the glycerol stocks for a nominal re-charge fee. DNASU
maintains and archives over 260,000 unique plasmids. The DNASU website sees an average of 3,000 unique
visitors per month, receives 5,000 orders and distributes over 35,000 plasmids per year to scientists worldwide.
 DNASU received funding from NIGMS through the PSI initiative that enabled the addition of >93,000
plasmids to its collection and the development of software tools for locating and using clones, thus creating a
unique worldwide resource. We also received funds from NIGMS Legacy program to improve the
infrastructure, member collection, visibility and sustainability of the repository. We have made significant
inroads to create a self-sustaining effort whereby we can continue to distribute clones from our existing
collection. However, the number of clones we distribute, although large, is small relative to the massive size of
the collection we must maintain, so our sales do not support continued database/computer programming,
upkeep and updating of our collection, or acquisition of new collections. We recognize that the scientific
community needs a comprehensive archival site like ours in order to continue expanding scientific knowledge
on the many proteins that have not yet been studied. We are seeking funding to support our operations and
customer support to: 1) Maintain and Improve the Physical Plasmid Repository by refining wet lab
methods, updating targeted collections to current expression vectors, refreshing clones to ensure viability, and
assisting with acquisition of orphaned collections; 2) Enhance Bioinformatics Capabilities of DNASU to stay
current with modern hardware, software and operating systems, and to enhance the DNASU database and
bioinformatics pipelines for sequence annotation of the physical clones and the related biological information;
and 3) Improve Customer Experience and Outreach by re-constructing the DNASU interface for order
placement, improving technical support, and engaging scientists through social media support."
10895525,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Deep crypt secretory (DCS) cells are an understudied lineage of secretory cells residing in the colonic crypt
base with unknown roles in colitis. In preliminary data, I show that DCS cells express a class of proteins known
as host defense peptides (HDPs) that can influence key epithelial (e.g. differentiation, barrier integrity) and
immune functions. Despite clear demonstrations of altered colonic secretory cell numbers and HDP levels in
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the mechanisms regulating DCS cells and HDPs are poorly understood.
This proposal is designed to identify the mechanisms driving DCS cell differentiation and HDP
production in colitis, and determine the role of these factors in regulating epithelial and immune
functions. Using a mouse model with elevated DCS cell numbers, I am proposing coordinated in vivo and in
vitro approaches to understand the mechanisms underlying DCS cell differentiation and HDP expression in the
colon (Aim 1) and to test how altered DCS cell-derived HDPs affect colonic homeostasis and acute and
chronic colitis severity (Aim 2). This work will be accomplished with new expertise obtained in advanced
transcriptomic studies and epithelial lineage tracing in models of colitis by working with my team of co-mentors
and advisory committee. This work will advance our understanding of the cellular mechanisms that drive
intestinal epithelial remodeling in colitis, and thus may reveal new potential therapeutic targets for IBD and
other intestinal inflammatory disease. The research and career development plan, generated in concert with
my mentors and advisory committee, will provide the training and support necessary to become an
independent investigator at an academic research institution."
10895434,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) play important roles in modulating chromatin structure
and gene expression, and dysregulation of these marks is associated with immune and inflammatory diseases.
Recent work by Dr. Steven Josefowicz and EpiCypher highlights the dynamic regulation of histone
phosphorylation (i.e. phospho-PTMs) at induced genes in stimulated primary macrophages, revealing new roles
for these underappreciated marks. Indeed, our studies strongly suggest that the study of stimulation-responsive
chromatin dynamics in diverse primary immune cell types will unlock novel regulatory mechanisms directly
related to immune and inflammatory diseases. Phospho-PTMs and other stimulation-responsive marks are
transient in nature, and must be studied in primary cells (vs. proliferative cell lines). However, analysis of PTMs
(phospho-PTMs and other types) in primary immune cells has been limited by existing chromatin mapping
assays (i.e. chromatin immunoprecipitation [ChIP-seq]), which display poor signal-to-noise (S/N), are extremely
low-throughput and expensive, and lack the sensitivity to study rare cell populations. Even CUT&RUN (Cleavage
Under Targets & Release Using Nuclease), a new immunotethering approach that vastly outperforms ChIP-seq,
still lacks the sensitivity to map histone PTMs in primary cells at low inputs (≤10K cells).
 To meet these needs, EpiCypher is developing EpiPrime-seqTM, an ultra-sensitive genomics platform for
immunology research. A key innovation of our approach is the development of a novel CUT&RUN-based protocol
to profile PTMs, including stimulation-responsive PTMs, from primary immune cells. This approach includes
development of a novel ""direct-to-PCR"" approach that drastically improves assay sensitivity to enable low
primary cell inputs (≤10K cells). We will leverage EpiCypher’s designer nucleosome (dNuc) technology to
develop controls carrying diverse phospho-PTMs, enabling antibody validation and in-assay technical monitoring
and normalization. For Phase I feasibility, we developed a set of phosphorylated dNucs and used them to identify
highly specific phospho-PTM antibodies. These tools were used to develop EpiPrime-seq, mapping phospho-
PTM at induced genes following stimulation in both abundant and rare, sorted primary immune cells. In Phase
II, we will extend EpiPrime-seq development for improved sensitivity and throughput. We will develop an
expanded set of phosphorylated dNuc spike-ins (PhosphoStat panel) and validate phospho-PTM antibodies. We
will develop robust EpiPrime-seq protocols for ≤10K primary cells, using our novel direct-to-PCR approach to
map stimulation-responsive phospho- and methyl-lysine PTMs in diverse primary immune cells. Following these
studies, we will prepare for commercial release by establishing lot-release strategies and performing validation
studies for EpiPrime-seq kits and PhosphoStat spike-ins. Finally, we will leverage EpiCypher’s recent advances
in high-throughput CUT&RUN assays to develop automated EpiPrime-seq protocols, which we will leverage to
launch assay services and create novel stimulation-responsive epigenomic atlases."

Dramatic advances in surgical repair and cardiac intervention have improved survival in even the most
complex forms of congenital heart disease (CHD). With this notable success, there has been a shift from
perioperative to chronic cardiac morbidity and accelerated mortality. Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is an
important determinant of long-term outcomes in children and adults with many forms of CHD. Outcomes such
as RV dysfunction and associated comorbidities are currently thought of primarily in terms of hemodynamic or
physiological factors. However, routine clinical and imaging variables have explained only a small percentage
of the variability in RV function and clinical outcomes in CHD patients, suggesting an important role for as-yet-
unrecognized contributors. We hypothesize that multiple genetic factors contribute to the unexplained
variation in RV performance and patient outcomes. To investigate the relationship of genomic factors and
clinical outcomes, we will study two exemplars of CHD for which right ventricular (RV) dysfunction
especially impacts outcomes: tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS).
Our proposed study population will leverage a unique clinical and genetic database developed by the PCGC,
as well cohorts within individual PCGC centers and other consortia. In Aim 1, we will study the effects of
rare damaging variants identified in patients with TOF and HLHS on RV function, clinical outcomes,
and anatomical subtypes influencing outcomes. Our primary outcome will be RV ejection fraction by
cardiac MRI (CMR). Secondary outcomes will include other CMR measures of systolic and diastolic function,
as well as clinical outcomes such as transplant-free survival, sustained ventricular and atrial tachycardias, and
heart failure defined as New York Heart Association Class III or IV. In Aim 2, we will study the effects of
common variants identified in patients with TOF and HLHS on RV function, clinical outcomes, and
anatomical subtypes influencing outcomes. Primary and secondary outcomes will be identical to those in
Aim 1. Aim 3 will assess the effects of rare and common variants associated with outcomes on
cardiomyocyte function, metabolism, gene expression, and chromatin accessibility in isogenic
induced pluripotent stem cells differentiated into cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) and CHD tissues. We will
define outcome-associated common variants using bioinformatic and functional assays, and derive iPSC-CMs
with CHD variants, alone or in addition to rare and common outcome-associated variants. We will assess
contraction relaxation, energetic parameters, and transcriptional activities in iPSC-CMs. We will complement
these studies with single cell nuclear sequencing (NucSeq) and ATACseq analyses of CHD tissues to explore
how outcome-associated variants influence in vivo cardiomyocyte biology. By identifying genes affecting
outcomes, our proposal will advance mechanistic insights, improve risk-stratification and provide
resources for more precise personalized therapies for CHD patients across the lifespan."
10895438,"The vision for this program is to develop tumor forecasting methods to predict and optimize the response of
glioblastoma multiforme to standard-of-care therapies—and do so on a tumor-specific basis. A fundamental
challenge in the care of patients with brain tumors is the limitation of standard radiographic methods to
accurately evaluate, let alone predict, patient response. We propose to address this shortcoming by developing
predictive, biologically-based mathematical models that incorporate the hallmark characteristics of brain tumor
growth (e.g., tumor induced angiogenesis, hypoxia, necrosis, proliferation, invasion, and resistance to therapy)
that can be initialized using advanced, subject-specific imaging data. This project will address two critical gaps
in the care of patients battling brain cancer. First, our imaging-based, mathematical framework accounts for
subject-specific characteristics and treatment regimens on model predictions. Second, in most studies, the
ground truth used for validation of the predictive model is whether the model can predict future regional
contrast enhancement, despite the well-known limitations of this qualitative MRI feature. Thus, while prior
human studies have demonstrated the potential of predictive modeling, its translation into a realistic radiologic
tool is fundamentally hindered by lack of systematic, pre-clinical validation where critical tumor characteristics
(e.g., tumor heterogeneity and whole brain tumor cell distribution) can be precisely known and rigorously
controlled. To overcome these limitations, we aim to: 1) establish the accuracy of tumor-specific modeling to
predict spatiotemporal progression and 2) establish the accuracy of tumor-specific modeling to predict
therapeutic response. Experimentally, we will construct a family of mathematical models that employ
quantitative MRI data to capture the fundamental biological features of glioblastoma. These data are
longitudinally acquired in patient derived xenografts that are treatment naïve or undergoing radiotherapy and/or
chemotherapy. The model family is then calibrated with these data and a novel model selection strategy is
employed to choose the most parsimonious model for predicting the spatio-temporal evolution of each tumor
which is then compared to MRI data collected at future time points. Model predictions of tumor progression
will be validated via registration to 3D fluorescent images of cleared ex vivo tissue, a technique that enables
visualization of whole brain tumor burden. We will provide the clinical and scientific community with a
validated mathematical description of glioma progression that can reliably predict progression and therapy
response across a range of relevant glioma signaling pathways and can be readily applied to the clinical setting."

This proposal describes a 4-year career development plan for the PI, Dr. Abraham J. Qavi, MD, PhD, with the
goal of preparing him for an independent research career as a physician scientist. This plan includes expand
training opportunities and a pathway to an independent career that includes the development and implementation
of sensor technologies and its application towards filoviruses, namely Ebola. The PI graduated with degrees in
Biochemistry & Molecular Biology and Chemistry from the University of California, Irvine. He then enrolled in the
Medical Scholars Program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he earned his MD and PhD
in Chemistry. Dr. Qavi continued his medical training as part of the Clinical Pathology Physician Scientist Training
Program at Washington University in St. Louis and the Barnes-Jewish Hospital consortium. During his residency
elective time, he began research in the laboratory of Dr. Lan Yang, who will serve as his co-mentor together with
Dr. Amarasinghe. Dr. Yang is the Edwin H. and Florence G. Skinner Professor of Electrical & Systems
Engineering, and an internationally renowned researcher in photonics. In 2019, Dr. Qavi added an additional
training component under the co-mentorship with Dr. Gaya Amarasinghe, Professor of Pathology & Immunology,
to expand the application of his previously developed sensor technology to infectious disease reach.
 The goal of this study is the development of a rapid, multiplexed optofluidic sensor platform for
the rapid detection of pathogens, with an initial focus on Ebola. Filoviruses, such as Ebola, are among the
most lethal human pathogens, with high case fatality rates during outbreaks. Critical in the identification and
management of outbreaks are robust detection methods that can be implemented rapidly and sensitively. To
address this critical need, Whispering Gallery Mode (WGM) sensors will be leveraged. WGM devices are a class
of optical sensors in which light is confined within a micron-scale volume. These devices have incredibly high
sensitivity, small sensor footprint, ease of integration with conventional electronics, and low fabrication costs.
Microbubble resonators (MBRs), a subclass of WGM sensors, offer the advantages of conventional WGM
devices while enabling coupling of optical and the fluidic components into a single component. The goal of this
proposal is the use of an optofluidic sensor platform based on MBRs for the rapid, multiplexed detection of Ebola.
The workflow and advancements, including MBR development, engineered antibodies, biophysical validation
and multiplexing, will provide the framework to extend the work beyond the initial goals and promote facile
transition to an independent career for Dr. Qavi."

10896358,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of disability and death in the US and a major global public health
problem. Time is running short if we wish to avert a global public health disaster with untold suffering,
disruption of families, and severe challenges to health care systems and economies. Effectual solutions will
come only from innovative research. While aging is the biggest risk factor for developing AD, it is unclear to
what extent normal aging is distinct from AD and which age-related factors drive disease. Senescence is a
homeostatic response, which aims to prevent the propagation of these damaged cells while they remain viable
and metabolically active. Senescent-like phenotypes have been described in neurons despite neurons being
post-mitotic cells and these cells may release factors that trigger senescence in surrounding glia. Senescent
glia and senescent-like neurons increase in the brain with age and are thought to contribute to the loss of
function associated with aging and age-related diseases like AD. Our application, entitled “Uncoupling Age-
Versus Cognitive-Related Cellular Senescence in Alzheimer's Disease,” is highly responsive to the objectives
outlined in the RFA-AG-20-025, by leveraging an innovative molecular imaging platform we invented at
Stanford; multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI), in order to uncouple age- from cognitive decline-related cellular
senescence. MIBI enables us to quantify, with low nanometer resolution, high-dimensional, protein-level
expression patterns, single-cell (neuro/immune) interactions, and spatial localization of senescence- and AD-
relevant molecules (Aim 1) in a model of healthy aging (Aim 2) and well-characterized cases of AD related
cognitive impairment (Aim 3). Importantly, MIBI allows all of this to be accomplished in archival FFPE material,
thus allowing retrospective analysis on a variety of existing cohorts. By creating in-depth, phenotypic cellular
signatures with spatial context from our unique aging and cognitive cohorts, we will be able to provide insight
for modifiable factors promoting cognitive decline by filtering those specifically associated with aging alone. In
this research program, collaborative expertise in clinical neuropathology and cognitive decline, technological
advancements in imaging, biochemical/molecular and cellular biology, and machine learning analytics
converge in this proposed research program to address the spatio-cellular (neuro/immune, senescent)
heterogeneity in non-human primate (NHP) and human models of healthy aging and AD brains. Furthermore,
it will be synergistic to, and draw on expertise developed in existing infrastructure to image and organize AD
clinical pathology (R01AG056287, R01AG057915, MPIs: SC Bendall, RM Angelo, TJ Montine) as well as the
NIA-funded 90+ UCI cohort, control material housed in the Stanford ADRC, and NHP specimens (P50
AG047366 co-I: TJ Montine). We will reveal cellular senescent phenotypes that differentiate AD from normal
age-associated senescence."
10896478,"IMPACT OF IMMUNE SEX DIFFERENCES IN THE FIRST 1000 DAYS OF LIFE
 AND IN CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE
PROJECT SUMMARY: Substantial differences exist between the immune responses made by males and
females that critically impact on health and survival. Immune sex differences start within weeks of
conception and are maintained throughout life. However, we continue to administer preventions and
treatments without taking immune sex differences into account, largely through a lack of understanding of
their mechanism. Understanding mechanisms of these immune sex differences is essential because it will
provide the rationale to tailor vaccines and treatments and improve health outcomes.
 We seek here to define the fundamental mechanisms underlying immune sex differences in early life
through to adolescence via three aims that focus on specific immunizations and infections:
In Aim 1, we evaluate mechanisms of immune sex differences in response to BCG immunization at
birth and measles vaccination at 6 months. We will focus not only on the specific responses protecting
against tuberculosis and measles but also on the non-specific immune effects of these vaccines that reduce
childhood mortality from diseases other than TB and measles by 50%. Both specific and non-specific
responses are stronger in females. We will study sex-discordant twins in South Africa to address Aims 1-2.
In Aim 2, we investigate the impact of immune sex differences on outcome from HIV exposure in
utero. Previous studies have shown strong effects on immune function in HIV-uninfected children born to
mothers living with HIV. In addition to the HIV-uninfected twin cohort we will also study in KwaZulu-Natal a
cohort of >230 HIV-infected mother-child pairs we have followed from birth since 2015. We have recently
demonstrated that female fetuses are more susceptible to in utero infection via type I interferon-resistant
viruses, especially when the mothers have themselves seroconverted during the pregnancy.
In Aim 3, we will evaluate in an observational study immune sex differences in response to SARS-CoV-2
vaccination in an adolescent cohort aged 12-17 years in UK. Immune sex differences have been
observed to all licensed vaccines, from birth to old age, with females making stronger antibody responses
but suffering greater adverse events, as described above. The 76% higher levels of neutralising antibodies
observed in 12-15yo compared to 16-25yo in response to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is striking
in demonstrating the age-specific effects on immunity even among adolescents versus young adults.
 In this study, we address the over-arching hypotheses that sex differences in the TLR7-IFN-I
signalling pathway, in the activation of nonconventional T-cells such as MAIT cells and Vd2+ gd T-cells, in
the regulation of specific immune genes by DNA methylation, in sex steroid levels, and in the transplacental
transfer of maternal antibody - all of these factors drive and have an impact on sex differences in outcome
from vaccines and infections in early life and beyond."

In alignment with the overall proposal and goal of this P01— Strategies for Targeting Astrocyte Reactivity in AD
and ADRD—we believe astrocytes can be targeted to impact a multitude of functions known to be dysregulated
in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) because of their close physical proximity to other
cell types and essential role in brain metabolism. It is our intention to use an astrocyte-centric approach to
discover new pathways and signals previously uncharacterized in vivo in order to better address future therapies
targeting the health of astrocytes in AD. Here, we will test the hypothesis that elevating insulin signaling
specifically in astrocytes in mouse models of AD-like pathology, will normalize cerebrovascular, metabolic,
and neuronal Ca2+ network changes commonly associated with AD and ADRD. We will combine our expertise
using intranasal insulin (INI) delivery in combination with two-photon (2P) microscopy in the 5xFAD mouse model
of AD-like pathology to investigate astrocyte-specific overexpression and knockdown of insulin receptors (IR) in
the brain, and will characterize the impact of this manipulation on: (Aim 1) neurovascular unit (NVU) function
using red blood cell flow measures; (Aim 2) astrocytic and neuronal bioenergetics using fluorescent measures
of ATP/ADP ratios, glucose imaging using 2-NBDG, and glucose and lactate levels using multi-electrode arrays
(MEAs); and (Aim 3) neuronal/ astrocytic Ca2+ networks using GCaMP6 fluorescent measures of Ca2+. Results
in 5xFAD males and females will be compared to age-matched WT littermates. All imaging experiments will be
conducted in the somatosensory cortex (S1) at rest and during ambulation in head-fixed mice. We will
corroborate some of our results with hippocampal investigations using electrophysiology in the slice, and also
measure spatial and memory processes using the radial arm water maze (RAWM). Our work will investigate
networks of neurons, astrocytes, and blood vessels as targets of amyloidogenesis and vascular impairment
across sex, and will also test the hypothesis that astrocytes represent a target of INI in the brain and can help
regulate the onset of Ca2+ dysregulation. Together, a conceptually novel and experimentally rich set of data will
be extracted in order to address new potential therapeutic targets in AD and ADRD and to elucidate how
particular elements of the NVU integrate to maintain function in health and disease. Under the leadership of Core
A, our proposed collaborations with the other projects and cores sharing resources and expertise will provide a
unique opportunity to share experimental protocols, data results, and interpretation across groups, and will lead
to a thorough and unprecedented characterization of astrocytic reactivity through the lens of experienced leaders
in the field. This project, within the context of the P01, could lead to a paradigm shift such that astrocyte health
and reactivity are considered along with other biological manifestations of AD in the clinic 1, perhaps switching
from the ATN classification (amyloid/tau/neuron degeneration) to the ATRAN (amyloid/tau/reactive
astrocytes/neuron degeneration) classification."
10897080,"PROJECT 3 – ABSTRACT SUMMARY
In alignment with the overall P01—Strategies for targeting Astrocyte Reactivity in AD and ADRD— Project 3 will
target the astrocyte glutamate transporter EAAT2/Glt-1 (gene name SLC1A2) and assess the impact on
cerebrovascular function, metabolism and neural network activity in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related
dementias (ADRD). We and other groups have shown that SLC1A2 levels are reduced in AD and ADRD— a
change that is recapitulated in many AD and ADRD mouse models. SLC1A2 is well known to guard against
excitotoxic damage to synapses by minimizing synaptic glutamate spillover. This mechanism has been studied
in many different disease models. However, much less is known about whether SLC1A2 similarly prevents
glutamate from adversely affecting astrocyte endfeet and cerebrovessels, which are widely known to undergo
dysfunction in AD and ADRD. SLC1A2 is also well known to drive the production of lactate— a key component
of the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle. Nonetheless, few studies have investigated the possibility that loss of
SLC1A2 in reactive astrocytes impairs lactate shuttling, leading to hypometabolism (another well-characterized
pathology in AD and ADRD). We hypothesize that the loss of SLC1A2 is a key “loss of function phenotype”
of reactive astrocytes that underlies impaired cerebro-vascular function/integrity, hypometabolism, and disrupted
neural network activity in AD and ADRD. We will test this hypothesis across three Aims using two astrocyte-
targeting approaches: a restoration approach where we use AAV-Gfa2 to overexpress SLC1A2 in astrocytes
of a comorbid Aβ/vascular model (5xFAD mice with hyperhomocystenemia) and a knockdown approach where
we will use AAV-GfaP-Cre to knock-down astrocytic SLC1A2 in FLOX-SLC1A2 mice. Aim 1 will determine the
impact of SLC1A2 modulation on astrocyte Ca2+ signaling, endfeet and BBB integrity, cerebral blood flow, and
neurovascular coupling using two photon (2P) imaging in awake mice, and MRI (in anesthetized mice). Aim 2
will determine the impact of SLC1A2 modulation on lactate and glucose signaling in awake mice using
microelectrode arrays. And Aim 3 will test the effects of SLC1A2 modulation on neuronal network fidelity and
synaptic function and plasticity using either 2P imaging of awake mice or electrophysiology on in situ brain slices.
Points of interaction: All functional outcomes are assessed in our Animal Vascular-Metabolic-Neural Network
core (Core B). Interrelationships between different astrocyte pathways (MMP9 modulation /Project 1, Insulin
receptor modulation/Project 2, and KATP modulation/Project 4) will be assessed as a function of AD and ADRD
comorbidities through the shared use of postmortem tissue across projects (cerebrovascular pathology/Project
1, amyloid pathology/Project 2, amyloid+vascular pathology/Project 3, LATE + hippocampal sclerosis
pathology/Project 4). Similar interrelationships will be assessed across comorbidities in shared postmortem
human biospecimens (Core C, Human Consultation-Biosamples-Biomarkers). All data will flow into our Data
Management and Biostatistics Core (Core D) for analysis of endpoint measures, both within and across projects."
10897081,"PROJECT 4 SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
An astrocyte mechanism will be targeted with the goal of preventing a common subtype of dementia. Limbic-
predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) and hippocampal sclerosis (HS) pathology are
present at autopsy in approximately 25% of “Alzheimer’s-type dementia” cases. Notably, a specific ABCC9
gene variant is associated with increased risk of developing LATE+HS. ABCC9 encodes a protein that serves
as a “metabolic sensor” linking brain hypoxia and stress to changes in intracellular calcium and blood flow.
We hypothesize that dysregulation of ABCC9 in astrocytes causes or exacerbates LATE+HS via impaired
cerebrovascular function, hypometabolism (with ionic dyshomeostasis), and neuronal hyperexcitability,
aligning perfectly with themes of this P01. These astrocyte mechanisms can be targeted by a well-tolerated
drug (nicorandil) that has been shown to be clinically safe and effective, with high potential public health
impact. The research will be conducted with the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Characterize ABCC9/SUR2
transcripts and proteins in human astrocytes. We will test the hypothesis that the ABCC9 genetic variant
associated with LATE+HS risk is also associated with decreased ABCC9 expression in astrocytes. Astrocyte
ABCC9 transcripts are mostly unknown. In human samples, we will evaluate the repertoire of mRNA
transcripts and splicing in astrocytes. We will characterize ABCC9 gene expression with RNA-Seq data
across cell types. In genotyped human brains from Core C (LATE+HS and controls), we will evaluate ABCC9
proteins immunohistochemically, and we will explore Sur2 expression in mouse models. Aim 2: Test the
hypothesis that modulation of astrocytic ABCC9//KATP leads to improved neurovascular and metabolic
function in LATE+HS model mice. The novel (TetR-TDP) mouse, an excellent animal model that has proven
hippocampal cell loss, astrocytosis, TDP-43 proteinopathy, and memory impairment, will be used to test the
impact of astrocyte specific ABCC9 upregulation on neurovascular function (multiphoton to look at
neurovascular coupling and vessel leakiness; MRI to look at cerebral blood flow and other endpoints). The
impact of astrocyte specific upregulation of SUR2B on brain metabolism will also be tested (glutamate uptake
in astrocytes; Ca2+ dynamics [GCaMP]; and, MRS to characterize brain metabolites). Aim 3: Test the
hypothesis that pharmacological modulation with nicorandil (a KATP channel agonist well-tolerated in oral
preparations) leads to improved neuronal and astrocyte function and neurobehavioral assessment outcomes
in TetR-TDP mice. These outcomes will include readouts of neurobehavioral parameters (RAWM and Y-
maze) and other endpoints including electrophysiological assessments in astrocytes. Follow-up assessments
will include detailed neuropathology (astrocytosis, HS, TDP-43 proteinopathy, and small vessel morphology).
In summary, while studying the mechanisms of astrocyte metabolic and neurovascular pathophysiology in
LATE+HS, we hope to test a novel therapeutic strategy."
10897146,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Health disparities in the burden of multiple chronic conditions for low-income and racial and ethnic minority
groups are pervasive and have their roots in social determinants of health and unequal access to evidence-
based health care services during critical periods of life. The Chicago region suffers from severe chronic
condition disparities for its African American and Latinx populations that can be mapped to specific
geographies due to the long history of racial segregation that has contributed to inequities in neighborhood
conditions, income, and access to high quality health resources and healthcare. Addressing disparities
in multiple chronic conditions in the Chicago region will require engaging diverse stakeholders committed to
overcoming gaps in the healthcare system, gaps in the traditional approach to delivering preventive and
management services, and gaps generated by a reductionist approach to science. We propose taking a
holistic approach to health disparities research that includes health care delivery systems, community health
centers, public health agencies and community-based organizations. The Community Engagement Core of
the Chicago Chronic Condition Equity Network (C3EN) aims to address these gaps by developing partnerships
between authentic community voices and researchers to co-design research interventions in the multi-
county Chicago region. We will engage multiple systems of clinical and social care that typically work in silos,
to collectively address research gaps in order to promote health equity for the African American and Latinx
populations in the Chicago region. In addition, these diverse stakeholders will facilitate the dissemination
of the findings of these research interventions to their constituents."

10897164,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The Surveillance Monitoring for ART Toxicities (SMARTT) study was developed by the Pediatric
HIV/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS) network to evaluate the safety of in utero antiretroviral (ARV) exposures on
children born to mothers with HIV. The study has been highly productive, informing national and international
guidelines for safe and effective ARV regimens during pregnancy. The SMARTT study uses an innovative
trigger-based surveillance approach for identifying adverse events (AEs) that may be attributed to prenatal and
perinatal ARV therapy exposure. All children receive periodic clinical and laboratory evaluations and only those
meeting certain thresholds or “triggers” receive additional assessments to evaluate specific AE criteria
designated as “cases”. The study opened to enrollment in 2007, and as of October 2019 has enrolled over
4000 infants and children who are HIV-exposed but uninfected (CHEU) born to mothers with HIV. By 2019,
33% of children had met case status in at least one domain. Pregnant women living with HIV are increasingly
receiving combination antiretroviral treatment at the time of conception, and newer ARV medications approved
over the last decade have raised concerns regarding possible increased risk of congenital anomalies, preterm
birth, and other adverse birth outcomes. As the landscape of treating HIV in pregnancy evolves, there is a
need to develop the most cost-effective and informative study designs for future monitoring of ARV safety
among CHEU.
 Building on the established experience of the PHACS network, we will enroll 200 mother-infant pairs
over 5 years from 21 clinical sites to evaluate potential adverse birth outcomes and alterations in growth and
neurodevelopment, and cardiometabolic, maternal, and oral health based on follow-up from birth through age 5
(intensive follow-up cohort). We will also conduct targeted long-term follow-up through age 17 years
among CHEU identified as AE cases based on the SMARTT trigger design, along with a comparison cohort
of 800 randomly-selected CHEU (stratified by clinical research site), to evaluate persistence, resolution, and
longitudinal profiles of health functioning across multiples domains of interest (extended follow-up cohort). This
large cohort will serve as a platform for multiple separately funded emerging research pilots, and allow synergy
with other PHACS projects. Innovative epidemiologic and statistical methods will be used to analyze this large
dataset to promote improved understanding of both child and maternal health in relation to HIV."
10897167,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that in 2016, there were 11,915 persons with
perinatally-acquired HIV (PHIV) in the U.S., including 10,101 adolescents and young adults. Globally, 1.7
million children under the age of 15 are living with HIV and with effective antiretroviral medications (ARVs) are
expected to survive into adolescence, young adulthood and beyond.
The Adolescent Master Protocol (AMP) was designed to evaluate long-term effects of HIV infection and
ARVs on multiple domains. AMP enrolled 451 children with PHIV between ages 7-16 years and 227 children
living with perinatal HIV exposure but uninfected (PHEU) from 2007-09. The AMP Up and AMP Up Lite
studies (AMP Up Series) were developed to allow for continued follow-up of young adults with PHIV
(YAPHIV) beyond 18 years of age, including AMP participants, to assess physical and mental health as they
transition to adulthood. These innovative studies share similar objectives and are designed to facilitate long-
term follow-up with annual online and medical chart abstracted data collection.
AMP has been highly productive with numerous influential publications. AMP Up has yielded important
information – including the role of social support and ability to self-manage health care on a successful
transition to adult clinical care, and the high risk of postpartum viremia and early HPV-associated cervical
lesions. Yet the long-term effects of HIV and ARV on health in young adulthood are still unfolding. The
comprehensive data collected since early childhood on a substantial subset of AMP Up participants previously
in AMP provides the invaluable opportunity to assess how early HIV and ARV, mental health, neurocognitive
function, and family dynamics impact adult outcomes. The specific aims of the AMP Up Series are to:
1. Define the impact of PHIV infection, ARVs, and individual, social and structural factors on: the transition to
adulthood and adult care; brain structure and neurological functioning; academic, vocational, emotional and
social functioning; mental health; medication and health care adherence; sexual behaviors; and substance use.
2. Identify infectious and non-infectious complications of HIV and their associations with ARVs and HIV.
3. Investigate genetic, epigenetic, virologic, inflammatory, and immunologic factors which impact the course of
HIV infection, its complications, the response to treatment, and potential for HIV remission/cure."
10897168,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Worldwide, over 300,000 women die each year from squamous cell cancers (SCC) of the cervix caused
by the high risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV). The development of the HPV vaccine has been a transforming
event, capable of preventing cervical cancer globally. HIV infection is an established risk factor for HPV
persistence, progression to CIN2+, and HPV-associated cancers. The majority of perinatal HPV appears to
be transient. However, the ability of infants with perinatal HIV infection (PHIV) to clear this infection is
unknown. What is known is that abnormal cytology is one of the more common diagnosed morbidities in PHIV
women. One of the pressing questions worldwide is “what is the efficacy in vaccinating PHIV children?”
 In a recent study within PHACS of HPV-vaccinated youth, we found that those with PHIV had HPV
antibody titers lower than uninfected youth and most disturbingly, their rate of abnormal cytology was
exceedingly high: the incidence of abnormal cytology was 15.0 and 2.9 /100 person-years for PHIV and
uninfected, respectively. It remains unclear whether this reflects vaccine failure or disease due to non-vaccine
HPV types. Our findings led to a sub-study within PHACS supported by the NCI to screen women with
abnormal cytology with colposcopy and perform HPV genotyping on cervical lesions. This proposal plans to
take advantage of women in this sub-study to understand the natural history of CIN 1 or 2. We are proposing
the following Aims:
Among YAPHIV women who have been vaccinated against HPV, we will examine:
1. the rate of and risk factors for regression and persistence/progression of HPV-associated CIN1 or 2.
 YAPHIV found to have CIN 1 or 2 will be followed prospectively by colposcopy, cytology and HPV
genotyping.
2. the prevalence of CIN 2+ in those testing positive for hrHPV with/without p16-Ki67 dual staining.
3. the rate of and risk factors for regression and persistence/progression of hrHPV infections. Women in aim 2
 with normal cytology and no CIN will be followed prospectively by annual cytology and HPV genotyping.
Among PHIV Men, we will examine:
4. the prevalence of and natural history of oral HPV in HPV-vaccinated and unvaccinated PHIV men. Oral
rinses obtained for PHACS bio-repository in men every three years will be tested for HPV genotyping.
 In summary, PHACS AMP-Up, a prospective cohort study, is an exceptional opportunity to understand the
natural history of hrHPV and CIN 1 or 2 in PHIV women and oral HPV in PHIV men. The results of this study
will be critical for developing clinical and policy guidelines for HPV vaccination strategies and cervical cancer
screening among young men and women in resourced and resource poor settings."
10897169,"PROJECT SUMMARY
An estimated 15 million children worldwide are living with perinatal HIV and antiretroviral (ARV) exposure, but
are HIV-uninfected (PHEU). Recent studies reveal cognitive challenges, mental health problems, and
increased rates of risk-taking behaviors including substance use among youth with PHEU (YPHEU). Existing,
cross-sectional neuroimaging studies indicate disrupted brain development among YPHEU, yet the underlying
neural mechanisms, particularly related to prenatal HIV and ARV exposure, are not well understood.
Dysfunction of networks supporting emotional regulation has been linked with childhood psychopathologies
and risk-taking behavior in youth, yet we know little in YPHEU despite increased risk behaviors. We propose a
longitudinal investigation to address these gaps in our current understanding. Our central hypothesis is that
disruption of networks supporting emotion regulation, and interaction with other developmental risks, are key to
understanding deficits in mental health, cognition and behavior in YPHEU. We will assess brain network
development, mental health, self-regulation and other cognitive domains, and risk-taking behavior, utilizing
functional and structural neuroimaging, clinical and computer-based assessments and tasks, in 190 YPHEU
(10-14 years) at baseline, and 2 years later. Participants will be recruited from the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort
Study (PHACS) Surveillance Monitoring of ART Toxicity Study (SMARTT). Aim 1 will leverage harmonized
age- and gender-matched neuroimaging and behavioral data from the NIH funded ABCD study on over 10,000
children age 9-10 years followed yearly, to compare with trajectories of brain network development, cognition
and behavior, as well as their relationships among YPHEU. Aim 2 will examine the impact of type and timing of
perinatal ARVs and other perinatal exposures such as substance use on brain network development within
YPHEU. We will also examine social and structural factors that may have independent effects on brain
development or interact with perinatal exposures. To further our understanding of lifetime implications of
perinatal exposures, exploratory Aim 3 will explore long-term brain network and behavioral consequences, and
their effect on transition to adult independence, in 50 young adults with PHEU and 50 with perinatally acquired
HIV (PHIV), age 22-29, enrolled in the PHACS Adolescent Master Protocol-Up (AMP Up) study. We will
leverage harmonized age- and gender-matched healthy young adult neuroimaging and behavioral data from
the NIH funded Human Connectome Project to compare outcomes. Recognizing significant public health
implications of the effects of ARV exposure on long-term cognitive and behavioral outcomes among YPHEU,
this project, leveraging multiple NIH-supported multicenter studies and established collaborations, will identify
mechanisms driving cognitive and behavioral outcomes, critical data for informing much needed prevention
and intervention strategies for the staggering numbers of YPHEU globally."
10897170,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Meaningful community engagement in HIV research supports the equitable collaborations between
researchers, study participants, and the community. It brings together the theoretical and methodological
expertise of academics and researchers, with the expertise of participants’ lived experiences and cultural- and
context-rich perspectives, an orientation that has gained increasing credibility in addressing complex health
and social problems. While the existence of Community Advisory Boards (CABs) in HIV research has been
well-established, their contribution to the research process has typically been relegated to reviewing study
materials and disseminating study findings. There is an unmet need for infrastructure and processes that
ensure the meaningful inclusion and integration of community members and other stakeholders throughout all
stages of the research process. A lack of meaningful community engagement has the potential to undermine
not only effective study design and study procedures, but also the ability of findings to be implemented more
broadly in the affected communities researchers ultimately seek to serve and benefit. As the PHACS Network
has grown and matured over the past 14 years, so have the membership and scope of its CAB (established in
2008) and Young Adult CAB (established in 2013). They have provided vital input that has created new study
questions, improved study procedures, and created more effective and innovative ways to disseminate
findings. In 2013, an innovative multidisciplinary Health Education and Communication Committee was formed,
comprised of CAB and YACAB members, clinical site staff, health educators, researchers, and investigators.
This committee has been a model in PHACS for the integration of community engagement into research
processes and has provided critical insights as PHACS has encountered unforeseen barriers to long-term
study retention and data collection. Additionally, it has produced a wide array of innovative, community-driven
health education resources, including an award-winning short documentary about perinatal HIV, a comic book
series on maternal disclosure, whiteboard videos explaining informed consent and study procedures, and a
web portal for young adult participants. To support the expanding scope of work and domains of interest in
PHACS 2020, the innovative Health Education and Community Core (HECC) will formalize and expand
these existing structures through targeted services that support the Research Projects, Emerging Research
Pilots, and Cores and promote meaningful collaboration among researchers, clinical site staff, and CAB and
YACAB members at all stages of the research process: when setting research priorities, crafting research
questions, collecting data, analyzing and interpreting data. The HECC will also serve as an “innovation
incubator” for novel efforts to communicate PHACS’ findings to participants and the community, thus modeling
a more broadly adoptable feedback loop structure that includes and values community voices at all stages."

The Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS) is a large-scale multi-site network with multiple observational
studies aimed to evaluate the long-term effectiveness and safety of population-based interventions to prevent
perinatal HIV transmission and HIV progression and inform HIV remission/cure strategies. The PHACS
Research Projects have generated and will continue to gather data on health determinants from various
sources and via diverse methods including clinical, social, genomic, microbiome, and imaging data. A multitude
of concept sheets and sub-studies will therefore be proposed requiring specialized epidemiological and
statistical expertise, ranging from efficient study design, causal inference methodology, deep learning
algorithms, bioinformatics, and integrative microbiome informatics, to inform data analyses that will be
conducted by the PHACS Data Resources Core (DRC). As we continue to add to our extensive PHACS
database, new and challenging problems are likely to arise that may necessitate the development of innovative
study designs and analytic methods, particularly in the fields of pediatric and perinatal epidemiology. Ongoing
training will be required on these and other methodological innovations for PHACS epidemiologists and
statisticians. Continuing education on fundamental epidemiological and statistical principles will also be
required for all PHACS investigators in order to conduct effective collaborative research.
To address these needs and promote valid and efficient pediatric and perinatal HIV research within the
Research Projects and any focused Emerging Research Pilots, the PHACS Epidemiological and Statistical
Methods Core (ESC) has been established to: (1) provide specialized epidemiological and statistical services,
support, and resources; (2) promote the development and application of novel epidemiological and statistical
methods; and (3) support continuing education in epidemiological and statistical methods through in-person or
web-based training and mentorship of early career investigators."
10897295,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are a leading causes of gastroenteritis in the United States and globally. The
significant public health burden associated with this pathogen has stimulated efforts in vaccine development and
in the evaluation of antivirals. However, a number of fundamentally important questions on virus pathogenesis
and protective immune responses remain unanswered and addressing these challenges is critical for the
development of effective strategies to prevent and treat HuNoV infections.
In this project, we aim to: (i) Elucidate factors that mediate clinical presentations associated with HuNoV
gastroenteritis; (ii) Develop and pre-clinically test drug-like inhibitors of virus protease and polymerase as
potential antiviral agents; and (iii) Determine HuNoV epitopes recognized by the human immune system during
infection and identify epitopes associated with virus neutralization and protective immunity.
Using clinical data and samples from previous human experimental challenge studies, together with infectivity
assays in human intestinal enteroids (HIEs) allows us to carry out functional and mechanistic on HuNoV
pathogenesis and virus neutralization. The HIE cultivation system also, for the first time, allows us to directly
evaluate antivirals. The findings from this project will therefore provide new understanding of the mechanisms
of HuNoV disease and identify potential targets that can used to treat disease symptoms. Drug-like inhibitors
prioritized through rational drug design and medicinal chemistry will be evaluated for their effects on inhibition of
virus and key factors associated with infection and disease. Finally, identification of antibody repertoires that
correlate with protective immunity and virus neutralization will inform vaccine design and testing. Together, these
studies will enable functional, mechanistic and translational contributions that will reduce the public health burden
of HuNoV gastroenteritis.

10897300,"PROJECT SUMMARY –Project 3
 The major goal of Project 3 is to provide a detailed structural understanding of various aspects human
norovirus (HuNoV) biology to synergistically complement the studies in Projects 1 and 2, and aid in the
design and development of antiviral strategies. HuNoVs are the leading cause of epidemic acute gastroenteritis.
These viruses show enormous genotypic diversity and based on this they are classified into several genogroups
and genotypes. Susceptibility to HuNoVs is determined by genetically controlled expression of histo-blood group
antigen (HBGA), which is also critical for their attachment to host cells. In the previous grant periods, from
extensive structural studies, we have shown how the sequence changes alter the HBGA binding specificity and
how they impact the antigenic landscape to drive the evolution of these viruses. Studies in Projects 1 during the
current grant period, have further amplified this notion by identifying several HBGA blocking human monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs) of various isotypes with an unexpected degree of breadth and neutralization activity using the
human intestinal enteroid (HIE) system developed in Project 2. Our studies in Project 3 during this period have
shown while the blockade mechanism of a GI.1-specific mAb is by directly blocking the HBGA binding site in
GI.1 HuNoV, with a cross-reactive GII-specific mAb, the blockade/neutralization mechanism is different and
potentially unique. The goal of AIM 1 is to further our understanding of potentially varying mechanisms of
blockade/neutralization of HuNoVs by human mAbs using X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM, and other
complementary biophysical techniques. The emphasis in our following two AIMs is on the non-structural proteins
of HuNoV that regulate virus replication to provide a structural framework for design and optimization of novel
antiviral compounds that are being discovered through high-throughput screening procedures (Projects 1 and
2). AIM 2 is designed to provide a structural understanding of how GII.4 protease with its unique features
interacts with the substrates, how the newly discovered small molecules inhibit GI and GII.4 HuNoV proteases
and GII.4 polymerase, and what is the mechanism by which some small molecules discovered during screening
similar to VPg enhance polymerase activity. The focus of AIM 3 is on the p41 protein encoded by G1.1 HuNoV.
p41, with its membrane-anchoring domain, NTPase and helicase activities, plays a critical role in virus
replication. In the previous grant period, we determined the first crystal structure of p41 lacking the membrane
anchoring domain. Although it provided structural insight into the NTPase activity, it was not sufficient to provide
a complete mechanistic understanding of the potentially membrane-associated helicase, RNA remodeling/RNA
chaperone activity of p41. Based on the exciting preliminary data, studies in AIM 3 will focus on determining the
structure of the soluble and nanodisc-reconstituted full-length p41 using cryo-EM and X-ray crystallographic
methods. We expect our proposed studies will provide novel structural and mechanistic insight that will have a
significant impact on immunological, translational, and replication-related aspects of HuNoVs."

University (HBCU) that has partnered with the UNC ARC since 2010; this partnership
contributed to the enrollment of NCCU’s first PhD students in 2012 and to several of the current
10 PhD graduates. NCCU is a comprehensive institution offering bachelor’s degrees and
graduate degrees, with 80% of NCCU students being underrepresented minorities (African
American or Hispanic). NCCU is located near the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and
the UNC NIAAA Alcohol Research Center, which has been funded since 1997. The previous
UNC-NCCU partnership involved 10 NCCU biomedical faculty in alcohol research (about 30%
of NCCU faculty laboratories), with up to 15 students each year contributing to 37 publications
and three funded NIAAA R grant applications. None of this occurred prior to this partnership.
This U54 Administrative Core proposes to continue to build and promote alcohol research
expertise and to develop research infrastructure and capacity, particularly for health disparities-
associated pathology. Further, the Administrative Core will develop and administer collaborative
education-training of URM NCCU students in UNC ARC labs and other UNC training activities.
This will be accomplished through 5 aims: Aim 1: Provide scientific and administrative
leadership; Aim 2: Monitor and enhance collaborative partnerships; Aim 3: Mentor leadership
among faculty; Aim 4: Support the Scientific Mentoring and Research Experiences Core; and
Aim 5: Recruit NCCU laboratories to alcohol research. Through structured mentoring and
experimentation, this proposal will create successful alcohol research programs, leading to both
discoveries and the education of large numbers of URM students on health disparities
associated with alcohol use disorders."
10897317,"Scientific Mentoring and Research Experiences (SMRE) Core – Abstract: Representation of minority
groups in alcohol research and other academic careers is important, but there are significant disparities found in
academia1. Evidence suggests these disparities can be improved by structured mentoring that cultivates
interests, experiences, and skills of underrepresented minorities (URMs) in the sciences and fosters their
retention in academia1. The NCCU alcohol research laboratories in the current proposal were developed through
a previous funded partnership grant focused on developing independent alcohol investigators. A primary goal of
the current RFA is to promote the participation of URM scientists, and this new Scientific Mentoring and Research
Experiences Core (SMRE) directly addresses this goal. Importantly, this Core will also increase productivity for
each research component by mentoring NCCU students and supporting their expertise in complex scientific
methods. UNC ARC and NCCU collaborative partnerships have always involved undergraduate and graduate
URM students, but this proposal expands existing alcohol research collaborative partnerships with the additional
goal of increasing student matriculation into alcohol research programs. By providing tailored experiences and
infrastructure that enables student research success, we strengthen each component and facilitate student
interests into lifelong biomedical careers. This includes mentoring in complex scientific methods for alcohol
research projects, mentoring from multiple UNC ARC alcohol PIs, as well as professional development skills.
 RCMIs are strong teaching institutions, with students comprising the bulk of the research workforce.
Accordingly, in prior years of this partnership, we found that strengthening the alcohol research expertise of
NCCU students not only enhanced the pipeline of URM researchers, but it also improved the quality and
productivity of each research project. We now propose focused initiatives to strengthen the scientific expertise
of students in each research project. This includes mentoring in academic scholarship, scientific communication,
grantsmanship, scientific rigor, responsible conduct of research, and complex scientific methods tailored for each
scientific component. Increasing research skills and career coaching for NCCU students will promote student
interest and benefit research project productivity, increasing successful discoveries that will help develop
projects’ independent funding as well as increasing academic and biomedical workforce diversity. To accomplish
these goals, we propose to: (1) provide NCCU undergraduates with mentoring in complex scientific methods and
career development to improve scientific skills and promote entrance of URMs into alcohol research, (2) provide
NCCU graduate students within collaborating components focused mentoring and instruction in complex
methods tailored to each research component, and (3) facilitate laboratory mentors with evidence-based training
in mentorship of diverse populations. This Core will strengthen each component by providing resources to the
scientific development of the students on each component."
10897321,"Project Abstract: Excessive binge alcohol consumption causes major health and socio-economic issues within
the United States. Unfortunately, minorities in this country are disproportionately burdened by these problems
despite equal incidences of binge drinking. Finding ways to reduce binge like consumption therefore remains an
important field of research to combat health disparities and decrease the development of ethanol dependence.
This project seeks to determine if astrocytes and the neuroimmune system represent novel targets by which to
curb excessive consumption. This grant determines the influence of excessive ethanol on astrocytic activation
and function in the hippocampus as well if the proinflammatory cytokines are responsible for glial maladaptations
(Aim 1). Because sex-differences can alter neuroimmune responses, these studies will elucidate the impact of
sex on both astrocyte activation and their function. Secondly, these studies will determine if hippocampal
astrocytic signaling can be switched to reverse the influences of ethanol on the increased proinflammatory
microenvironment and decreased glutamatergic tone of the hippocampus (Aim 2). Finally, because both
glutamate and proinflammatory cytokines can impact hippocampal dependent memory tasks and consummatory
behaviors, these experiments will determine the impact of astrocytic signaling on ethanol consumption and
alcohol-induced cognitive deficits (Aim 2). The development of astrocyte specific DREADDs allows us to
manipulate G-protein coupled receptor signaling in the hippocampus using site directed stereotactic viral
delivery. Altogether, these two aims will test our overall hypothesis that there is a reciprocal and reinforcing
relationship between alcohol and astrocyte activation mediated by the influence of astrocytes on glutamatergic
tone and proinflammatory signaling cascades. These innovative studies will provide insight into the role of
astrocytes in the transition to alcohol dependence as well as the influence of alcohol-induced neuroimmune
dysregulation on the astrocytic response."
10897324,"Project Summary
The objective of the proposed research is to target molecular pathways involved in alcohol-induced limb/fin
defects to identify novel mechanisms with a role in FASD with the long-term goals of informing clinical practice,
and ultimately reducing the incidence and severity of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). This objective
will be met by applying two innovative and complementary approaches that use cell, zebrafish and mouse
models to (i) genetically knockout and identify genes that rescue or exacerbate the effects of ethanol exposure,
and (ii) high throughput screening of focused chemical libraries to identify compounds that modulate the effects
of ethanol exposure. Our approach utilizes genetically modified zebrafish and mice, and the developing fin and
limb respectively, as readily examined target tissues whose molecular signaling pathways and vulnerability to
ethanol teratogenesis are well documented. This research proposal is founded on 1) strong evidence that
craniofacial abnormalities and limb defects have been observed in those identified with FASD, 2) recognition
that disruption of sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling, a major morphogenic pathway regulating embryonic
development as a significant consequence of prenatal ethanol exposure (PAE), 3) that genetically reduced
Shh signaling results in increased vulnerability to ethanol-induced birth defects, and 4) the availability of
differentially expressed gene sets from our previous study on the effects of PAE on mouse limb development.
The hypothesis to be tested is that the identification of novel genes and compounds that can rescue
morphological and behavioral deficits elicited by PAE will reveal fundamental and novel insights into the
mechanism of ethanol-induced birth defects. This hypothesis will be tested with experiments that employ well-
established cell line, zebrafish, and mouse FASD models and will address the following Specific Aims: Aim 1
will use these in vivo and in vitro models to assess gene-environment interactions, particularly the candidate
genes whose expression was shown to be altered in ethanol-exposed mouse limb buds by our previous
ethanol RNA Seq study. Aim 2 is to utilize high-throughput screening technologies in vitro and in vivo to identify
small molecule modulators that rescue or exacerbate the effects of PAE. Small molecule compounds that
rescue or exacerbate ethanol-induced fin defects in zebrafish embryos and limbs defects in mice will be
identified. The proposed studies will be conducted by NCCU faculty and trainees under the mentorship of
UNC’s Bowles Center for Alcohol Studies researchers. In addition to expanding our understanding of ethanol’s
teratogenic mechanism of action as well as providing clues regarding genetic sensitivities and interventions for
FASD and potentially novel pathways with a role in FASD, this research project will foster state of the art
research by budding scientists from underrepresented minorities and will provide the foundation for important
FASD studies to be addressed in future grant applications/research."
10897325,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alcohol consumption has been associated with increased breast cancer risk. Although alcohol-associated breast
carcinogenesis has been extensively studied, the mechanisms of alcohol-induced tumor initiation, especially the
primary cell targets in cancerous transformation, remains unclear. Recent advances indicate that deregulation
of cancer stem cells (CSCs), a small group of tumor cells with self-renewal and differentiation potential, plays a
central role in cancer initiation, development, and recurrence. The effects of alcohol consumption on breast
cancer stem cells have been poorly understood. Nevertheless, studies showed that alcohol-induced liver
oncogenesis involves CSC promotion. Alcohol-derived acetaldehyde (AA) induces chromosome rearrangement
with functional consequences in hematopoietic stem cells, suggesting that tissue stem cells may be the primary
target of alcohol/AA-associated genotoxicity. Supported by our preliminary studies showing that alcohol induces
DNA damage, chromosome alterations and CSC expansion in breast cancer cell lines, this project aims to study
whether and how alcohol consumption promotes cancer initiation through induction of CSCs from mammary
stem cells (MaSCs). We hypothesize that alcohol promotes breast cancer development through AA-mediated
gene mutations and genomic instability of MaSCs, which leads to the disruption of genome integration and
cancerous transformation. The underlying mechanisms involve mutation of p53, impairment of DNA repair
machinery and deregulation of stemness networks. In support of this study, we have developed the MMTV-
erbB2/Aldh2-/- mouse model for mammary tumorigenesis and MaSC analysis. These unique tools will facilitate
our studies on AA accumulation-associated toxicity in MaSCs in vivo. The hypothesis will be tested in three
specific aims. 1) To determine whether alcohol and AA exposure promotes MaSC/CSC stemness and mammary
tumor development in treated animals. 2) To examine alcohol/AA-induced genomic instability in mammary
tumors and MaSCs/CSCs. 3) To understand the mechanisms of alcohol/AA-mediated genomic instability and
MaSC/CSC deregulation focusing on p53 pathway and Wnt/Sox2/RANKL signaling network of mammary
stemness. Results from this project will advance our understanding of alcohol-induced genomic injury and MaSC
mutation that lead to malignant transformation in breast cancer initiation, and identify specific regulators that
mediate these genetic and functional changes of the MaSCs and CSCs. These data will be of great significance
for early diagnosis and prevention of alcohol-associated breast cancer."
10868825,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Alcohol addiction constitutes one of the most serious public health problems worldwide. According to the CDC,
the total economic cost of excessive alcohol use is estimated to be $249 billion. Despite its devastating impact,
there are few effective treatments. Neural circuit based approaches to treat addiction provide a powerful
opportunity to develop more specific and effective treatments. However, circuit complexity is a significant
obstacle to a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms by which memory circuits are altered to create
enduring preferences for alcohol associated cues. The current proposal will take place at Bryant University, a
primarily undergraduate institution, and will capitalize on the genetic tractability of Drosophila melanogaster and
precise neurogenetic tools available to interrogate how identified memory circuits are altered by alcohol and why
alcohol associated memories are so resistant to change. Although only 100,000 neurons comprise the central
nervous system of Drosophila, the neural circuitry underlying reward and addiction is remarkably complex and
similar to mammals. Like mammals, Drosophila show robust preference for cues associated with alcohol
intoxication that persist in the face of aversive consequences. Studies proposed here will capitalize on
established and newly developed neurogenetic tools that allow for the precise manipulation of individual neurons
and visualization of circuit activity. Doing so will enable us to test the hypothesis that alcohol disrupts memory
circuit activity and drives maladaptive reward seeking by engaging significantly more dopamine neurons during
acquisition. Specifically, we will use a combination of optogenetics, thermogenetics, and two-photon microscopy
to capture the precise changes in dopamine neural dynamics while Drosophila learn to associate odor cues with
alcohol intoxication. Additionally, we will determine if alcohol-independent activation of dopamine neurons is
sufficient to induce maladaptive memories for natural rewards. Finally, we will investigate the role of recently
identified downstream regions of the fan-shaped body in modulating alcohol reward memories to understand the
stability and persistence of these memories. We expect that extracellular dopamine levels and number of
recruited dopamine neurons will significantly increase across alcohol exposures and this increase is sufficient to
drive maladaptive reward seeking behavior. Further, we predict that downstream convergent regions play a
critical role in behavioral flexibility and disruption to these functional connections results in memories that lack
flexibility and drive maladaptive reward seeking. Ultimately, understanding general circuitry principles described
first in Drosophila will provide insight to how alcohol co-opts mammalian circuits to create enduring preference
for alcohol and drive maladaptive choice. An AREA grant is essential to continue our efforts in exposing
students to hands-on meritorious research, providing superior research experiences, and strengthening
the research environment at Bryant University, thereby enabling more students to participate."

10864222,"CRC Abstract / Summary
FA (FA) is very common, affecting up to 32 million Americans, including up to 8% of children and 10% of adults,
and its prevalence appears to have increased significantly over the past 20 to 25 years.4,10 The past decade has
seen tremendous progress in the investigation of FA, with significant advances in both prevention and treatment,
as well as in the understanding of the immunologic basis of FA. However, at this time there is still only a single
FDA-approved therapy for FA, and given its limitations most patients are still left with the age-old option of strict
avoidance and the use of emergency medications upon accidental exposure. Given these facts, safe and
effective therapies, or even better preventative approaches that can be widely applied, are highly desirable.
Johns Hopkins University (JHU) has been a leader in the study of FA for over 30 years, and a CoFAR Clinical
Research Center (CRC) since its inception. With its large referral population, the center has been a world leader
in defining the natural history of FA and in the study of FA treatments. In addition, JHU has a remarkable track
record of training the next generation of leaders in FA research, and most important to this application, the entire
Hopkins team of physicians, nurses, research assistants, and laboratory personnel remains intact, poised to
move forward with this next 7 years of CoFAR. From the scientific perspective, this application puts forward three
outstanding protocols. The first is a cutting edge, network wide clinical trial on the treatment of peanut allergy
using a novel approach to immunotherapy utilizing a peanut peptide vaccine. The second and third protocols are
site-specific, led by outstanding young investigators, the first focusing on the mechanisms of food-induced
anaphylaxis and the second on patient-centered outcomes in FA treatments.
Given these facts and the details to follow, it is clear that JHU is exceptionally qualified to remain a CRC for this
next iteration of CoFAR. The site brings to CoFAR an unbeatable combination of highly experienced investigators
and staff, available patients, and a track record of innovation, leadership, and performance, as well as an
unparalleled record in the development of the next generation of clinician scientists focused on the study of FA."
10864297,"Leadership Center Summary/Abstract
Food allergy research has increased dramatically over the past 20 years, in large part to the efforts of CoFAR.
New approaches for both treatment and prevention have been introduced, as have the understanding of the
immunologic basis of food allergy. The overarching goal of the research agenda proposed in this application is
to maintain CoFAR's position as an international leader in the study of food allergy, including optimal
characterization of the disease and development of the next generation of treatments ad prevention. The
research agenda will be based first and foremost on the best possible science, but to maximize productivity we
will also need to plan judiciously so that all available resources can be used to their utmost capacity. Therefore,
the research agenda will need to carefully select and stage protocols based not just on their potential to advance
the field, but also with careful consideration regarding other novel treatments that may be under development,
and how one study may inform the next. Finally, the overall research strategy will need to work in unison with
the NIAID, the SACCC and each CRC in the consortium.
This overall agenda will be accomplished through the following major components: 1) To implement a leadership
team capable of providing optimal administration of the Consortium, including financial, operational, and
managerial aspects, as well as protocol development and implementation, data collection and analysis, and
publications and presentations, with judicious financial management. Dr. Robert Wood will lead this team, with
co-PIs Drs. Scott Sicherer and Supinda Bunyavanich. The team will include experts in clinical trials as well as
the laboratory study of food allergy. The team will also include a financial administrator as well as a highly
experienced grants management group at Johns Hopkins. The leadership team will work closely with the NIAID
and SACCC, together providing day-to-day management of all clinical operations within the consortium. 2) To
develop the necessary committee structure to guide and implement the Consortium's administrative and clinical
operations. 3) To develop a structure of financial management that will make optimal use of all CoFAR funds
and resources. 4) To integrate the Biomarker Facility into each clinical protocol.
It is anticipated that a minimum of 2 major protocols, including both clinical trials and non-interventional studies,
will be initiated and completed over the seven-year funding period, and this could rise to 4 or even 5 protocols
depending on the size, duration, and complexity of each study. If successful, this research agenda will define
not just the next 7 years of CoFAR, but will also establish the platform for the next decade(s) of food allergy
research."
10867176,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
The Administrative Core plays a vital role in the UCSD ADRC by providing scientific leadership, fiscal
management, operations oversight, and administrative support to the Center's Cores and training program. Its
primary objective is to ensure effective coordination and collaboration among the various components of the
Center. The specific aims of the Administrative Core include 1) maintaining an effective leadership team, 2)
fostering strong and cohesive Cores, 3) supporting partnerships and cross-center initiatives, 4) coordinating
programs for Developmental Projects and REC scholars, 5) interacting with advisory committees and program
officers, 6) overseeing data transmission and sample distribution, 7) providing fiscal and staff management,
and 8) communicating ADRC activities and research findings to relevant stakeholders. By fulfilling these aims,
the Administrative Core promotes the Center's mission and theme while supporting integration across
departments, scientists, and community partners. It guides the overall priorities and facilitates interactions to
advance Center goals and ensure resources are allocated appropriately. Fiscal management is a key aspect,
providing for efficient use of resources and amplifying productivity and innovation in priority scientific areas.
Additionally, the Administrative Core plays a role in selecting and awarding development research and training
grants, promoting collaboration among clinicians and researchers across UCSD and other outstanding local
and national research institutions. The Administrative Core also works closely with the ORE core in ensuring
efficient dissemination of the latest research findings and opportunities for engagement with the UCSD ADRC,
informing the broader community about the Center's work and encouraging involvement.
Overall, the Administrative Core serves as a critical component of the UCSD ADRC, facilitating the effective
functioning of the Center and promoting its mission of advancing Alzheimer's disease and related dementias
research."
10867177,"The Clinical Core will support the ADRC’s objectives by maintaining about 500 research participants,
who agree to longitudinal follow-up and undergo a detailed evaluation every year. The research participants
include people who have no cognitive problems and are aged 65 or older (healthy controls), people with mild
cognitive symptoms (Mild Cognitive Impairment, or MCI) and people with Alzheimer’s Disease, other
neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Dementia with Lewy Bodies or Frontotemporal Dementia) or vascular
cognitive impairment. Participants are recruited from across San Diego County and from neighboring parts of
Orange and Riverside Counties. At least 20% of the cohort will be Latino, supporting diversity among the
cohort and a research focus of the Center on better understanding risk and protective factors for AD and
related disorders among Latinos, the second largest ethnic group in San Diego. The evaluation includes history
of cognition, behavior and function, medical and family history and medications. A general and neurological
examination is performed. Participants undergo neuropsychological testing of memory and other cognitive
abilities. Blood is drawn for routine laboratory tests and to prepare samples for measurement of biomarkers
and for DNA analysis. Participants undergo brain imaging by MRI, and some will also have PET scans of the
brain to assess for accumulation of the amyloid and tau proteins. If they agree, participants will also undergo a
research lumbar puncture, where cerebrospinal fluid is removed for testing and to support research. Data
generated from all of these procedures and studies is entered into the ADRC database. The ADRC research
team reviews all the clinical and cognitive data to make an initial clinical diagnosis. They then assess CSF,
brain imaging and blood biomarkers to determine whether Alzheimer’s Disease or other disorders may be
present and account for the participant’s symptoms. Participants are approached to donate their brains at the
time of death to support further research.
 Data from the annual assessments are shared with the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center
(NACC), plasma and DNA are shared with the National Central Repository for Alzheimer’s Disease (NCRAD)
and brain images are shared with the SCAN project; this sharing makes UCSD data, samples and images
available to support large scale research across the national ADRC network. ADRC participants are also
offered participation in additional research projects with collaborators at UCSD."
10867178,"The Database Management and Statistics Core provides a secure database infrastructure to support the
acquisition, storage, and transmission of research data generated by the Center, and provides biostatistical
consulting and analysis support to Center investigators and others accessing these data for research
purposes. We maintain a recruitment and operations database used to monitor all contacts with participants
and potential participants in cohort studies and clinical trials. We maintain a secure, web-based, relational
database with PostgreSQL backend and PHP front end for input, storage, and retrieval of clinical and
research data generated by the Center. We use provided web-based tools to support all National Alzheimer’s
Coordinating Center data sharing initiatives. Biostatistics faculty and an M.S. biostatistician provide statistical
consultation and programming support using the statistical programming language R. Graduate students,
post-doctoral appointees, and early stage faculty are mentored in Alzheimer’s disease research and statistical
research methods via hands on collaborative production of manuscripts for peer-reviewed publication."
10867179,"The focus of this Neuropathology (NP) Core renewal is to collaborate with other Center Cores to achieve
specific aims related to ADRD nervous system tissue acquisition, pathologic diagnosis, and research
utilization and distribution. Our Core endeavors to advance understanding of neurodegenerative disease
mechanisms by utilizing innovative approaches including multi-omic studies, collaborating with other Cores,
and emphasizing study of diverse populations. The first aim of the NP Core is to perform tissue autopsy on
diverse populations and disease states, with a continued focus on increasing the diversity of the patient
cohort who receives detailed neuropathologic evaluations, particularly Latino participants. We will also
prioritize collection of healthy control cases and cases with early-stage pathology. We have prioritized both
of these populations at our Center and continue to increase the proportion of autopsies from these groups.
Second, we will perform comprehensive neuropathological analysis and diagnosis according to the National
Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) NP Form 11 Guidelines using detailed H&E and immunostaining
analysis (tau, Abeta, alpha-synuclein, and TDP-43) with data uploaded to the NACC database for sharing.
Third, the NP Core will continue its onsite and collaborative research efforts to understand the mechanisms
underlying neuropathologic heterogeneity and the co-occurrence of multiple pathologies. This will involve
distributing banked tissue to researchers outside of our Center and, within our Center, leveraging the
synergy between robust clinical neuropsychological studies, expertise in digital pathology, and ongoing
collaborations utilizing RT-QuIC. Fourth, the NP Core places a strong emphasis on mentoring the next
generation of NP researchers, particularly young and underrepresented scientists. We will provide
resources and training opportunities, including access to ADRC tissue and core resources, to support their
research and development, in collaboration with our REC core. Finally, the NP Core aims to advance novel
molecular approaches using postmortem tissue, specifically focusing on cell type-specific multi-omics
transcriptomics. We will integrate post-mortem transcriptomic data with data from neuronal models
developed by their iPSC Core, including direct-induced neurons and iPSC-neurons. In summary, the NP
Core's specific aims focus on performing tissue autopsies, executing comprehensive neuropathological
analysis, managing and sharing specimen resources, mentoring young researchers, and advancing novel
molecular approaches. These objectives collectively contribute to the Core's mission of advancing the
understanding of neurodegenerative diseases and fostering the development of future neuropathologists
and neuroscientists."
10867180,"Inability to efficiently recruit sufficient numbers of participants in observational studies and clinical trials
slows progress in understanding Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and developing effective treatments. This
problem is particularly acute in historically underrepresented groups leading to a lack of diversity and
inclusiveness in research that may mask disease heterogeneity (both clinical and neuropathological), limit
generalizability of results, and inhibit the development of treatments that are effective, safe, and available
for all people.
 The goals of the Shiley-Marcos Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) Outreach, Recruitment
and Engagement (ORE) Core are to meet the recruitment needs of the ADRC and affiliated studies through
broad community outreach that provides education about AD and related disorders (ADRD) and presents
opportunities for participation in research, with a particular focus on the large, underserved Latino
population in our region. The ORE Core also strives to maintain engagement with those participating in
ADRD research to maximize retention. To achieve these goals, the ORE Core will 1) develop and
implement sustainable strategies for recruitment of research participants and study partners, ensuring
participation from underrepresented groups and those with reduced healthcare access; 2) provide outreach
to educate community members, community organizations, and local healthcare professionals about ADRD,
the importance of ADRD research, and resources provided by the ADRC; 3) implement methods to engage
current and potential ADRC participants (e.g., identify factors that might increase acceptability of ADRD
research procedures such as autopsy), and to engage students at all levels of education to support the next
generation of individuals working in neuroscience-related careers, and 4) track the success of recruitment,
outreach and engagement activities using defined metrics and recruitment science procedures to assess
the relative value of various strategies. Methods will build upon our prior success in recruiting and retaining
diverse participants in the ADRC longitudinal study and volunteer registry through community-based
memory screening, partnerships with neurology clinics (including those with a large underrepresented
patient base), lay and professional educational activities, quality-of-life programs (e.g., support groups), and
timely dissemination of information on ADRD research, treatment advances and ADRC resources via our
website, newsletters, and social media. With input from key community partners, these efforts will occur in a
manner that is culturally sensitive and appropriate for individuals from diverse groups who may have low
literacy or English as a second language."
10904991,"Project Summary/Abstract
Preschool anxiety, while prevalent and impairing, is an imperfect predictor of future outcomes. For example,
longitudinal data suggest that anxiety disorders in preschool predict not just future anxiety but also other
internalizing disorders and comorbid disruptive behavior in adolescence. Similarly, early adversity increases
risk for many forms of adolescent psychopathology. Using our current methods we cannot identify which
preschool children will go on to acquire which disorders in adolescence. This is in part because most models
focus primarily on continuity within diagnoses as opposed to transdiagnostic risk factors and in the case of
adversity, on the number rather than character of adverse childhood experiences. The current proposal tests a
novel conceptual model focused on the type of adverse exposure, which differentiates two primary dimensions
of experience underlying multiple forms of adversity: deprivation and threat. Interpersonal violence or threat
and decreased cognitive and social inputs or deprivation are differentiated by the kind of experiences children
have and by the impact of those experiences on neural and cognitive function. Thus, this model of adversity
allows a focus on transdiagnostic risk factors. Importantly, the neural pathways linked to deprivation and threat
are the same neural circuits known to be disrupted in early anxiety disorders. Given this shared neural risk we
expect that early adversity and anxiety will interact to increase risk for psychopathology in adolescence. We
also expect further moderation by other preschool diagnoses (e.g., ODD, ADHD). These neural pathways may
be the ‘missing link’ between preschool anxiety and adolescent psychopathology. To address this knowledge
gap, we propose following a group of adolescents (now aged 15-17 years; N=502) who were first assessed in
preschool (ages 2–5 years). A subsample of these children (N=93) underwent structural and functional imaging
up to 3 times between 5-10 years of age. This innovative, cost-effective proposal will provide an unparalleled
opportunity to answer central questions about the trajectory of neurodevelopmental processes linking early risk
to specific forms of adolescent psychopathology in a highly vulnerable population. The proposed research
directly addresses Objectives 1 and 2 of the NIMH strategic plan."
10900922,"Project Summary
Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) has emerged as a promising therapy for cardiac arrhythmia by electrical
stimulation of vagal nerve at the cervical level. Direct VNS achieves its antiarrhythmic effects through increasing
efferent parasympathetic input to the heart. However, patients receiving VNS have reported severe side effects,
which are due to off-target stimulation of non-cardiac vagal branches. Cholinergic activation using
pharmacological approaches also resulted in serious adverse events due to lack of organ specificity. Increasing
vagal efferent input to the heart by targeting cardiac vagal postganglionic (CVP) neurons alone would be ideal
to minimize the off-target effects and to achieve precision of parasympathetic activation for anti-arrhythmia. Here,
we will introduce a miniaturized bio-optoelectronic implant that avoids limitations of VNS and pharmacological
approaches by using optogenetics to treat fatal ventricular arrhythmias in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Comparing with electrical and pharmacological approaches, optogenetics provides higher speed and accuracy
in regulation of living cell function with less complications. However, a strategy of optogenetic therapy on
ventricular arrhythmias in T2DM has not yet been established. Withdrawal of cardiac vagal activity is associated
with ventricular arrhythmias-related sudden cardiac death and with high mortality in T2DM patients. Patients with
T2DM are two to four times more likely to die from myocardial infarction (MI), compared with non-diabetic
patients. Our recent study confirmed that reduction of cell excitability in CVP neurons exacerbates MI-evoked
ventricular arrhythmias and mortality in T2DM animals. Considering the advantages of optogenetics including
rapid, specific control of neuronal activities by light-sensitive opsins, adeno-associated virus-channelrhodopsin-
2 (AAV-ChAT-ChR2-mcherry) will be transfected into CVP neurons in T2DM animals. Specificity of neuronal
expression of ChR2 (an excitatory light-sensitive opsin) in CVP neurons will be achieved by linking the choline
acetyltransferase (ChAT, a specific marker of cholinergic neurons) promoter to the ChR2 gene. Continual
optogenetic stimulation in CVP neurons will be achieved by illuminating a light-emitting-diodes (LED) probe that
is controlled and powered wirelessly in freely moving animals. We hypothesize that optogenetic therapy could
restore cell excitability of CVP neurons and acetylcholine (ACh) release from cardiac vagal nerve
terminals, further improve vagal control of ventricular function and reduce acute MI-evoked ventricular
arrhythmias and high mortality in T2DM. To test this hypothesis, we will determine if optogenetic restoration
in CVP neuronal excitability restores ACh release from cardiac vagal nerve terminals, improves vagal control of
ventricular function, and reduces MI-evoked fatal ventricular arrhythmias and high mortality in T2DM animals.
This proposal will establish the first evidence of the optogenetic therapy on MI-evoked ventricular arrhythmias
and mortality in T2DM, and may provide a new therapeutic strategy for improving outcomes and quality of life in
T2DM patients."

 The choroid plexus is a structure that extends from the walls of the brain’s four ventricles, floating in the
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It is thought to be the source of CSF and thus play a role in controlling the content and
volume of the fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord. However, it is unknown whether the choroid plexus can
sense CSF flow or hydrostatic pressure in the ventricles and how it might use this information to modulate CSF
production. The combination of CSF, brain, and blood volumes determine intracranial pressure (ICP), and
changes in one of these parameters typically leads to compensatory changes in one or both of the other two. In
the absence of these compensatory mechanisms, ICP can increase past the normal range, leading to
headaches, seizures, neural damage, and in extreme cases, death. Pathological ICP levels occur in several
neurological injuries and diseases (traumatic brain injury, stroke, hemorrhage, tumor, hydrocephalus, and during
seizures). Thus, understanding the mechanisms underlying ICP sensation and compensation could inform
therapeutic strategies for handling dysregulated ICP across multiple neuropathologies. This proposal aims to
investigate mechanosensation at the choroid plexus with the overarching goal of understanding ICP dynamics
in health and disease.
 PIEZO1 is a cation channel activated by mechanical stimuli. It is expressed in choroid plexus epithelial
cells (CPECs), the cell type thought to be responsible for CSF production, but its role there is entirely unknown.
Remarkably, I found that conditional knockout of Piezo1 from CPECs increases seizure susceptibility in mice in
the context of kainic acid-induced neuronal hyperactivity. This proposal will test what stimuli activate PIEZO1 in
CPECs and how this signal might be used to regulate and stabilize ICP. More specifically, I will use
electrophysiology and calcium imaging in primary cell culture and choroid plexus explants to characterize
PIEZO1 activity in CPECs. I will also assess ICP dynamics after manipulation of CSF volume and neuronal
activity in control mice and those lacking Piezo1 in CPECs. Finally, I will explore the downstream effects of
activating PIEZO1 in CPECs, and I will test whether increasing CSF clearance at the choroid plexus might
ameliorate seizure severity in the absence of choroid plexus PIEZO1. Together, the results from these
experiments will contribute to our understanding of how the choroid plexus senses and regulates ICP. This
knowledge could help inform how ICP dysregulation is treated in the context of neurological diseases including
stroke and traumatic brain injury."
10866233,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Depression affects at least one in every six people, and identifying targetable risk factors is urgently needed to
facilitate early intervention and prevention. The literature and the applicant's pilot studies suggesting the
neurotropic herpes virus, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, is capable of inducing neuroinflammation,
which has been established as an important factor that contributes to the development of depression in
vulnerable individuals. The objective for the proposed K01 award is to use CMV infection as a model to
develop a comprehensive understanding that CMV infection-associated neuroinflammatory mechanism
predicts disruption of frontotemporal circuitry and increased odds of depression. The applicant will use a
multifaceted approach to understand the potential neurobiological pathways that may increase the risk of
depression in individuals with CMV infection. This approach includes the use of existing blood-based
serological markers to determine CMV serostatus and antibody levels, diffusion-weighted neuroimaging to
assess brain microstructure integrity, polygenic score methods to prove host anti-CMV immunity, and
behavioral assessments to identify depression cases and matched controls, as well as depressive symptoms,
within the UK Biobank dataset. The proposed research aims to: (1) determine the associations between CMV
seropositivity, brain alterations, and depression using the largest serological sample so far; (2) investigate links
between genetic predisposition to CMV seropositivity, brain alterations, and depression; and (3) explore
genetically predicted inflammatory molecular pathways through which CMV infection may affect brain integrity
and depressive symptoms. This study will employ rigorous methods to elucidate the role of CMV in brain
alteration and depression, which can lead to an actionable target to mitigate neuroinflammation and reduce
depression risk. The innovative approach leverages polygenic scores to capture individual genetic differences
in host immunity, offering an opportunity to identify at-risk individuals and investigate the inflammatory
mechanisms involved. This Career Development Award builds upon the applicant's neuroimaging expertise
and prior research focus, and further provides training to: (1) bridge the knowledge gap on viral epidemiology
in the context of mental health; (2) refine the understanding of the disrupted brain circuits and their relationship
with the clinical symptoms of inflammation-associated depression; (3) apply statistical genetics to probe
individual differences in immunity; and (4) develop professional skills and transition to independence. The
proposed research and training will be mentored by a team of leading experts with diverse, complementary
expertise, ensuring successful outcomes. Upon completion of this award, the applicant will be well-prepared for
an independent research career in population immunopsychiatry, focusing to (1) gain a mechanistic
understanding of how neurotropic viral infection may confer risk for mood disorders; and (2) determine which
specific individuals are at risk for depression across the lifespan and the mechanisms of why they are at risk."
10869695,"Inflammatory skin diseases, such as psoriasis and allergic contact dermatitis, affect a large proportion of the
population. B cells that suppress inflammation, termed regulatory B cells (Breg), are key contributors to
homeostasis and to limiting inflammation at many sites, including the skin. IL-10 is an important regulatory
molecule used by Bregs to constrain T cell responses. The mechanisms used by Bregs to interact with their
target T cells have not been defined, and no approaches exist to modulate T cell effector functions in skin and
other sites via targeting of B cell properties. Our preliminary data show that IL-10+ Bregs express CXCL10, ligand
for the chemokine receptor CXCR3. Effector CD4 and CD8 T cells are the main cell types that express CXCR3
and chemotax toward CXCL10. We hypothesize that Bregs produce CXCL10 to ‘lure’ effector/memory T
cells into their vicinity and expose them to IL-10 and potentially other Breg molecules, resulting in
dampened T cell responses and decreased inflammation. Alternatively, CXCL10 expressed by effector B
cells may amplify the immune response through enhanced T cell recruitment and/or augmentation of T cell and
B cell activation by facilitating antigen-specific T-B interactions. To test our hypothesis, we propose two specific
aims: Aim 1 will test the role of B-cell expressed CXCL10 during skin inflammation using a mouse model with
inducible B-cell restricted CXCL10-deficiency. Under Aim 2 we will reveal the (IL-10+ and IL-10–) B cell subsets
that produce CXCL10 during skin inflammation as well as determine the effector and regulatory T cell subsets
attracted to skin B cell CXCL10. The gained knowledge will allow us to refine strategies to modulate cutaneous
T cell responses in inflammation, infection, and cancer through targeting B cell functions."
10869696,"Project Summary
During adolescence, friends meet more of youths’ relationship needs, including needs for support. Importantly,
despite hundreds of studies focused on same-gender friends, relatively few studies have considered cross-
gender friendships. Learning more about cross-gender friendships in adolescence, however, is important as the
prevalence of cross-gender friendships increases during adolescence. Moreover, better understanding cross-
gender friendships is especially important for girls because girls seem to be at a disadvantage in cross-gender
friendships. Specifically, boys perceive cross-gender friendships to be more supportive than do girls.
The gap in the literature is that the’ specific behaviors in cross-gender friendships associated with positive
perceptions of the friendships are unknown. This gap will be addressed in the proposed research by observing
60 cross-gender friend dyads (120 adolescents). Given the importance of social support to friendship, cross-
gender friends’ interactions will be observed in a context in which the adolescents disclose a problem and friends
have the opportunity to provide support (or not). Friends’ responses to adolescents’ disclosures about personal
problems will be coded into response categories. Some of these are engaged and positive (e.g., sharing a related
experience) and some are disengaged and negative (e.g., minimizing the problem). In a large study of same-
gender friendships, we found that girls produced more engaged/positive responses than boys and that receiving
engaged/positive responses from friends was associated with positive perceptions of the friendship. Gender
differences were not found for disengaged/negative responses and disengaged/negative responses were not
related to adolescents’ perceptions of the friendship,
The following hypotheses will be tested in the proposed research. Findings are expected to replicate previous
research indicating that boys perceive their cross-gender friendships more positively than do girls. In addition,
girls are expected to produce more positive/engaged responses to cross-gender friends’ disclosures than boys
(no hypothesis is put forth regarding gender differences in disengaged/negative strategies). Receiving
engaged/positive responses from cross-gender friends also is hypothesized to be related to perceptions of the
friendships as supportive and close (no hypotheses are put forth for disengaged/negative responses).
Importantly, a line of research that identifies specific behaviors in cross-gender friendships that are associated
with positive perceptions of the friendship could have significant applied implications for programs aimed at
promoting positive cross-gender interactions. Finally, the proposed research is innovative both in the focus on
cross-gender friendships and the application of a very detailed and nuanced coding system."
10870515,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While pulse oximetry is a standard of care that guides management of critically ill patients, there is growing
evidence that racial bias in pulse oximeter accuracy may overestimate oxygenation in hypoxic patients with
pigmented skin and cause harm by impeding escalation of respiratory support. Pulse oximeters noninvasively
estimate blood oxygenation (SpO2) and peripheral perfusion (perfusion index, PI) by detecting tissue absorption
of red and infrared LEDs. SpO2 is based on calibration via the modulation ratio R, the ratio of pulsatile and non-
pulsatile absorption from one LED divided by the ratio from the second LED, regressed against arterial blood
oxygenation (SaO2). Oxy- (HbO2) and deoxy-hemoglobin (Hb) have distinct absorption at these wavelengths
and because, unlike melanin, they exhibit pulsatile variation, it was assumed that SpO2 estimates based on the
pulsatile signal would be pigmentation-independent. Alarmingly this assumption appears to be invalid as recent
work has found that oximeters are more likely to provide falsely normoxemic SpO2 in hypoxemic patients if they
are darkly pigmented. Differences in melanin-related absorption and scattering, particularly at red wavelengths,
are thought to underly pigmentation-related errors in estimates of oxygenation, and likely also impact estimates
of perfusion. However, studies demonstrating pigmentation-related device error have not controlled for other
confounding physiologic factors that may impact pulse oximetry, and it is therefore not known if health
disparities faced disproportionately by people with pigmented skin may independently drive pulse oximeter
errors. Overcoming pigmentation-related pulse oximeter bias and decoupling it from other sources of oximeter
error is critically important to ensuring that darkly pigmented patients, who already face inequities in the health
care system, are not denied life-saving care due to devices that fail to meet the needs of a diverse population. To
solve these problems, we propose (i) utilizing novel experimental systems that allow pigmentation to be varied
while other physiologic parameters remain constant, and (ii) shift pulse oximeter wavelengths from red (with
high melanin absorption and scattering) to short-wave infrared (SWIR, 900-1700 nm) where melanin absorption
and scattering is minimized. Successful completion of the proposed studies will ensure that life-saving pulse
oximeter technology serves the needs of patients across the full spectrum of pigmentation and no longer fails an
already marginalized community."
10870517,"Mechanisms and dynamics of superinfection exclusion in microviral prophage populations
PROJECT SUMMARY
The Microviridae, small, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses that infect bacteria are among the most
abundant and stable colonizers of the human gut. Therefore, competition for host cells between lysogenic
microviruses is expected to be fierce. Hypervariable regions (HVRs) mediating prophage defense against other
viruses (superinfection exclusion, SiEx) as well as overcoming these defenses have evolved numerous times
concurrently with the evolution of lysogeny in different microviral lineages. We thus hypothesize that
microviruses have also evolved one or more entirely novel ways by which they prevent viral superinfections,
and that these mechanisms have profound influence on their genome dynamics. In addition, there is evidence
that these mechanisms might have been adapted by bacteria to become anti-phage defense systems. Our
project’s objectives are thus to understand a) the origin(s) of microviral SiEx and b) the influence of HVR
diversity on SiEx dynamics. To this end, we will compare the basic mechanisms of SiEx in independently
evolved microvirus prophages, a putative defense system, and potential SiEx-like mechanisms in lytic
microviruses that might have served as exaptations in prophage SiEx. Secondly, we will experimentally test the
effect of HVRs on SiEx, in particular whether specific mutations allow the avoidance of SiEx and how different
HVR types interact with each other. This will be done through synthesis of variants of the model microvirus
Enterogokushovirus carrying all known HVR types. Pairwise infection assays will then determine which HVRs
can block or overcome SiEx of other HVRs. This study will provide considerable insights into the biology of the
Microviridae and also insights into the influence of SiEx on the population dynamics of prophages in general.
Additionally, it will contribute to our growing knowledge of the arsenal of phage defense mechanisms in
bacteria."
10873317,"The broad goal of our proposed studies is to exploit our new insights into the molecular mechanisms and
physiological roles of CALHM1 and CALHM3 as components of a novel ion channel in taste perception. We
discovered CALHM1 as a membrane protein that expressed throughout the brain and in taste buds that lacks
significant homology to other proteins, although five homologs have been identified, and CALHM1 is
conserved across species. We identified CALHM1 as a pore-forming subunit of an ion channel with a large
pore diameter and gating regulation by voltage and extracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+o). We discovered that CALHM1 is
essential for perceptions of sweet, bitter and umami tastes by type II taste bud cells, since CALHM1-knockout
mice cannot perceive these tastants. We identified the essential role of CALHM1 by discovering that it is a
voltage-gated ATP-permeable ion channel, and that tastant-evoked Na+ action potentials trigger ATP release
as a neurotransmitter through CALHM1-associated channels to transduce taste information from the periphery
to the central nervous system. We further discovered that CALHM3 is an essential component of the native
voltage-gated ATP-release channel, contributing as a pore-forming subunit with CALHM1 to create a
heteromeric ATP-release channel in type II cells. Genetic deletion of CALHM3 also eliminates the ability of
mice to perceive sweet, bitter and umami substances. The molecular mechanisms and structural bases of ion
permeation and gating of CALHM channels are not understood despite their physiological importance. Nor is it
understood how integration of CALHM3 into a CALHM1/3 channel so strongly affects voltage-gated activation,
a key feature that allows CALHM1/3 channels to respond to action potentials. Temperature notably influences
taste perception with physiological and hedonistic implications, but the contribution of peripheral taste-transduction mechanisms to the effects of temperature on the perception and sensation of tastes is largely
unknown. We have discovered that temperature strikingly influences CALHM1/3 conductance as well as the
electrical excitability of type II cells. We will employ electrophysiology in native taste bud cells and
heterologous expression systems, mutagenesis, cryo-EM, and modeling to define the gating mechanisms of
CALHM1 and CALHM1/3 channels, how CALHM3 as a pore-forming subunit enhances voltage-gated
activation of CALHM1/3 channels, and how CALHM1/3 channels respond to action potentials evoked by
tastant stimulation over a wide range of temperatures. Using a novel mouse model in which CALHM1/3 in
taste bud cells has been engineered to have distinct temperature sensitivity, we will define how differential
effects of temperature on ATP-release channel gating and excitability may provide a mechanism for how a
temperature-sensitive channel in the peripheral gustatory system contributes to the influence of temperature
on taste sensitivity and perception."

The objective of this proposal is to establish a short-term summer research program for
American Indian medical students to work jointly with mentors at 10 National Institute on Alcohol
Abuse and Alcoholism-funded alcohol research centers and Oklahoma State University Center
for Health Sciences to conduct studies focused on making alcohol research more rigorous and
reproducible. A critical need exists to increase the number of American Indian
physician-scientists, and our institution — which has partnered with the Cherokee Nation to
establish the first and only tribally-affiliated medical school in the United States — is uniquely
suited for this program.
Matt Vassar, PhD, will lead this T-35 program. Dr. Vassar established and leads a highly
successful summer research program for medical students. Since its inception 4 years ago, this
program has directly produced 52 publications. Seventy-one percent of the medical students
who have completed the summer research program continue to be active in research following
program completion. Overall, Dr. Vassar’s student mentorship record includes 137 medical
students who have co-authored over 100 peer reviewed publications with him. Vassar will be
assisted by numerous medical school leaders with records of success in research, mentorship,
and administration. The program will also benefit from additional financial/administrative support
from the President and Dean of the Medical School, the Vice President for Research and Chief
Research Officer, and the Chair of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences.
We have an outstanding group of 52 program mentors for our AI medical students for 4 summer
students in year 1 and increasing to 6 students by year 5 of the grant. Students will receive
direct experience in research for 2 months, and these experiences include a one-week visitation
to the mentor’s research center to participate in team meetings and outreach activities and to
explore careers as physician-scientists. Additional contact (2 times per week) with the mentors
will occur over Oklahoma State University’s video conferencing technologies. Medical students
will participate in weekly didactic and case-based sessions provided by mentors from
participating research centers to learn about alcohol research, the responsible conduct of
research, and engaging in practices that promote rigor and reproducibility. The culminating
event of the program will be submitting all manuscripts for publication during an article
submission party. Program success will be monitored by longitudinal surveys of students and
mentors and through oversight by Internal and External Advisory committees."

The Pharmacological Sciences Training Program (PSTP) at Georgetown University Medical Center is new,
interdisciplinary and integrated program that will bring together an inclusive and diverse community of doctoral
candidates across Ph.D. disciplines who are dedicated to thesis research in pharmacological science. Faculty
mentors in the PSTP share major research strengths in identifying drug targets within cellular signaling pathways
to treat human disease. The 28 mentor and 11 preceptor faculty in the program all have a strong history of
mentorship and research programs in drug development for disease treatment with >$30 million in annual
research funding. Trainees in the program are drawn from Ph.D. programs in Pharmacology & Physiology,
Biochemistry, Tumor Biology, and Neuroscience. Trainees will prepare for future careers in academia, pharma
or biotechnology industry, or drug regulatory agencies. This application seeks annual funding for six predoctoral
students, providing a catalyst to bring together the four feeder programs, and would be the only NIGMS T32 at
GU. Trainees will enter the program in their second year of graduate school, will be supported for their second
and third years, and will have ongoing participation throughout the remainder of their degree. Trainees take a
comprehensive set of core courses in pharmacological sciences, physiological/biochemical principles integral to
pharmacology, and specialized electives in pharmacology relevant to their research. Recognizing the
interdisciplinary nature of pharmacological sciences, students will have additional exposure to bioinformatics,
molecular and cellular biology, and biostatistics that integrate pharmacology. Our courses take a wide view
ranging from cellular networks to organ function to behavior and systems medicine. Training will enhance their
understanding of drug mechanisms specific to their field of study and research, and enable them to characterize
novel drug targets and signaling pathways in disease. Both trainees and mentors will participate in structured
mentor training. During the period of support, all trainees will have two dedicated blocks for internships: one part-
time, semester-long placement will occur at Georgetown (e.g., regulatory affairs, technology commercialization);
the second block will be summer internship at a local partnering institution (biotech, government, foundations).
Thus, our trainees will gain broad exposure to transferable skills across career paths while developing their
research abilities. We have set program goals to include (1) achieving a 95% degree attainment within 5.5 years
of matriculation, (2) achieving 30% representation of underrepresented groups in our trainee pool, (3) achieving
100% participation of mentors and trainees in formal mentor training, (4) achieving four high-impact publications
per trainee, (5) achieve 75% job placement in pharmacology-related careers within two years of degree, (6)
continuing to expand our internship opportunities, and (7) increasing the adoption of best practices in graduate
admissions. We are committed to training the next generation of pharmacological scientists, building on the
strengths of Georgetown’s long track record of success in pharmacology."

Immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) can control intracranial disease in approximately 50% of patients with
melanoma brain metastases (MBM), which is the leading cause of death for these cancer patients - implicating
that immune microenvironment (IM) modulation can be therapeutic in the brain. There has been a paradigm shift
in clinical management wherein immunotherapy can be considered rather than traditional surgery and/or
radiation. However, there is a lack of preclinical models available that model the IM in patient MBM, which are
needed to test and improve immune therapies (IT). Our goal for this R03 proposal is to develop and test a patient
derived organoid model that mimics the IM found in patient MBM, which will have future applications in the
development and optimization of IT strategies. The development of this model will provide foundational data to
study cellular cross-talk in the IM of MBM, which will be the focus of a larger NCI R01. Our laboratory has
experience using ex vivo patient derived brain organoids from surgical samples for precision medicine assays
and drug screening. Our preliminary data derived from single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of patient MBM
samples demonstrates that CD8+ T cells in the parent tumor express exhaustion markers (i.e., PDCD1, CTLA4,
LAG3, and TIGIT) – supporting therapeutic strategies targeting T cell activation. Further, cell-cell communication
analyses of our scRNA-seq data suggests that cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the dominant cells
receiving T cell crosstalk in MBM - indicating that T cells modulate the extracellular matrix. We hypothesize that
patient derived organoid models need ECM to retain T cell characteristics of patient MBM and that an organoid
with ECM will provide an optimal model for testing IT strategies. The aims of this study are: 1.) To identify the T
cell phenotype in immunocompetent MBM organoids with and without ECM. 2.) To identify T cell phenotype
following ICI treatment in MBM organoids. The development of a preclinical, immunocompetent, ex vivo model
of MBM has yet to be accomplished and will facilitate the following innovations: i) establishment of biospecimen
workflow that will allow for preservation of tumor stroma and immune cells in brain metastasis organoids, ii)
identification of T cell-tumor cell interactions that can be targeted in the future, and iii) identification of biomarkers
of ICI efficacy in the brain. The innovations gained by this R03study will contribute to the lives of patients with
end stage melanoma as brain metastases is the leading cause of death in these patients. Our data will provide
a basis for a future NCI R01 application."

RNA modifiers coordinate essential steps of the mitochondrial ribosome assembly pathway; yet our
limited understanding of the signals controlling these RNA editing factors hinders our knowledge of how
these important regulators misshape the mitochondrial proteome in complex diseases. In mammals,
the RPUSD4 pseudouridine (Y) synthase collaborates with newly identified auxiliary factors to catalyze
pseudouridylation of mitochondrial ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Although the factors necessary for
mitochondrial rRNA pseudouridylation have been annotated, the molecular mechanisms by which the
Y synthase module exerts exquisite specificity towards assembling mitochondrial ribosomes is
unknown. Moreover, mounting evidence links dysregulated rRNA pseudouridylation to mitochondrial
genetic disorders, underscoring the importance of this underexplored RNA modification regulatory
network. To address these shortcomings, we will apply a cross-disciplinary program combining hybrid
structural biology, genomics, and biochemistry. This integrative approach will address critical questions
in mitochondrial RNA processing, including: 1) How does the RPUSD4 Y synthase exerts strict
specificity for its single rRNA modification site? 2) Why do mitochondrial disease-mutations dysregulate
the Y synthase module? 3) How does the Y synthase module recognize assembling ribosomes?
Defining the intricate molecular signals coordinating the fundamental process of rRNA
pseudouridylation will set a framework to launch innovative programs that exploit mitochondrial RNA
processing systems for the benefit of mitochondrial disease patients."
10873086,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Taste receptor cells (TRCs) are continually replaced from adult stem/progenitor cells, and the fidelity of this
process underlies the relative constancy of our sense of taste. However, a host of cancer therapies perturb
taste and we posit this is due to perturbation of taste cell renewal. The Wnt/ß-catenin and Hedgehog pathways
are implicated in scores of cancers, and many drugs have been and continue to be developed to target these
pathways in tumors; these drugs invariably cause taste dysfunction for patients. Subsets of taste stem cells
express the Wnt target gene Lgr5 and the Hedgehog target gene Gli1, and both Wnt and Hedgehog pathways
have been shown to regulate taste cell renewal in vivo. Thus, in the long term, understanding the functional
relationship of Wnt- and Hedgehog-sensitive stem cells in taste homeostasis, as proposed here, will shed light
on how these progenitors are disrupted by chemotherapeutics that cause taste dysfunction, and allow
development of strategies to mitigate dysgeusia. In our application, we propose to test explicit hypotheses of
the functional relationship of LGR5+ and GLI1+ stem cells in the circumvallate taste papillae of mice.
Hypothesis 1: Progenitors expressing high levels of LGR5 are slow cycling, multipotent stem cells that produce
rapidly proliferating GLI1+/LGR5low/neg progenitors that give rise directly to TRCs.
Hypothesis 2: Upon LGR5+ cell ablation, GLI1+ progenitors expand their potential to reconstitute circumvallate
epithelium and give rise to new LGR5+ stem cells.
To test these ideas, we combine in vivo molecular genetics, in vitro production of lingual organoids, and single
cell transcriptome profiling – all approaches with which we have become skilled. In Aim 1, we test the
competency of LGR5 vs GLI1 progenitors to produce taste cell-replete organoids, and further assess the
degree to which lineage production by each progenitor type is dependent upon Wnt signaling. In Aim 2, we
explore the capacity of GLI1+ progenitors to regenerate both taste cells and LGR5+ stem cells following genetic
ablation of LGR5+ cells. In Aim 3, we combine temporally fine-grained lineage tracing with single cell RNA
sequencing to transcriptomically define the cell lineages that continually produce each of the functional taste
cell types, i.e., glial-like cells and sweet, bitter, umami, salt and sour TRCs. In sum, our proposed studies will
lead to significant advances in our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that maintain our
sense of taste."
10873089,"Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the US with 5+ million diagnoses, over 27,000 lives lost
each year and the annual treatment costs of over $8 billion. The early diagnosis of skin cancer has a significant
and positive impact on patient outcomes and treatment costs but remains highly subjective and requires highly
specialized training that only dermatologists receive. Currently approved diagnostic devices have low
diagnostic accuracy which has prevented any significant adoption by clinicians. When a patient presents with a
suspicious skin lesion, uncertainty in the initial evaluation by a dermatologist often leads to biopsies that
suggest that no subsequent treatment is necessary while some lesions that are not biopsied do require urgent
treatment. False positives subject patients to unnecessary, invasive procedures (harms of scaring and wound
infections), reduce provider’s accessibility to other patients needing more urgent treatments and the health
care system to unnecessary costs. False negatives result in delayed treatment, adverse patient outcomes and
avoidable health care costs. This diagnostic problem is exacerbated when a patient first presents to a primary
care practice due to much lower diagnostic accuracy; here, some patients are referred unnecessarily to
dermatologists while many skin cancers go undetected. Overall, the lack of accurate, objective assessment
tool for frontline providers leads to preventable loss of lives and costs the US healthcare system over $3B each
year; monies that are unnecessarily wasted. The Veriskin’s TruScore device is a proprietary, non-invasive, low-
cost, easy-to-use, hand-held unit that supports the diagnosis of skin cancer. It rapidly and objectively
determines whether a suspicious skin lesion is malignant. The device provides a score of 0 to 100 indicating
the probability of malignancy. The TruScore device works by detecting and analyzing force-induced
hemodynamic abnormalities due to pathological angiogenesis which is a well-established early hallmark of
cancer. Pilot clinical studies indicate >99% sensitivity and >94% specificity in differentiating of skin cancer from
a variety of benign lesions. The TruScore device has been granted FDA’s Breakthrough Device Designation
Status in 2020.The device will be useful at all levels of care, but the greatest benefits to patients may result
when the device is used in primary care practice. The specific goal of this project is to perform a pivotal clinical
trial and receive FDA’s premarket approval for the TruScore device for use in both, primary care and
dermatology practices.
The long-term goal of the project is to achieve widespread clinical adoption of the simple-to-use and low-cost
non-invasive device for skin cancer detection that will: (1) improve patient outcomes by facilitating more
accurate and non-subjective assessment of suspect skin regions by non-expert clinicians, (2) enable precise
targeting of patients for biopsies and escalation of care and (3) reduce skin cancer treatment costs."
10873233,"Despite the benefits of a rapid, large-scale deployment of telemedicine in the US, making an accurate
diagnosis via telemedicine involves several potential challenges that warrant further study. Currently, it is not
well known how telemedicine implementation impacts ‘telediagnosis,’ defined as the co-production of an
accurate and timely explanation of a patient’s health problems through remote interactions and transmitted
data, including the clear communication of that explanation to the patient. But early evidence of telemedicine-
related misdiagnosis is already emerging even though the precise frequency of diagnostic errors related to
telemedicine visits and the factors that contribute to these diagnostic errors are unknown. Even before the
global pandemic, diagnostic errors were common and underreported in health care. The goal of this project is
to identify contributory factors for telediagnosis errors, develop methods to efficiently detect them, and enable
risk-assessment strategies to prevent them. We will first use qualitative methods to understand factors
increasing the risk of telediagnosis errors and identify what clues can be used to detect a telediagnosis error.
We will then use these findings to develop electronic triggers (e-triggers, i.e., tools to mine vast amounts of
clinical and administrative data to identify signals for likely adverse events) to identify telemedicine-related
diagnostic errors. We will thus build on our prior work on using e-trigger algorithms to detect patterns of care
suggestive of missed or delayed diagnoses. Review and analysis of e-trigger identified cases can uncover
safety concerns and provide information on breakdowns related to the diagnostic process and contributory
factors. This will generate learning and feedback for improvement efforts by individuals, teams, and healthcare
organizations. Finally, we will perform co-design workshops and use these findings to develop a self-
assessment tool for systems, providers, and patients to identify and mitigate the risk of telediagnosis errors.
The project will capitalize on our existing strong collaborative partnerships at Baylor College of Medicine and
the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and leverage databases containing electronic health records
(EHRs) from over 10 million individuals to accomplish the following specific aims.
Aim 1: Evaluate factors that increase the risk of telediagnosis errors using interviews with clinicians,
 staff, patient safety personnel, telemedicine experts and patients.
Aim 2: Develop e-triggers to identify telemedicine-related diagnostic errors and identify potential
 contributory factors.
Aim 3: Develop a self-assessment tool to evaluate the risk of telemedicine-related diagnostic errors.
A portfolio of e-triggers to identify errors can be used for quality improvement activities and implementation of
solutions to reduce error. The risk assessment tool will enable health systems, providers, and patients to self-
assess their risk for telediagnosis errors, and act prospectively to reduce such risks."

Recent decades have revealed the profound impacts that gut microbiota have on human
health. Far beyond being simply pathogenic vs benign, gut microbes impact a variety of
health and disease states, including metabolic, digestive, and mental health, as well as
propensity to cancer. Adding to the complexity, gut microbes can influence the
metabolism, and thereby action, of drugs developed to promote health and treat disease.
This suggests that many conditions would benefit from a more personalized treatment
plan that takes individual gut microbiota into account. Stratifying by microbial profile
may also benefit drug development, by removing a confounding variable in clinical trials.
The current standard method of measuring the gut microbiota is via fecal samples.
However, while convenient, inexpensive, and non-invasive, these samples do not
accurately reflect the details of gut communities. Up to a third of intestinal microbes can
be effectively absent from fecal samples, which also fail to preserve information about
spatial structure. Therefore, new measurement techniques are needed to more accurately
profile gut microbiota. Here, we will develop an innovative approach that uses living
biosensors to record extracellular DNA as they traverse the gut, preserving a record of
the internal microbial composition and spatial structure. This strategy relies on naturally
competent bacteria, which we recently used to detect DNA released from colorectal
tumors in vivo. The first two aims will develop complementary strategies to store
extracellular DNA, and the third will demonstrate them in mice. In Aim 1, we will store
snippets of environmental DNA in CRISPR arrays for later readout. This aim includes the
endogenous CRISPR-Cas system, as well as alternative systems that may be better suited
for the target DNA. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that environmental DNA can
instead be stored by casposases, which could allow storage of longer snippets. These two
aims serve as alternative approaches for each other, and both approaches will also encode
bio-spatial information in the order of recorded DNA sequences. In Aim 3, we will
validate the gut DNA recorder in vivo using mouse models of dysbiosis. This work will
develop highly innovative approaches, with risk appropriate for this mechanism and
ameliorated by multiple alternatives. The result of this work will be a novel diagnostic
technique that can record and measure the microbiota across the entire intestinal tract,
with no invasive prodedures required."

Adolescents with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have impaired exercise capacity and reduced quality
of life. Current therapies only modestly improve exercise capacity and are often prohibitively expensive,
highlighting the need for additional, cost-effective interventions. Multiple studies have demonstrated that
increasing physical activity is highly efficacious in adult PAH, resulting in six-minute walk distance (6MWD)
improvement that exceeds the effect of medications. However, protocols require inpatient rehabilitation,
making them impractical and poorly scalable to the adolescent PAH population. Moreover, cardiopulmonary
rehabilitation is poorly reimbursed, and facilities are not easily available or accommodating of adolescents.
Recently, in adults, we completed the first mobile health (mHealth) intervention in the PAH population,
demonstrating the effectiveness of linking real time activity tracking with a “smart” behavioral coaching
intervention, using personalized, encouraging content based in behavioral change theory (e.g. feedback loops
and habit formation). After 12 weeks, the intervention arm took 1019 more steps per day than the control arm
(adjusted for age, sex, functional class, and baseline step counts), with <5% dropout. In secondary analyses,
we observed significant improvements in quality of life (QOL) and right ventricular function. But, adolescents
may respond differently to remote real time activity monitoring and behavioral coaching, demanding
optimization of our approaches. We hypothesize that a mHealth intervention specifically designed for the
needs of an adolescent population with PAH is feasible and will increase daily step counts. We propose a
randomized pilot trial of smart texts versus usual care for 12 weeks using personalized, adaptive step count
targets and text messages that leverage age-appropriate behavioral psychology. Using a fully remote study
without in-person visits, 50 participants will wear a Fitbit device and be randomized 1:1 to the mHealth
intervention or usual care. Aim 1 will adapt our successful PAH-focused mHealth approach to the
developmental needs and interests of adolescents. Participant, caregiver, and community feedback will be
used to optimize our resource of smart text messages for study communication. In Aim 2, we will test the
feasibility of a mHealth intervention to increase step counts in adolescents with PAH. Secondary endpoints will
include measures of QOL for the adolescent and caregiver(s), activity duration and intensity, right ventricular
function, as well as fidelity of text and data transmission. The goals of this proposal are to 1) develop and
refine an adolescent-focused mHealth intervention for PAH and 2) obtain the feasibility and preliminary data
needed to conduct a large, multi-center R01-funded trial across the U.S. with our Pediatric Network
collaborators, which will be submitted for consideration during the last year of this award."

Breast cancer (BC) is the second most common cancer diagnosed in American women and the second leading
cause of cancer death for women in general. Compared to Caucasian American (CA) women, African American
(AA) women display an earlier onset of BC and have a significantly higher mortality rate. While the role of societal
factors for the poorer outcome of AA women with BC is well-established, the biological factors that mediate BC
racial disparities remain largely unknown. In our preliminary studies, we identified that lipolysis-stimulated
lipoprotein receptor (LSR) was expressed at the highest levels in African American BC cells, especially in triple
negative BC (TNBC). We also developed a tumor specific anti-LSR antibody, tested multiple small molecules
showing high toxicity, and established LSR targeting antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) construction and
evaluation procedures. Our central hypothesis is that the anti-LSR ADCs-based therapy can effectively inhibit
TNBC growth with a limited side effect, especially in AA patients. In this study, we propose to develop targeted
therapies for curative treatment of AA TNBC. Aim 1, we will examine the expression profile and
genetic/epigenetic alterations of LSR in BC tissues between AA and CA patients. We will also assess the
differences among the localized, regional and distant tumor stages and the correlation between LSR expression
and genetic/epigenetic alteration. Aim 2, we aim to build an effective platform of ADC-based targeted therapies
to treat TNBC, and to identify the most efficient anti-LSR ADC strategy by investigating the targeting specificity,
anti-TNBC efficacy, anti-LSR mAb-induced suppression of lipid metabolism, and various ADCs-mediated anti-
tumor effects. Aim 3, we aim to use our established protocols of maximal tolerated dose, pharmacokinetics,
biodistribution and anti-tumor toxicity to evaluate the therapeutic value of our LSR targeting ADCs in syngeneic
4T1 TNBC xenograft models and preclinical patient-derived xenograft TNBC models after surgery and/or
chemotherapy. If the anti-cancer efficacy is confirmed in the preclinical models, then it will enhance cytotoxicity
to tumor cells with low dose and limit systemic toxicities. Importantly, our proposed work will improve life quality
and the survival rate of TNBC patients, especially AA patients, by combining with surgery and/or chemotherapy."

This new application for an institutional T32 program is designed to provide advanced translational
research training on Alzheimer's disease and AD related dementias (ADRD). This proposal builds
on the outstanding research and training environment of UCSD and participating neighboring
institutions (The Salk Institute, Sanford-Burnham-Prebys Institute, and The Scripps Research
Institute) as well as leveraging the resources of the UCSD Alzheimer's Disease Research Center,
the AD Collaborative Study, and other affiliated programs. To take advantage of the unique
opportunities of our research community, we will offer focused but also multidisciplinary
approaches to training four pre- and four postdoctoral (MD, PhD, or MD/PhD) trainees to prepare
them to tackle the challenges of ADRD due to population aging. The program has three key
features: 1. Academic bridging - A principal focus will be to provide the predoctoral students
and postdoctoral fellows with concepts and research tools necessary to address issues at the
interfaces of basic, translational, and clinical questions in ADRD research. This bridging will be
reflected in the diverse interests and expertise of the participating faculty, the nature of the
projects proposed by the trainees, and the training plan itself which includes formal didactic
teaching and less formal seminars, journal clubs, interactive sessions with faculty, and scientific
retreat. 2. Multidisciplinary Approach - By its very nature, neurosciences is a multidisciplinary
field of investigation. The training faculty brings to this Program expertise, experience, and
technical knowledge in a variety of approaches and disciplines. Our goal is to train future
investigators who are to work and think effectively in several of these areas. This will be achieved
by choosing the best faculty, by bringing together trainees and mentors who are open to
interdisciplinary exchange of ideas and approaches, and providing them a forum for instruction,
discussions, and interactions. In addition, we hope to draw into the ADRD community faculty
members who have recently expanded their research efforts into ADRD or who have expertise in
related areas or in technologies that can expand the scope of ADRD research. 3. Mentorship –
An integral aspect proposed for this Training Program is the attention to mentorship. In addition
to the trainee's own research mentor/supervisor, each trainee will select a co-sponsor chosen to
provide more multidisciplinary input and oversight into his/her research. Junior faculty members
will also be assigned a mentor chosen from the Executive Committee of the Training Program to
provide advice and support in order to advance their academic trajectory and enhance the
success of their laboratory trainees."

There has been more than a 30% increase in opioid overdose deaths in the last year. Bystander access to
naloxone medication effectively reverses opioid overdose deaths with limited adverse events. However, current
naloxone distribution strategies are missing individuals at high risk of opioid overdose. Vending machines are
an innovative strategy shown to increase reach of harm reduction services in Europe. Young adults who
witnessed or experienced an opioid overdose expressed a desire for naloxone vending machines but identified
features of the built environment (including safety and location) as perceived factors contributing to use. There
is widespread interest in naloxone vending machines in the U.S. Yet, implementation challenges have slowed
down or limited adoption including navigating stakeholder approvals and identifying appropriate locations for
placement. The aim of this proposal is to study a community-initiated, stakeholder engaged adaptation of
naloxone distribution, VEnding machine Naloxone Distribution for Your community (VENDY), to increase the
reach of naloxone in underserved populations at-risk of opioid overdose. Study Aims include:
 Aim 1: To refine the VENDY program in 3 underserved communities (2 urban and 1 rural) using an
 iterative user centered design (UCD) implementation strategy and stakeholder engagement to increase
 reach, implementation, and sustainability. We will use iterative usability and message testing to refine the
 program with community members who misuse opioids. We will conduct surveys and qualitative interviews
 with stakeholder to refine the UCD implementation strategy for future use.
 Aim 2: Conduct a 6 month pilot assessment of the VENDY program in 2 urban and 1 rural community.
 The pilot includes a midcourse adaptation and evaluation of reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation
 and maintenance (RE-AIM) outcomes.
 Aim 3: Identify factors in the social and built environment contributing to reach and implementation of the
 VENDY program using photovoice qualitative evaluations with organization implementers and community
 members currently using opioids. Photovoice evaluations will occur in potential locations in Aim 1 to inform
 VENDY placement and in the VENDY location in Aim 2 to inform stakeholder adaptations.
Community-based approaches such as VENDY are particularly important to reach opioid users not currently
engaged with health systems. To accomplish these aims, Dr. Wagner will pursue training in 1) user centered
design, an innovative implementation strategy, 2) conduct of pragmatic trials in diverse settings, and 3)
assessment of the built and social environment and its effect on reach and implementation. This mentored
research project and career development plan are designed to prepare Dr. Wagner to become a leader in the
adaptation of effective interventions addressing substance use to better reach underserved populations and to
produce sustainable implementation models."
10873836,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tetherin, also known as BST-2 or CD317, is an interferon-inducible transmembrane protein that inhibits the
detachment of enveloped viruses from infected cells. Under conditions of interferon-induction, tetherin is
upregulated on virus-infected cells and captures nascent virions as they attempt to bud from the cell surface.
Whereas most simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) use Nef to oppose the tetherin proteins of their
nonhuman primate hosts, HIV-1 Vpu and HIV-2 Env have acquired the ability to counteract human tetherin
because of the absence of a five amino acid sequence in human tetherin that confers susceptibility to Nef. We
previously demonstrated that tetherin antagonism by Vpu protects HIV-infected cells from antibody-dependent
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). We now show that the anti-tetherin activity of Vpu also protects HIV-infected cells
from antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). These findings imply that by trapping virions on the
cell surface, tetherin increases the sensitivity of HIV-infected cells to Fc-mediated antibody responses, and that
the antiviral activity of tetherin may be much greater in vivo than previously appreciated. The current proposal
builds on these studies to address the overarching hypothesis that tetherin serves as link between innate and
adaptive immunity to enhance the susceptibility of virus-infected cells to antibodies.
In Aim 1, we will determine the immunological mechanisms by which tetherin enhances antibody-mediated
phagocytosis of HIV-infected cells. These studies will focus on the factors that influence the extent to which
tetherin can promote ADCP, which will provide a better understanding of how to use these interactions to
improve antibody-based treatments for HIV-1 infection. In Aim 2, we will take advantage of the power of SIV
infection of the rhesus macaque as an animal model to assess the contribution of viral countermeasures to
tetherin and SERINC5 to lentiviral replication and pathogenesis. These studies will reveal the impact of tetherin
and SERINC5 on lentiviral infection and the therapeutic benefit that may be derived from antiretroviral drugs
designed to increase the sensitivity of HIV-1 to these restriction factors. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis
that tetherin enhances antibody-mediated control of virus replication in SIV-infected macaques. These studies
are fundamental to our basic understanding of the synergy between tetherin and antibodies and the potential to
exploit these interactions for the treatment and prevention of HIV-1 infection."

The Biochemistry, Molecular and Cellular Biology (BMCB) graduate program at the University of Arizona is an
interdepartmental and interdisciplinary graduate program that seeks to equip students with a broad
understanding of modern approaches in Biochemistry, Molecular and Cellular Biology, and Systems/
Quantitative Biology, and the way these approaches can be combined to tackle important unsolved problems in
Biology and Medicine. To achieve this goal, we focus on ensuring our students develop eight interrelated skills:
(1) A broad knowledge of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and System/Quantitative Biology; (2) A broad
interdisciplinary knowledge of experimental/computational approaches; (3) An ability to communicate (and thus
think) clearly; (4) An ability to read, evaluate and integrate the scientific literature (5) A deep knowledge in the
field of thesis research; (6) An ability to plan and execute experiments; (7) An ability to generate new insights
and ideas; (8) An ability to recognize important research problems and questions. Students start developing
their foundational skills (1-5) in first year classes; using group work to study key literature, build up their
understanding of experimental methods and approaches, and develop good communication skills. At the same
time, students do three eight-week rotations to learn the intricacies of experimentation and identify a suitable
faculty mentor. Then, as students start their second year, they enroll in a Scientific Communication course,
where they are guided though the process of developing their thesis project, writing it up and submitting it as a
fellowship, and presenting it in oral form. Starting in Fall 2019, our students will also take a Quantitative Methods
course at the start of their second year, where they will learn to program in R, carry out a range of statistical
tests, and then use those skills to analyze images, movies, and large Omics datasets (helping with the rigor and
reproducibility of their future research). Students then move on to their Oral and Written exams and begin
focusing on their thesis project. At the same time, however, they continue to participate in a number of activities
designed to help them refine their skills, remain connected to the BMCB community, and identify and secure a
career that works for them. The most important of these are: (1) a new Journal Club and associated Idea
Development Workshop that provides students multiple opportunities to develop and refine new ideas and
questions each semester; and (2) “Student Only” retreats, career development workshops, and a BMCB
internship program, that expose students to a wide variety of professions and help them make the contacts they
need to move forward in their career. To help support these activities, we are requesting funds to cover the
costs of eight BMCB students per year, approximately 1/3 of our TGE students. Students will be appointed to
the training grant for one, or subject to renewal, two years; preferably in their second and third year. Our
expectation is that ~90% of students that enter the BMCB program will graduate and go on to have a career in
Biological or Biomedical research--regardless of their gender or race--a goal we have met for the last 10 years."

 The etiology of aging and age-related disease is poorly understood. Over the past 3 decades, there have
been impressive advances in our understanding of the critical role of aging in the development of many diseases
that limit quality of life. Aging and diseases associated with age clearly result in dependence and a severe
reduction in health-span; however, without a clear understanding of the interactions between aging and disease,
effective therapies cannot be developed. Our training program in GeroScience was initiated in 2017 as a new
approach to training the next generation of researchers to address the complex causes of aging and their
interactions with age-related disease. We originally requested support for 3 pre-doctoral and 4 post-doctoral
fellows for 16 faculty. Over the last 4 years, the program has leveraged this support to train a total of 8 pre-
doctoral trainees and 9 post-doctoral trainees. The total number of trainees during this initial funding period will
continue to expand in the -05 year of the program. It is particularly important to note that as our trainees are
accepted to the T32 program, they undergo a rigorous training plan and are required to write grant applications
to support their proposed research. Importantly, trainees that rotate off our T32 due to the funding of their Federal
or Association sponsored awards continue to participate in, and benefit from, the overall training program that
we have established. Similarly, our mentors are recertified each year and we have developed a program to train
young mentors. Predoctoral Students: Of the 8 pre-doctoral students that have entered our program, seven (7)
are on-track or have completed their PhD. Seventy-five percent (75%) of the pre-doctoral students (6) have
written grant applications and, of those submitting applications, 100% have been funded. Importantly, these are
primarily F31, R36, and AHA grants. These trainees have produced 4.12 publications to date. Post-Doctoral
Fellows: Of the nine (9) post-doctoral candidates, seven (7) fellows have submitted grants thus far and, of these,
57% have received funding. The trainees average 8.91 publications to date. The vast majority of our students
have won local and national awards for their presentations. Those that have graduated have found employment
in both academic and pharmaceutical environments. Based on our level of success, current census and plans
for continued expansion of our program, we have increased our mentoring faculty to 21 and are requesting 4
graduate and 4 post-doctoral trainee positions to continue our training in GeroScience."

Over 700,000 people live with a primary brain tumor in the United States. Maximally safe surgical resection is
the single most important initial predictor of quality of life and overall survival. To this end, the surgeon maximizes
the extent of tumor resection (EOR) while preserving function. Preserving the integrity of white matter tracts
(WMT) during brain tumor surgery is a necessary requirement to preserve function. However, the absence of a
clear boundary between functioning WMTs and tumor tissue poses a significant challenge for the neurosurgeon.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tractography provides the surgeon with preoperative images of WMTs to
help predict their location. Intraoperatively, the surgeon can use tractography images with image-guidance to
maximize preservation of WMT integrity, which has been shown to enable faster and safer surgeries, improved
functional outcomes, and increased EOR. However, MRI tractography has practical limitations as a surgical aid
for preserving WMT integrity. First, WMT reconstruction can be inaccurate and imprecise due to algorithm
variability, user determined thresholds, variable tractographer expertise, and quality of MRI data, which leads to
false positives and false negatives. In brain tumors, this challenge is exacerbated by unpredictable patterns of
WMT displacement, brain edema, and signal alteration directly related to the underlying tumor. Even with optimal
WMT reconstruction, intraoperative MRI tractography does not provide an accurate location of WMTs because
it is not a real-time view of the dynamic changes that occur in the surgical field. WMTs shift relative to the pre-
operative imaging (i.e., brain shift), thus making the location of WMTs as predicted by tractography inaccurate
(e.g., errors up to 3 cm). Fluorescence guided surgery (FGS) helps surgeons visualize brain tumor tissue, with
results showing increased EOR. FGS provides the surgeon real-time visualization of tumor tissue during surgery,
and thus is not limited by brain shift, because FGS provides direct, in vivo information. We recently discovered
that a subset of our first-in class near infrared nerve-specific small molecule fluorophores can cross the intact
blood brain barrier, where a handful have demonstrated affinity for WMT. We hypothesize that FGS using a
WMT-specific fluorophore could provide an objective methodology to accurately identify in real-time WMTs
during surgery. The long-term goal of this project is to dramatically improve surgical outcomes by creating the
first real-time intraoperative WMT imaging methodology. This project’s immediate milestones will include
quantification of WMT affinity followed by pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies in healthy rodents.
Then, pre-clinical studies in normal rodents and two models of WMT injury will enable selection of the most
promising agents to deliver proof-of-concept data of at least one agent suitable for future clinical translation."

The Development and Evaluation of Enhanced Digital-Chemosensory-Based Olfactory Training for
Remote Management of Substance Use Disorders (EDITOR) is a project to develop a sustainable, scalable,
and patient-centered mobile health platform, comprised of (1) a patient-facing culturally-adapted digital-
chemosensory therapeutic for stimulant, alcohol and opioid use disorders, sensors for acquisition of objective
physiological measures of substance intoxication and withdrawal, and an application for running and
interpreting the interventions and sensory acquisition programs; and (2) a provider-facing web portal, for
substance use disorder treatment in socially-disadvantaged and sexual minority populations. Management of
substance use disorders (SUD) mostly involve direct contact between patients and providers, but the
precedence of COVID-19 pandemic has elevated the need for patient-centered remote management of SUD.
While digital therapeutics and mobile health platforms provide avenues for remote management, our
communities of African Americans (AA), Hispanic-Americans (HA) and other socially disadvantaged
populations lag in adoption of these mobile platforms, due to inability to read, digital illiteracy, lack of access to
smartphones, absence of reliable Wi-Fi or internet, and financial constraints. Moreover, while interventions
exist for Opioid Use Disorders (OUD), there are no drugs for cocaine or stimulant use disorders. Underserved
AA and HA communities with OUD, particularly marginalized men who have sex with men (MSM), have more
severe co-existing cocaine, methamphetamine, and alcohol use disorders; and digital solutions for these
populations are lacking. Providers on the other hand, lack well-adapted, intelligent-based physiological and
psychophysical acquisition platforms to guide remote agonist management of opioid and alcohol withdrawal.
Through Phase I SBIR, EVON Medics developed a combinatorial digital chemosensory-based orbitofrontal
cortex training for Opioid Use Disorder (CBOT). Based on the limitations of CBOT for our socially
disadvantaged AA, HA and MSM population, we recently revised the platform for treatment of stimulant and
alcohol use disorder, by including beta-caryophyllene chemosensory stimulation. We propose further product
development, with innovative changes to the patient-facing platform and a new provider-facing platform to
guide remote management of OUD, Stimulant (cocaine and methamphetamine) use and alcohol use disorders
through Fast-Track SBIR funding. In Phase I, we will configure the patient-facing platform with: voice
commands with different languages especially for the non-English speaking, non-Wi-Fi or internet-dependent
connectivity solution and reliable pupillary, pulse rate, other physiological and psychological (e.g., craving)
acquisitions; and the provider-facing component to provide interpretation of patients’ data in a HIPAA-secure
portal. We will do preliminary testing in affiliated substance use community programs and community
populations in the under-served communities in Washington, DC and Maryland. In Phase II, we will perform a
pilot randomized trial of EDITOR compared to treatment as usual and CBOT for office-based treatment of
SUDs in several federal funded programs associated with Evon Medics and Howard University. Upon
completion of Phases I and II, we will be poised to expand the research to either a larger, Phase III efficacy
study, or an implementation study of effectiveness in the real-world setting through commercial partnerships
developed over the course of this project. To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first evaluation of
Digital-Chemosensory-Based platform for remote management of SUD, culturally adapted for socially
disadvantaged communities and populations."
10873841,"Leukocytes are essential immune components protecting the body against foreign invaders.
Adhesion, migration, extravasation, and cell-cell communication are mediated though the
bidirectional signaling of β2 integrins, which are integral membrane proteins found on the
leukocyte surface. Due to their complex and multifunctional roles, dysregulation of β2 integrins
is linked to autoimmune, cardiac and pulmonary pathologies as well as infectious diseases and
several cancers. Although integrins are prime therapeutic targets, drug development has been
hindered due to unanticipated side effects that arise from large gaps in our understanding of the
mechanisms that drive specificity and integrin activation. I will decipher the molecular basis for
β2 integrin activation, ligand recognition, and bidirectional signaling using an integrative
approach. I'll build on my expertise in cryoEM method development to capture high- resolution
conformational snapshots of isolated β2 integrin and ligand-bound complexes to reveal the
dynamic structural rearrangements associated with signal transduction and identify key residues
mediating ligand specificity. Using cell-surface expressed integrins, I'll assess the functional
consequences of mutating these residues on binding of ligands and conformation- specific
antibodies and on adhesion, phagocytosis, and cell motility. To gain broad insight into integrin
allostery in a near-native context, I'll develop a membrane mimetic system using next-
generation styrene maleic acid copolymers. Membrane lipids influence integrin activation and
ligand binding and are key to forming stable complexes. These polymers will afford a stream-
lined method to extract and purify nanodiscs embedded with pre- formed integrin-ligand
complexes in their native environment. I will use this system to study integrin in complex with
talin, the central integrin- activator protein that binds a conserved motif on the cytoplasmic
region on integrin. This will reveal in molecular detail how integrins are activated to relay signals
allosterically across the plasma membrane and define a molecular basis for bidirectional
signaling as well as provide a framework for designing biochemical, biophysical, and mechano-
sensitive experiments to study larger complexes and gain comprehensive insight into integrin
function. Ultimately, this work will provide a structural blueprint for the rational design of
therapeutics for autoimmune diseases, which is a long-term goal of the lab."
10890106,"Project Summary
One of the main research directions of my laboratory focuses on regulation of the endothelial barrier and
endothelial cell migration. These processes are critical for physiological function of vascular system and they
are often dysregulated in human diseases. A lot of progress has been made in understanding signaling that
regulates endothelial barrier and cell migration. However, stimulation of endothelial cell migration during
angiogenesis is a highly localized and transient event. Defining the role of the local and temporal components
of angiogenic signaling has been challenging due to limitations of current tools. Furthermore, spatiotemporal
regulation of the endothelial barrier by these stimuli has been poorly understood. Our proposed work will focus
on determining how the location and duration of migratory signals direct endothelial cell invasion and migration
through extracellular matrix, and how they affect the organization and permeability of the endothelial barrier.
The endothelial barrier is controlled at the level of adherens junctions (AJs), cell-cell adhesion structures
mediated by the transmembrane protein VE-cadherin. Phosphorylation-mediated signaling regulates the
structure and permeability of AJs. In our recent studies, we described a dual role of tyrosine kinase Src and its
phosphorylation of VE-cadherin in regulation of endothelial permeability. Our results demonstrated that Src-
mediated phosphorylation induces formation of dynamic AJs that still retain their barrier function. This suggests
a mechanism for the regulation of AJ plasticity that does not compromise barrier permeability during
endothelial cell migration. In parallel studies, we dissected a mechanism of Src-regulated degradation of the
extracellular matrix by the endothelial cell and discovered a novel cytoskeletal component that mediates
formation of matrix-degrading podosomes. The studies proposed here will continue to build on our previous
findings and focus on dissecting how phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and angiogenic signaling by Vascular
Growth Factor Receptor 2 (VEGFR2), Sphingosine-1-phosphate Receptor 1 (S1PR1), and Src regulate
plasticity of AJs as well as invasion and migration of endothelial cells. We will employ novel optogenetic tools
that will allow us to interrogate these processes with precise spatial and temporal control. We will use
engineered light-regulated VEGFR2, S1PR1, and Src to determine the effects of locally and temporally
controlled angiogenic signals and dissect mechanisms that mediate regulation of AJs and migration of
endothelial cells in three dimensional environment. Our long-term goal is to define the processes that control
migration of endothelial cells and endothelial barrier function during angiogenesis."

High dietary quality is protective against cancer. Previous work to improve dietary quality by changing the food
environment has emphasized increasing access to healthy foods in retail stores, but relatively little attention
has focused on intervening in independently owned restaurants, which have the potential to contribute to
cancer prevention in predominantly minority, low-income urban neighborhoods. Our team has worked
extensively with these types of restaurants to increase access to and promote healthier entrees, sides and
beverages, leading to significant increases in total revenues, sales, and purchasing of promoted foods.
Stemming from that work, this study has two interrelated objectives to sustainably improve access to and
promotion of healthier foods in independently owned restaurants: 1) to use systems science approaches to
refine, implement and test the effects of a novel intervention (FRESH: Focus on Restaurant Engagement to
Strengthen Health) on dietary quality, and health of regular customers, among other outcomes; and 2) to use
FRESH formative, baseline, implementation and outcome data to develop, parametrize, and calibrate a system
dynamics model that will allow stakeholders to virtually test the effects of FRESH strategies on outcomes in
their own communities. FRESH is a multilevel theory- and practice-based intervention for independently owned
restaurants with 3 core components: food preparation, food access & procurement, and consumer nutrition
environment. Aim 1) To use systems science approaches to refine existing materials from our successful
restaurant interventions and adapt the intervention to two urban sites (Baltimore and the DC metro area) that
are predominantly low-income and minority (African American and Latinx). Aim 2) To implement FRESH in 24
independently owned restaurants across both sites during 16 months and collect process data. Aim 3) To
assess the impact of FRESH using a multisite cluster randomized controlled trial on dietary quality (primary
outcome); health indicators; psychosocial factors of regular customers (n=576), and evaluate its impacts on
unit sales and weekly revenues. Primary Hypothesis: Regular customers of participating restaurants in FRESH
intervention neighborhoods will demonstrate at least a 5-point increase in Healthy Eating Index score, as
compared to restaurant customers in comparison neighborhoods. Data from Aims 1- 3 will be used to develop,
parameterize, and calibrate a system dynamics model to simulate the effects of FRESH intervention strategies
under different scenarios, leading to Aim 4) To disseminate a planning tool that enables stakeholders to
simulate and virtually test FRESH intervention strategies in other urban contexts, visualizing potential effects
on unit sales, revenues, customer health indicators, and cancer-prevention dietary behaviors, via a web-based
user-friendly interactive dashboard. This study will yield results that are both novel and significant, including a
simulation model to test restaurant-based cancer-prevention strategies, yielding substantial cost-savings from
avoided trial-and-error implementation."
10890120,"1 Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are highly prevalent among women in the United States (US) with
 2 profound health, social, and economic implications. However many women do not understand these health
 3 consequences, and even symptomatic women often do not seek treatment. A majority of LUTS research and
 4 clinical practice has focused on treatment of the most affected subset of women; thus the evidence base for
 5 prevention is sparse. An improved understanding of risk and protective factors for LUTS development in
 6 women across the life course is essential to inform the development and evaluation of prevention interventions.
 7 The goal of the Prevention of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (PLUS) Consortium is to conduct collaborative,
 8 transdisciplinary studies to establish the evidence base for future intervention studies to promote bladder
 9 health and prevent LUTS in adolescent and adult women. The Yale Clinical Research Center has substantively
10 contributed to this effort over the last 4 years by engaging in—and leading—PLUS foundational work including
11 the development of a conceptual framework, formative qualitative and quantitative research, strategic planning,
12 measure- and protocol-development, and the active engagement of communities of scientists, clinicians, and
13 the lay public through publications, conference presentations, and community outreach efforts. We are ideally
14 positioned to continue impactful contributions to PLUS research initiatives in the next cycle, bringing deep
15 experience and expertise in behavioral science, conceptualizing and designing large cohort studies, and
16 engaging diverse community participants to inform prevention research.
17 Drawing on ecological systems theory and using the PLUS Consortium conceptual framework, we will conduct
18 transdisciplinary prevention research that investigates multiple levels of influence on individuals’ bladder-
19 related behaviors and bladder health across the life course. Our aims are to: (1) Actively contribute to the
20 conceptualization, design, and implementation of a longitudinal national, population-based observational cohort
21 study examining women’s bladder health across the life course; (2) Analyze data from the national cohort study

Periodontitis is a prevalent inflammatory disease that causes destruction of the tooth-supporting tissues
(periodontium). The maintenance of homeostatic mechanisms is essential for protection against inflammatory
damage in the periodontium. In this context, the function of immune cells needs to be tailored according to
specific environmental challenges; for instance, the ability to mount a robust immune response needs to be
followed by timely resolution of inflammation and restoration of tissue integrity. This adaptation is known as
functional immune plasticity and results from an intimate crosstalk of immune cells with tissue-derived factors,
which, in turn, are regulated by and reflect changes of the tissue microenvironment. The functional
characterization of a novel endogenous homeostatic molecule, derived from periodontal tissue-resident cells
and designated developmental endothelial locus-1 (Del-1), has significantly contributed as a prototype
paradigm to the emerging concept that tissues have a “regulatory say” over the host immune response. This
project investigates the overarching hypothesis that Del-1 acts as a local endogenous regulator of functional
immune plasticity by not only regulating periodontal inflammation but also by promoting resolution thereof, and
hence periodontal homeostasis. The proposal comprises three specific aims and focuses on relevant animal
model-based mechanistic and intervention studies, including mice with lineage-specific deletions or
overexpression of Del-1. In Aim 1, it is proposed that Del-1 promotes the resolution of periodontal
inflammation. Aim 2 investigates the mechanism(s) by which Del-1 promotes homeostatic immunity.
Specifically, it is proposed that Del-1 modulates macrophage plasticity via two complementary mechanisms;
inhibition of inflammatory signaling and promotion of a pro-resolution reprogramming of macrophages, both of
which may impact the function of other immune cells, such as T cells. Aim 3 is to determine the importance of
the location of Del-1 expression in the regulation of periodontal inflammation and bone loss. The concept to
establish here is that the cellular source and location of homeostatic molecule expression is functionally
important in that it allows it to perform distinct functions in an appropriate context. This application therefore
offers a fundamentally new insight into the local mechanisms that govern and tailor the function of the immune
system. The proposed research is likely to reveal hitherto unknown mechanisms of immune system plasticity
relevant to the pathogenesis of oral diseases; these mechanisms can be harnessed to develop innovative
approaches to inhibit destructive inflammation and restore tissue integrity."

 Social interactions are marked by contingent and dynamic gaze exchanges among individuals, and these
exchanges powerfully shape inter-individual communication and coordinated social behaviors. Consequentially,
divergent social gaze interactions frequently lead to challenges in gathering and processing information from
others and further disrupt other social cognition. An excellent use of a non-human primate model is to study
neural circuits underlying contingent and dynamic social gaze, and test for their causal contributions. We have
shown that interacting with a real partner leads to drastically different social gaze dynamics compared to
observing the same conspecific in pictures or videos. Furthermore, using this live social gaze interaction
paradigm, we have recently found robust neural correlates of social gaze interaction in the orbitofrontal cortex
(OFC) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA). However, causal roles of OFC and BLA, and the OFC-BLA interplay,
in regulating social gaze interaction remain unestablished. Informed by our latest data and other emerging
findings from the field, we hypothesize that (1) BLA is required for preferentially directing attention to social
stimuli by processing social gaze valence, whereas (2) OFC is required for regulating social gaze interaction
according to social context, and that (3) the communication between OFC and BLA is required for contingent
and dynamic social gaze interaction. To test this overarching hypothesis, we will first examine the functional
relationship between social gaze preference and value processing in OFC and BLA neurons. We hypothesize
that BLA neurons process social gaze interaction using a valence schema, whereas OFC neurons do not.
Second, we will examine the necessity of OFC, BLA, and the OFC-BLA interplay in social gaze interaction by
temporarily inactivating OFC or BLA, or cross-inactivating OFC and BLA. We hypothesize that BLA is necessary
for preferentially directing attention to partner’s eyes and processing them, whereas OFC is necessary for social
context-dependent changes in gaze dynamics linked to dominance and familiarity between pairs. We also predict
that the direct communication between OFC and BLA is particularly crucial for interactive aspects of social gaze.
Finally, by recording neural activity from one area while temporarily inactivating the other area, we will examine
the neural representations of social gaze interaction in OFC and BLA that require functioning BLA or OFC,
respectively. Results from this proposal will provide functionally informed causal contributions of the OFC-BLA
circuits in real-life social gaze interaction."

Castleman disease (CD) describes a group of rare and poorly understood hematologic disorders that share
characteristic histopathologic alterations, lymphadenopathy, and systemic inflammation but vary in etiology,
symptomatology, treatments, and outcomes. Approximately 2,000 individuals of all ages are diagnosed with CD
each year in the US. Unicentric CD (UCD) involves one region of enlarged lymph nodes and typically milder
inflammatory symptoms; the three currently-recognized subtypes of multicentric CD (MCD) result from different
etiologies but involve progressive episodes of systemic inflammatory symptoms and life-threatening cytokine-
driven multi-organ dysfunction, such as the liver, kidneys, and bone marrow. The underlying mechanisms and
therapeutic targets are not well understood. While various treatments are often tried for CD, systematic
evaluations of these treatments have not been performed, the optimal treatments for each subtype are not
known, and biomarkers to identify patients likely to respond to certain treatments are needed. New treatment
approaches are also needed, but no validated, patient-centric treatment response criteria or biomarkers exist to
consistently evaluate promising treatment approaches in clinical trials. Further, clinical data had not been
centralized and no evidence-based diagnostic or treatment guidelines existed until recently.
 To address these barriers, we established an international longitudinal natural history study of CD in 2016
through a 5-year collaborative partnership between the Castleman Disease Collaborative Network, Janssen
Pharmaceuticals, and the University of Pennsylvania (lead institution). Developed by a team of physicians,
researchers, and patients, ACCELERATE utilizes an innovative patient-powered study design whereby CD
patients in the US and globally self-enroll online and our study team obtains and systematically extracts complete
medical record data into a central database. The use of common data standards, rigorous data extraction
protocols, and expert adjudication of each case ensure that the data is of high quality and interpretability. We
have enrolled over 500 CD patients and collected extensive, longitudinal data on approximately one-half that
have been leveraged to characterize the spectrum of CD, support the development of evidence-based treatment
guidelines, and advance translational research.
 Despite these advances, significant unmet needs remain for the majority of CD patients who do not have
an effective FDA-approved therapy. Unfortunately, our 5-year funded study has ended. We are seeking funding
to leverage the data collected from our 5-year collaborative partnership, build upon infrastructure from this multi-
stakeholder collaboration, and continue enrollment and data collection to identify clinically-meaningful patient
subtypes, clinical outcome measures, and novel treatment approaches. Our proposed studies have the potential
to transform care for CD patients, overcome barriers to therapeutic product development, and establish a model
for rare disease natural history studies."
10893555,"Project Summary
The goal of this research project is to gain deeper mechanistic insights into trans-translation, a conserved bacterial system for
translation quality control, directed proteolysis, and nonstop mRNA decay. The fundamental premise of our proposed studies
is that the SmpB-tmRNA mediated trans-translation process solves all of problems caused by nonstop mRNAs, including
rescue and recycling of unproductively stalled ribosomes, proteolysis of the potentially toxic nascent polypeptides, and
selective decay of the causative defect mRNA. We propose that the tmRNA-rescued ribosome serves as a hub for recruitment
of specialized rescue factors and initiation of interconnected salvage pathways. Therefore, over the next five years we will
address two independent aspects of the trans-translation process: (1) adaptor guided proteolysis of tmRNA tagged proteins
and (2) tmRNA-facilitated nonstop mRNA decay. In Aim I, we will investigate whether the translation machinery serves as a
platform for initiating guided proteolysis by recruiting the AAA+ ClpXP protease system to translating ribosomes. The
primary aim of our studies is to investigate a novel substrate recognition mechanism that enables the ClpXP protease, via its
specific-enhancing factor SspB, to capture marked proteins at their site of biogenesis on the ribosome. A detailed knowledge
of how specific substrate are captured via this novel pathway will shed significant new light on how AAA+ enzymes are
directed to define cellular locations and how proteases contribute to cellular fitness and survival under adverse conditions. In
Aim II, we will investigate the link between the tmRNA-mediated ribosome rescue system and the selective capture and
decay of defective mRNAs by RNase R. We wish to elucidate the mechanism by which RNase R is recruited to the translation
machinery and define its exact binding site and interacting partners on the rescued ribosome. We will explore the possibility
that a unique modification of ribosomal components creates specialized ribosomes that play a key role in recruiting RNase R
to tmRNA-rescued ribosomes. Recent studies have provided compelling evidence to demonstrate that the trans-translation
process and ClpXP and Lon proteases are key participants in various regulatory pathways in several pathogenic bacteria, and
therefore are required for pathogenesis. The genetic, biochemical, and structural studies proposed in this project offer the
unique opportunity to gain significant new insights into the trans-translation process and identify new targets for future
development of new antibiotics."
10893556,"ABSTRACT
Non-coding elements comprise 98% of the human genome. The coordination of non-coding regulatory elements
in the mammalian genome plays a pivotal role in controlling gene expression. Both experimental and
computational studies reveal that pathogenic genes involved in complex diseases, including oncogenes, are
regulated by a large number of enhancers, implying the existence of a complex interdependent regulatory
network of enhancers in modulating and maintaining expression of these genes. Genome-Wide Association
Studies (GWAS) reveal that non-coding regulatory elements, including enhancers, are hotspots for the genetic
predisposition to disease. To determine causal relationships between chromatin architecture and gene
transcription, perturbation in a biological system is necessary. Recent advances in CRISPR-based genome
engineering and live cell imaging technologies have enabled new techniques for ultrahigh resolution interrogation
of the function of various genome regulatory elements and how they relate to gene expression. In preliminary
studies in our lab, we performed a targeted CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) based screen to study how the 7
MYC enhancers present in K562 cells work together to co-regulate this oncogene. We created a library with
>87,000 pairs of gRNAs targeting the MYC enhancers to understand the epistatic network of gene regulation
underlying MYC expression. We found that when a subset of enhancer pairs were targeted together, they
exhibited a more dramatic than expected reduction in growth rate. We developed a model that divides MYC
enhancers into 2 layers that work together with varying degrees of efficiency to co-regulate MYC expression in
K562 cells. Here, we seek to expand these preliminary results to examine additional oncogenes and perform
these experiments in additional cell types. In addition, we will combine perturbation of oncogene enhancers with
CRISPR-based live cell imaging (termed CRISPR LiveFISH), that allows for the dynamic imaging of multiple
genomic loci, mRNA, and protein components in living cells. In Aim 1, we will develop an ultrahigh-resolution
multiplexed CRISPRi/a tiling screens platform to dissect enhancer interactions of different oncogenes in different
cancer cell lines. We will perform multiplexed CRISPRi/CRISPRa screens to inhibit or activate pairs of enhancers
with an ultrahigh spatial resolution (~20bp) controlling four oncogenes (MYC, CCND, BCL2, PDE4DIP) in K562
and HeLa cells. In Aim 2, we will characterize the dynamic real-time interactions between transcriptional
coactivators, mediators, multiple enhancers, promoters, and RNA transcription during CRISPRi/a-mediated
perturbation. We will monitor real-time dynamics of different enhancers, promotors, RNA transcription, and the
transcriptional coactivator proteins BRD4, IRF1, and Gata4 using LiveFISH with and without enhancer
perturbation. Altogether, we seek to apply new CRISPR technologies developed in our lab to create a model of
how oncogene enhancers are dynamically regulated across multiple oncogenes and in multiple types of cancer
cells."

RESEARCH: Precise, early detection and repeat, objective quantification of disease changes in interstitial lung
disease (ILD) could allow for early diagnosis and intervention and assess therapeutic responsivity over time. We
have previously shown that Optical coherence tomography (OCT) can provide low-risk, minimally invasive
microscopic ILD diagnosis with high accuracy compared to histopathology and clinical diagnosis. However,
qualitative evaluation and time-and labor-intensive manual segmentation of thousands of OCT images remains
challenging in the clinical setting. We hypothesize that OCT combined with well-established AI-based analysis can
accurately detect and segment microscopic ILD features in a larger cohort of ILD patients (Aim 1), quantify 3D ILD
volumetric disease burden and spatial distribution (Aim 2), and provide 4D quantification of disease change over
multiple time points (Aim 3). The successful completion of this proposal has the potential to streamline microscopic
ILD diagnosis and disease quantification over time.

10893443,"Project Summary: Destabilization of the genome is known to cause and perpetuate many diseases, particularly
cancer. Normally, genome stability is maintained by numerous cellular processes devoted to preserving and
repairing DNA. As a result, cells rarely acquire new mutations. However, recent findings from our group and
others have demonstrated that cells can undergo transient episodes of genome destabilization and acquire
numerous genomic mutations simultaneously. These events, termed saltational bursts of genomic instability,
drive rapid genome evolution and are posited to contribute to the initiation and progression of multiple types of
cancer. Currently, we understand very little about the properties and causes of saltational bursts, largely because
a model system with which to rigorously study these events has been lacking. We have recently characterized
bursts of genomic instability in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Based on compelling preliminary
data, we hypothesize that stochastic failures in genome maintenance can cause saltational bursts of genomic
instability and lead to transient mutagenic episodes. In this application, I propose to use innovative genomic and
cellular approaches to comprehensively explore key attributes of saltational bursts of mutagenesis. Specifically,
I will 1) investigate the temporal properties of bursts in order to define the duration of these destabilizing
episodes, 2) determine whether bursts occur through defects in specific genome integrity pathways, and 3)
determine how variable activity of these pathways modulates the frequency and mutational load of saltational
bursts. By conducting the above studies, I will contribute much needed insight into the mutational mechanisms
that drive rapid evolution. Moreover, these studies will strengthen our understanding of the mutagenic events
that give rise to diseases."
10895358,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Macromolecules fluctuate between different structural states of a conformational ensemble. One of the major
effects of ligands and mutations is to change the relative stability of these different states. However, most of
our structural biology modeling revolves around a paradigm of distinct and singular structures. Our major goal
is to move beyond static images of biological macromolecules, while retaining the ability to interrogate the
resulting models to improve ligand design and mutational engineering. We are also interested in creating
experimental methods to perturb the relative populations of these conformations, using temperature or
chemical perturbation to bring them into the window where they can be observed and modeled. In two previous
grants supported by NIGMS, we have focused three primary technologies: 1) ensemble modeling, where
alternative conformations present in X-ray (and now, increasingly, cryoEM) density maps are explicitly
identified and refined as a conformational ensemble or multiconformer model; 2) multitemperature
crystallography, where the temperature of X-ray data collection is shifted, while avoiding radiation damage, to
change the relative balance of different populations; 3) model validation, where the density at specific points is
quantified to support or falsify modelling. We have applied these paradigms broadly and collaboratively, with a
commitment to open methods and software. Two major foci have been: 1) ligand discovery using combinations
of multitemperature crystallography and empirical X-ray fragment screening (most notably to identify new ways
to allosterically inhibit the phosphatase PTP1B); 2) protein mutational engineering (most notably in the context
of protein design and in understanding the relationship between conformation dynamics and catalysis). With
MIRA support, we will continue our computational developments to further improve cryoEM modeling of
alternative conformations, to perform large scale test of the effects of ligand binding on protein conformational
heterogeneity, to improve validation and comparison of distinct ensemble model types, and to quantify density
signals for alternative conformations, hydrogens, and modifications. In parallel, our experimental work will
focus on the structural basis of new ligands to counter antibiotic resistance and on defining the conformational
landscape of the oligomeric enzyme glutamine synthetase. Our experimental work provides an important
testbed for new computational innovations and ways to validate the importance of newly modeled alternative
conformations. MIRA support will also enable us to conduct our research in a transparent and open manner,
dedicating ourselves further into early data disclosure (e.g. preprints and posts on our website) and data reuse
(e.g. deposition of primary diffraction and EM data), which are already paying dividends by enabling other
researchers. In summary, our research will create robust experimental and computational methods to access
conformational ensembles and provide avenues to exploit conformational heterogeneity for useful ends."
10895364,"7. Project Summary/Abstract
The over-arching theme of this proposal is to train “comprehensive imaging scientists” in the skills
necessary to identify clinically relevant problems; develop instrumentation, sensors, and contrast
agents to form images appropriate for the problem; and analyze the resulting imaging data using
signal processing, mathematical modeling, visualization, and informatics techniques to improve the
prevention, detection, diagnosis, and treatment of human diseases. The program spans from molecular to
cellular to tissue to organ. In order for imaging scientists to be knowledgeable of the full trajectory from image
formation to analysis and decision-making, they must be trained in four core areas: Instrumentation, Devices,
and Contrast Agents; Image processing; Modeling and Visualization; and Data Mining and Informatics.
All students in the program are trained in the core concepts of these areas. The current training program is a
two-year pre-doctoral portfolio program. A total of 41 students have been admitted to the program. The
proposed renewal will train another 20 students. The program includes off-campus externship research
experiences; in-depth clinical engagement; and a wide-ranging professional development component.
Imaging Science is an integral element of basic science research and clinical medicine. Imaging cell trafficking
and receptor pharmacology in vivo have already led to targeted drug and gene therapies and an understanding
of cellular biochemical pathways will contribute to new advances in medicine. Individualized medicine relies
heavily on imaging techniques to select the best therapies and monitor progress. Although structural in situ
human imaging is already a critical component of clinical medicine, many advances are needed in functional
imaging of the brain and other organs to improve healthcare. Brain mapping which is a core focus of NIH
research relies heavily on imaging. We have identified a critical need for imaging scientists to develop new
imaging instrumentation and apply that instrumentation with appropriate methods from image processing;
modeling and visualization; and informatics and data mining. In recognition of the potential of artificial
intelligence to transform medical imaging, our program emphasizes applications of machine learning.
This training program fills a critical niche by providing highly skilled scientists who are trained in the broad
trajectory of imaging science. Understanding the interplay between instrumentation and image analysis,
including machine learning methods, is important for designing the next generation of hardware and software
tools for quantifying complex biological systems and providing robust clinical tools. A key outcome of the
program is that trainees gain the skills necessary to identify clinically relevant problems."

Paracrine Action of BMP3 in Pulmonary Hypertension
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a severe vascular disease characterized by persistent precapillary
pulmonary hypertension, leading to right heart failure and death. Despite intense research in the last decades
PH remains an incurable disease with a high morbidity and mortality. New directions and therapies to improve
understanding and treatment of PAH are desperately needed.
Although evidence demonstrates the importance of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathway
in PAH, our current understanding of the exact pathophysiological role of several members of this pathway
remains limited. In this R01 we propose detailed functional and mechanistic studies to understand the role of
BMP3 in PAH. We hypothesize that PASMC-derived BMP3 inhibits PAEC dysfunction and pathological
pulmonary vascular remodeling. Based on robust preliminary studies, we propose testing this central
hypothesis with 3 specific aims.
Aim 1 will define BMP3 regulation in PAH and its effects in vitro. We will assess the levels of pulmonary BMP3
levels and circulating BMP3 levels in lung and serum of patients with clinical PAH and of PAH-diseased
animals. We will also determine whether sex affects pulmonary BMP3 expression in humans and rodents, and
we will investigate the effect of PASMC-derived BMP3 on PAEC function in cocultures of PASMCs and PAECs
isolated from non-PAH and PAH patients.
Aim 2 will characterize the in vivo effects of cell-specific BMP3 deletion and of BMP3 upregulation. We will
provide a detailed characterization of the cardiopulmonary phenotypes of SMC- and EC-specific BMP3 KO
mice. We will also examine the effects of exogenous recombinant BMP3 on PAH in the Sugen/Hypoxia model
in rats. Using a novel approach, which we have demonstrated to be highly specific and efficient for protein
overexpression in the lung (i.e. chemically modified mRNAs (modRNAs)), we will assess whether BMP3
modRNA reverses PAH in the Sugen/Hypoxia model in rats.
Aim 3 will dissect the molecular mechanisms of BMP3. We will perform a series of in vitro and in vivo studies
to determine the mechanism(s) of BMP3 regulation and to define BMP3 mechanism(s) of action. Promoter
activity assays, co-immunoprecipitation experiments, GST pull down assays, quantitative PCR measurements
and western blot analyses will determine the pathways implicated in BMP3 signals. Cocultures of PASMCs and
PAECs and lungs from BMP3-KO mice and from rats overexpressing BMP3 in vivo will determine the
pathways implicated in BMP3 signals."

Studying cancer across a diverse array of species provides a unique opportunity to interrogate factors
underpinning cancer initiation and progression and facilitating the modeling of new therapeutic targets in the
setting of spontaneous tumors complicated by comorbidities and metastases. While there is extensive reporting
of the frequency and diversity of tumors in animals from zoos, it has not been systematically linked to the plethora
of genomic resources available. To facilitate the transition of comparative oncology studies from human plus one
or two other species, to pan-mammalian analyses, we propose building a pan-mammalian tumor compendium
and portal to easily disseminate our resource. We will develop and apply machine learning tools to detect
patterns of cancer emergence and cancer resistance in human and non-human mammalian tumors. Our
approach provides opportunities to leverage the largely understudied mammalian tumor data jointly with human
data to identify reciprocal links between evolution and cancer resistance. This will allow us to make new human
cancer discoveries through integrative analysis of high-throughput biological data in the context of mammalian
species. We offer a powerful approach combining high-quality reference genomes and genomic data from
hundreds of mammalian species with machine learning, that has the promise to unearth the evolutionary genetic
underpinnings that are cornerstones of cancer initiation and progression. We will develop and apply models to
identify mammalian tumors that effectively mimic rare human cancers, work with collaborators to acquire tumor
samples from strongest identified mammalian models, then sequence and analyze these samples to validate
their effectiveness as models of human cancers."

Synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus is critical to the formation, storage and retrieval of episodic memories.
The separate regions of the hippocampus have evolved to play distinct roles in spatial navigation, contextual
memories, social memories, and our ability to separate patterns or complete patterns to reconstruct partial
memories. In particular the dentate and CA3 regions of the hippocampus are involved in pattern separation
that is vital to the integrity of episodic memories. At the center of this region are the mossy fiber afferents that
make conditional detonator synapses onto CA3 pyramidal neurons, which have a distinct form of presynaptic
cAMP dependent plasticity. Despite the importance of cAMP plasticity to memory formation and retrieval in the
CA3 the exact molecular mechanisms underlying MF LTP have yet to be uncovered. The premise of this
research builds upon our finding that there are at least two downstream cAMP effectors, PKA (protein kinase
A) and Epac2 (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP 2), that contribute to cAMP dependent MF LTP.
Despite these findings it is still not known how signaling by each of these effectors results in elevated release
from MF synapses and, what are the important targets and substrates that are involved in MF LTP.
Here we will use a comprehensive approach with leading edge proteomic, biochemical and
electrophysiological approaches to determine the signaling partners of the cAMP effectors, and uncover the
physiological mechanism of their actions. Thus, in Aim 1 we will take orthogonal approaches to find the
interactors and substrates of PKA and Epac2 and validate these by performing high resolution labeling in situ.
In Aim 2 we will determine the exact physiological mechanism that underlie increases in release of
neurotransmitter at MF synapses using a combined optoactivation-knockout/pharmacological strategy. In the
final Aim we will answer the question of how these different, but convergent, mechanisms are engaged during
naturalistic activity patterns, and whether selective disruption of these effectors impairs the ability of mice to
separate similar patterns that underlie the formation and retrieval of episodic memories."

Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common form of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). DLBCL
tumors are highly heterogeneous and molecular profiling has revealed up to six distinct prognostically relevant
sub-groups, however these classifications are primarily based on profiles of the malignant cells. Non-malignant
cells in the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) can be powerful modulators of tumor growth and can be
targeted for cancer therapy, yet biomarkers that include TME elements have not been developed. We
hypothesize that successful development of next generation immune targeting therapies for lymphoma
will require spatially resolved, highly multiplexed single cell based biomarkers of TME composition and
structure. In this study we propose to perform imaging mass cytometry analysis (IMC) on over 2000 cases of
aggressive B cell lymphoma with the following aims: Specific Aim 1: Validate spatially-derived protein biomarkers
of DLBCL outcomes (n-830 patients). Specific Aim 2: Analyze the single cell topology of histologically diverse
aggressive B cell lymphomas (n=1380) to identify shared TME based biomarkers across all aggressive B cell
lymphoma. Specific Aim 3: Determine which TME elements modulate chemoresistance and mediate response
to immune therapies in lymphoma through in vitro model systems. In the first two Aims, we will apply our novel
abundance weighted score (M-score), developed specifically for IMC analysis, to validate candidate biomarkers
(such as PD-L1+/CCR4+/TIM-3+) and identify new biomarkers. We will also apply our single cell spatial
clustering algorithm, Regions of Immune Cell Organization (RICO), to identify tumor-immune spatial clusters
that are associated with clinical outcome. The spatial resolved, single cell, highly multiplexed, digital image
analysis proposed here will have clinical impact for the ~80,000 new US cases of NHL. Specific Aim 1 will validate
and discover protein biomarkers in a image format familiar to pathologists allowing for seamless clinical
adoption, Specific Aim 2 will refine methods for spatial systems biology applied to challenging lymphoma
types, and Specific Aim 3 will allow pre-clinical validation of prognostic and predictive biomarkers."
10895556,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Infectious disease is a major threat to human health worldwide. The emergence of
antibiotic resistance pathogens necessitates the development of new drugs to treat infections. A
fundamental challenge in developing antibiotics is that many pathogens replicate inside host
cells rendering them inaccessible to antimicrobial agents. The critical processes that govern
pathogen growth within host cells represent promising new targets for therapeutic intervention.
 Most bacterial pathogens that grow inside host cells do so in a specialized compartment
called the replication vacuole. Maintaining the integrity of the replication vacuole is critical to
bacterial survival and growth as it provides protection against host surveillance systems that
detect and eliminate pathogens. Disrupting this process would thus limit bacterial growth and
enabling pathogen killing by the host immune system.
 Recently, we discovered an unprecedented link between host cell peroxisomes and the
ability of the bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila to sustain its replication vacuole. The
impaired growth of Legionella in the absence of peroxisomes demonstrates a critical role for
peroxisomes in supporting Legionella infection. Peroxisomes play central roles in numerous
cellular processes. Importantly, peroxisomes are most widely recognized for their critical
functions in the production and breakdown of lipids, major constituents of pathogen replication
vacuoles and sources of nutrients for growing bacteria. This suggests that Legionella may
exploit peroxisomes to gain access to these essential molecules. In addition to Legionella, many
pathogens that grow within host cells, use common strategies to establish an infection, in
particular the formation and maintenance of a replication vacuole. Thus peroxisomes are likely
to be important for other infectious bacteria. The proposed research will define how
peroxisomes enable Legionella to cause disease while simultaneously avoiding detection and
elimination by the body’s natural defenses, which is paramount to the development of new
antibiotics."

Development is all about timing. From fertilized egg to newborn infant, embryonic development proceeds as a
highly coordinated sequence of stereotyped events. The order and timing of each stage of the process,
including the timing of tissue morphogenesis and differentiation of progenitor cells, are essential for building
mature organs in time for birth. Defects in timing are associated with both congenital birth defects as well as
chronic diseases in the adult, including asthma, emphysema, renal failure, and type II diabetes. What controls
the tempo of development – the central metronome of the embryo – is one of the great mysteries of biology.
Only a handful of molecular timers have been discovered to-date, including the circadian and segmentation
clocks, both of which operate as transcriptional oscillators that are entrained by periodic activation of
extracellular biochemical stimuli. However, it is unclear how biochemical signals that are transmitted by
diffusion can couple the rates of development of organs that are separated by large distances within the
embryo. We recently discovered unexpectedly that the rate of morphogenesis of the embryonic mammalian
lung is entrained by mechanical forces from luminal fluid pressure, which controls the frequency of
synchronized epithelial branching and smooth muscle contraction across the organ. These findings suggest
the presence of a “mechanical clock” in the fetus. Because fluid pressure is transmitted instantaneously
between distant tissues, a mechanical clock could synchronize the rates of development across organs,
permitting coordinated maturation before birth. Here, we propose to investigate the coupling of lung, kidney,
and pancreatic development, organs that are all connected by fluid within and around the embryo and that form
via branching morphogenesis. We will define how the magnitude of pressure controls the rates of proliferation,
differentiation, and morphogenesis using microfluidics approaches. We will also identify the oscillatory
signaling pathways that are induced by pressure and investigate how fluid forces are transmitted between
distant organs to ensure that their rates of development are coupled. We will combine organ-on-a-chip models,
tissue-specific reporter animals, transgenic knockout mice, single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics, and
quantitative time-lapse imaging analysis, and complement these with studies of human patient samples and
mouse models of entrainment defects. This work will uncover how the shared mechanical environment of fetal
organs permits them to grow and mature coordinately in time for birth, which is essential for designing new
approaches to treat disorders associated with congenital defects and developmental prematurity, as well as
chronic diseases in the adult."

The Yale Division of Addictions, Department of Psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine requests a 6th 5-year
renewal for our Clinician Scientist Training Program, which has been providing intensive training in research
methods for clinical and translational investigation of drug abuse since 1991. Presently, the Clinician Scientist
Training Program supports three early career faculty members engaged in various aspects of drug abuse
research with a focus on treatment development. The support will permit the Clinician Scientists to spend 3-5
years at Yale’s Division of Substance Abuse obtaining clinical and research training under the mentorship of a
team of 53 senior investigators whose interests range from molecular neurobiology to health services research.
With about 100 externally funded research projects, the central theme of our research program is the
development and evaluation of innovative pharmacological and behavioral treatments for individuals with drug
addictions in a manner informed by emerging neuroscientific findings. Our multidisciplinary, translational
program enables us to conduct research that moves rapidly in both directions from preclinical projects
(“bench”) to clinical studies (“bedside”). The training goal for this program is to provide Clinician Scientist
Scholars at the junior faculty level with an opportunity to devote virtually full-time effort during the initial phase
of their careers to learning research skills and conducting research projects as a critical step toward launching
careers as independent research scientists. After initial work conducted with the support of this program, they
will be guided to develop scientifically meritorious research proposals (using, for example, R21 and R01
mechanisms) which will provide support for research that extends beyond the period of the program. Since the
onset of the program, we have provided training for 37 Clinician Scientists, many of whom are among the
leaders of their generation of drug abuse investigators."
10896015,"ABSTRACT: Trigeminal neuropathic pain is the most debilitating pain disorder but current treatments
including opiates are not effective for it in most patients. The pain can often be triggered by a breath of cooling
air blowing on the face. Mechanisms of trigeminal neuropathic pain exacerbation at cooling temperatures are
not well understood, which prevents us from designing mechanistically based therapy to effectively treat this
devastating pain. Our recent studies in rat models have suggested that thermally sensitive two-pore domain K+
channels (thermal K2Ps) may play a key role in trigeminal neuropathic pain exacerbation at cooling
temperatures. Our central hypotheses here are: 1) Thermal K2Ps provide a brake to prevent nociceptor
hyperexcitability under physiological conditions, 2) Trigeminal nerve injury causes thermal K2P down-
regulation to impair the brake leading to trigeminal nociceptor hyperexcitability and neuropathic pain, and 3)
Cooling temperatures further suppress thermal K2Ps to lead to trigeminal neuropathic pain exacerbation. We
will test these hypotheses with the following specific aims. ♦Aim 1. Elucidate the role of thermal K2Ps in
controlling trigeminal nociceptor excitability and determine the effects of cooling temperatures on K2P
functions. We will use immunohistochemistry to characterize thermal K2P expression in trigeminal nociceptors
of normal rats. We will use our newly developed in situ patch-clamp recordings to characterize thermal K2P-
mediated leak K+ currents in trigeminal nociceptors and their role in controlling trigeminal nociceptor excitability
of normal rats. We will study effects of cooling temperatures on thermal K2P functions in trigeminal nociceptors
of normal rats. ♦Aim 2. Elucidate that trigeminal nerve injury down-regulates thermal K2P expression leading to
trigeminal nociceptor hyperexcitability. We will use two established rat models of trigeminal neuropathic pain,
the infraorbital nerve chronic constrictive injury (ION-CCI) and oxaliplatin-induced trigeminal neuropathy
models. We will study changes of thermal K2P expression and thermal K2P-mediated leak K+ currents in
trigeminal nociceptors of these models. We will use pharmacological and genetic approaches to elucidate that
down-regulation of thermal K2Ps leads to trigeminal nociceptor hyperexcitability. We will determine how
cooling temperatures further exacerbate hyperexcitability of trigeminal nociceptors of these rat models. ♦Aim 3.
Elucidate that thermal K2P down-regulation underlies trigeminal neuropathic pain, and establish thermal K2Ps
as therapeutic targets for trigeminal neuropathic pain in rat models. We will use orofacial operant tests to study
whether thermal K2P down-regulation leads to trigeminal neuropathic pain manifested with cold allodynia and
hyperalgesia. We will use ION-CCI and oxaliplatin models to determine whether trigeminal neuropathic pain
can be alleviated by pharmacological and genetic enhancements of thermal K2P functions in trigeminal
afferent nerves. ♦ Completion of these Aims will fill the scientific gap of trigeminal nociception, elucidate a new
mechanism of trigeminal neuropathic pain, and establish new therapeutic targets for this debilitating pain."
10896019,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Lung transplant is the only curative treatment for end stage lung diseases such as idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis, COPD, cystic fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension. However, long-term
survival of lung transplant recipients (LTRs) is the lowest among all organ transplantations with a
median survival of 6 years. Approximately 50% of LTR’s develop chronic rejection within 5 years
post-transplantation, a syndrome referred to as chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). CLAD
pathogenesis is poorly understood. We and others have shown that lung dysbiosis (disruption of
microbiota homeostasis) is strongly associated with CLAD, although to date it is unclear if
dysbiosis is the cause or effect of CLAD. Unlike, gut dysbiosis which is an established risk for
chronic inflammatory diseases; the role of lung dysbiosis and the mechanisms linking it to CLAD
remain to be determined, representing a critical knowledge gap. Our objectives are to use a
longitudinal approach to define the pathogenic lung microbiome that predates CLAD onset and
investigate mechanisms for microbiome-induced fibrogenesis that increase CLAD susceptibility.
Our hypothesis is that lung dysbiosis inhibits epithelial autophagic clearance of pro-fibrotic
cytokines in an IL-33 dependent manner, thereby augmenting fibrogenesis and risk for CLAD.
SA1: To investigate the role of IL-33 blockade in attenuation of lung dysbiosis related fibrogenesis
and CLAD in a murine lung transplant model. SA2: To elucidate the mechanisms of IL-33
regulation of autophagy that are linked to pro-fibrotic responses in the lung. SA3: To determine
the relationship between human lung dysbiosis, IL-33 and CLAD susceptibility. Completion of the
proposed studies will (a) define the mechanistic link between airway microbial dysbiosis in lung
transplant recipients to dysregulated epithelial responses and CLAD; (b) provide proof-of-concept
that IL-33 blockade can favorably modulate microbiome mediated pro-fibrotic response leading
to CLAD. (c) Identify specific airway microbiome signatures that identify those at risk for CLAD."
10896025,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A major goal of publicly funded early childhood education (ECE) programs for low-income families is to
address underlying social disparities in order to improve children's long-term educational attainment and health
outcomes. Rates of participation in ECE programs and public investment in these programs have grown
dramatically over the last 30 years, changing the context for understanding the potential long-term program
benefits. Whereas existing long-term studies (Perry Preschool, Abecedarian) compared the benefits of ECE
versus home care, the critical question facing ECE programs today is whether improvements in the quality of
contemporary ECE programming can have incremental long-term benefits. In order to optimize return on
investment, long-term studies evaluating costs and benefits of ECE program enhancements are needed. The
proposed study will examine the long-term outcomes and identify the public service and financial costs affected
by the two REDI interventions, enhancements to the Head Start classroom and home visit programming
respectively, and estimate their likely return on investment. We propose interviews with and administrative data
collection for participants in each of two ongoing longitudinal studies, the REDI-Classroom (REDI-C) trial
(n=356, retention=80%) and the REDI-Parent (REDI-P) trial (n=200, retention=86%), that have followed
children with detailed measurement of adaptive social-emotional and academic functioning from preschool into
adolescence. There are three aims: 1) Assess the long-term impact of REDI programs with follow-up
assessments that extend to early adulthood (age 23) for participants in the classroom program and through
high school completion (age 19) for participants in the parent program; 2) Collect new services and
administrative data from education, criminal justice, healthcare, and social service records to estimate the
costs linked to program effects and determine the long-term return on investment for the REDI-C and REDI-P
programs; and 3) explore the associations between initial REDI-C and REDI-P impacts on social-emotional/
self-regulation skills and later, long-term benefits, and explore possible moderation of intervention effects by
the quality of the school contexts experienced by participants in order to illuminate likely mechanisms of action
and inform future ECE intervention design."
10896027,"The Institute for Reproduction and Perinatal Research at the University of Kansas Medical
Center hosts the Annual Gilbert S. Greenwald Symposium on Reproduction and Perinatal Research
in honor of and as a memorial to the life and research career of Gilbert S. Greenwald, Ph.D.; the 2022
Symposium will be the nineteenth. The objective of the annual Symposium is to provide a forum for
all attendees to strengthen and expand individual professional networks, to build knowledge based
both within an individuals research focus and in broader areas of reproduction, to be exposed to new
research techniques and approaches, and to get feedback related to ongoing research projects. The
Symposium provides an important opportunity to strengthen existing and establish new research
collaborations.
 Enhancing opportunities for trainees is a key aspect of the symposium. Trainees are provided
the opportunity to participate at all levels; on the organizing committee, suggest, invite, host, and
introduce guest speakers, present their work through elevator talks, poster, or oral presentation, meet
with guest speakers, meet regional researchers, and meet other Midwest regional trainees.
Establishing both communication skills and a networking infrastructure is key to a successful scientific
career and every opportunity, such as the Greenwald Symposium, serves to enhance the overall
training experience.
 The Symposium is held over one and a half days and features scientific talks by seven invited
external scientists and seven regional trainees. The Greenwald symposium focuses in the
reproductive sciences and covers topics related to reproduction, development, regenerative medicine,
genetics, epigenetics, stem cell biology, pathologies of the reproductive system, and developmental
origins of disease. We encourage any investigator, faculty, trainee, and laboratory staff to participate
in the Symposium and have approximately 100 attendees each year primarily from Midwest regional
institutions in Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and Iowa.
 We have three key goals with this application; to enhance support of trainees, to address
diversity and inclusion, and to provide an exceptional scientific Symposium. This R13 program will
provide financial support of non-KU trainees for registration and travel costs associated with
participation in the Symposium. The active participation of trainees in scientific meetings is an integral
component of the educational process and we encourage all interested trainees to participate. We
have found deferring costs associated with attending this symposium does facilitate the ability of
trainees to participate and therefore has a role in enhance progression toward a successful career in
research."
10896057,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The goal of this K99/R00 proposal is to facilitate Dr. Shaobing Su's transition into the role of independent
investigator focused on understanding how early and prolonged parent-child separation (i.e., separated at ages
0-6 for at least 6 months per year) shapes the mental health of separated-reunited children in the United States
(US). This proposal builds on Dr. Su's strong foundation in quantitative and intervention research through a risk
and resilience lens and her prior research on mental health and development of vulnerable children, especially
children born to immigrants or migrants. Dr. Su seeks to expand her knowledge of the literature related to child
development and parent-child separation as well as her repertoire of methodological skills, including cultural
adaptation of theories, measures, and interventions for racial and ethnic minorities, qualitative and mixed-
method research, Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approaches, and grant writing.
 This CBPR-based exploratory sequential mixed-methods research comprises 3 aims and 3 studies:
 Study 1 (Aim 1) will elucidate the mental health challenges that arise in Chinese American children with a
history of early and prolonged parent-child separation; and identify potential processes that might influence
mental health. Study 1 involves semi-structured interviews with Chinese separated-reunited children (N=48,
aged 12-17) and their parents (N=48 primary caregiver parents).
 Study 2 (Aim 2) will examine mental health disparities and risks and resources between separated-reunited
children and non-separated children; and explore the relationships among separation, risk, and protective
factors at multiple levels, and affected children's mental health outcomes. Study 2 is a quantitative study
among 200 Chinese American separated-reunited children and 200 non-separated children (aged 12-17).
 Study 3 (Aim 3) will identify focal areas and potential “active ingredients” to prioritize as components for
development of a targeted intervention for affected children and families. Study 3 will use mixed-methods
analyses to integrate qualitative (Study 1, Community Advisory Board recorded discussions) and quantitative
findings (Study 2, Boston College seed grant) to seek convergence and divergence as the basis for a model of
change and integrate it into existing family strengthening models for mental health interventions.
 The CBPR-based, mixed-methods research may deepen understanding of the impact of parent-child
separation on child development and effects of multilevel risk and protective factors. Findings may inform
intervention, policy, and practices for separated-reunited Chinese American children as well as other children
affected by other forms of separation (e.g., children in institutional settings, children separated at the border).
This award will support Dr. Su's transition to independent research in parent-child separation and mental
health; and enable her to develop R01 proposals to adapt and evaluate family-strengthening interventions for
affected children or to expand the research to other child cohorts with a longitudinal sequential design."
10896176,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The “Monkey Alcohol Tissue Research Resource” (MATRR) is a multiple PI research resource award from
Oregon Health & Science University and Baylor University. The MATRR has been highly successful in
providing the alcohol research community access to tissue and data generated from cohorts of monkeys that
have completed a standard protocol to study voluntary alcohol self-administration. The procedure results in a
wide distribution of average daily ethanol intakes (g/kg) and the MATRR bioinformatics has established
reliable, robust categories of drinking that encompass low, binge, heavy and very heavy chronic intake
patterns. The necropsy procedure is fully refined and allows for the highest quality harvesting of all organs and
tissues in the body. Prior to necropsy, registered users and other interested parties are contacted for custom
tissue preparations, otherwise frozen and fixed tissue remain in the MATRR until requests are made through a
dedicated web resource. All tissues are accompanied by data on organismal and alcohol intake variables to aid
in rapid publication of findings. Importantly, the MATRR provides an opportunity for laboratories with specific
expertise in organ pathology, neuroscience and genomics the ability to extend their research to a primate
model with similar genetics, developmental processes, endocrinology, immunology, physiology and
neuroanatomy to humans. Thus, the MATRR is unique to the alcohol research field in promoting a translational
resource for mechanistic studies of alcohol-induced pathologies. The MATRR resource has exceeded all
expectations in terms of tissue generation, inventory control, tissue requests, tissue utilization, data analytics,
novel data generated, publications, newly funded projects and new research directions. In this renewal, we
propose to add 3 more cohorts, with an expected accumulation of tissues and data from 20 cohorts of
monkeys (total n=240 (162 ethanol, 78 control)). This has positioned the MATRR to fill experimental designs
requiring large number of individuals, for example genetic and in vivo imaging datasets. The inventory control
is aided by a unique web-based interface that also serves to administratively evaluate and act upon tissue
requests. In total, we have 226 registered users and have shipped over 3,813 tissue samples from 5,590 tissue
and data requests. With each accepted request an MTA is filed and timely progress reports are automatically
requested. In the past funding, the resource has been extremely successful in the number of publications (48
in 48 months) from 22 different laboratories at 13 unique universities or Institutes. There remain great
opportunities in further building and refining this resource. Our goal is to have the MATRR bioinformatics
integrate data across disciplines, organs and individuals to generate knew knowledge of chronic alcohol use
disorders. Finally, we acknowledge that in addition to building critical numbers for large scale data analyses,
the opportunity exists to study additional tissue (such as fetal), variations in the protocol (such as necropsy in
abstinence) and additional datasets such as sonography for liver elasticity."
10896179,"Project Summary/Abstract
Anomia is a core feature of aphasia, a disorder affecting at least 2.5 million Americans. Assessment of naming
ability is foundational to both research and clinical practice in aphasiology, but currently available naming tests
have largely failed to capitalize on important advances in psychometric theory and practice over the past 50
years. Sensitive metrics are needed to support investigations of the cognitive mechanisms underlying anomia,
clinical decision making, and treatment research. To be optimally useful, these metrics must be validated within
a rigorous psychometric framework to (i) efficiently provide information about both overall severity and the
underlying cognitive deficits in a unified framework, (ii) support repeated assessments without threatening
internal validity or measurement precision, (iii) target both object and action naming, and (iv) easily integrate
into computerized adaptive testing platforms. All current anomia tests lack at least one of these features. To
remedy this gap, this project pursues three aims.
 First, to ease sharing of information across clinics and labs, and enhance the ability to conduct robust
meta-analytic studies, five object picture-naming tests will be equated within an item response theory
framework, and their scores will be expressed on the same metric. Further, to obviate the need for large
samples in future item development, a model for predicting the difficulty of most picturable nouns will be refined
and cross-validated. Just as the measurement of length does not depend on which ruler is used, measurement
of anomia severity need not depend on which naming test is given.
 Second, to quantify the underlying cognitive deficits of anomia, a cognitive-psychometric model of
anomia will be refined and evaluated to produce a measurement model that balances clinical utility, model-data
fit, and fidelity to current theory.
 Third, given the increasingly recognized importance of action naming, a computer adaptive action
naming test will be developed using item response theory by modeling action naming responses; regressing
verb item difficulty parameters on relevant target properties; and, conducting real-data simulations to assess
the precision of the computer adaptive test engine.
 This work will produce a powerful and flexible anomia assessment tool with utility for both research and
clinical practice. Depending on user specifications, it will maximize diagnostic information and measurement
precision while minimizing response burden. The aims of this project directly address goals identified in the
NIDCD Strategic Plan for 2017-2021, including developing and refining techniques, technology, and
instrumentation for improved diagnosis to aid in treatment and improve clinical outcomes."
10896185,"Nearly 1 in 2 US adults has hypertension, and it is a leading cause of myocardial infarction,
stroke, and death. Despite the importance of hypertension and the widespread availability of
medication treatment, only 44% of patients had controlled blood pressures in 2018. This is in
part due to the way in which we deliver care, and new strategies are needed to achieve better
blood pressure control. Team-based care with medication titration by a non-physician is a
promising approach, but the cost and infrastructure required make this option less feasible. An
alternative strategy is to have patients self-manage their own hypertension by checking blood
pressures and following an algorithm, pre-planned between the patient and primary care doctor,
to intensify their medications at home. Despite evidence for the effectiveness and cost-
effectiveness of this approach, it has not yet been incorporated into routine care.
In this project, we propose to develop an implementation-ready antihypertensive self-titration
intervention informed by qualitative interviews and real-world assessments of antihypertensive
adherence. The proposed aims are to: (1) explore barriers and facilitators to the implementation
of antihypertensive self-titration in routine US primary care; (2) assess adherence to
antihypertensive treatments; and (3) develop an implementation-ready antihypertensive self-
titration protocol, perform usability testing, and prepare a proposal for a pragmatic, randomized
trial to test the intervention’s effectiveness. The overarching goal of the project is to develop an
innovative alternative model of hypertension care that has the potential to improve blood
pressure control, patient self-efficacy, and disease understanding
Dr. Haff is a practicing primary care physician committed to a career in research to improve the
prevention and treatment of cardiometabolic disease, and this proposal includes a training plan
that will accelerate her career development in the areas of implementation science, qualitative
methods, health services research methods, and scientific writing. The mentorship team, led by
Niteesh Choudhry, an expert in health services research and implementation science related to
cardiometabolic disease, includes well-known experts in preventive cardiology (Paul Ridker, co-
mentor), biostatistics (Robert Glynn, co-mentor), and implementation science and qualitative
methods (Karen Emmons, co-mentor), and will ensure successful completion of the proposed
project and training. By the conclusion of this program, Dr. Haff will be able to independently
design, target, and evaluate interventions for cardiometabolic disease. The results of the
proposed K23 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application."
10870059,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Large-scale genomics has taken a central role in the biomedical sciences. The increasingly quantitative nature
of biomedical research and the explosive growth of genomic data have resulted in an increasing demand for
individuals trained at the interface of genomics and the mathematical sciences. Recognizing this demand, the
NHGRI has convened multiple workshops over the years focused on quantitative training in genome science.
Workshop reports have consistently noted a critical need in this domain, noting too few scientists trained to
develop methods and tools and to analyze the vast amounts of data generated from genomics studies and
their rapidly emerging technologies. For example, in 2013, NHGRI advisors advocated “maintaining investment
in genomics sciences training while expanding the statistical and informatics component.” The focus on big
data and data science in biomedicine is expanding this need further; in the current NHGRI strategic planning
process, advisors have strongly advocated expanded NHGRI commitment to data science training. The
University of Michigan Genome Science Training Program (GSTP) was one of the first NHGRI-funded T32s.
Now in its 25th year of continuous funding, the GSTP has trained 122 individuals. While the GSTP continues to
evolve to ensure trainees are able to address cutting-edge research questions in genomics, the fundamental
premise of the GSTP remains: that graduates should have substantial training in the mathematical and
biological sciences and at their interface. This training facilitates communication between disciplines,
identification of important problems, and construction of the statistical and computational tools to solve those
problems, and so provides outstanding training for statistical genomicists, genomic epidemiologists,
bioinformaticians, and human molecular genomicists with a strong grounding in statistics and computation. The
GSTP is based in four participating departments: Biostatistics, Epidemiology, Human Genetics, and
Bioinformatics, with additional faculty in Biological Chemistry; Ecology and Evolutionary Biology; Environmental
Health Sciences; Microbiology and Immunology; Nutritional Sciences; and Statistics. We request continued
support for ten predoctoral and three postdoctoral trainees, consistent with the last ten years. The University of
Michigan demonstrates its own commitment to the GSTP with nearly $1 million in additional support. Trainees
will be supported for two years (occasionally three) to provide time to embark on the interdisciplinary training
we have demonstrated is critical to their success. Graduates of the GSTP will continue to help fill the need for
quantitative genome scientists, and in so doing, help the NHGRI achieve its goals of translation of genomic
information into advances in human health."
11144103,"Project Summary
Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common inflammatory disease that affects a large portion of the U.S.
population, resulting in poor quality of life for those affected and utilizing billions of dollars of health care
resources. Unfortunately, CRS presents more like a heterogeneous syndrome than a distinct diagnostic entity,
resulting in variability in both phenotype, symptoms, and inflammatory signatures. Consequently, CRS
pathophysiology and associated mechanisms of disease remain poorly understood. Our group recently identified
a unique inflammatory signature specific to elderly CRS patients, which is characterized by profound elevation
of IL-1 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that CRS in aged
patients is associated with an age-dependent, IL-1-associated mechanism that derives from dysfunctional
innate immunity and activation of the inflammasome. We will test this hypothesis by analyzing a large
prospectively enrolled cohort of CRS patients. Specific Aim 1 will determine whether aging is associated with
altered Toll-like receptor expression or function, with resultant ‘priming’ of the innate immune system. Aim 2 will
determine whether aging in CRS patients results in increased inflammasome activation. We will subsequently
analyze the ability of common microbial ligands and endogenous age-related inflammatory stimuli to activate
inflammasome-associated cytokine production and release. Finally, in Specific Aim 3 we will determine whether
there are functional associations between the sinonasal microbiome and/or individual pathogens with aging,
innate immune function, and the IL-1-driven pro-inflammatory signature. This proposal seeks to characterize a
previously unrecognized inflammatory subtype of CRS that affects aged individuals, a vulnerable population with
limited medical and surgical options. Findings from this study will provide further insight into the mechanism of
CRS and reveal previously unidentified associations between innate immune function, the sinus microbiota, and
different types of chronic mucosal inflammation in the sinonasal cavity."
10910106,"Pressure injuries are a significant secondary complications for many individuals with reduced mobility,
including elderly Veterans and those with spinal cord injury (SCI). Core assistive technology for persons
with limited mobility includes a wheelchair seating system, comprising both a wheelchair and an
effective pressure relief cushion. All wheelchair users are at some increased risk of pelvic region
pressure injuries while sitting. Numerous studies have shown that although no one cushion can meet
every user's needs, pressure relieving cushions are a critical component in all wheelchair seating
systems to maximize function for individuals with mobility restrictions and decrease the risk of pressure
injury development. An effective cushion prevents tissue breakdown, promotes postural stability and
increases overall sitting tolerance.
Preliminary work investigated a range of novel low-cost dynamically responsive materials developed for
the non-medical market and which showed potential for use in seating design. A key aspect of the
modular cushion's design is its ability to be fitted and customized for each user using a cushion fitting
algorithm (CFA). The modular array thus optimizes pressure distribution over the cushion surface while
the user is sitting. Using the CFA, each cushion can be personalized for the user to optimize interface
pressure distribution and maintain seated tissue health.
The current project will provide next-generation development and user evaluation of a low-cost
advanced modular pressure relief cushion and fitting algorithm, building on the previous support from
VA. The first generation modular cushion was designed for power wheelchair users, the second
generation will be lower weight and also suitable for manual wheelchair users. Low cost compressible
SquishINS inserts will be additively manufactured using commercially available silicon by modified
desktop Makerbot Replicator printers (StrataSys, Brooklyn, NY). Pre-clinical benchmark evaluation will
be carried out using ISO 16840-2 testing standards. Cost analysis will ensure that the next- generation
modular cushion continues to apply value-driven principles. A clinical pilot study of 30 Veterans who are
full-time wheelchair users will be carried out using a repeated measures clinical study design, with
study participants as their own controls. `Pre-baseline' seated interface pressures will be assessed with
study participants sitting on their own cushions and pelvic region skin checks carried out by the study
Research Nurse. All participants will then receive customized modular cushions fit to the user using the
CFA to create a personalized cushion insert layouts. Participants will be randomly assigned to Group A
or Group B using a modified randomization scheme. Group A participants will first use a gel ball fitted
cushion for 2 weeks during all daily living activities while seated in their wheelchair followed by use of a
SquishINS fitted cushion for 2 weeks. Group B will first use the SquishINS fitted cushion then a gel
ball fitted cushion. Seated interface pressure distribution will be obtained with the fitted cushion at the
beginning and end of each test period. A dual temperature and humidity sensor placed in the cushion
will enable continuous monitoring of microenvironmental status during use for download at the end of
each test period. The study Research Nurse will also repeat the pelvic region skin check and
participants will complete a questionnaire based on the QUEST 2.0 user satisfaction instrument. All
responses will be documented as part of the QS/DC program.
Our pre-clinical development and user evaluation will provide a strong foundation for translation of
personalized low-cost high-performance modular cushions for effective seated pressure redistribution in
wheelchair users."

The Genomics and Bioinformatics Core (Core C) will provide state-of-the-art sequencing technologies to enable
immunogenomic and epigenomic measurements and corresponding bioinformatics analyses for the proposed
P01 Program Projects. This Core will deploy a wide range of bulk and single cell next generation sequencing
technologies optimized for the preclinical and clinical biospecimens in the Projects. Technologies supported by
this Core include: whole exome sequencing for neoantigen prediction, bulk and single cell RNA-sequencing for
inference of molecular and cellular networks, bulk and single cell T cell receptor sequencing to query T cell
clones and their associated function, and ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq technologies to query epigenetic and tran-
scriptional regulation. These technologies are complemented by optimized bioinformatics pipelines and compu-
tational methods tailored to immunogenomics developed by the Core and Program Investigators. Bioinformatics
methods are tailored to customized analyses of the datasets generated in Program Projects, and proteomics
measurements from the Digital Pathology and Mass Cytometry Core (Core D) to support TME characterization.
This Genomics and Bioinformatics Core will perform further integrative analyses of biospecimens of the thera-
peutic regimens employed across Projects in this Program and promote Program Synergy. The computational
methods employed in this Core will summarize the high-dimensional data to provide low dimensional summaries
to the Biostatistics and Clinical Trials Core (Core B) to identify molecular and cellular determinants of immuno-
therapy response and resistance to support the Projects in defining new therapeutic strategies for precision
immunotherapy.
The Core Co-Leaders combine expertise in genomics technologies (Dr. Yegnasubramanian) and bioinformatics
(Dr. Fertig). In addition to the Program-specific goals, this Core further leverages the existing infrastructure in
the NCI-designated Johns Hopkins University SCCC Core Grant-supported Experimental and Computational
Genomics Core (ECGC; Co-Director Yegnasubramanian; Co-Investigator Fertig). Both Leaders, Fertig and
Yegnasubramanian, have an established track record in Genomics and Bioinformatics in collaboration with one
another and Program Investigators ideally suited to enable the profiling and bioinformatics analysis proposed for
the Program in this Core."

capabilities. The IDC will apply innovative strategies to provide robust research career development resources,
leveraging technology and data science to address disparities in chronic diseases, and mentoring junior faculty
and post-doctoral fellows, and create a holistic, individualized, and rigorous track for each IDC participant. To
achieve these goals, the IDC will pursue three specific aims: 1) To administer a pilot awards program that
supports research projects focused on health disparities in chronic diseases. Projects will be led by ESI, with
an emphasis on supporting those from backgrounds underrepresented in the biomedical research workforce;
2) To ensure mentoring of pilot awardees, particularly those from backgrounds underrepresented in the
biomedical research workforce, to enhance competitiveness for extramural funding. We will provide consistent,
proactive, skilled mentoring to ESI both before and after they apply for pilot awards; and 3) To foster academic
skills development and scientific team building, emphasizing participatory research training for all ESI. The IDC
is envisioned as a magnet and an engine - a magnet that attracts ESI into chronic disease health disparities
research and an engine that nurtures them toward success in NIH grant funding. New extramural grant funding
that results from the overall efforts of, and support provided by, the IDC will ultimately contribute to healthier
communities nationwide."
10897778,"Tackling health disparities requires a transdisciplinary framework that cuts across scientific and
organizational silos to integrate multiple disciplines. Equally important are strong collaborations between
researchers, community- based organizations, healthcare systems, public health agencies, and other
stakeholders. Such a collaborative approach helps ensure that relevant, contextually appropriate research is
conducted and, importantly, that findings can be translated into long-term sustainable community and system-
level changes that promote health equity.
 The Community Engagement Core (CEC) of the Southeast Collaborative for Innovative and
Equitable Solutions to Chronic Disease Disparities (the Center) will bring together institutions, faculty and
community partners with expertise across a range of disciplines – behavioral, social, genetic, and
environmental. To accomplish this, the CEC will pair each academic study team with one local Federally
Qualified Health Center (FQHC)/ FQHC network which will provide community oversight and input to all
programmatic aspects. CEC faculty will also facilitate dynamic ongoing process aimed at engaging the
research teams and FQHC partners in a more participatory engagement approach. The goal of the Center’s
Community Engagement Core (CEC) is to nurture productive bi-directional working relationships between the
academic and consortium partners aimed at addressing diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and related
conditions.
 The CEC’s role will be to ensure the perspective of such partners, representing African American and
Latino communities throughout the Southeast, are integrated into the Center’s priorities and infrastructure by
instituting the following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1. Establish a Community Advisory Board that will provide guidance and direction
on the Center’s overall goals and priorities, provide input regarding strategies to enhance community
engagement, selection of SDH measures, and accelerate implementation, dissemination, and adoption of the
Center’s findings.
Specific Aim 2. Provide community input into the selection and execution of pilot projects.
Specific Aim 3. Foster participatory partnerships between the three large research projects and local FQHCs
in developing, adapting and implementing socially and culturally appropriate interventions addressing
disparities and having outcomes which can be readily tailored to the FQHC context."
10897783,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Tobacco smoking serves as a primary preventable transdiagnostic risk factor that, if targeted more effectively,
could reduce a wide range of health disparities in prevalence, severity, treatment efficacy, and mortality across
many chronic health conditions (e.g., diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea), reduce complexity/multimorbidity, and
reduce healthcare costs by up to 80%. The Southeast, in particular, has an urgent need to disrupt the status quo
of tobacco control (<2% CDC recommend appropriations; highest smoking and mortality) driven in large part
through neglected patterns of SDoH (poverty, access to care) that disproportionately impact racial and ethnic
minorities in the form of greater smoking and chronic diseases, and ultimately nearly a decade of life lost.
Unfortunately, only 5% of smoking cessation attempts last at least one year, with lower success among Black
smokers even though they smoke at similar rates and intensity, and make more quit attempts. Mobile health
(mHealth) may have particular utility in addressing racial disparities. Blacks smokers show high engagement
rates with smartphones to access healthcare and greater adherence to digital interventions, which may facilitate
tailoring to meet distinct needs. There is an urgent need to overcome equity gaps, which will require diversity
and inclusion of individuals from representative races/ethnicities to identify effective treatments. There is a need
for just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) that 1) can be deployed rapidly (ideally before craving occurs),
2) effectively prevent or attenuate cravings quickly, and 3) are amenable to personalized treatment. Our
automated, yet personalized, JITAI app, QuitBuddy, allows patients to prepare for high-risk situations before
they arise, effectively promoting abstinence and preventing relapse. Our overall goals are to optimize smart
algorithms, identify personalized relapse risk, and automatically prompt delivery a real-time, preemptive
manner, upon approaching personalized high-risk locations. Results from a NIDA-funded (K23) pilot randomized
controlled trial demonstrated outstanding usability (top 10% of over 500 apps), acceptability (>80% compliance),
and technical feasibility (<10% GPS data). We build upon these promising data by testing effectiveness in fully
powered and rigorous SMART design, with diverse representation of underserved populations, and meeting
community needs for SDoH interventions. Aims 1&2: Evaluate QuitBuddy and SDoH augmentation intervention
effectiveness for smoking cessation and relapse prevention via pragmatic remote SMART design (N=2,090). We
expect superior 6-month biochemically verified abstinence rates for QuitBuddy and SDoH augmentation
interventions, relative to controls. Exploratory Aims: Test potential moderators/mediators. Our approach
integrates for the first time established theories of relapse risk, evidence-based treatment, smartphone/GPS
technology, and SDoH. As such, this project offers high-impact solutions to address health disparities across a
wide range of chronic diseases that disproportionately affect underserved populations."
10897789,"ABSTRACT
This application is in response to the RFA-MD-21-007, Centers for Multiple Chronic Diseases Associated with
Health Disparities: Prevention, Treatment, and Management. Project 2 of this application will implement a
multilevel intervention to reduce disparities in the diagnosis and management of obstructive sleep apnea to
improve cardiometabolic outcomes. Specifically, this project will implement a randomized clinical trial to test the
hypothesis that treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with positive airway pressure (PAP) and motivational
enhancement therapy (MET) therapy in Black and Hispanic patients improves adherence to PAP therapy and
downstream sequelae including blood pressure, glycemic profiles, and quality of life. OSA-related Intermittent
hypoxemia and sleep fragmentation activate the sympathetic nervous system, increase oxidative stress, and
heighten systemic inflammation. These perturbations can increase blood pressure, decrease insulin sensitivity
and impair β-cell function, and impact quality of life. Poor adherence to PAP therapy is most notable in minority
populations, reflecting multiple individual, and health system level challenges. Over the last decade various
strategies to augment adherence to PAP therapy have been rigorously sought. One successful approach is the
use of MET to improve adherence MET, which is based on the principles of motivational interviewing, is designed
to promote self-efficacy and maximize behavioral change. To address feasibility of implementing MET in
Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC), where access to sub-specialized sleep care is less likely, we
propose screening for and diagnosing OSA using the electronic health record, at home sleep apnea tests, and
training community health workers (CHW) to implement MET. The central scientific premise of this application is
that MET, implemented by CHW trained in motivational interviewing, can improve PAP adherence. Our approach
of using CHWs will provide a feasible, generalizable, and scalable approach to tackling the common problem of
poor PAP adherence in the underserved. Our Specific Aims are as follows. Aim 1: To compare the impact of
MET, with specific attention to social, physical, psychological and environmental barriers (social determinants of
health), delivered by culturally congruent CHWs versus an attention-matched comparator (consisting of
comparable number of calls to discuss general sleep hygiene) on: (a) PAP adherence, (b) blood pressure, (c)
24-hr glycemic profiles, (d) daytime sleepiness, and (e) quality of life at 90 days. Aim 2: To compare the 3, 6,
and 12 month healthcare utilization patterns and costs of care of OSA patients in each study arm. Given the high
prevalence of OSA and medical comorbidities in the minority populations, findings from this trial would have a
major impact on both clinical practice and public health, justifying early case identification and treatment of OSA
in underserved populations."
10897806,"Abstract
The majority of new cancers that were diagnosed and the majority of cancer related deaths worldwide occurred
in low-and-middle income countries (LMICs) in 2018. This is in striking contrast to more developed countries
where cancer care and outcomes are improving. One driver of this difference is the human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) which predisposes those who are infected to develop certain cancers. Despite the burden of cancer
in LMICs, there is a lack of organized research and support services to see to the successful outcomes of
research programs. In the case of cervical cancer, the confluence of high HIV prevalence, disparity in resources
and lack of infrastructure in research results in high burden of what could be a preventable disease. The overall
objective of this proposal is to improve the screening, prevention, and knowledge of the mechanisms of cancer
development as it relates to cervical cancer in Kenyan and Ugandan women. In HIV-infected women and
uninfected women, cervical cancer is caused by persistent infection of human papillomavirus (HPV). Though
infection with HPV is relatively common, only a small percentage of women will develop cervical cancer.
Environmental factors unique to Kenya and Uganda may also contribute to the increase in cervical cancer burden
in this area of the world. There is also a lack of understanding of the human molecular mechanisms and viral
(HPV and HIV) work together to promote cancer development. The investigation of how all of these factors
(environmental, viral, human behavioral and biological) interact in Kenyan and Ugandan women is the overall
objective of this program project. The role of the Translational Biology Core (TBC) is to support the scientific
endeavors outlined in the three projects and to provide an environment conducive to the training of new African
scientists in the field of HIV-associated malignancies. Not only will the TBC process and store samples collected
during the study period, it will also continue augment the biorepository that will provide samples for ongoing
research in Oncology in East Africa. As a part of this proposal, the TBC will be improving data sharing resources
in partnership with the International Epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS in East Africa (IeDEA-EA) so that
data generated in Kenya and Uganda can be freely shared among members of the consortium. In doing so, the
care provided to women in Kenya and Uganda with cervical cancer will improve."
10897809,"ABSTRACT
The goal of the Developmental Core is to enhance the research training, leadership capacity and professional
networking for junior Kenyan and Ugandan health care professionals who are interested in addressing research
questions regarding HIV-associated malignancies. This U54 renewal application continues to focus on
strengthening research capacity related to human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical cancer in HIV-infected
women of East Africa. In Kenya, coordination will be through the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare
(AMPATH) partnership which consists of a collaborative network of North American academic medical schools,
Moi University and Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital. In Uganda, coordination will be with the International
Epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) Collaboration and Makerere University that has fostered
collaborative research mentoring through participation in the Afya Bora Consortium; an interprofessional program
fostering global health leadership. This Core brings together our collective expertise to rapidly advance research
capacity focused on HIV-associated malignancies and to help develop the next generation of Kenyan and
Ugandan research leaders through the following Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1: To leverage the current and future U54 Project cohort data to enhance the translational
and population-based HIV/AIDS and HIV-Associated Malignancy peer-reviewed research in East Africa.
Through a competitive application process, we will award 4-6 pilot projects each year. Each mentee will be
matched to a primary scientific mentor, assigned a designated site mentor, and supervised by a Research
Advisory Committee (RAC) consisting of team members with relevant professional and technical expertise.
Mentoring will include research methodologies, implementation, grant writing skills, budgeting and financial
management. Mentees are expected to submit first-author publications and an external grant application.
Specific Aim 2: To establish a mentorship and leadership development program to promote research in
HIV-associated malignancies for Kenyan and Ugandan healthcare professionals. There are unique skills
developed by researchers when their study populations are HIV-infected and/or have cancer, which are chronic
diseases often associated with poor prognoses and long-term care. Training modules and professional
development tools from the Afya Bora Consortium will be modified to address these challenges. Systematic
evaluations will inform the development of sustainable mentorship and leadership development programs.
Specific Aim 3: To develop sustainable professional networking and collaborative research mechanisms
that unite Kenyan and Ugandan healthcare professionals and trainees. Monthly seminars will strengthen
this newly established collaboration and showcase inter-related and complementary research projects. Junior
trainees will have an opportunity to apply for Travel Awards so they may present at scientific conferences,
thereby expanding their professional network and gaining recognition in their field."
10897815,"Abstract
Current estimates indicate that every year 5,250 women (crude rate 20.5) are diagnosed with cervical cancer in
Kenya and 3,286 (crude rate 12.8) die from the disease. Cervical cancer ranks as the 2nd most frequent cancer
among women in Kenya and the 1st most frequent cancer among women between 15-44 years of age. About
9.1% of women in the general population are estimated to harbor human papillomavirus (HPV) 16/18 and 63.1%
of invasive cervical cancers are attributed to HPV 16/18. In Uganda, cervical cancer is the number one cause of
cancer related death in women. 6,413 Ugandan women (crude rate 28.8) are diagnosed with cervical cancer
and 4,301(crude rate 19.3) die from the disease. About 3.6% of the general population harbor HPV 16/18 and
57% of invasive cancer is attributable to HPV 16/18. HIV-infected women have higher prevalence, incidence,
and persistence of HPV infections, more so in women with severe immune compromise. HIV has been shown
to increase the risk of the development, progression and recurrence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Several
studies have consistently shown that HIV-infected women present higher risk of CIN persistence or recurrence
after standard therapy . Both Kenya and Uganda have high prevalence for HIV/AIDS at 7% and 12.9%,
respectively. In settings where loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) is available, accessible and
appropriate, treatment with LEEP is recommended by the WHO. However, there is a paucity of studies assessing
the efficacy of LEEP among HIV-infected women and the characteristics of CIN2/3 lesions after LEEP. The core
objective of this application is to understand the natural history of recurrent CIN2/3 lesions among HIV-infected
women after LEEP. To help guide management based on HIV/HPV science, we propose an epidemiologic and
immunohistochemical study of the cervix following LEEP to address the value of destruction of the cervical
transformation zone to prevent cancer. We propose to enroll 300 HIV-infected women with CIN2/3 undergoing
LEEP and follow them every 6 months for 2 years with colposcopy and biopsy when appropriate. We will do a
repeat LEEP for recurrent CIN2/3 lesions.
The Specific Aims for this proposed study are:
1. To assess the incidence and risk factors for “recurrent” CIN2/3 after LEEP among HIV- infected women.
2. To determine baseline HR-HPV types (in tissue) among HIV-infected women with CIN2/3 undergoing LEEP
compared to the HR-HPV types with “recurrent” cervical lesions after a second LEEP.
3. To determine the immunohistochemical differences between the initial and repeat LEEP specimens among
HIV-infected women with “recurrent” CIN2/3"
10897816,"Abstract
 High-risk human papillomaviruses (HR HPVs) are the causative agent for cervical cancer, with more than
80% of cases clustered in low and middle income countries (LMIC), and a further concentration in African
countries like Kenya and Uganda. There are preventive vaccines against HPV, but less than 2% of the world’s
target population has received them. This leaves millions of women at risk for cervical cancer. We need to
understand how HR HPV affects its host cell, dysregulates its environment, and, in regions with high rates of co-
infection of HR HPV and HIV, synergizes with HIV to drive cancer development and progression in women.
 The greatest clinical risk factor for cervical cancer development is a persistent HR HPV infection. When
HR HPV infects the cervix, it changes the typical, sequential activation of cellular growth and differentiation
pathways both to support the HR HPV infection and to foster cancer development. In the presence of HIV, the
pathways and functions of HR HPV infected host cells are further disrupted, leading a more rapid progression to
cancer. We hypothesize that HR HPV infections manifest in predictable cellular gene expression changes that
are detectable in cervical samples, biopsy tissues, and peripheral blood. With HIV co-infection, we hypothesize
an additional, overlapping subset of augmented or unique gene expression changes are also detectable. As a
collective, these changes can serve as functional biomarkers to prospectively identify precancerous lesions and,
in the context of her HIV status, to stratify a woman’s future cervical cancer risk. Identifying and validating these
biomarkers is the goal of Specific Aim 1.
 In addition to cellular biomarkers that predict cancer risk, the type and variant of HR HPVs is an important
predictor of morbidity and mortality associated with a cervical cancer diagnosis. Currently, there is a lack of
foundational data on the genetic landscape of variants of HPV 16, the most common HR HPV type in invasive
cervical cancers in Kenya and Uganda. We hypothesize that specific HPV 16 variants add to this region’s cervical
cancer risk; generating detailed data on HPV 16 variants is the goal of Specific Aim 2.
Our specific aims are: (1) Determine differences in host gene expression that prospectively discriminate
among HIV+ and HIV- women the risk for cervical dysplasia and precancerous lesions. We will leverage the
synchronous collection of cervical swabs and tissue, blood, and a clinical exam by visual inspection to quantify
host gene expression changes linked to pathology. (2) Determine the HPV 16 variants found in HIV+ and HIV-
women. We will investigate HPV 16 variants and conduct whole genome sequencing to create a detailed picture
of HPV 16 genetic polymorphisms. Through investigations of HR HPV, its host cells, and HR HPV in the context
of HIV, we will determine the biologic and virologic signatures designating a HIV+ or HIV- woman at risk for
cervical cancer development and progression. Studies for both aims will be performed in Kenya and Uganda,
expanding scientific research techniques and future pipelines of investigators in Sub-Saharan Africa."
10897841,"The Mid-Atlantic Center for Cardiometabolic Health Equity (MACCHE) will establish an Investigator
Development (ID) Core with two objectives: (1) to promote career development for Early-Stage Investigators
establishing research careers focused on health disparities for chronic diseases; and (2) enhancing diversity of
the workforce in this area of biomedical research. MACCHE includes a partnership between The Johns
Hopkins University (JHU) and University of Maryland Baltimore (UMB) – both of which have Centers for Health
Equity and both of which are centers of excellence for biomedical research. To accomplish its objectives, the
Investigator Development Core has established three specific aims:
Aim #1. To establish a pilot project program for postdoctoral fellows, early career faculty and other Early-Stage
Investigators to support innovative research related to chronic disease disparities. The pilot award program will
solicit applications from early-stage investigators at JHU, UMB, Morgan State University, community partners,
and the surrounding Mid-Atlantic region who have an interest in addressing chronic, cardiometabolic disease
disparities. MACCHE's pilot program will work deliberately to promote pilot applications from persons from
underrepresented groups in biomedical research, including those who have faced disadvantage, disability, or
come from an under-represented racial/ethnic group. After research applications undergo peer review,
applications will be selected for funding based on scientific merit as assessed by peer review in combination
with strategic considerations as determined by MACCHE's Steering Committee.
Aim #2. To create a multidisciplinary mentoring network and community for pilot project awardees (“MACCHE
health equity scholars”) inclusive of senior faculty with health equity expertise. With oversight by MACCHE's ID
Core, Early-Stage Investigators receiving MACCHE pilot awards will establish mentoring committees including
a primary mentor and two co-mentors to provide overall career mentoring in scholar's background discipline.
When possible, we will match scholars with a `national' mentor from another one of the P50 programs. In
addition, one of our Core program faculty advisors will oversee the scholar's progress in the program.
Aim #3. To support Early-Stage Investigators with structured didactic training to promote ethical, scientifically
rigorous, and reproducible research to address chronic disease disparities. Pilot grant awardees will be
required to participate in didactic training on “Responsible Conduct of Research” and “Scientific Rigor and
Reproducibility” offered at one of the parent institutions. In addition, they will be encouraged to participate in
other career development opportunities, including courses on Grant Writing, Scholar Skills and Community-
Building, and Writing Accountability Groups. By providing pilot research funding in combination with enhanced
mentoring, MACCHE's Pilot Award Program will promote innovative multi-disciplinary chronic disease
disparities research in the region and also enhance the diversity of the biomedical research workforce."
10897848,"Community Engagement Core Project Summary
The values and principles underlying community-engaged research have led to its prominence as an essential
strategy for conducting health disparities research, particularly in the realm of cardiometabolic conditions. By
centering the equitable engagement of all collaborating partners during each stage of the research process,
community-engaged research holds promise for supporting the cultural relevance, translation, and
dissemination of promising interventions that disrupt the relationships between socially patterned structural
factors, and the consequent emergence of health inequities. However, it is not enough to merely consult with
or involve stakeholders in the research enterprise. To fully realize the power of community-engaged research,
stakeholder partners must be positioned and acknowledged as leaders, co-creators, and co-developers. This
requires intentional efforts to amplify stakeholders' influence throughout every phase of the research process
through shared leadership and ownership.
The Community Engagement Core (CEC) of the proposed Mid-Atlantic Center for Cardiometabolic Health
Equity (MACCHE), jointly led by Dr. Lisa A. Cooper, Reverend Debra Hickman, and Dr. Chidinma A. Ibe,
will serve as the MACCHE's focal point for cultivating, organizing, and promoting bi-directional learning and
communication between consortium partners and a robust cadre of multisectoral stakeholders. To accomplish
this goal, we will employ best-practices in community-based participatory research to ensure that the voices
and perspectives of marginalized communities are embedded into the fabric of MACCHE's research and
training initiatives. Specifically, we will 1) construct and implement a shared governance structure that places
stakeholders as leaders within the Center and its studies; 2) advance, facilitate, and evaluate MACCHE's
community-engaged research efforts, and 3) co-design strategies to translate, disseminate, and sustain
MACCHE initiatives. Taken together, these efforts will cultivate an environment of collaboration that amplifies
the lived experiences and expertise of our partners to facilitate the translation, dissemination, adoption, and
sustainability of our interventions and key research findings. This has implications for the success of our
research and for advancing health equity in the Mid-Atlantic region."
10897851,"Summary/Abstract: Project 1
Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may have hundreds of cycles over the night of loss of airway
dilator motor tone and airway obstruction, followed by apnea, which is ended by an arousal, in which there is
EEG desynchronization accompanied by return of airway dilator muscle tone, opening of the airway, and re-
established ventilation. The EEG arousals cause sleep fragmentation and loss, resulting in cognitive
impairment, and metabolic and cardiovascular consequences. We hypothesize that by augmenting brain
circuits that keep the airway open while suppressing the EEG arousals, we can prevent these outcomes. We
previously demonstrated that the EEG arousal to CO2 depends upon a population of CGRP neurons in the
parabrachial nucleus (PBCGRP neurons). We now have identified a population of neurons expressing the
transcription factor FoxP2 (PBFoxP2 neurons) which are just lateral to the PBCGRP neurons and which appear to
be responsible for much of the increase in ventilation and in EMG tone of the genioglossus muscle (GG-EMG),
an airway dilator, during CO2 exposure. In Specific Aim 1 we plan to use Channelrhodopsin2 to
optogenetically activate PBFoxP2 neurons at baseline and during CO2 arousal, and will measure changes in
respiratory rate, tidal volume, minute ventilation, and GG-EMG. We hypothesize that we can increase the
respiratory response to CO2 in this way. We will then activate specific terminal fields of the PBFoxP2 neurons in
the dorsal (nucleus of the solitary tract, hypoglossal nucleus) and ventral (preBötzinger complex, caudal
ventrolateral medulla) to determine which of these contribute to the overall respiratory response. In Specific
Aim 2 we will use ArchaerhodopsinT to inhibit the PBFoxP2 neurons or their terminal fields in the medulla, at
baseline and during CO2 exposure, to see which are required for the respiratory response to CO2. Specific
Aim 3 will use GCaMP6 calcium imaging to examine the responses of PBFoxP2 and PBCGRP neurons to CO2
arousal. We will examine this initially with fiber photometry, but then will record the responses of individual
FoxP2 or CGRP neurons in the PB during CO2 arousal and other stimuli, to determine whether there are
subsets within these groups that respond to specific classes of stimuli. Finally, in Specific Aim 4, we will use
chemogenetics to enhance the firing of the PBFoxP2 neurons with the hM3Dq excitatory receptor and to
suppress the firing of the PBCGRP neurons with the hGlyR inhibitory receptor. We plan then to combine these
approaches in single animals to provide a proof of principle that selective and simultaneous activation of
PBFoxP2 neurons and inhibition of PBCGRP neurons can allow a vigorous respiratory response, including
increased GG-EMG in response to CO2 during sleep, without resulting in EEG arousal."

The goal of the Administrative and Coordinating (A&C) Core is to oversee the administration of the East Africa
Consortium for HPV and Cervical Cancer (EACHC) in Women Living with HIV/AIDS. The A&C Core coordinates
the activities of all investigators involved on three projects and the three additional cores (Biostatistics and Data
Management; Translational Biology; and Developmental), and to facilitate communication within and between
the North American, Ugandan and Kenyan institutions and other organizations in which the EACHC will directly
interact. The Administrative and Coordinating Core will also be responsible for dissemination of information
within participants of the EACHC, and outside of the EACHC through an External Advisory Committee, which
will provide additional advice on pilot projects and on mechanisms to enhance community outreach and
engagement.
The rationale for central communication and data flow through this centralized approach is to maximize intra-
institutional, inter-institutional and inter-country collaborations through this unique partnership and to adjudicate
any potential conflicts as they arise.
The specific services provided by this Core follow from its Aims:
Specific Aim 1: To facilitate communication, resolve potential conflicts and maximize the research infrastructure
supporting the investigators of each of the EACHC projects and cores;
Specific Aim 2: To disseminate research findings between the consortium members in East Africa and North
America; and
Specific Aim 3: To leverage the research conducted by the EACHC with the community stakeholders with other

10897846,"Summary: Core A
Core A is the Administrative Core for the Program Project. It includes two main aims: to provide
administrative support and financial management support for the Projects and Cores. The
administrative support includes organizing triweekly meetings of the Project and Core Leaders
(the Executive Committee) and all PPG investigators. The Executive Committee addresses all
issues related to scientific progress, plans for future meetings, and when necessary (in closed
session) personnel issues. The meeting of all of the PPG investigators (including all of the
workers associated with the PPG Projects or Cores in all labs that are involved) usually
numbers about 25 people, and is a forum for presenting ongoing work on a regular, continuing
basis. This allows comments and criticisms that refine the scientific approach and data
analysis. The Administrative Core also organizes meetings of the Internal Advisory Board (on
years 1, 3, and 5 of the PPG) and of the External Advisory Board (on years 2 and 4). The
Internal Advisory Board, which will be chaired by Dr. Gene Nattie, who will also attend the tri-
weekly meetings, will consist of local investigators with an interest in the science that is being
done. They will also be invited to the External Advisory Board meetings, as participants. The
External Advisory Board meetings will review progress, give advice on next steps, and help to
refine the quality of the science in the PPG group. Financial administration under Core A will
include providing monthly updates to investigators on their budgets, and helping with annual
reports to the NIH. It will also report back to the Program Director who will track expenditures,
and work with investigators who fall behind in their scientific work or exceed their budgets.
Core A will provide necessary services to allow the Projects and Cores to work together
smoothly and to achieve their Aims."

10897852,"Project Summary/Abstract
Innovation in chronic disease management is urgently needed to effectively control hypertension (HTN) and
diabetes, conditions which affect millions of Americans. Uncontrolled HTN and diabetes cause cardiovascular
disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and premature death. However, these conditions are poorly
controlled despite the availability of effective and affordable therapy. A pressing priority is reducing disparities
in the management and control of chronic diseases and making primary care more convenient for underserved
populations. Black and Hispanic adults are disproportionately affected by HTN and diabetes than White adults.
They also experience more adverse social determinants of health, including a lack of access to reliable
transportation and fragmented access to primary care. Team-based care including community health workers
and pharmacists are “best practices” in improving HTN and diabetes control. Telehealth has become a
cornerstone of efforts to minimize disruptions in primary care and can be enhanced with remote patient
monitoring devices. The COVID-19 pandemic has spurred efforts to increase access to timely and appropriate
care through re-engineering primary care to be patient-centered and digitally-enabled. Sphygmo Home, a
remote patient telemonitoring solution that links with validated blood pressure (BP) and glucose monitoring
devices is a promising solution to improve patient's self-management of HTN and diabetes. We have designed
the LINKED-HEARTS Program, an innovative, theoretically derived, patient-centered, multi-level intervention
to address individual and community-level social determinants that affect chronic disease management. The
LINKED-HEARTS Program focuses on addressing structural issues of access and includes a self-measured
BP(SMBP) and blood glucose telemonitoring platform; team-based care including a pharmacist and community
health worker and provider-level interventions. Using a hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation design, our
proposed specific aims are 1) To compare the effect of the LINKED-HEARTS Program versus SMBP alone in
improving BP control (systolic BP<140/90 mm Hg) and improving patient-centered outcomes at 6 and 12 months,
in a cluster-randomized controlled trial of adults with uncontrolled HTN and either diabetes or CKD. 2) To use
the Pragmatic Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) to evaluate the reach, adoption,
maintenance of the LINKED-HEARTS program at 12 and 24 months post-randomization and explore contextual
factors that associated with adoption and maintenance of the program. We will enroll 600 adults, clustered in 16
practices including federally qualified healthcare centers. Through early and continued stakeholder engagement
with health system leaders, providers, patients, and our community, we seek to close the wide “know-do-gap”
and reduce chronic disease disparities. We also propose a comprehensive dissemination strategy to reach
critical audiences and achieve buy-in and policy change."

 In people with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), airflow obstruction results in hypercarbia and other signals
that increase ventilation, dilate the airway, and also trigger cortical arousals from sleep. Current therapies such
as CPAP focus on airway opening, but compliance with these therapies is poor, and many patients continue to
have daytime sleepiness. As recurrent arousals from sleep contribute to daytime sleepiness and other
consequences of OSA, new methods that maintain sleep in OSA without disrupting ventilation would address
an important, unmet need in OSA treatment.
 In the last cycle of this P01, Dr. Saper’s group (Project 1) showed that calcitonin gene-related peptide
(CGRP) neurons of the lateral parabrachial nucleus are necessary for cortical arousals in response to
hypercapnia. Specifically, inactivation of PBCGRP neurons substantially delays or eliminates cortical arousals in
response to hypercapnia without blunting ventilatory responses. Thus, the PBCGRP neurons are essential for
driving cortical arousals, but they are not necessary for ventilatory responses to hypercapnia. We hypothesize
that activation of inhibitory inputs to the PBCGRP neurons will delay or eliminate cortical arousals to hypercapnia
without altering ventilatory responses.
 Our Aims seek to identify these inputs and their receptors on the PBCGRP neurons, with the ultimate goal of
selectively reducing activity in the PBCGRP neurons to prevent cortical arousals while preserving ventilatory
responses. This Project synergizes well with Projects 1, 3, and 4 that seek to enhance ventilatory responses to
hypercapnia in mice, and Project 5 which seeks to identify pharmacological methods to improve OSA in
people. We will first use conditional and conventional tracing methods to identify afferents to the PBCGRP
neurons, and then we will use Channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping (CRACM) to establish synaptic
connectivity. Using single cell sequencing techniques, we will then identify receptors expressed by the PBCGRP
neurons, and confirm receptor expression using in situ hybridization and in vitro calcium imaging. We will then
use fos and fiber photometry to determine which afferent pathways to the PBCGRP neurons are sleep-active.
Last, we will determine whether signaling through inhibitory inputs to the PBCGRP neurons delays or eliminates
cortical arousals triggered by brief period of hypercapnia. We will measure the latency to cortical arousal after
hypercapnia in combination with photostimulation of inhibitory inputs to the PBCGRP neurons and then with
pharmacological inhibition of the PBCGRP neurons.
 Collectively, these multidisciplinary experiments will identify crucial anatomical and neurochemical inputs to
the PBCGRP neurons that should provide new pharmacological opportunities for maintaining sleep in OSA
without inhibiting airway opening."
10897858,"Project Summary/ Abstract- Project 3
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent breathing disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of
partial and complete airway obstructions that occur exclusively during sleep. OSA poses a significant public
health burden due to its being associated with the development of adverse cardiovascular, cognitive, and
endocrine conditions. With high relevance to the current proposal, reestablishment of airway patency following
an obstructive event is often associated with arousal from sleep (defined by activation of the EEG), resulting in
sleep fragmentation, reduced sleep time, and excessive daytime sleepiness in many cases. This disruption of
sleep continuity is thought to underlie many of the pathological consequences of OSA. Numerous failed
attempts to treat OSA pharmacologically by enhancing ventilatory drive have been limited by unwanted
increases in arousability that accompany ventilatory augmentation. Hence, development of methods to
enhance ventilatory responses without driving cortical arousal in response to hypercapnia would be a major
advance with translational impact for OSA. The detailed circuits underling respiratory versus cortical arousals
in response to hypercapnia — including key cell groups, their targets and their transmitters — remains,
however, incompletely understood. This knowledge gap has hampered the development of pharmacological
strategies to treat OSA. The objective in this particular application is to demonstrate a role for CO2-responsive,
glutamatergic FoxP2 neurons of the lateral crescent parabrachial nucleus (PBclFoxP2) in driving ventilation
independent of arousal. The central hypothesis is that activation of select forebrain inputs to the PBclFoxP2
neurons will enhance the ventilatory response to hypercapnia without driving cortical arousals. The rationale
for the proposed research is that successful demarcation of cortical versus respiratory arousal components of
hypercapnia circuitry would enable pharmacological treatment strategies for OSA that derive their clinical
benefit from the dissociation of the respiratory and arousal responses to hypercapnia. Guided by strong
preliminary data, our hypotheses will be tested by pursuing four specific aims: 1) Identify and map presynaptic
forebrain inputs to PBclFoxP2 neurons; 2) through transcriptome analysis, uncover unique and “druggable”
receptors on CO2-responsive vlPB cells, including the PBclFoxP2 cell population; 3) define the state-dependent
activity of presynaptic forebrain inputs to PBcl neurons; and 4) determine whether signaling from delimited,
neurochemically-defined forebrain inputs can augment the ventilatory response to hypercarbia. The approach
is intellectually and technically innovative because of its emphasis on forebrain inputs to PBclFoxP2 neurons in
the context of ventilatory control, and because it employs a novel combination of newly developed and
validated technical approaches. This work is significant because it is one of several key steps in a continuum of
research that is expected to lead to the identification and development of a clinically practical drug that can
reestablish airway patency in OSA patients without producing sleep disruption."

Black and Latinx women have the highest prevalence of obesity3. Women entering pregnancy with obesity
have an excess risk of gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders, and acute cardiovascular event during
labor and delivery, compared to normal weight women4,5. Because pregnant women are motivated to have a
healthy baby, pregnancy provides the ideal “teachable moment” to not only reduce adverse pregnancy
outcomes, but ultimately prevent long-term CMD in women and their infants28,29. Lifestyle interventions
addressing obesity in pregnancy have the potential to break the cycle of obesity and cardiometabolic disease
(CMD) for Black and Latinx women8. However, despite evidence of effectiveness, few lifestyle interventions
have been tested among Black or Latinx pregnant women or been implemented in community-based settings,
where many high risk pregnant and postpartum women access safety-net services. To address this gap, we
will leverage our team's experience designing and testing an evidence-based pregnancy/postpartum health
coaching intervention that is remotely delivered (phone coaching using motivational interviewing + web-based
platform + mobile phone behavioral tracking). Along with our Maryland home visiting partners, we will adapt
and implement H42/H4U into the home visiting setting, i.e., H42/H4U-HV and tailor the intervention for Latinx
and Spanish speaking women. Early home visiting is an evidence-based public health service strategy found in
all 50 states that targets services to high-risk communities to address adverse social determinants of health.
Home visitors provide health education, promote positive parenting and early learning, and link families with
needed community resources10. While home visiting programs don't universally prioritize CMD risk in their
services, they are an ideal service-strategy for integration of a healthy lifestyle intervention. We will use a
hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation randomized control trial to compare the effectiveness of H42/H4U-
HV integrated into home visiting compared with usual home visiting services in reducing postpartum weight
retention (difference between pre-pregnancy weight and weight at 6 months postpartum) among 360 pregnant
and postpartum women. We will also evaluate the implementation of the intervention to enable and sustain
integration into home visiting. Health Disparities Impact. A tailored and targeted remotely-delivered health
coaching intervention implemented into early home visiting has potential to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors
and eliminate disparities in obesity, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and long-term CMD among young high risk
Black and Latinx pregnant and postpartum women and their infants. Our research approach allows us to not
only establish the effectiveness of H42/H4U-HV but also understand the factors that enable intervention
implementation to inform sustainability, further the pathway from evidence translation into practice, and
facilitate greater subsequent public health impact11."
10897860,"Project Summary
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a debilitating condition leaving 14%-49% of middle-aged adults with
excessive daytime sleepiness and impaired cognitive, metabolic, and cardiovascular functioning. Treatments
beyond the often poorly tolerated CPAP remain limited, despite this unmet medical need. This Program Project
seeks to identify new intervention points in neural brain circuits to combat OSA. In OSA, the activity of muscles
that keep the airway open drops leading to airway collapse and impeded ventilation. Tissue and blood oxygen
levels fall and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels rise (hypercapnia). This leads to an intensification of breathing
movements, meant to improve ventilation, but which only worsen the airway collapse by generating negative
pressure. Once a threshold of hypercapnia is reached, the brain arouses, rapidly leading to robust airway
opening, resumption of ventilation, and return to sleep. This OSA cycle occurs many times per night,
fragmenting sleep and inflicting autonomic surges underlying vasoconstriction and tachycardia that drive much
of the comorbidity. Our Program seeks to identify neural brain circuits to optimize the activity of muscles that
keep the airway open and to augment breathing (Respiratory Augmentation) without arousing the brain. In
Project 4, we focus on the serotonergic neuronal system in the lower brainstem in mice, leveraging our team’s
recent discovery of two genetically distinct subtypes of serotonergic neurons each critical for a robust
ventilatory response to hypercapnia, yet each acting on largely distinct components of the neural respiratory
arousal circuit. The subtype denoted Egr2-Pet1 increases respiratory drive by connections to centers that
measure pCO2 and that mediate arousal, whereas the second subtype, denoted Tac1-Pet1, sends connections
to motor centers that control airway dilation and inspiration. By modulating these subtypes separately it may be
possible to a) optimize airway dilator tone to avoid airway closure, b) optimize ventilation to avoid exacerbation
of airway closure, c) optimize EEG arousal threshold to reduce sleep fragmentation, and d) avoid
cardiovascular stress. In Aim 1, we will study how Egr2-Pet1 and Tac1-Pet1 populations modulate each of
these different functions during wake, sleep, and arousal, enabled via intersectional chemogenetic tools in
combination with a Repeated-CO2-Arousal model for OSA, while measuring diaphragm and airway dilator
muscle activity, brain activity, heart rate, and respiratory rate and depth. In Aim 2, we will use in vivo and in
vitro optogenetic and calcium imaging tools to determine circuit nodes to which Egr2-Pet1 and Tac1-Pet1
neurons functionally connect, relevant for airway dilation, ventilation, and arousal. In Aim 3, we will visualize
the circuit nodes from which Tac1-Pet1 and Egr2-Pet1 neurons receive input. Throughout, we will query
response dependence on serotonin receptors, relevant for pharmacological strategies in OSA. Collectively,
results from this work have the potential to transform our understanding of and approaches to prevent OSA."
10897861,"Abstract/ Summary: Project 5
OSA is a common and debilitating condition that currently has no effective pharmacotherapy. In the previous
PPG, we identified a drug combination (atomoxetine + oxybutynin) that lowered the apnea-hypopnea index by
74% and raised the nadir oxygen saturation from 84% to 94%. Despite these encouraging results, some
patients experienced antimuscarinic side effects from oxybutynin. Furthermore, subsequent mechanistic
studies revealed that oxybutynin was acting primarily as a sedative (counteracting atomoxetine), rather than a
pharyngeal muscle stimulant. Therefore, the goal of the current grant is to find a better sedative than
oxybutynin to add to atomoxetine. This will be accomplished by first testing common, non-myorelaxing
sedatives (Aim 1). Then, in Aim 2 we will test sedatives identified from Projects 1-4 that specifically block CO2-
mediated arousals (but not CO2-mediated respiratory/pharyngeal muscle responses). As described in the
other grants accompanying this PPG, Projects 2 and 4 are expected to identify serotonin subreceptors on
parabrachial CGRP neurons (PBCGRP) that can be antagonized to prevent EEG arousal in response to elevated
CO2. Additionally, Projects 3 and 4 will focus on identifying serotonin subreceptors on a separate group of
parabrachial neurons (PBFoxP2) that could be manipulated pharmacologically to augment upper airway dilator
tone. Of note, preliminary studies suggest that PBCGRP neurons are activated by a different subset of serotonin
receptors than the PBFoxP2 neurons, thus allowing us to potentially target these two parabrachial regions
independently. Therefore, Aim 2 will test specific serotonin agonists/antagonists, with or without atomoxetine
(as necessary), to activate airway muscles without inducing arousals. Finally, in Aim 3 a one-month clinical trial
will be performed on the most effective drugs emerging from Aims 1 and 2 (if no such drugs are found, then the
original atomoxetine + oxybutynin combination will be studied). As the human component to this PPG, Project
5 will utilize the information gleaned from the animal experiments to build upon the exciting results of the
previous PPG and move the field closer towards a potential pharmacotherapy for OSA."
10897863,"Summary
Heart failure (HF) is associated with high morbidity, mortality and costs, and there is great interest in refining
strategies to reduce HF risk. Diabetes (DM) and low socioeconomic status (SES) are each independent risk
factors for HF, and both factors together have a synergistic association with incident HF. A major functional
consequence of these associations is impaired cardiorespiratory fitness, with implications for prognosis and
quality of life. Additionally, low SES and DM are over-represented among racial and ethnic minorities and
therefore a cause of HF disparities. Strategies to address the high HF risk associated with the combination of
low SES and DM will require a focus on social determinants of health. Problem-solving training and community
health worker (CHW) support are effective in overcoming barriers to care, and improving lifestyle, DM self-
management, health system engagement and risk factor control, but they have not yet been applied to
addressing HF risk. Prevention efforts would be further informed by understanding geographic disparities in HF
risk and elucidating clinical risk factors that might serve as targets for intervention. We therefore propose a
randomized trial among 350 persons with low SES, DM, obesity and early cardiac dysfunction, testing the
effects of a multi-level intervention of problem-solving training, CHW support and partnership with community
facilities to support lifestyle change on fitness, risk factor control, markers of cardiac injury/fibrosis and quality
of life. We propose: Aim 1: To use electronic medical record data to a) compare the association of
neighborhood SES with incident HF in patients with DM, across urban, rural and suburban settings,
and b) to identify modifiable clinical risk factors for HF associated with DM that are more prevalent in
persons with low SES. Aim 2: To adapt an evidence-based, pragmatic intervention to improve
functional status and risk factor control in persons with low SES, DM, obesity and early cardiac
dysfunction, using community-based participatory research (CBPR) and patient-centered outcomes
research (PCOR) principles. Aim 3: To test, in a randomized controlled trial, if a 1-year multilevel
intervention of problem-solving training, CHW use to enhance social support and health system
engagement, and use of community facilities to support lifestyle change improves cardiorespiratory
fitness and related outcomes in those with low SES, DM, obesity and early cardiac dysfunction, more
than enhanced education and connection with community health programs. This work will elucidate
strategies to address HF risk related to low SES and DM, which are key contributors to HF disparities."

 (Core B)
Large Animal Model and Electrophysiology Core
Experiments in large mammals are a defining feature of this P01. All three projects require analyses of cardiac
function in neonatal or adult pigs, but the housing, surgical, and analytical requirements are too expensive to be
conducted in an individual laboratory and typically require expertise in the use of specialized and sophisticated
equipment. Thus, the Large Animal Core (Core B) will provide a centralized facility for all surgical procedures
(e.g., induction of myocardial injury, treatment administration, perioperative care), cardiac functional
assessments (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], hemodynamics), and electrophysiological evaluations
(programmed electrical stimulation, implanted loop recorders, optical mapping). Core B will be located at the
University of Alabama at Birmingham in the Cardiac Rhythm Management Laboratory (CRML), and animals will
be housed at the adjacent Animal Resource Program (ARP). Collectively, these two facilities have all of the
resources and equipment needed to conduct our proposed experiments and are staffed by an exceptionally
skilled, efficient, and experienced team of investigators, cardiac surgeons, veterinarians, and technicians. The
responsibilities of Core B are organized under the following three Specific Aims (SAs): SA 1, Induction of
myocardial injury in neonatal and adult pigs; SA 2, Delivery of experimental therapy (i.e., transplantation
of engineered human myocardial tissue patches [hMTPs] or state-of-the-art [AAV- or modRNA-mediated] gene
delivery); and SA 3, Electrophysiological and functional assessments. Core B will also collect tissues,
prepare biological samples for histological and molecular analysis, coordinate the shipment of tissues and
samples to all Projects, and ensure that all experimental data, protocols, reports, and other documentation are
securely stored, archived, and shared among Projects and Cores. Notably, all experimental procedures will be
rigorously and consistently defined and executed for all Projects, which will accelerate the pace of scientific
discovery by enabling us to draw valid conclusions from comparisons across the full range of experiments
conducted under this PPG."

 (Project 1)
 Endogenous and Exogenous Mechanisms that Promote
Myocardial Remuscularization in Postinfarction LV Remodeling
 The molecular and cellular basis for progressive heart failure is the result of the inability of damaged and
apoptotic myocytes to be replaced. While a number of cell- and tissue-based therapies can limit this dysfunction,
the proportion of cells that survive at the site of administration for more than a few weeks after transplantation is
extremely low. As such, substantial remuscularization of the infarcted region has rarely been reported; and when
limited remuscularization has been reported, it is frequently accompanied by potentially lethal ventricular
arrhythmias of unknown mechanism. This proposal aims at remuscularization of the injured ventricle by the
definition of key endogenous factors that regulate and promote the cell cycle of the native cardiomyocyte (CM),
and from exogenous transplanted bioengineered cardiac muscle patch (hCMP) that overexpresses key
regulators of CM cell cycle, and will incorporate a functional vascular network and recapitulate some of the key
micro environmental cues of native heart tissue. We recently established a novel hiPSC cell line with MHC-driven
overexpression of a key regulator of CMs: CCND2 (hiPSC-MHC-CCND2OE), which can remuscularize injured
ventricle in rodent model. The central objective of this proposal is to “turn back the clock” of the myocyte cell
cycle, which will facilitate myocardial repair. The Specific Aims (SA) that will examine this objective include: SA1:
To identify the key regulators that promote cell-cycle activity in the hearts of early neonatal pigs after myocardial
injury. We will: 1) using state-of-the-art fate-mapping molecular biology and imaging technologies, and the single
cell/nucleus RNA sequencing (scRNAseq or snRNAseq) technology demonstrate the key regulators/signaling
pathways that govern the myocyte cell cycle; and 2) test the remuscularization of the injured ventricle by
manipulating the key regulators using either targeted modRNA or AAV9 delivery strategies to selectively modify
these regulators in adult pig hearts following ischemic injury. SA2a. To engineer hCMPs containing CMs that
are capable of proliferating after transplantation, and characterized by previously unattainable size and thickness
that are functionally mature and primed for in-vivo vascularization. SA2b. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
hCMP constructs for myocardial recovery and remuscularization in a large-animal (pig) model of myocardial
injury. We will use state-of-the-art techniques that includes optical mapping in combination with the 3-
dimensional intramural cardiac mapping to delineate the potential arrhythmia mechanisms over the entire
transmural and left ventricular surface. These studies will synergize with the other projects and serve as a prelude
for therapeutic initiatives focused on remuscularization of the injured human heart."
10897867,"ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular disease is common and deadly. While lower organisms have a tremendous capacity for
regeneration, the adult mammalian heart is more limited in its capacity for regeneration and remuscularization
of the damaged tissue following an injury such as a myocardial infarction. Recently, we defined an evolutionary
conserved Shh signaling pathway in newt and mouse that promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation in vitro and
cardiac repair. Our preliminary data support the hypothesis that Gli1 (a downstream effector of Shh) is a direct
upstream regulator of Sox4 gene expression and Gli1 overexpression promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation in
vitro. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that Etv2 is a master regulator of the endothelial lineage and is
necessary and sufficient for angiogenesis in mouse and pig. Importantly, the results of these studies provide a
platform for the proposed studies that will dissect the mechanisms that govern cardiovascular repair and
proliferation. Therefore, our overall hypothesis is that the Shh downstream effectors, Gli1/Gli2, regulate
cardiomyocyte proliferation in a Sox4 dependent manner and Etv2 promotes endothelial/vascular
development to collectively promote cardiac regeneration. In these proposed studies, we will use a
number of novel genetic models and large animal models that are available in our laboratory (and the cores),
bioinformatics algorithms that we developed and we take an innovative approach to dissect the role of Gli1,
Etv2 and Sox4 as important factors that govern cardiovascular repair and proliferation. To examine our
hypotheses, the revised Project 2 proposal will address the following specific aims: Specific Aim #1: To
define the capacity of Gli and Etv2 deficient hearts for growth and regeneration; Specific Aim #2: To
determine the impact of Gli1 and Etv2 overexpression on cardiac repair and regeneration and Specific
Aim #3: To define the mechanistic role of Sox4 in the cardiomyocyte lineage. These aims will
complement and synergize with the other projects. They will utilize our recently engineered genetic mouse
models, inducible viral vectors, modified mRNA-GFP constructs, mouse and pig models, molecular analyses
and bioinformatics algorithms to comprehensively define the role for Gli1, Etv2 and Sox4 as essential factors
that govern cardiac repair and regeneration by promoting cardiomyocyte proliferation and angiogenesis
following injury. Given the tremendous morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular disease in our society, the
potential impact of this proposal is tremendous."

response to the existing chemotherapy contribute to poor prognosis for pancreatic cancer patients. There is an
urgent need to identify novel therapies that would significantly improve survival in patients. While most pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinomas have mutations in Kras, multiple other genetic alterations contribute to molecular
oncogenesis and patient prognosis. These genetic lesions hold the key to novel personalized therapies for
pancreatic cancer patients but remain poorly explored. Identifying novel personalized therapeutic combinations
would be a significant advancement in combating PDAC.
 We and others identified a novel ME2 deletion as a passenger deletion with SMAD4 loss, which is prevalent
in up to 30% of PDAC patients. By utilizing cell culture models, organoids, orthotopically-implanted mouse
models, and patient-derived xenografts of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with and without ME2-loss, we
made the novel observation that ME2 has a direct negative impact on tumor growth and metastasis in pancreatic
cancer. Here, we propose to investigate the molecular basis of ME2 loss-mediated oncogenesis in pancreatic
cancer. By utilizing a series of unbiased high-throughput screening approaches, we have identified novel
signaling alterations in pancreatic cancer cells due to ME2 loss. Hence, we will also investigate the effectiveness
of blocking the signaling pathways induced by the ME2 loss that facilitate aggressiveness in pancreatic cancer.
Such mechanisms potentially regulate tumor cell growth and invasiveness of low ME2-expressing tumor cells.
Thus, our studies will facilitate the development of new and more effective treatments for pancreatic cancer.
 Our long-term goal is to determine the molecular basis of ME2 loss-mediated signaling that facilitates
invasiveness and metastasis in pancreatic cancer. In the first aim, we will utilize genetically engineered mice
models to investigate the impact of ME2 loss on pancreatic cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis. The
second aim will investigate the molecular basis of ME2 loss-mediated aggressiveness in pancreatic cancer. Aim
3 will investigate the potential of personalized therapies for patients with ME2 loss by utilizing spontaneous
models and patient-derived xenografts and evaluate biomarkers and molecular regulators of their efficacy.
Collectively, the proposed studies employ an innovative and integrative approach to elucidate the molecular
basis of ME2 loss-mediated tumor progression and may uncover additional personalized therapies and
biomarkers of therapeutic efficacies for the treatment of aggressive pancreatic cancer."
10897302,"Protein homeostasis (proteostasis), or the proper folding and function of the proteome, is vital for cellular and
organismal health. Critical to proteostasis is an evolutionarily ancient cytoprotective mechanism originally
characterized in cells subjected to elevated temperatures. This mechanism, termed the Heat Shock Response
(HSR), is now known to protect against many diverse sources of proteotoxic stress. A hallmark of the HSR is the
profound transcriptional induction of molecular chaperones known as heat shock proteins (HSPs), a process
regulated by the transcription factor Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1). Because this rapid and robust transcriptional
induction can be provoked by simply increasing temperature, the HSR has been used as a model system in the
gene expression field for decades. As such, the processes that govern HSF1 activation and transcriptional
regulation upon heat shock have been extensively studied. However, evidence accumulating over the last
decade has revealed a more complicated picture of HSF1 function. We have found that in cancer, HSF1 directly
regulates the transcription of genes involved in cellular processes which extend far beyond protein folding, in a
manner distinct from the classic HSR. This has been mirrored in studies of HSF1 in other physiological contexts,
such as in the tumor microenvironment and in organismal development. The mechanisms which enable HSF1's
regulatory plasticity, and the underlying logic that connects the disparate set of HSF1-regulated genes with
HSF1's role in proteostasis, is not well understood. Here we propose to use cancer as a as a model system to
study the mechanisms that underlie HSF1's non-canonical regulatory roles. Through a series of unbiased proteomic
and genetic screens we identify a factor critical for HSF1 in this distinct physiological context, and a surprising
multifaceted role for a non-canonical HSF1 target gene in feedback regulation of HSF1 and the HSR. To investigate
these mechanisms, we will integrate sophisticated technologies in the field of transcription regulation with
established biochemical, genetic and genomic methods. Our studies will provide the knowledge required for the
development of therapeutic interventions that promote or inhibit specific programs directed by HSF1. Ultimately,
this may enable us to modulate HSF1's non-canonical programs which are implicated in an ever-expanding array
of disease states."

Preventing epilepsy and its progression (epileptogenesis) remains the ultimate goal for epilepsy research and
therapy development. Although this has been identified as an urgent need by the NINDS Epilepsy Research
Benchmarks, there is still no therapy available that interferes with the epileptogenic process. The development
of a therapy to prevent epilepsy and its progression would be paradigm-shifting in the way epilepsy, one of the
most frequent neurological conditions worldwide, would be treated. This application is designed to test new
interventional therapies to prevent epilepsy in rodent models of acquired epilepsy utilizing existing FDA-
approved drugs. The rationale for our approach is based on more than 25 years of research into maladaptive
processes in adenosine metabolism, which drive, and contribute to, the epileptogenic process that turns a
healthy brain into an epileptic brain. Specifically, an acute injury-associated adenosine surge in the brain drives
glial activation and dysregulation of glutamate homeostasis through increased activation of adenosine A2A
receptors, which couple to the astroglial glutamate transporter GLT-1. Hence, the use of the FDA approved A2A
receptor blocker istradefylline, or the FDA approved GLT-1 activator ceftriaxone are rational therapeutic
interventions to interfere with key mechanisms during the onset of the epileptogenic cascade. A delayed
response of the epileptogenic cascade is pathological overexpression of the major adenosine metabolizing
enzyme adenosine kinase (ADK) resulting in chronic adenosine deficiency in the epileptic brain. We have shown
that overexpression of ADK, and specifically an isoform expressed in the cell nucleus (ADK-L), drives the
epileptogenic process through an epigenetic mechanism (increased DNA methylation). We have shown that
therapeutic adenosine augmentation effectively prevents epilepsy and its progression in 4 different rodent
models of epileptogenesis. Hence ADK inhibitors and DNA methylation blockers (e.g. the FDA approved drug -
5-azacytidine) hold promise for the prevention of epilepsy and its progression. To this end we recently launched
a drug discovery program, which yielded a candidate ADK-L inhibitor (MRS-4203) with antiepileptogenic activity.
Collectively, our preliminary data provide a solid rationale that the adenosine system and its downstream
mediators offer several possible antiepileptogenic therapeutic targets. The CENTRAL GOAL of this application
is to identify and test therapeutic strategies for epilepsy prevention based on repurposing of FDA
approved drugs and the use of novel small molecule compounds that target components of the
adenosinergic system. Our therapeutic approaches will be tested and optimized in the mouse intrahippocampal
kainic acid model of temporal lobe epilepsy and validated in a traumatic brain injury induced model of
posttraumatic epilepsy. Our hypothesis will be addressed in three Specific Aims: (1) Targeting adenosine
receptor dependent mechanisms for epilepsy prevention (2) Targeting adenosine receptor independent
mechanisms for epilepsy prevention (3) Test therapeutic efficacy of antiepileptogenic combination therapies"

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a ssRNA (-) nairovirus that produces fever,
prostration, and severe hemorrhages in humans. Fatality rates associated with CCHFV range from 5-
80% based on phylogenetic variation of the virus, transmission route, and different treatment facilities.
Originally identified in Russia and the Congo, CCHFV has rapidly spread across large sections of
Europe, Asia, and Africa. Recently, CCHFV has illustrated its continued ability to spread into
previously naive regions. At the same time, U.S. citizen traffic has increased substantially to the
regions endemic with CCHFV, specifically South-Central Asia. As a result, there is a substantial risk
for transmission of CCHFV and/or its tick vector to the United States. Intriguingly, CCHFV is not the
only nairovirus that threatens the public. Nairobi Sheep Disease virus (NSDV) as well as nairoviruses
Issyk-kul, Dugbe and Erve can cause human disease of varying severity and economic distress. There
is no vaccine or prophylactic currently available for treatment of CCHF or any other nairovirus related
disease. Reports have identified a viral homologue of the ovarian tumor protease (vOTU) located
within the nairovirus genome. Recently, vOTUs’ ability to reverse post-translational modification by
proteins ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like interferon-simulated gene 15 (ISG15) on a narrow subset of host
pathways has been illustrated to be critical to pathogenesis. Also, vOTUs from CCHFV and other
nairoviruses have been found to be sensitive to species-species variations in ISG15 and their
specificity includes at least the species that disease is most prominently identified. This proposal will
determine the identity of specific host proteins within those pathways targeted by vOTUs. This will
enable therapeutic approaches that protect, or elevate, specific host inhibitory factors for these
viruses. The proposal will also seek to evaluate the correlation between the in vitro activity/substrate
species-specificity of these nairovirus vOTUs and overall virulence and zoonotic range of the
nairoviruses in question. Additionally, the efficacy of using CCHFV vaccine candidates with altered
CCHF vOTU functions will be assessed. Together, the resulting information will provide critical insight
into the role of vOTUs play in pathogenesis and host restriction as well as advance the development
of prophylactics targeting vOTUs."

determine the identity of specific host proteins within those pathways targeted by vOTUs. This will
enable therapeutic approaches that protect, or elevate, specific host inhibitory factors for these
viruses. The proposal will also seek to evaluate the correlation between the in vitro activity/substrate
species-specificity of these nairovirus vOTUs and overall virulence and zoonotic range of the
nairoviruses in question. Additionally, the efficacy of using CCHFV vaccine candidates with altered
CCHF vOTU functions will be assessed. Together, the resulting information will provide critical insight
into the role of vOTUs play in pathogenesis and host restriction as well as advance the development
of prophylactics targeting vOTUs."

Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease affecting over 1.6 million people in the United States, and
more than 5 million Americans are expected to be diagnosed with T1D by 2050. Clinical T1D is preceded by an
occult period of autoimmune beta cell loss and dysfunction. Disease prediction can be performed for clinical trial
purposes, with a combination of islet autoantibodies, genetic markers, and metabolic markers. However, the
predictive ability in the short term, particularly early in the disease or as an early marker of response to therapy,
is often inadequate. This results in needing longer and more extensive clinical trials for T1D interventions. Islet-
derived exosomes (or small extracellular vesicles produced by pancreatic beta cells or nearby cells within the
peri-islet environment) may reveal beta cell dysfunction and islet inflammation and are believed as promising
biomarkers for early detection and monitoring of T1D, but little has been explored yet. Thus, there is an urgent
and unmet need to identify and characterize islet-derived exosomes for the early detection of T1D, particularly
during the asymptomatic phase. Our overall objective is to create an integrated exosome isolation and analysis
system for the high throughput screening and identification of islet-derived exosomal markers with the rapid
purification and specific detection of islet-derived exosomes in T1D. The rationale for the proposed work is to
screen for pancreatic islet-specific exosomal markers and further develop an Exosome Technology with
Optoelectronics Lab-on-chip (EXTOL) system for rapid and specific capturing and analyzing islet-derived
exosomes in T1D. Then, we will validate the EXTOL system and screened exosomal markers using clinical
samples from T1D patients and appropriate controls. The ultimate product of this study is to provide a new
platform to screen, identify, and analyze exosomal markers for rapid and specific detection of asymptomatic
T1D."

The Candidate is a postdoctoral fellow committed to developing an academic research group focused on
applying bioinformatics to understand the pathophysiology of alcohol-related liver diseases (ALD). His previous
and current postdoctoral work has given him the unique skillset to answer questions involving gene
expression/regulation in the immune system. The Career Development Plan describes 2 years of mentored
research wherein the candidate will develop skills in clinical immunology, generate the sequencing data outlined
in the proposal, and learn leadership skills to transition into independence. The next 3 years, after obtaining an
independent faculty position, will be dedicated to developing new data analysis pipelines and establishing cell
biological and bioinformatics tools to understand gene regulation in the innate immune system, which will allow
the candidate to establish future projects in ALD immunology. Research Plan: ALD is a spectrum of disorders
that affect a growing number of people worldwide. Alcoholic Hepatitis (AH) is a severe inflammatory disease that
can increase the morbidity and severity of ALD disorders. In AH, the innate immune system is hypersensitive to
microbial byproducts. Alcohol consumption causes gut-barrier disruption, leading to leakage of gut microbes into
the portal circulation. The liver immune system is able to detect these microbes through pattern recognition
receptors, including the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and C-type Lectin receptors (CTLs). While TLRs have been
well studied for their role in sensitizing the innate immune cells to microbial products, the CTLs have only recently
been implicated in mouse models of ALD. CTLs are a large family of PRRs that sense a vast diversity of
microbes, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Our work has found that many members of the CTL gene family
are upregulated in the liver and peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs of AH patients. CTLs were also
upregulated in PBMCs in response to LPS/TLR4 signaling. We predict CTLs are upregulated in response to gut-
derived LPS in order to increase sensing for other microbes that may be present in the blood, making this
pathway a secondary innate immune surveillance pathway. In this proposal, we will test this hypothesis in three
aims to address the functional role and regulation of this immune surveillance pathway, and the mechanism by
which it is exacerbated in AH. First, we will use PBMCs isolated from AH patients to measure increased
sensitivity to CTL agonists, as well as micro-/mycobiome sequencing to determine what microbial byproducts
were in circulation in patients. Second, we will use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to dissect the
different monocyte subclasses, variation in CTL expression, and how different cell types respond to CTL
agonists. Third, because CTL genes are clustered in the genome, we will use scRNA-seq and ATAC-seq (Assay
for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin) to understand co-regulation of nearby genes in the genome. Altogether,
this proposal will further our understanding of CTL mediated immune surveillance in host/microbial interactions
during AH disease progression and potentially identify new therapeutic targets to decrease inflammation."

 Skeletal muscle tissue is maintained and can be dynamically modeled to fit ongoing needs by changes in
muscular activity. Myofibers, the primary cells that comprise the contractile elements of skeletal muscle, are
post-mitotic and maintained by a pool of stem cells, termed satellite cells, which are localized to a niche be-
tween the myofiber and overlying basal lamina. Loss of mobility arising from loss of skeletal muscle function
occurs following an injury, is an inevitable consequence of aging and a consequence of many neuromuscular
diseases, the latter two resulting in reduced quality of life and increased morbidity, requiring hospitalization or
home care, significantly raising health care costs. These complex physiological changes are well documented
but the mechanisms responsible for these changes are not understood.
 SCs (satellite cells) maintain muscle throughout life, providing a constant source of new myonuclei that
appears to occur primarily by asymmetric division. Loss of SC asymmetric division contributes to age-related
losses of SC function during aging and to the dystrophic muscle phenotype. Enhancing the ability of SCs to di-
vide asymmetrically improves strength in aged muscle and improves dystrophic muscle function. The depend-
ence of skeletal muscle health on SC maintenance, which in turn requires SCs divide asymmetrically empha-
sizes an essential role for SC asymmetric division that has not been adequately addressed. EGFR (epidermal
growth factor receptor) and FGFR1 signaling promote SCs to divide asymmetrically, identifying these as two
critical signaling pathways involved in maintaining SCs. Activation of EGFR signaling improves dystrophic
muscle phenotypes and activation of FGFR1 signaling in SCs from aged muscle rescues asymmetric division
restoring SC numbers to youthful levels and increases strength in aged mice, suggesting that SC asymmetric
division is essential to maintain skeletal muscle health. The primary premise for the proposed experiments in
this application is that driving SCs to divide asymmetrically improves muscle health. However, SCs comprise a
minor population of cells within skeletal muscle (1-3%) and thus, how can improvement of SC health affect an
entire muscle? To fulfill this knowledge gap, we plan to identify the pathways driving SCs to divide asymmetri-
cally and elucidate the mechanisms by which stimulation of SC asymmetric division enhances skeletal muscle
function."
10898001,"One of the primary goals of this P01 program project proposal is to define the functional and antigenic specificity
of the memory humoral response before and after dengue virus (DENV) infection. Here, we will determine the
molecular and structural basis for type-specific and cross-reactive human B cell responses to DENV infection.
Aim 1 of Project 4 will study the epitopes and structures recognized by DENV3 type-specific potently neutralizing
antibodies (Abs). The goal is to define a comprehensive antigenic map of neutralizing determinants on the DENV
E protein, which will inform DENV vaccine design and testing efforts. In past work with investigators in this
consortium, we have mapped many of the major antigenic determinants on DENV1 and DENV2. The protective
determinants on DENV3 are less well studied. Fortunately, in preliminary experiments, in collaboration with
Project 1 and Core C, we have generated a significant panel of potent DENV3-specific neutralizing monoclonal
Abs (mAbs) from the Nicaraguan Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study (PDCS) samples. It is clear that many of these
antibodies recognize novel epitopes that are not previously known. We will use these reagents to identify the
molecular and structural basis for recognition using alanine scanning mutagenesis, hydrogen deuterium
exchange mass spectrometry, cryo-EM and crystallography studies. If the antigenic maps appear incomplete,
as determined by Project 1 in dengue-endemic populations, we will generate additional mAbs from the peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected from children with documented repeat DENV3 infections, as well as
DENV1 and DENV2 infections, in the PDCS to define the complete antigenic landscape. We hypothesize that
most DENV3-specific Abs are directed to quaternary epitopes, including those near the DENV envelope domain
I/II (EDI/II) hinge region, but that there is a diversity of binding poses and angles for recognition of this complex
region. In Aim 2, we will define comprehensive antigenic maps for cross-reactive Abs that recognize and
neutralize viruses of all 4 DENV serotypes. In preliminary studies, we have isolated broad and potent mAbs that
have distinct profiles from those of the limited number of E dimer epitope (EDE) mAbs reported to date. The new
mAbs suggest there are additional sites of vulnerability for broad and potent neutralizing responses that are not
yet understood. Studies in this aim will define with biochemical, genetic and structural approaches the novel
epitopes associated with highly neutralizing cross-reactive mAbs that differ from EDE epitopes after 2° DENV
infection. Finally, in Aim 3, we will use emerging techniques in adaptive immune receptor next generation
sequencing to interrogate the Ab variable gene repertoires in PDCS subjects. We will use deep sequencing of
peripheral blood Ab gene repertoires in prior (pre-2° infection, pre-vaccination) PBMC samples from the same
individuals. These studies will provide a global view of repertoire responses that will complement the molecular
‘snapshots” afforded by mAb studies in Aims 1 and 2. The repertoire studies will elucidate the complexity and
specificity of the human B cell response to DENV infection on a more systematic level. The P01 integrates the
work of several laboratories with expertise in different aspects of DENV biology and adaptive immunity. The
human mAbs isolated in Project 4 will be used to study the molecular, structural and genetic basis for neutralizing
responses but also will generate and distribute key mAb reagents that facilitate the studies in Projects 1 and 2
in this P01. Chimeric antigens produced on Project 2 will be used to identify subjects with novel B cell responses,
and also to map new mAb specificities. The tasks proposed here could not be performed by any single laboratory
in the P01 because of the expertise needed in Ab engineering and deep sequence analysis, the scale of
production required, and the need for unique dengue reagents, cohort participants, and molecular biology
approaches. Understanding human B cell responses to DENV at both the clonal and overall genetic repertoire
level promises to give significant new insights into the molecular and genetic basis for type-specific and crossreactive
human B cell responses."

Amyloid beta (Aβ) is the hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) but also affects Parkinson’s disease (PD)
patients, especially in later stages when PD dementia (PDD) starts to develop. When PDD advances, about
50% of PDD patients develop extensive neuropathology similar to AD. This includes misfolded Aβ plaques
and tau neurofibrillary tangles, while the source and scale of Aβ-produced damage and its effects on PDD
development are unknown. In 53% of PD patients there is also an accumulation of insoluble Aβ amyloid
around blood vessels, known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). We previously found that systemic
Aβ peptide, generated by blood platelets during cerebral thrombosis, is highly visible on and around the
blood vessels within the brain. In addition, in a murine model of PD, when chemicals are injected into the
brain to kill dopaminergic neurons, Aβ appears on and around blood vessel walls. We hypothesized that
tissue accumulation of Aβ and CAA in PD may be the result of continual platelet activation due to local
brain inflammation, with high quantities of Aβ transported through blood vessel walls to brain tissue,
causing injury. The objectives of this proposal are to find the platelet-related mechanisms involved in late-
PD pathogenesis. Our specific aims will test whether the direct reduction of platelet count, platelet
activation/degranulation, or blood plasma Aβ carriers are important in the development of Aβ
accumulation. Our proposed innovative research will determine whether this direct approach is effective
and could thereby lead to a cure for late-stage Aβ accumulation in PD. This approach might open the way
for new therapeutics to stop the development of PDD, which would be a very significant contribution to
public health."

10867181,"The Biomarker Core will contribute to the ADRC by overseeing research activities involving fluid (and tissue)
biomarkers, neuroimaging and DNA. Biomarkers are critically important as indicators of pathology, structure
and pathophysiology of brain changes in Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders (ADRD). In Alzheimer’s,
the Amyloid, Tau, neurodegeneration (ATN) framework uses biomarkers to stage disease. Biomarkers can help
with diagnosis, including revealing pathological changes during preclinical or early stages of disease. They can
help with differential diagnosis, prognosis, and identification of disease heterogeneity. For fluid biomarkers, the
ADRC will collect blood (for DNA, plasma, serum) annually, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at baseline on as many
participants as possible (and repeated after 24 months), research MRI on as many participants as possible at
baseline, and amyloid and tau PET on at least 24 participants per year plus 10-20 more through the CLARiTI
project. For fluid biomarkers, the Core will maintain a repository where collected samples are stored.
Biomarkers will be measured in CSF to assess ATN, and emerging plasma biomarkers will be measured at
UCSD and using resources of the NCRAD laboratory that serves the entire ADRC network. For α-Synuclein,
seeding amplification assays will be obtained in CSF, and from serum or plasma if new methods become
standardized. DNA will be prepared at the ADRC and also at NCRAD from samples that will be shared. APOE
genotyping, GWAS and other genetic sequencing will be performed, coordinated by NCRAD. Research MRI
imaging will be obtained using standardized sequences, in compliance with the SCAN project. To characterize
amyloid burden, amyloid PET will use florbetapir, and for tau burden, tau PET will be obtained with MK6240.
MRI and PET data will be shared with the SCAN project. Vascular disease due to arteriosclerosis and amyloid
angiopathy will be assessed through MRI. The Biomarker Core will use stringent quality control to ensure that
acquisition of samples and imaging follows best practices, and will maintain rigor in analyzing biomarker data.
The Biomarker Core will conduct and support additional research to identify novel biomarkers, including
sharing samples with outside investigators. Core faculty will assist in teaching activities for REC and other
scholars and will provide advice to investigators who wish to use biomarkers in new grant applications."
10867352,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Patients who survive acute critical illness but require prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV, i.e. mechanical
ventilation >14-21 days) are growing rapidly in number, have large post-acute care expenditures, and
experience a grim 60% 1-year mortality. Traditionally, post-acute care of patients receiving PMV has been
provided either within the same short-stay hospital or on transfer to long-term acute care hospitals (LTCHs),
depending in large part on short-stay hospital practice. It is unclear how a hospital’s tendency to use
LTCHs (or not) for post-acute care of patients receiving PMV affects pre-transfer provider behaviors
and long-term patient outcomes. Payment reforms, initially intended to enrich for patients receiving PMV at
LTCHs (via a tiered Medicare reimbursement model), have led to LTCH closures and potentially also changes
in admission and transfer criteria across multiple care settings, including LTCHs, short-stay hospitals, and
skilled nursing facilities (SNFs, previously uncommonly used for PMV care). Because certain practice patterns
(e.g., early post-acute facility transfer, timing of tracheostomy, feeding tubes, advance directives) occur prior to
PMV onset and may determine in part whether a patient undergoes PMV, we will study the immediately
‘upstream’ cohort in whom such decisions are made: those at high risk for PMV (i.e. mechanically ventilated
>96hrs, 1 in 3 of whom will go on to require PMV). We will apply a combination of advanced health services,
novel econometric, and qualitative methods to accomplish the following specific aims: (1) Determine trends
and drivers of variation in post-acute facility use among patients at high risk for PMV in the 10 years spanning
payment reform; (2) Evaluate the association between LTCH use and (a) physician behavior at short-stay
hospitals and (b) long-term outcomes of patients at high risk for PMV; and (3) Perform semi-structured
qualitative interviews of providers and patients to determine how differences in LTCH use may impact
approaches to post-acute care planning and patient experiences. The knowledge generated from this mixed
methods approach will be critical to inform both clinical practice (i.e. by altering the way providers plan for and
choose optimal sites of post-acute care) and future policy (i.e. by potentially shaping future payment reform
and determining whether other sites of post-acute care, such as skilled nursing facilities, should be targets of
quality reporting legislation)."
10867354,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The diagnosis and monitoring of cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD)
requires valid and reliable assessment of cognitive change. Current limitations in traditionally used testing
measures include the length of testing, low engagement, day-to day variability, few data points, and limits in
the ability to identify subtle differences in normal individuals at risk for cognitive decline. Many of the currently
available computerized assessment tools either (1) have not been updated to incorporate current cognitive
neuroscience theory (2) do not target measures associated with the earliest neuroanatomical changes in brain
aging and neurodegeneration and/or (3) do not capitalize on the benefits of digital technology to maximize valid
and reliable cognitive data collection. Mobile and sensitive measures for detection of subtle cognitive change in
preclinical Alzheimer's Disease (AD) along with biomarker measures of molecular pathology and
neurodegeneration will combine to identify individuals who will benefit most from interventions. This project will
include development and validation of two, engaging, user-friendly and empirically based cognitive assessment
tasks and create the Mobile Cognitive App Performance Platform (mCAPP). The two cognitive tests will
comprise: (1) a memory card game (already designed and pilot-tested) that includes similar pairs of objects
and increasing memory load and (2) an executive functioning and processing speed test using a code
completion game. The cognitive tests will include a high-ceiling and low floor to capture a range of ability, burst
testing to increase reliability of the data, gamified design to increase engagement and motivation, and mobile-
based design for capturing data in all environments. The mCAPP will be validated in a well-characterized
cohort of older adults with normal cognition in the Penn Alzheimer's Disease Center. The cohort will
concurrently complete a neuropsychological battery, high resolution structural MRI and amyloid PET imaging
through funded P32 and R01 projects, which will be leveraged in this study to understand the relationships
between cognitive performance and neuroimaging biomarker status. Structural imaging targets will include
areas of the medial temporal lobe implicated in the earliest stages of preclinical Alzheimer's disease. The
purpose of the mCAPP is to collect reliable and valid cognitive data to detect very early signs of AD-related
cognitive change and remotely track response to interventions. Remotely administered, engaging cognitive
tests that are sensitive to the earliest changes in individuals at risk for AD have the potential to expand our
knowledge of cognition in aging, lead to early detection of cognitive variability, monitor change over time and
change as a result of intervention. This project will facilitate collection of data to support larger studies with the
mCAPP and career development opportunities in ADRD research for the early career principal investigator."

Epigenetic regulation of gene expression occurs via heritable changes in DNA and associated histone proteins.
Such modifications, which include methylation, acetylation, and nucleosome repositioning, have a major and
poorly understood role in development and disease. Recent studies have begun to explore epigenetics of
hearing and balance disorders which negatively impact quality of life and impose a significant socioeconomic
burden on millions of Americans. In both children and adults with hearing or balance disorders, development of
the cochlear epithelium, vestibular epithelia and associated neurons are often disrupted. During inner ear
development, neurosensory progenitors from the otic vesicle give rise to sensory hair cells and
vestibulocochlear neurons. Mutations and epigenetic changes in genes that perturb otic development often
cause improper hair cell and neuron formation, resulting in hearing loss. The chromodomain helicase DNA
binding protein 7 (CHD7) is an ATP dependent epigenetic chromatin remodeler implicated in inner ear
development. Mutations in CHD7 cause CHARGE syndrome (ocular Coloboma, Heart defects, Atresia of the
choanae, Retardation of growth and development, Genital hypoplasia and pubertal delay, and Ear
abnormalities). Patients with CHD7 loss are often diagnosed with mixed conductive and sensorineural hearing
loss; however, the pathogenic mechanisms that cause sensorineural hearing loss are not known. In the inner
ear, CHD7 is dynamically expressed in neurosensory progenitors, mesenchyme, sensory epithelium, and other
otic cell types. However, it is unclear which otic cell type(s) and what type of cis-regulatory element(s) are
perturbed in the presence of pathogenic CHD7 mutations. In addition, CHD7 has been shown to reposition
nucleosomes in vitro, yet the chromatin remodeling activity of CHD7 in vivo during otic development has not
been determined. Enrichment of CHD7 at different cis-regulatory elements is cell type dependent, and our
preliminary studies have identified CHD7 binding to the promoter of long noncoding RNA transcripts preceding
neuronal differentiation in immortalized multipotent otic progenitors (iMOPs). We hypothesize that CHD7 forms
a chromatin remodeling complex in otic neurosensory progenitors and binds to cis-regulatory elements to
regulate transcription. We will test our hypothesis using a combination of mouse genetics, single-cell
sequencing approaches, and super-resolution microscopy. Results from these studies will help identify
mechanisms underlying sensorineural hearing loss, enhance understanding of epigenetic regulation of inner
ear neurosensory cell development, and contribute knowledge to help design regenerative or restorative
therapies for the inner ear."

The overall objective of this Mentored Research Scientist Career Development Award is to support Dr. Tosca
Braun’s transition to an independent investigator with a focus on using community-engaged approaches to
develop and disseminate community-engaged mindfulness-based interventions to advance health in vulnerable
and minority populations. Interpersonal violence is commonly experienced among Black/African American (AA;
44%), Hispanic/Latino/a/x (34%), and non-Hispanic/Latino/a/x White women (37%) in the US, as well as
stigmatization related to IV and other attributes (e.g., race/ethnicity, weight). Violence and stigma both drive
“downstream” poor behavioral and physical health. Stigma sequelae – distress in response to stigma, anticipated
(fear of) stigma, internalized stigma – independently foster shame and affect dysregulation, thus magnifying
distress and consequent health impacts. These interpersonal violence (IV) sequelae can be alleviated by
reducing distress, yet culturally sensitive transdiagnostic approaches to reduce survivor distress across ethno-
racial populations are rare. We propose to use community-engaged research to develop a complementary
medicine program that integrates adapted Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) training with Trauma-Informed Yoga
(TIY) to improve stigma sequelae and reduce distress in ethno-racially diverse survivors: Integrated TIY and
MSC (I-YMSC). MSC targets stigma-related problems (affect dysregulation, shame) and improves distress in
the long-term, yet can temporarily increase short-term distress. TIY reduces short-term distress and promotes
physiological-autonomic regulation. Dr. Braun’s program evaluation data suggests adapting MSC to explicitly
address cultural factors and intersectional stigma and integrating this approach with TIY is strongly warranted
and has potential to ameliorate health inequities experienced by ethno-racially diverse IV survivors. Further,
training community yoga instructor survivors to teach I-YMSC represents an additional level of engagement with
our stigmatized target population that is unusual in mindfulness research. In this K23 proposal, Black/AA,
Hispanic/Latino/a/x, and White survivors will be equally represented across all project phases (33% each), with
results considered both across participants and within each subgroup. Specific aims include: (1) (1.1) develop I-
YMSC using community-engaged research with women IV survivor stakeholder partners, (1.2) pre-pilot the
intervention in an open pilot trial to further refine the intervention, (1.3) develop a community-engaged teacher
training, and (2) (2.1) conduct a 2-armed test of the behavioral intervention compared to a health education
control to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the I-YMSC intervention, and (2.2) pilot the teacher training.
The essential hands-on learning and mentored training in this grant will support Dr. Braun in establishing her
program of research as an independent investigator in community-engaged mind-body research working with
vulnerable and minority populations, including women survivors of violence. Findings may also have applicability
to promoting health resiliency and restoration in other marginalized populations who experience health inequities."

 Animals build their multicellular bodies with diverse types of cells that perform and integrate distinct
functions. Animals, however, are not unique in their capacity to generate distinct cell types. In fact, their closest
living relatives, a group of aquatic, unicellular, bacterivorous protists called choanoflagellates, detect biotic and
abiotic cues to differentiate into phenotypically and functionally distinct cell types in different environments.
Choanoflagellates also possess critical genes that regulate animal cell differentiation during development,
supporting the hypothesis that cell differentiation mechanisms evolved prior to the origin of animals and
became integral in animal and choanoflagellate biology.
 Although nearly 800 million years of animal evolution has shaped human biology since we last shared a
common ancestor with choanoflagellates, the commonalities in genetic toolkits and cytological characteristics
indicate that choanoflagellates have tremendous potential as microeukaryotic models to investigate the core
functions of genes that regulate cell differentiation. During my postdoc, I pioneered the first methods for gene
delivery and genome editing in the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta to realize its full potential as a model
system. My lab continues to propel those methods for the discovery of the molecular mechanisms that drive
environmentally-triggered cell differentiation in S. rosetta. This proposal supports our research mission by using
the molecular tools I developed to dissect putative regulatory pathways that emerge from functional genomic
surveys. In particular, we focus on homologs of RNA-binding proteins that form the animal germline and and/or
maintain pluripotency. Moreover, we strive to develop our nascent genetic tools into scalable, easy methods that
enable genome-wide screens of cell differentiation regulators. Overall, this work will contribute a new, functional
comparison to illuminate the origin and evolution of cell differentiation pathways in choanoflagellates and
animals, which I anticipate will uncover core functions of biomedically important genes that originated before
choanoflagellates and animals diverged."

 Precisely how anti-trypanosomatid drugs kill parasites remains largely unknown. Trypanosomatid
infections, in the form of African trypanosomes, American trypanosomes, and Leishmania spp., directly
contribute to disease and poverty of over 1 billion people. Thus, gaps in knowledge have a significant human
impact. The well-established treatments nifurtimox, eflornithine, benznidazole, pentamidine, suramin, and
melarsoprol all suffer from complex treatment regimens, host toxicity, and burgeoning drug resistance. The high
host toxicity of melarsoprol (encephalopathy in ¼ of patents) made development of new drugs an imperative,
which has been answered by NECT (nifurtimox-eflornithine combination, intravenous) and fexinidazole (oral)
therapies. Despite this progress, mechanisms of cell death and drug resistance are unknown for fexinidazole
and other significant drugs. The ORFeome-based Trypanosoma brucei Gain-of-Function Library is the state-of-
the-art-tool for identification of both direct drug targets and mechanisms of drug resistance in trypanosomatids.
Discoveries from a published melarsoprol Gain-of-Function screen identified novel aspects of resistance
(including mitochondrial proteins). Unpublished data from a fexinidazole genetic screen demonstrated that drug
resistant survivors arise from induced expression of a clearly identifiable set of genes, which remain to be
elucidated. Multiple trypanocidal drugs converge on the same set of cytology phenotypes, suggesting shared
pathways to cell death. Based on genetic screening data and cytology-based phenotypes, this proposal will test
the central hypothesis that anti-trypanosomatid drugs share common mechanisms of cell killing and utilize
pathways that can promote multi- and pan-resistance against widely used therapies. In AIM 1, all clinically
relevant anti-trypanosomatid drugs (nifurtimox, eflornithine, benznidazole, pentamidine, suramin, and
fexinidazole) will undergo GoF genetic screening and validation to identify a set of genes that promote multi- and
pan-drug resistance. Multiple drugs converge on trypanosomatid redox and mitochondrial functions. AIM 2 will
use genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors to test the working hypothesis that anti-trypanosomatid drug
treatments perturb redox metabolism and ROS stress management in the cytosol and mitochondrion, filling a
gap in our understanding of drug-induced redox stress. Drug cytotoxicity in T. brucei is associated with a set of
established phenotypes, AIM 3 will determine how multi-resistance genes contribute to cell death phenotypes
including: cell cycle, DNA damage, and loss of mitochondrial functions. The proposed research is of high
significance because it will link trypanocidal phenotypes with their associated genes and genetic pathways for
the first time. Genes whose expression promotes multidrug resistance will elucidate the pathways that lead to
cell death in these parasites. Discoveries arising from these studies will illuminate mechanisms of cell death for
all existing trypanosomatid therapies and identify targets for improved drug design. This proposal will enable
better informed choices in anti-parasitic compound development and screening for years to come."

Obesity is associated with an increased risk of relapse from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most
common childhood cancer. We have uncovered a novel mechanism by which fat tissue may make ALL more
aggressive and harder to cure. ALL cells found in adipose tissue in mouse models have a higher expression of
RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand) than ALL found in marrow. Exposing ALL cells to
adipose tissue ex vivo also increases their expression of RANKL. RANKL is known to contribute to ALL cell
expansion in vivo, as well as invasion into bone and the central nervous system (CNS). In the present grant, we
will investigate the pathways by which adipose tissue increases ALL expression of RANKL. We will explore this
finding using a translational approach, with experiments ranging from bench to mouse to evaluations of clinical
samples. We will elucidate which adipose tissue-derived signals are responsible for ALL cell RANKL expression.
We will examine whether obesity increases ALL RANKL expression in mice and clinical samples, and explore
the relationships between RANKL expression and bone density, CNS invasion, and chemotherapy treatment
response. Finally, we will test an FDA-approved treatment, denosumab, in mice to see whether impairing RANKL
signaling can improve ALL treatment outcome. These studies may provide a novel strategy for ALL patients to
reduce bone loss and fractures, reduce CNS invasion, and potentially improve chemotherapy treatment
outcomes."

 Each year, there over 200,000 hospitalizations for cirrhosis in the United States. Over one-third of
these patients are readmitted within 30 days, and up to 10% will die in the hospital. Despite national
quality measures and care guidelines, cirrhosis care remains suboptimal and highly variable. Clinical
Decision Support (CDS) systems present an attractive strategy to improve guideline-adherence due
to low implementation costs. These systems, however, remain largely untested in cirrhosis care and
it remains unknown whether they are effective at improving guideline-adherence and whether
improving guideline-adherence changes clinical outcomes in cirrhosis care. This proposal will
leverage my ongoing KL2 work in which I designed “CirrhosisRx,” a cirrhosis-specific CDS system, to
address these evidence gaps by: Comparing the effect of CirrhosisRx versus “usual care” on
adherence to quality measures and clinical outcomes through a pragmatic randomized controlled trial
(pRCT, Aim 1); Assessing whether changes in guideline-adherence mediate changes in outcomes
(Sub-Aim 1); Studying CirrhosisRx's reach, adoption, and maintenance in care workflows (Aim 2);
and Identifying facilitators and barriers to adopting electronic interventions for cirrhosis care at other
centers (Aim 3). These aims will generate the necessary data and knowledge for a future multicenter
pRCT of CirrhosisRx and other electronic interventions in hepatology care.
 I am an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).
Building upon a strong foundation of research support, this K23 will allow me to transition from being
a retrospective researcher to a pragmatic trialist of electronic interventions in hepatology. I need
dedicated training to gain expertise in the conduct, analysis, and dissemination of pRCTs of electronic
interventions. Under the supervision of a multidisciplinary team of leaders in hepatology (Lai), clinical
informatics (Pletcher), biostatistics (Huang), and implementation sciences and qualitative methods
(Ackerman), I will execute a detailed career development plan outlined in this proposal to develop the
following skills: 1) pRCT design and conduct, 2) Advanced statistical methods in pRCT data analysis,
3) Intervention evaluation frameworks, and 4) Multicenter collaborations. As part of my 4-year plan, I
will actively engage in coursework and structured tutorials in the topics above, and in interdisciplinary
development and leadership programs.
 RELEVANCE: Conducting a pragmatic randomized controlled trial of a cirrhosis-specific clinical
decision support system to improve guideline-adherence and clinical outcomes will help provide
evidence regarding to the effectiveness of such interventions and allow for the design and execution
of future trials of similar interventions to improve cirrhosis care."

Please find attached our application entitled “Broadening the scale and impact of a comprehensive Long
COVID clinic to serve diverse patient groups with multidisciplinary care and research access” being
submitted to RFA-HS-23-012: Implementing and Evaluating New Models for Delivering Comprehensive,
Coordinated, Person-Centered Care to People with Long COVID (U18). This application is responsive to
SEN NOT-HS-23-013.
While several models of dedicated outpatient Long COVID clinics have emerged across the U.S., features
essential to implementing and providing equitable, comprehensive, coordinated, and person-centered Long
COVID care have yet to be fully identified and evaluated. In April 2020, our team founded the
multidisciplinary UCSF OPTIMAL Long COVID clinic, a dedicated center for individuals in the post- acute
phase of COVID-19 modeled after the multidisciplinary structure of post- ICU clinics. The clinic currently
serves a diverse population and the clinic has already had a major impact, resulting in lower odds of
hospitalization or emergency department visits. The central goal of this proposal is to improve capacity,
access, and equity for underserved, vulnerable, and minority populations being served by the
OPTIMAL Long COVID Clinic. Specifically, we will scale up multidisciplinary care operations in the current
UCSF OPTIMAL Clinic and expand the program to patients at San Francisco General Hospital, a safety net
hospital serving a diverse and vulnerable patient population experiencing long COVID. We will increase
coordination and communication between our clinical operations, established federally-funded Long COVID
research programs, and community- based organizations (CBOs) and clinics serving populations affected by
Long COVID.
Using an implementation science approach and leveraging the existing OPTIMAL Long
COVID care model and established relationships with community organizations and
research studies, we will:
Aim 1: Scale up Long COVID care in the San Francisco Bay Area to increase access for underserved,
vulnerable, and minority populations.
Aim 2: Enhance Long COVID care coordination and communication across clinical, research, and
community settings.
Aim 3: Identify key barriers and facilitators to implementation success and sustainability of the
expanded and enhanced Long COVID care model.
Results from this project will significantly inform Long COVID care delivery models and have a major
impact on unmet Long COVID care needs among underserved populations."

Biomedical research scientists face unique career challenges that, if unaddressed, hinder the
success, well-being, and ultimately retention of this specialized workforce. Curricular support to
meet these threats to well-being first requires a comprehensive understanding of the diverse
experiences of biomedical research scientists, across specialties and career stages. After
conducting interviews with biomedical research program directors, and focus groups with
biomedical faculty and research trainees across our institution, we will develop a set of modules
to address well-being needs along four tracks: a Foundational track that provides content on the
Six Areas of Worklife and how they bear on well-being; a Resilience track that provides
evidence-based tools for formulating a personal plan for well-being and navigating the rejection
that is inherent to a successful biomedical research career; a Relational Support track that
identifies strategies for developing healthy mentorship and sponsorship relationships and
techniques for collaborative research success, and a Programmatic Infrastructure track that
includes support for navigating differences, identity formation, and building capacity for
adaptability. A series of facilitator guides will accompany the modules to allow for consistency in
interactive content. Each module will be evaluated for its educational value through mixed-
methods investigation, and in consultation with an advisory board composed of graduate
education experts, directors of educational assessment, leadership from the UCSF Office of
Career and Professional Development, diversity and learner success, student and faculty
academic affairs, faculty equity, and a Chief Wellness Officer. A randomized controlled study
design will allow for assessment of the impact of training materials on validated well-being,
resilience, career self-efficacy and adaptability measures. The training materials will be made
freely available and will provide a sustainable set of tools for building well-being, resilience, and
adaptability in our biomedical research scientist workforce."
10863202,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Dr. Jennifer Kay is a tenure track-equivalent Research Scientist at Silent Spring Institute, an independent, non-
profit research center dedicated to uncovering environmental causes of breast cancer and other women’s
health issues. Dr. Kay develops new approaches to identify chemical exposures that increase breast cancer
risk and quantify their effects by integrating mechanistic evidence with experimental and observational studies
in animals and humans. Genotoxicity and/or endocrine activity are features of most known human breast
carcinogens, and the combination of cancer initiation by genotoxicity and promotion by endocrine signaling is
predicted to increase risk compared to either alone. Drawing on her experience studying mechanisms of
mutagenesis and carcinogenesis in the liver, intestines, and lung, with this K01 career development award, she
will investigate the mechanistic interactions of estrogenicity and genotoxicity in breast cancer using a rodent
model and novel multiplexed spatial biology approaches. This award will provide Dr. Kay the opportunity to 1)
hone grantsmanship and project management skills, 2) become a leader in breast cancer prevention and
toxicology, and 3) generate new mechanistic knowledge that can support hazard and risk prediction. Dr. Kay’s
primary mentor, Ruthann Rudel, Research Director of Silent Spring Institute, will help her design research that
can shape cancer risk assessment and prevention strategies, and she will help Dr. Kay translate findings to
national and international scientific organizations, government decision makers, and lay audiences. Co-mentor
Dr. Laura Vandenberg of University of Massachusetts Amherst—an expert in rodent mammary gland biology
and carcinogenesis—will train her in diverse techniques for studying chemical effects on the breast using rats.
The proposed project, “Quantifying early biomarkers of mammary carcinogenesis with multiplexed spatial
biology,” will characterize the mechanistic interactions between genotoxicity and estrogenicity in chemically
induced mammary carcinogenesis. Biomarkers of effect will be tracked in mammary tissue structures and
epithelial cell types in the days and weeks after exposure to chemicals that are genotoxic, estrogenic, or both,
preceding tumor development. Expanding upon her previous experience with spatial biology and quantitative
bioimaging, Dr. Kay will integrate molecular markers measured via multiplexed immunofluorescence with
microscopic alterations to tissue morphology in adjacent histopathological sections and structural effects in
whole-mount tissues. In addition, this project will, for the first time, measure the ability for chemical exposures
to alter estradiol levels in mammary tissue as well as serum. This research advances NIEHS goals by
enhancing mechanistic understanding of endocrine disruption and genotoxicity in breast cancer, laying a
foundation for assessing carcinogenic effects of mixtures and predicting risk with toxicological methods that are
matched to the underlying processes. The tools developed here can be applied to study molecular effects of
carcinogens that act via other mechanisms in a wide range of tissues."
10866117,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death, and lung cancer screening (LCS) can reduce lung cancer-
related mortality by 20%. However, only 5-10% of eligible individuals have received an initial LCS exam, with
Black and Hispanic individuals less likely to be screened and more likely to suffer delays in diagnosis and
treatment, contributing to higher mortality from lung cancer. Community health workers (CHWs) are an
effective strategy to promote screening and mitigate disparities in other cancer settings. Whether CHWs can
be effective in the context of LCS and address key barriers to receiving LCS remains unknown. The goal of this
study is to develop and pilot test a four-part CHW intervention to improve LCS uptake and mitigate disparities,
which includes: 1) patient outreach, 2) patient-centered shared decision-making, 3) smoking cessation
counseling, and 4) navigation of logistical barriers. Our central hypothesis, based on our qualitative work and
informed by the expanded Health Belief Model, posits that CHWs can address key modifiable factors to
improve LCS awareness, engagement, and barriers to accessing care, leading to increased LCS uptake
overall and among Black and Hispanic communities. Our aims are to: Jointly “transcreate” a CHW intervention
to increase LCS uptake among patients served by community health centers (Aim 1); conduct a pilot
randomized controlled trial of the CHW intervention (Aim 2a); and obtain empiric estimates of effect size in
LCS and tobacco treatment utilization (Aim 2b). We first seek to jointly “transcreate” a CHW intervention with
our community advisory board, comprised of key stakeholders in LCS and patients with lived experience,
applying the Transcreation Framework for Community-Engaged Behavioral Interventions to Reduce Health
Disparities. Then we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of the CHW intervention at Baystate
Health’s three community health centers. We will randomize 80 LCS-eligible individuals (40 in each arm) to
either the CHW-led intervention or enhanced usual care (i.e., mailed LCS educational materials and usual LCS
as per primary care provider). Primary pilot outcomes are focused on feasibility, including participant
recruitment, measure completion, retention, fidelity, and acceptability. We will also conduct an evaluation of
secondary trial outcomes, including LCS and tobacco treatment utilization, as well as explore potential
mediators (e.g., knowledge, facilitation of logistical barriers). The proposed activities will provide me crucial
skills in health equity research, implementation science, and clinical trial design, and launch my career as a
clinician-scientist dedicated to addressing health disparities. This work will also lay the groundwork for a
subsequent R01 grant conducting a fully powered randomized controlled trial of the CHW intervention that
directly addresses top priorities from the President’s Cancer Moonshot and NCI’s mission to develop multi-
level interventions that facilitate equitable access to cancer screening and reduce lung cancer mortality."
10872172,"Abstract
 Obesity triggers cellular damage and impedes tissue recovery from injury, and its escalating prevalence
may promote complications of peripheral vascular disease, such as critical limb ischemia (CLI) or renal artery
stenosis (RAS). Reducing complications of obesity could diminish the risk of death, improve quality of life, and
produce extensive cost savings. This application is based on the scientific premise that obesity increases
tissue susceptibility to injury by interfering with normal defense and repair processes associated with
mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs). MSCs constitute an effective endogenous cellular repair system,
but obesity may blunt their efficacy. We found that obesity-induced MSC dysfunction in pigs was associated
with altered mitochondrial structure and function, but the mechanisms of mitochondrial damage in human MSC
and its contribution to regulation of MSC function in human obesity remain unknown.
 Our central hypothesis is that human obesity engages epigenetic mechanisms that impair human MSC
mitochondrial structure and function and render MSC functionally deficient. We speculate that obesity
alters in MSC the epigenetic states of micro-RNA (miR) miR-181a, a key miR that targets mitochondrial DNA
and negatively regulates their function. A consequent fall in levels of the mitochondrial derived peptide (MDP)
MOTS-c in turn impairs function and tissue repair capacity of MSC in obesity. To test our hypothesis, we will
define gene expression and epigenetic states of mitochondrial targeting miRNAs and MOTS-c in human
adipose tissue-derived MSC and elucidate their functional significance for both MSCs and their mitochondria.
 Our Specific Aims will pursue 3 hypotheses. Aim 1: Human obesity induces MSC miR-181a expression and
in turn mitochondrial and MSC structural damage and dysfunction. Using RNA-seq we will identify miR-181a as
a key miR upregulated in MSCs from patients with obesity vs. healthy controls. Its role in regulating MSC and
mitochondrial function and structure will be assessed in vitro and in vivo (in mice with CLI or RAS) using novel
in vivo imaging and ex vivo techniques. Aim 2: Human obesity engages epigenetic mechanisms to alter miR-
181a. We will define the epigenetic landscape of miR-181a using MeDIP-seq, and its contribution to MSC
repair in vitro and in vivo using an epigenetic modifier. Aim 3: A fall in MOTS-c owing to mitochondrial damage
contributes to functional impairment of ‘obese MSC’. Using novel MDP-seq we will pinpoint MOTS-c as a
unique MDP linking mitochondrial to cellular integrity in MSC. MSC treated with MOTS-c peptide or neutralizing
antibody will be characterized, and restoration of ‘obese’ MSC function tested both in vitro and in vivo.
 The proposed studies, employing cutting edge techniques, may uncover novel mechanisms underlying cell
damage and impaired repair in human obesity. These studies will advance understanding of the pathogenesis
of cellular damage, and likely contribute towards management of patients with obesity and vascular disease."
10869561,"Inaccessibility to the findings of environmental and public health research, in readily usable
form, is a major barrier to public's and study participants' abilities to understand and apply
those findings to reduce their exposure to environmental hazards and improve health outcomes.
Such available report-back of research results (RBRR) requires easily understood and visualized
data presentations, dissemination, and overcoming ethical and cultural barriers to effective
information distribution. This project aims to develop an ethically-sound RBRR approach that
can build environmental health literacy (EHL) and make results accessible, by creating the novel
Translating Research to Action & Knowledge (TRAK) Portal –a web-based, smartphone-
accessible tool for study participants and communities. To advance RBRR, our approach aims to
effectively serve both individuals and their communities' needs. Earlier we found that study
participants want to see how their data compares to those of other populations/geographic
regions, and to see their data contextualized both for themselves (what does this mean for me?)
and their communities (how does this impact my community?). The TRAK Portal will
encompass these foundational themes, in a modifiable tool that allows scalability across studies,
and will publish open-source code. The project will leverage findings from 17 prior RBRR
studies and >900 study participants, to create an interactive TRAK web tool. It will be developed
initially to provide RBRR of silicone wristband-based chemical exposure data but will be
extendable to scale across multiple data/study types. The project will promote and enable data
sharing within and across studies, and will learn directly from RBRR study participants, to
inform a qualitatively improved RBRR process responsive to community and cultural norms and
will advance EHL by discovering and thus leveraging people's motivations toward decision-
making to reduce and prevent exposures to environmental contaminants. Input from
Community and Expert Advisory Boards and Community Engagement Studios will identify
preferences, perceived risks and benefits, barriers, and facilitators to efficacious RBRR, learning
from diverse populations (rural, urban, Hispanic, environmental justice), testing the Portal in
two current NIH-funded studies, for diverse perspectives: 1) Fair Start – inner-city cohort of
pregnant women (predominantly Latinx, low-socioeconomic status (SES), aged 18+, speaking
English or Spanish); and 2) St. Helen’s – suburban, mostly white non-Hispanic, middle-SES
English-speaking cohort aged 5+ impacted by toxic waste). The project will identify and
integrate ethical approaches for the best RBRR execution to increase health equity."
10871402,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a significant challenge for human health, especially with the emergence of
multi-drug resistance bacteria and the lack of new antibiotics development. In the United States alone there are
over 2.8 million cases each year with over 35,000 deaths. Worldwide annual deaths are over 700,000 and this
number is expected to grow to 10 million by 2050. There is a great concern that the COVID pandemic may have
increased AMR risk. While the next generation ASTs have been actively under development in the last decade
and some automatic tools were approved by the FDA, they are mostly based on morphological changes with
limitations in sensitivity and selectivity, mostly requiring overnight cultures and long turn-around-time.
Additionally, a separate capital investment is necessary for automatic AST instruments.
In vivo isotope labeling with heavy water (D2O) has been used to monitor microscale cellular responses such as
protein synthesis and turnover, DNA replication, and de novo lipogenesis. When bacteria are cultured in D2O,
newly synthesized bacterial lipids are labeled by deuterium and can be readily detected by mass spectrometry
(MS). We are developing a new antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) using deuterium-labeling mass spectrometry
(DLMS), in which AMR bacteria can be rapidly detected by a bench top matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF) that is commonly available in many clinical labs for
bacterial species identification. Based on previous success on resistant E. coli and methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), our DLMS AST will be now applied to all ESKAPE (Enterococcus,
Staphylococcus, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and Enterobacter) pathogens using a bench top
MALDI-TOF, the Bruker Biotyper. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) measured by DLMS will be
compared with a traditional broth dilution method, which is expected to be comparable but achieved in only a
few hours instead of one or two days. To further accelerate the adoption of this DLMS AST assay by clinical
bacteriologists, an on-agar assay will also be developed using ETESTÒ and D2O agar. Furthermore, we will
explore the discovery of new AMR metabolite biomarkers using DLMS, which will not only shorten the turn-
around-time but also provide information about resistant mechanisms. Our long-term vision is to have both global
markers (deuterated lipids) and specific AMR biomarkers (deuterated small metabolites) simultaneously
detected by DLMS using a bench-top MALDI-TOF, allowing prompt prescription of the most appropriate
antibiotics and reducing antibiotic overuse."
10871496,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Our proposal will examine a central mechanism of cell death pathways—the formation of large membrane
pores during the final stages of cell death. Recent studies have demonstrated that this process involves
Ninjurin1 (Ninj1), a membrane-spanning protein that multimerizes to form large membrane pores that lead to
membrane rupture. These membrane ruptures are essential for advanced signs of cell death and for the
release of larger inflammatory molecules required to mount an effective response to pathogens. The
multimerization of Ninj1 is critical for membrane rupture, but little is known about the specific mechanisms
underlying Ninj1 multimer formation or the direct implications of this oligomerization. This proposal will
determine how Ninj1 is activated by upstream steps of the cell death pathway, including caspase-8 and
caspase-1-driven signaling, and how gasdermin family members regulate this process. We will also examine
the contribution of Ninj1 activation in cell death pathways in the innate immune response to pathogens using
mouse models of Yersinia infection.
Our preliminary experiments demonstrated that Ninj1 expressed in myeloid cells is required for the host
response to Yersinia bacteria. We also showed that Ninj1 controls myeloid-cell driven defenses to Yersinia
infection in mice, underscoring the importance of Ninj1 in the innate immune response to bacterial infections.
Furthermore, our data suggest that GSDMD has a regulatory role in Ninj1 oligomerization initiated via both
caspase-8 and caspase-1. We hypothesize that GSDM proteins are modulating Ninj1 oligomerization and host
responses to caspase-8 and caspase-1 stimulations, and that Ninj1 oligomerization is a critical component in
effector-mediated immunity to Yersinia infections. Using Yersinia infections, cytokines, inhibitors, expression
systems and other tools, we will define the pathway controlling Ninj1 oligomerization during innate immune
signaling to cell death and inflammation to elucidate how this central step in multiple cell death pathways is
regulated."
10870649,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Anxiety sensitivity (AS), which involves fear that arousal related symptoms will have negative physical, social
or psychological ramifications, is an important driver of anxiety, trauma-related and somatic disorders.
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), particularly involving interoceptive exposure (IE; i.e., exposure to
unwanted internal sensations), has the greatest demonstrated efficacy at reducing AS but can be hard to
tolerate. Conversely, mindfulness is sought out for management of multiple mental health problems, but the
observed clinical effects are often modest. A hybrid of these two approaches may capitalize on the strengths of
each approach. Mindfulness training (MT) may increase the tolerability of exposure, enhance compliance and
support extinction learning through increased engagement with the feared stimulus and heightened awareness
of the nonoccurrence of feared outcomes. The proposed project, therefore, will refine a novel hybrid
intervention, Interoceptive Training Enhanced Mindfulness (ITEM), which combines IE with MT, evaluate its
feasibility and acceptability, and develop a multimodal assessment battery for use in subsequent studies. To
this end, 12 Veterans with high AS will complete ITEM, providing quantitative and qualitative information about
their experience. A panel of experts will use that material to refine the intervention. Following the refinement
process, 48 Veterans will be randomized to receive ITEM or IE in six one-on-one sessions delivered via
telehealth. They will complete assessments before and after the 6-week intervention period. Outcomes related
to engagement and compliance with ITEM and IE will be the primary focus of the pilot randomized controlled
trial (RCT). Additionally, we will examine the novel assessment measures to establish an optimal methodology
for subsequent efficacy studies. Because multiple mental health (e.g., anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder,
eating disorders and depression) and physical health (e.g., chronic pain, conditions related to toxic exposure)
problems are driven by maladaptive reactions to interoceptive cues, this intervention has the potential to
ultimately produce wide-spread mental and physical health benefits."
10870650,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cells can perform their functions by spatiotemporally enriching biomacromolecues to form membrane-less
condensates through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). The formation of phase-separated condensates
allows the cell to concentrate regulatory proteins with interaction partners to accelerate biological processes not
only for cellular homeostasis but also for disease progression. Targeting condensates that promote dysregulated
cellular processes has been suggested as a novel approach to developing new drugs. Studies have linked LLPS
to super-enhancers (SEs), a transcriptional mechanism driven by an extremely high density of master regulators
and Mediator complex that maintains the high expression of cell-type specific genes to determine cell identity,
disease states, and most notably, oncogenesis. It has been implicated that the formation of phase-separated
condensates of master regulators with Mediators is critical for activating the transcription of cell identity genes
driven by SEs. However, how the master regulators undergo LLPS at SEs to maintain key oncogene expression
is still largely under investigation, especially in HNSCC. In addition, no therapeutics are available for targeting
SEs in cancer treatment, indicating the need for alternative strategies to be developed. We recently discovered
that FOSL1 serves as a master regulator to promote the malignant progression of HNSCC through establishing
SEs with Mediator complex (MED1) at key oncogenes. However, how FOSL1 drives key oncogene expression
without a transcriptional activation domain is still not fully understood. Furthermore, the crystal structure of
FOSL1 still remains unsolved and the structure-based drug design for FOSL1 inhibitors has been severely stifled.
Currently, there are no FOSL1 inhibitors for cancer treatment. Using the AlphaFold program, we identified two
intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in FOSL1. The presence of IDRs in a protein is frequently diagnostic of its
ability to phase separate. We found that purified FOSL1 recombinant proteins can phase separate at in vitro
conditions. Moreover, phase-separated condensates containing FOSL1 can be visualized in live HNSCC cells.
Based on these results, we hypothesize that FOSL1 associates with MED1 to undergo phase separation to
establish super-enhancers at key oncogenes and maintain their high expression and consequent malignant
phenotype of HNSCC. We proposed the following two specific aims to validate our hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will
determine whether FOSL1 cooperates with MED1 to assemble phase-separated condensates at in vitro
conditions and also in live HNSCC cells. Furthermore, we will also examine these condensate formations at key
oncogenes driven by SEs in HNSCC cells and patient-derived xenografts. In Aim 2, we will explore whether the
deletion of IDRs in FOSL1 will abolish condensate formation to disrupt SEs to suppress the expression of key
oncogenes and the consequent malignant phenotype of HNSCC. The successful accomplishment of this study
will provide solid evidence to link LLPS with SEs and key oncogene expression in HNSCC, support a notion that
targeting FOSL1 phase separation suppresses HNSCC tumorigenesis, and lay the foundation for future studies."
10870805,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The importance of complex learning, memory and verbal/symbolic processes in the
development, maintenance and relapse of substance use disorders (SUDS) is increasingly
being recognized. Drug-related cues and behaviors develop and alter in value based on direct
association with drug experiences but are also determined by verbal and other symbolic
processes. Research on these aspects of SUDS is hampered by the limited availability of
animal models of such processes. The two PIs, Dr. Galizio and Dr. Bruce, have developed a
model of symbolic processes in rats: classes of olfactory stimuli that are physically dissimilar but
are related through a history of association. Twelve odors are arbitrarily partitioned into two sets
of six. Rats are trained to make instrumental responses for reward to one set with no reward for
the other until they are responding exclusively to the rewarded set. Then reward contingencies
are repeatedly reversed and, after extensive training with these procedures, the animals begin
to show transfer of responding or non-responding to all members of each set after exposure to
just a few. This transfer of function among stimuli without direct exposure to the changed
contingencies defines a functional equivalence class and the proposed research will explore
whether these classes share key properties with human symbolic classes or categories. Aim 1
will test whether pairing of a novel stimulus with one class member will result in the novel
stimulus coming to be related to all class members without explicit training. This is called class
expansion and is readily demonstrated in humans. Aim 2 will test whether transfer of a novel
instrumental response across class members will occur in rats as they do in humans. Aim 3 will
test transfer of a Pavlovian conditioned response across class members assessed in a cue-
induced reinstatement paradigm. Finally, in a proof of concept experiment, Aim 4 will examine
whether an odor preference induced by pairing with morphine will transfer to other class
members. These studies form the basis for a model of symbolic processes in rats with potential
translational value to the treatment of SUDs."

10873234,"Project Summary
HIV incidence remains unacceptably high in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) due in part to inadequate access,
uptake, and retention in biomedical HIV prevention services, including pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis
(PrEP/PEP), among persons at increased HIV risk. Alcohol use is a common risk factor for both HIV
acquisition and poor HIV prevention uptake and retention in SSA. Interventions that promote biomedical HIV
prevention among persons with heavy alcohol use and their sexual partners are urgently needed.
Alcohol-serving drinking venues play an important role as sites of HIV transmission in SSA and are ideal sites
to engage women and men at increased risk of HIV in biomedical prevention services. However, despite long-
standing awareness of drinking venues as transmission “hot spots”, few interventions exist to reach and
engage persons in PrEP and PEP from drinking venues in SSA. Major barriers to reaching and engaging
persons at high risk of HIV from community settings such as drinking venues in HIV testing – a critical first step
to accessing biomedical HIV prevention – include HIV-associated stigma and poor perceptions of risk. To
address these barriers, we have developed a mobilization strategy of integrating HIV testing within multi-
disease screening to recruit >2,000 people from drinking venues in Kenya and Uganda, reaching >75% of
adults recruited for HIV testing. We now need to determine whether multi-disease mobilization can promote
uptake of HIV prevention for adults at drinking venues in the context of new biomedical prevention options.
Following uptake of biomedical HIV prevention, persons with heavy alcohol use face challenges with retention
in care and adherence to PrEP/PEP. We have adapted a brief alcohol counseling intervention (Health Living)
to reduce alcohol use and promote antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and HIV viral suppression among
persons with HIV in Kenya and Uganda. We now need to determine whether this intervention can promote
retention in biomedical prevention and PrEP/PEP adherence among adults with heavy alcohol use.
The project will rigorously test innovative interventions in Kenya and Uganda to increase uptake and use of
biomedical HIV prevention, and assess facilitators, barriers, and cost-effectiveness of these approaches.
The project will have the following aims: Aim 1: Compare the effectiveness of two mobilization strategies to
increase uptake of biomedical HIV prevention among adults at drinking venues. Aim 2: Determine the efficacy
of the Healthy Living Intervention (HLI) to reduce heavy alcohol use vs. standard care (control) on retention in
biomedical HIV prevention in a randomized trial among adults with heavy alcohol use. Aim 3: Determine the
cost-effectiveness of interventions that increase biomedical HIV prevention uptake (Aim 1) and retention (Aim
2) among adults at high-risk for HIV who attend drinking venues.
The proposed research will address the critical intersection of alcohol use and HIV risk in SSA, by promoting
reach, uptake and retention in biomedical HIV prevention and exploring associated facilitators and barriers."

Amyloid aggregates are the defining pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), yet the role they play
and the therapeutic effect in targeting these aggregates remains controversial. Little is known about the impact
of the proteome context in which these proteins reside, or what nucleates their aggregation in specific sites in
the brain. Studying the composition of amyloid deposits using proteomic approaches has demonstrated the co-
deposition of many other proteins, however currently there is no straightforward chain-of-events that explains
plaque composition. The predicament in which the field currently subsists critically highlights the lack of suitable
structural-mechanistic models to understand both the causes and consequences of amyloid aggregation in terms
of direct molecular interactions, as well as which specific cellular factors determine pathognomonic disease
initiation.
In this project, the Switch Laboratory in VIB Flanders Institute for Biotechnology will approach the selective
amyloid aggregation of beta amyloid (Aβ) and tau in AD mechanistically and will do a systematic search for
potential interacting partners based on the sequence- and structure-specificity of aggregation. This systematic
and proteome-wide screen is based on the assumption that amyloid aggregation is initiated by the specific
interaction of aggregation-prone regions (APRs) within Aβ and tau with aggregation-prone sequence segments
in other proteins within the background proteome.
They have developed a unique computational pipeline to model heterotypic interactions with sufficient predictive
power to identify amyloid modifiers in cells. The project will investigate the in vivo impact of heterotypic amyloid
interactions in mouse models and for the hits, will analyze in molecular detail how the aggregation of Aβ and tau
is modified by the interactions.
Aim 1 will run an in-silico screen with special emphasis on known factors related to selective vulnerably. The
computational screen will use all-atom modelling of sequence segments with sequence homology to the APRs
of Aβ and tau to identify other brain-expressed proteins that may modify the aggregation of Aβ or tau. Aim 2 will
screen full-length proteins in cellular models to identify candidates that can modify amyloid aggregation of Aβ
and tau in a complex biological context. Aim 3 will identify modifiers that have an effect in vivo by expressing the
most potent modifier proteins in mouse models, to study the impact on aggregation onset and extent of amyloid
pathology of Aβ and tau. For the most promising modifiers identified in Aims 2 and 3, Aim 4 will unravel the
molecular mechanism of selected heterotypic amyloid interactions use state-of-the-art biophysical methods to
elucidate exactly how these interactions change the amyloid formation of Aβ and tau."

In response to PAR-20-056 from the NIDCR to develop and enhance the Dental, Oral and Craniofacial
Research Workforce, a T90/R90 Comprehensive Training Program in Oral Biology is proposed. The proposal
builds on 29 years of experience with highly productive T32 and T90/R90 Training Programs at the University
of Florida College of Dentistry (UFCD) and will provide extensive breadth and depth in training to basic and
clinician scientists in multiple areas that are designated as high priority by the NIDCR. The scientific areas
encompassed in this Comprehensive Training Program in Oral Biology include, but are not limited to, the
Human Microbiome, Oral Infectious Diseases, Mechanistic Connections between Oral and Systemic Health,
Virology, Salivary Gland Biology, Autoimmunity, Bone Biology, Head and Neck Cancers, Computational
Biology, Biomedical Engineering, and Stem Cell Biology. To accomplish our goals, a team of accomplished
basic and clinical researchers has been assembled to provide an extensive set of training experiences in the
biomedical sciences that are directly relevant to oral health and diseases. Well-established interdisciplinary
research training programs in the UFCD and the UF College of Medicine will be utilized, with particular
emphasis on the Interdisciplinary PhD Program in Biomedical Sciences and the UF Clinical and Translational
Science Institute (CTSI). Trainees will include i) 3 traditional PhD students conducting oral health-related
research, ii) 4 dual-degree candidates in our DMD-PhD program, iii) 2 post-doctoral scientists (T90; PhD,
DMD/DDS-PhD, DMD/DDS), and iv) 1 non-citizen, non-permanent resident DMD-PhD holders seeking
advanced post-doctoral training (R90) to prepare them for careers in academic dentistry. In most cases, PhD
and postdoctoral trainees will receive an initial commitment for appointments of three or two years,
respectively, whereas dual-degree students will be supported for the duration of their training. Additional formal
training in Clinical Investigation, Implementation Science or Biomedical Informatics will be available to
individuals supported by the program. The use of combinations of our extensive educational, scientific, and
clinical resources has allowed us to develop highly integrated yet sufficiently flexible training options to meet
the needs of a very diverse group of trainees. Collectively, these programs will produce highly skilled and
interactive scientists who can engage in team science to generate new knowledge and translate discoveries to
tangible advances in the detection, prevention, treatment and cures of diseases and abnormalities of the oral
and craniofacial complex."

Liver plays a central role in S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe, the principal methyl donor) metabolism, as this is
where 50% of methionine intake is catabolized to SAMe. In liver, SAMe biosynthesis is mediated by
methionine adenosyltransferase 1A (MAT1A)-encoded enzyme. Patients with advanced non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH) have reduced MAT1A expression. We developed the Mat1a knockout (KO) mouse
model, which has chronically low hepatic SAMe level, spontaneous development of NASH and hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC). This grant, currently in its 16th year, has supported 77 original papers plus 27 reviews.
During the past funding period we showed how dysregulation of SAMe leads to NASH, defined the
metabolomic signatures as a function of hepatic SAMe content and found nearly 50% of non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease (NAFLD) patients share the M-subtype metabolomic signature of the Mat1a KO mice. Using this
KO model, we have uncovered two novel SAMe targets, aldolase B (ALDOB) hypomethylation and La
Ribonucleoprotein Domain Family Member 1 (LARP1) hyperphosphorylation, that we hypothesize are linked to
NASH progression during fructose consumption and NASH-HCC, respectively. This renewal application tests
this novel hypothesis in two specific aims. Specific Aim 1 examines the role of ALDOB R173 methylation in
NAFLD progression. Our data support the hypothesis that ALDOB exists in two forms: one that is
unmethylated, enzymatically active and senses fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) level to regulating AMPK
activity; and a second form that is methylated, enzymatically inactive and does not regulate AMPK activity. We
further hypothesize that in Mat1a KO mice ALDOB hypomethylation (with higher activity and lower FBP)
activates AMPK as an adaptive response to halt further fatty acid accumulation but this will be disrupted by
fructose consumption, which will increase FBP content and accelerate NASH progression. We will define 1)
how SAMe depletion affect glucose/fructose flux, 2) how ALDOB R173 is methylated and how it affects ALDOB
structure, activity, and FBP sensing, 3) whether fructose consumption accelerates NASH progression through
dampening AMPK activation, and 4) relevance to human NAFLD. Specific Aim 2 will examine the role of
LARP1 in NASH-HCC progression. Our data show LARP1 protein level and phosphorylation at multiple sites
(some are novel) are increased under SAMe depletion, leading to enhanced translation of 5’-terminal
oligopyrimidine tract mRNAs, including proteins involved in translation. Overexpressing LARP1 enhanced HCC
cell growth, migration and invasion. We will define 1) how SAMe regulates LARP1 expression, 2) which
kinases are responsible, 3) how phosphorylation affects LARP1 function, 4) whether LARP1 is a driver of
NASH-HCC in SAMe deficiency, and 5) relevance to human NAFLD. Successful completion of these proposed
aims will provide important insights on how fructose consumption accelerates NASH progression and how
LARP1 drives HCC development in patients with NAFLD, topics that are highly relevant to public health."

Resident Memory CD8 T cells (TRM) in the female reproductive tract (FRT) have a proven protective role
against viral infections. As such positioning of CD8 TRM of high quantity and quality that are durably
maintained is a key goal to achieve protective antiviral immunity in the FRT. Detailed understanding of
molecular cues that guide FRT TRM differentiation is essential to attain this objective. Cells in the local
environment i.e., reproductive mucosa is thought to be a big source of signals that shape CD8 TRM
differentiation. Rodent models have emerged as key to understanding these molecular signals and local
interactions. However, the complex nature of the in vivo vaginal microenvironment along with technical issues
associated with inefficient FRT TRM isolation process have limited execution of high throughput studies
focused on identifying these cellular communications. We have established an in vitro three-dimensional
vaginal epithelial organoid system (VEO) that accurately captures the features of in vivo multilayered stratified
vaginal epithelium. By culturing these VEOs with CD8 T cells, we were able to induce CD8 TRM differentiation
and the resulting TRM phenotypically and transcriptionally resembled antiviral TRM generated in mouse. We
aim to leverage this VEO-CD8 coculture model to rapidly uncover fate-specifying regulators of FRT TRM and
investigate fundamental interactions between the vaginal epithelium and CD8 T cells that govern TRM
differentiation. In aim-1, we will execute a targeted RNAi screening approach to rapidly define transcription
factors (TFs) that instruct TRM formation in the VEO system. We have previously found that the TF Runx3
supports TRM differentiation in diverse non-lymphoid tissues, and here, we will evaluate an unappreciated role
for Runx3 in driving FRT TRM differentiation in vitro. Lastly, transcriptional profiling of VEO-induced TRM found
an undescribed role for retinoic acid (RA) in promoting TRM formation in the vaginal epithelium. In aim-2, we
will utilize the VEO-CD8 coculture system as well as in vivo infection models to test if CD8 T cell intrinsic or
extrinsic RA signaling regulates TRM formation. The proposed study will establish a robust reductionist
alternative to the in vivo mouse models currently in use and will provide novel mechanistic insights into
epithelial-CD8 T cell interaction in the vaginal mucosa."

 Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a clinical syndrome that represents the end-stage of chronic parenchymal
lung diseases. Dysfunctional repair of the distal lung epithelium has been hypothesized as central to PF
pathogenesis, but the mechanisms governing epithelial repair following injury remain incompletely understood.
In order to comprehensively profile the cell types and gene expression programs driving PF, we performed
single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of peripheral tissue from PF and control lungs and identified dramatic
changes in cell types, states, and expression programs in PF lung epithelium including a previously
undescribed KRT5-/KRT17+ “distal basal cell” (DBC) population that produces pathologic extracellular matrix.
Independently, using whole-exome sequencing for genetic discovery in families with pulmonary fibrosis
(Familial Interstitial Pneumonia, FIP), we identified rare mutations in an orphan G-protein coupled receptor
(GPR87) that segregate with disease, implicating GPR87 as a novel FIP risk gene. Our preliminary data
indicate that GPR87 gene expression is dramatically increased in lung tissue from patients with sporadic cases
of IPF, and localizes specifically to these newly described pathologic ECM-producing DBCs. In mice, as in
humans, Gpr87 expression was low in the peripheral lung; however, expression increases substantially after
following bleomycin injury, where it localized to distal basal cells. We generated mice expressing an FIP-
associated mutant form of Gpr87 using a CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing strategy and found that mice carrying a
single-copy of the mutation (Gpr87mut/wt) had increased lung fibrosis compared to control mice following a
single-dose bleomycin. Unchallenged mice carrying biallelic mutations (Gpr87mut/mut) develop spontaneous
airway epithelial remodeling and striking atypical hyperplasia in vivo. Consistent with these findings, culture of
Gpr87mut/mut mouse tracheal epithelial cells (MTECs) in air-liquid interface (ALI) and 3D organoid systems
resulted in aberrant epithelial differentiation. Together, our preliminary data implicate DBCs in PF pathogenesis
and suggest that GPR87 regulates the fate and function of these cells. Our hypothesis is that GPR87
regulates proliferation and differentiation of distal basal cells, which are required for efficient repair of alveolar
epithelium after severe or repetitive injury. Our specific aims are: 1) Determine the role of Gpr87-
expressing distal basal cells in promoting lung fibrosis. 2) Identify mechanisms regulating distal
basal cell fate and function in severe and chronic alveolar injury. 3) Investigate GPR87-dependent
regulation of basal cell function and differentiation. In studies proposed below, we will use innovative
transgenic mouse, organoid and inducible pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based models to investigate the
mechanisms through which GPR87 contributes to fibrotic susceptibility and adaptive versus pathologic lung
epithelial repair."

The conversion of dinitrogen to ammonia is required for the global nitrogen cycle and is accomplished biologically
by nitrogenase enzymes. Although highly inert, dinitrogen is “fixed” by nitrogenase enzymes, and made
biologically available, allowing uptake to form key nutrients necessary to sustain life. The nitrogenase enzyme
active site features a multi-metallic core contained within a complex network of amino acids, which are necessary
to orchestrate a series of multi-proton, multi-electron transfers to small molecule substrates during the reduction
process. Although crucial for dinitrogen reduction, the precise molecular role that these secondary interactions
serve to promote reduction is not well known. More explicitly, the scientific community does not precisely know
where and how substrates bind, how electrons are delivered, and products released. Thus, there is an inherent
gap in our knowledge underlying key contributors to nitrogenase reactivity. To address this gap, this proposal
targets the design and study of small molecular constructs that contain highly directed and variable secondary
coordination sphere interactions. We will use a rational design approach to prepare synthetic analogues that
feature modifiable appended functionality (hydrogen-bond donors, Lewis acids/bases) in the secondary
coordination sphere environment to evaluate cooperative reactivity. We will use these molecular structures to
test key mechanistic hypotheses regarding the molecular-level reduction of substrates using secondary-sphere
cooperativity. We propose that the same type of interactions evaluated in our synthetic systems that promote
nitrogenase-type activity can be, by extension, adapted to describe biological systems. The knowledge we
acquire will provide key needed contributions to mechanistic studies of nitrogenase function and also synthetic
nitrogenases. Substrate activation promoted by highly directed secondary sphere interactions is a broad theme
among many biocatalytic cycles, and thus, we envision that the results of our studies will have broad utility to
elucidate meaningful contributors to enzymatic reactivity."

The Life After 90 Study is a lifecourse cohort study of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD),
cerebropathology, and cognitive aging in diverse oldest-old individuals. Recently launched, and still enrolling, LA90 is the
largest, most ethnic/racially diverse cohort study of the oldest-old with prospective clinical and lifestyle data from as early
as 1960/70s. In Cycle 1, we enrolled 908 individuals aged 90+ (mean age 92.6, range 90-105) from a range of enthoracial
backgrounds (22% Black, 24% Asian, 20% Latino, 28% White, 1% Other, 6% Multi-Race). Participants are seen every 6
months with an average of 2.9 research visits per person to date. All visits include an extensive neuropsychology battery
and clinical exam, research interview including measures of lifecourse social experience, brain donation program, and,
among a subset, PET and MRI imaging. The LA90 cohort encompasses an array of life experiences, 17% were born
outside of the US, 35% have <high school education, 40% are multilingual or learned English as a second language, and
24% born in southern US. Our initial findings suggest that there is vast heterogeneity and complexity in the trajectory of
cognitive change, brain pathologies, and neuroimaging markers of brain status in the 10th and 11th decade of life. In this
competitive renewal application, we extend our science to investigate blood-based biomarkers for ADRD in oldest-old
using the ATN framework (amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration), expand our brain donation-based pathology, and enroll an
additional 500 ethnic/racially diverse participants. Additionally, we will leverage decades of antecedent health data
available to identify early and midlife markers for oldest-old cognitive `SuperAgers'. Our aims are: Aim 1. Enroll 500
additional oldest-old individuals to determine more precise age-specific, race-specific, and sex- specific incident rates of
cognitive impairment, ADRD, and cognitive decline over 8 years. Aim 2: Determine the contribution of neuroimaging
markers of amyloid, vascular injury, and brain atrophy on cognitive decline and ADRD in diverse oldest-old. Aim 3:
Continue enrollment into brain donation and characterize the contribution of brain pathologies on cognitive decline, and
ADRD in the oldest-old. Aim 4: Collect and quantify blood-based biomarkers consistent with the ATN framework and
evaluate their contribution to ADRD and cognitive impairment in diverse oldest-old individuals. Aim 5: In a diverse
cohort of oldest-old, identify and understand lifecourse predictors of cognitive `SuperAgers'. Renewal of LA90 will create
an unprecedented scientific resource for studying ADRD and cognitive outcomes in a diverse cohort of oldest-old
individuals, a group representing the rapid diversification of this population."

Endothelial barrier dysfunction (EBD) has been associated with crucial lung injury ((e.g. acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS)) and deaths in the Intensive Care Units. Approved medicine that specifically
targets EBD does not exist, hence the development of efficient medical countermeasures in that context is of
the utmost need. Synthetic somatostatin analogs (SSAs) suppress the secretion of growth hormone (GH),
are FDA-approved, and are currently used in clinics for the treatment of acromegaly and neuroendocrine
neoplasms. This R03 proposal is based on the concept that SSAs protect against EBD. If our hypothesis is
proven correct, SSAs can be eventually tested against the corresponding disorders. Based on preliminary
observations, we will pursue Specific Aim 1 to investigate the role of Lanreotide (LAN), Octreotide (OCT)
and Pasireotide (PAS) in LPS- and IFNγ -induced EBD. To do so, we will utilize human lung microvascular
endothelial cells, post-treated with SSAs after LPS or IFNγ exposure, to assess their effects in transcellular
and paracellular permeability, cell injury and inflammation. Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) is a
homeostatic signaling network activated upon increases of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and it is
involved in the regulation of endothelial barrier function. Global UPR induction counteracts Kifunensine
(UPR suppressor)-triggered EBD. Our preliminary observations suggest that LAN induces BiP-a UPR
activation marker- and activates ATF6, which has been shown to deliver protection in experimental models
of widespread disease. To further our studies, we selectively suppressed ATF6 in endothelial cells to reveal
that targeted ATF6 suppression potentiates LPS-induced EBD. Based on our published and unpublished
observations, we will assess Specific Aim 2, to examine the involvement of ATF6 in the protective effects of
SSAs in EBD. We will test the effects of SSAs in inflamed endothelial cells that express more or less of ATF6,
in the context of injury and barrier function. New preliminary data suggest that LAN and OCT oppose LPS-
induced acute lung injury (ALI) in mice. Based on those observations, New Specific Aim 3 will further our
knowledge on the effects of SSAs in a murine model of LPS-induced ALI, and in the context of ATF6. The
completion of our studies will reveal a novel avenue of investigation, based on the SSAs application in
disorders related to EBD. All necessary material is commercially available, and alternative approaches have
been developed to cover most of the possible outcomes. To the best of our knowledge, thorough studies on
the effects of SSAs in EBD - and in the context of ATF6 - have not been conducted, yet."

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide.
Unfortunately, there is currently no FDA approved medication for any stage of ALD. Advancing our knowledge
on the pathophysiologic mechanisms of ALD will certainly pave the way to development of therapeutic
interventions. One of the known mechanisms of alcohol-induced liver injury is the perturbation of lipid metabolic
pathways. In fact, alcoholic steatosis is the earliest pathological change in ALD. In the past funding period, we
have shown that instead of triglyceride, accumulated free fatty acid (FFA) levels positively correct with disease
severity in experimental models of ALD. However, how alcohol causes FFA accumulation in the liver and the
feasibility of FFA lowering approaches for treating ALD are still open questions to be elucidated. Through profiling
hepatic FFAs, we found that the most significantly altered and abundant FFA species were long chain FAs
(LCFA) which were increased by alcohol. On the other hand, their activated forms, long chain acyl-CoAs, were
decreased by alcohol, suggesting a defect in FA activation by long chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL). Our
preliminary study detected two ACSL isoforms in the liver, ACSL1 and ACSL4, that both were downregulated
after alcohol exposure. ACSL1 is a major form of hepatic ACSLs that is critical for channeling FA to mitochondrial
β-oxidation, whereas ACSL4 specifically targets arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism and has been reported to be
critically involved in ER VLDL lipidation. Along with reduced VLDL secretion rate as well as its lipidation status,
we indeed found that alcohol exposure decreases hepatic AA-CoA despite an increased AA. Moreover, we found
that the expression of ACSL1 and ACSL4 were positively correlated with aryl hydrocarbon receptor both in vivo
and in vitro. All evidence collected strongly supports a novel concept that defect in ACSL-mediated hepatic FA
channeling plays a critical role in FA disposal disorder and in alcohol-induced lipotoxicity, which is tightly
controlled by AhR. We will test the hypothesis in 3 aims. In Aim 1, we will investigate the role of ACSL1 in
directing the metabolic switch toward mitochondrial β-oxidation versus ER ω-oxidation in order to reduce toxic
lipid production from ER and to prevent lipotoxicity in ALD. In Aim 2, we will explore how ACSL4 is involved in
AA channeling to ER for VLDL lipidation and/or to peroxisome for β-oxidation other than converting to toxic lipid
mediators. In Aim 3, we will determine whether the expression of ACSL is regulated by AhR at transcription level.
We also will test the effect of endogenous AhR ligand in reversing ACSL expression and protecting alcohol-
induced lipotoxicity. Understanding these mechanisms will enable us to develop targeted dietary therapies to
prevent and treat ALD."

Epigenetic dysregulation is an emerging hallmark of cancers, and examples of cancer associated
overexpression, mutation, translocation, or aberrant recruitment of the proteins which regulate the epigenome
are rapidly emerging. NSD2 (nuclear receptor-binding SET domain-containing 2) is a key player in epigenetic
regulation, known for its ability to mono- and dimethylate lysine 36 of histone 3 (H3K36). This mark is associated
with active transcription, and elevated levels of H3K36me2 lead to aberrant activation of normally silenced genes.
Consequently, NSD2 is a potent oncoprotein and has been implicated as a therapeutic target for a variety of
cancers. NSD2 was found to be among the most frequently mutated genes across 1,000 pediatric cancer
genomes representing 21 different pediatric cancer subtypes. A study in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL) cell lines and patient samples revealed a recurring gain of function mutation (E1099K) which resulted in
elevated H3K36me2 levels. Furthermore, NSD2 is involved in the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma (MM) which
is the second most common blood cancer. 15-20% of MM patients carry a translocation between chromosomes
4 and 14 [t(4;14)(p16.3;q32)] of which NSD2 is thought to be the primary oncogenic driver.
In addition to its catalytic SET domain, NSD2 contains several methyl-lysine (Kme) reader domains including
four PHD fingers and two PWWP domains which are thought to be critical in propagating H3K36me2 and
recruiting NSD2 to its oncogenic target genes. Although NSD2 clearly shows promise as a therapeutic target in
oncology, no small molecule ligands have been reported to date and it remains unclear as to which domains are
`druggable' and function most critically in promoting tumorigenesis. The creation of high-quality NSD2 chemical
probes will clearly provide much needed insight and serve as critical reagents in assessing preclinical target
validity, while providing the potential for an immediate transition to a drug discovery effort. Our recent efforts to
target the N-terminal PWWP domain of NSD2 have been successful in producing potent lead compounds.
With novel NSD2 inhibitors in hand, we aim to explore the development of NSD2 protein degradation reagents
which capitalize on advantages of small molecule inhibitors while moving beyond the limitations of traditional
receptor pharmacology. This emerging drug discovery strategy is particularly well-suited for NSD2 because 1) it
is a large multi-domain protein and we lack knowledge of the best domain to target, 2) inhibition of a single
domain may not be sufficient to phenocopy NDS2 genetic knockdown results and more broadly prevent
tumorigenesis, and 3) Kme reader domains are generally viewed as difficult drug targets. The overall objective
of this proposal is to apply medicinal chemistry, chemical biology, and cancer biology approaches to discover
first-in-class NSD2 bifunctional degraders in order to better understand NSD2 cancer biology, to assess NSD2
preclinical target validity, and as potential therapeutic agents."
10881732,"ABSTRACT
 Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) constitute 10% of all genomes, yet they remain the wild west of
biology, even though they function within the host cell in a myriad of critical ways, including as regulatory
elements, as extracellular messengers, as sources of viral-like particles (VLPs), and, importantly, as somatic
mutagens. Our overreaching goal is to understand how the ERV family, IAP (Intracisternal type A Protein),
functions at the mouse maternal-fetal interface. Thousands of genomic IAP instances exist that consist of gag,
pro, pol sequences flanked by LTRs. These instances have lost the ancestral envelope (env) sequence and
form naked VLPs that remain inside the cell and can transpose. Today, only a single copy, IAPE-D1, remains
with a conserved envelope (env) sequence that mediates extracellular release of its VLPs. This strong
evolutionary conservation of the env in IAPE-D1 suggests that it serves an important extracellular function.
Thus, IAPs function in two distinct cellular domains: one as an extracellular messenger, and the other as an
intracellular source of regulation and mutation.
 The rigor of prior research strongly supports this hypothesis. More than 50 years ago VLPs were
described in placentas of all species, including mouse and human. The source of the mouse VLPs is likely IAP
as we find that it is the only ERV family expressed during placentation. Our data suggests that these VLPs are
functional as, when we knock down IAP using shRNA in trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) or in mouse embryos,
we observe defects in differentiation and placentation. Further, we find that IAP binds specific RNAs in TSCs,
including those that mediate differentiation and imprinting, suggesting that IAP VLPs contain cargo.
Importantly, we find that IAP protein is expressed in maternal tissues in the absence of transcript, suggesting
that it was transported from the neighboring placental cells. Based on our own preliminary results and more
than 50 years of prior research on IAP, we hypothesize that 1) the only extracellular IAP, IAPE-D1, is forming
VLPs in the mouse placenta that transport specific RNAs into the maternal decidua and 2) the intracellular
IAPs serve multiple functions including the generation of naked VLPs that are mutagenic and as sequences
that serve as critical regulatory elements within the placenta genome. While human placentas do not have IAP,
they do have HERVK, which forms VLPs that are likely to serve similar functions especially given that the
placenta is a hotspot for convergent evolution. Overall, this proposal will deliver the function and mechanism
of a major fraction of the unexplored genome during pregnancy."

Dysfunctional inflammatory immune responses to modified lipids/cholesterol and bacterial components such as
LPS leads to unresolved and chronic inflammation, promoting various metabolic and genetic diseases. One
prime example of chronic inflammatory disease is atherosclerosis, a major cause of cardiovascular disease
(CVD) related mortalities. Despite progress in treatments, CVD still accounts for ~1 out of every 3 deaths in the
USA. Another disease related to dysregulated cholesterol metabolism and unresolved extrahepatic
inflammation is progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis 1 (PFIC1), where mutations in ATP8b1 (a member
of the type 4 subfamily of P-type ATPases) perturbs the detergent-resistant state of the hepatic canalicular
membrane, leading to hepatic injury. While much is known about the pathophysiology of PFIC1, the underlying
mechanism for how the loss of ATP8b1 leads to compromised integrity of the canalicular membrane is not
clear. A high throughput proteomic analysis suggests that ATP8b1 flippase activity and phosphoinositide
metabolism may be interconnected, but the mechanistic link between ATP8b1 and phosphatidylinositol
metabolism is not clear. Our data provide novel insights into the mechanism that leads to plasma membrane
remodeling in PFIC1 macrophages and hepatocytes by establishing role of ATP8b1 in PIP2 trafficking. We are
proposing cutting-edge methods to unequivocally establish PIP2 flippase activity of ATP8b1, making it the first
known PIP2 flippase from any system. PFIC1 patients often present with extrahepatic inflammatory
manifestations, suggesting role of ATP8b1 in regulating inflammation. Recent studies have highlighted the
major role of pyroptosis executor Gasdermin D (GsdmD), a pore-forming protein, in promoting a variety of
inflammatory diseases. Our data identified ATP8b1 as the first known negative regulator of GsdmD cleavage
and we propose to decipher the mechanism of this effect in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and
mouse models of inflammation. In addition, we will determine the therapeutic efficacy of targeting GsdmD in
reducing atherosclerosis and determine the tissue-specific role of GsdmD in CVD.
Successful completion of these aims will reveal new biology underlying PFIC1 extrahepatic inflammatory
manifestations and GsdmD-induced progression of atherosclerosis. Our data showing GsdmD cleavage to be
the primary mechanism behind increased IL-1β release in ATP8b1-/- monocytes and macrophages may allow
the design of anti-GsdmD therapeutics for treating extrahepatic inflammation in PFIC1. Our data showing the
efficacy of Disulfiram as an anti-atherosclerotic reagent in hyperlipidemic mice provide pre-clinical data for
targeting GsdmD for treating atherosclerosis. Elucidation of tissue-specific role of GsdmD will open up new
fields of investigation and therapeutic interventions for treating atherosclerosis."
10890030,"Reinforcement learning (RL) is a fundamental learning process that is common across species and essential
for cognitive flexibility and survival. In addition to neuroscience and psychology, RL also has proved valuable in
the field of artificial intelligence (AI), achieving super-human performance in complex tasks. Understanding of
the neural mechanism of RL would facilitate not only the development of diagnosis and treatment for learning
and cognitive disorders but also development of novel deep RL architectures in AI. In this proposal, we aim to
gain insights into how different brain areas work together to support RL.
To tackle this problem, we use a behavioral task that entails two layers of RL at different timescales: fast RL to
solve the task within a session and slow RL to learn the fast RL strategy over weeks/months of training. By
leveraging mouse genetics and cutting-edge technology such as longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging of
neural population activity and dopamine signaling, optogenetics, plasticity perturbation, and modeling with
artificial deep RL networks, we will investigate the neural mechanisms of the fast and slow. In particular, we
hypothesize that synaptic plasticity in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) plays a central role in slow RL. We will
investigate the functions of OFC and its dopamine signaling in RL in Aims 1 and 2. In Aim 3, we will examine
how OFC interacts with other cortical areas in RL. These aims will uncover the large-scale circuit basis of
different aspects of RL and offer a novel conceptual framework to understand how RL is implemented in the
brain."
10890032,"The link between neural circuits and behavioral performance has been an enduring mystery in neuroscience. A
fundamental observation of both neurons and behavior has been that they both exhibit variability. This
variability can manifest on a variety of time scales, from minutes to hours to days, and across many spatial
scales, from local populations of neurons to the whole brain. One important missing feature in our
understanding of cognition and behavior, that may explain some of the apparent variability, is a lack of insight
into the brain’s internal cognitive state while performing any task. The coordination among neurons across the
brain is critical to achieving any internal cognitive state, such as attention or arousal. This coordination has
been extensively studied at the level of field potentials, but relatively rarely in populations of single neurons.
Furthermore, because the coordination among neurons in a pair of brain areas may relate to the action of
distant brain circuits, teasing apart the fundamental neural circuits that give rise to coordinated neural activity,
and the link in turn to behavior, has been challenging. At the same time, pharmacological approaches targeted
at neuromodulatory systems have proved a powerful, if coarse, means to influence behavior and treat disease.
We will study neural coordination across scales, from field potentials and neurovascular signals measured at
the scalp, to populations of spiking neurons in cortex, to individual neurons in a deep brain structure that
modulates cortical activity. Simultaneously, we will measure behavior on cognitive and perceptual tasks as well
as the pupil, which we have shown in previous work exhibit slow fluctuations on the time scale of minutes to
hours. Our strategy is to identify how neuronal coordination of cortical neurons is indicative of internal cognitive
state and neuromodulatory input, and can be modified to alter cognition and behavior. We will do this in a
computational framework that links the variability among neurons in a population to internal states of the brain
and in turn to behavior. In our first specific aim, we will test the hypothesis that field potentials and
neurovascular signals at the scalp are directly linked to neuronal coordination in prefrontal cortex and behavior.
In the second aim, we will test the hypothesis that neuronal coordination in prefrontal cortex as well as
systemic indicators of arousal are influenced by norepinephrine efflux from the locus coeruleus. Finally, in the
third aim, we will test the hypothesis that direct intervention in this circuit by microstimulating the locus
coeruleus can alter neuronal coordination in cortex and in turn influence behavior. The overall result of this
study will be to establish a direct link between coordinated activity in the cortex, neuromodulatory drive, and
cognition and behavior. This will aid in developing treatments for myriad neurological disorders that involve
altered states of arousal or changes in norepinephrine drive, and establish a framework for understanding the
link between large-scale measures of neuronal coordination (like oscillations in field potentials at the scalp) and
neuronal circuit mechanisms."

The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant social, healthcare, and economic
devastation in the United States (US), potentially exacerbating the maternal health disparities facing rural
women and women of color. Telehealth represents a promising opportunity to reducing disparities in maternal
health access, quality, and outcomes, given its substantial range of opportunities, including audiovisual
synchronous and asynchronous encounters between patients and providers, remote patient monitoring,
facilitating visual communication of evidence-based practice, and supporting clinical decision-making. Yet,
multilevel barriers might hinder some underserved women from fully benefiting from telehealth. Expanded
federal and state-level telehealth coverage through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security
(CARES) Act and state policies may be mitigating the detrimental effects of this unprecedented pandemic by
reducing gaps in access to telehealth and quality maternity care. Although self-reported data indicated abrupt
increases in telehealth uptake during the pandemic, limited real-world data are available regarding the role of
perinatal telehealth uptake on the pandemic’s effects and the role of state level policy in telehealth adaptation
during COVID-19. This longitudinal, real-world data study will use recurring national electronic health records
(EHR) data [National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C)] and integrated statewide population-based data in
South Carolina and Florida which complement the overrepresentation of urban populations in N3C. With
multiple innovative approaches using common data modeling, multi-level imputation for missingness, and
Bayesian statistics simulation methods, this study aims to: 1) investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
on maternal care access, quality, and maternal and birth outcomes by maternal race/ethnicity and rural/urban
residence; 2) examine whether perinatal telehealth uptake mitigates the pandemic's effects on disparities in
maternal care access, quality, and outcomes by maternal race/ethnicity and rural/urban residence; and 3)
assess how state-level telehealth policies (relaxation for originating sites, reimbursements for store-and-
forward services, remote patient monitoring, and provider expansion) – relate to perinatal telehealth uptake by
race-ethnicity and rural/urban residence. We will also 4) develop a stochastic simulation model to predict
long-term changes in maternal care access, quality, outcomes, and expenditures of maternity care, with and
without each respective state telehealth policy. Our overarching goal is to advance the understanding of the
three-way intersections among the COVID-19 pandemic, state telehealth policy, and perinatal telehealth uptake
on health disparities facing vulnerable maternal populations – rural and racial/ethnic minority women. We
have formed a multidisciplinary team of investigators, including maternal health services researchers, health
policy analysts, telehealth experts, senior clinical researchers, perinatal epidemiologists, rural health advocates,
health psychologist, big data analysts, and machine learning experts to conduct this study."
10890051,"Adoptive T cell therapy for cancer has proven remarkably successful and is capable of producing high response
rates and dramatic remission in some patients. Currently it is more effective against liquid than solid tumors,
due to the environment within tumors being hostile for T cell survival and function. As is true of many tumors,
melanomas are highly glycolytic, and deplete the local glucose concentration. Melanomas that develop
resistance to Vemurafenib undergo metabolic remodeling to become dependent upon glutamine. As both
glucose and glutamine are essential for effector CD8 T cell differentiation and anti-tumor effector functions, the
T cell response is compromised in the tumor microenvironment. Advances in adoptive T cell therapy have
focused mostly on better targeting and activation of tumor-specific T cells, however they may still fail to thrive in
this metabolically challenging environment. Engineering cells with the flexibility to use multiple carbon sources,
with less reliance on glucose and glutamine, is one very promising approach that could be layered onto any
tumor targeting strategy. In this application we show that CD8 T cells lacking in the transcriptional repressor
Zbtb20 display enhanced glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism, and increased fuel flexibility relative to wild-
type cells. Single cell transcriptional profiling confirmed these metabolic changes and confirmed phenotypic
studies showing a skewing toward the memory fate. Consistent with these attributes being favorable for anti-
tumor immunity, we found adoptive transfer of Zbtb20-deficient CD8 T cells conferred superior immunity upon
challenge with melanoma or adenocarcinoma cells. Therefore, suppression of Zbtb20 is a very promising
approach to improve T cell metabolism for adoptive immunotherapy. In this proposal we determine the precise
molecular mechanisms underlying enhanced anti-tumor immunity, mechanisms for elevated glycolytic and
mitochondrial metabolism, and the extent to which each change is responsible for anti-tumor immunity. We also
determine the extent to which a dominant negative mutant of Zbtb20 can replicate enhanced protection observed
in Zbtb20 deficient cells, as this is more readily translatable to human T cells. These studies will reveal the
mechanism(s) by which Zbtb20 deficiency enhances anti-tumor immunity and investigates strategies that can
be translated into human T cell adoptive therapy."
10890054,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Black cigarette smokers, 85% of whom smoke menthol cigarettes, suffer excess tobacco-caused morbidity and
death, including cancer. Menthol (v. non-menthol) cigarette smokers, especially Black smokers, have a greater
dependence on nicotine and are less likely to quit smoking, despite having more quit attempts. This may be
partly due to greater abstinence-induced declines in positive mood/affect and nicotine cravings. However, there
are limited data on the underlying mechanisms that explain smoking lapses among Black menthol smokers.
Prior studies have used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to examine how negative affect (i.e., poor
mood), nicotine craving (i.e., urge to smoke), and contextual factors predict cigarette smoking lapse in real-
time. Understanding these underlying mechanisms will help us develop effective cessation interventions for
Black menthol smokers. To fill these critical research gaps, this study will use EMA to 1) examine the within-
subject association between momentary negative affect, nicotine craving, and smoking lapse (aim 1) and 2)
examine momentary perceived stress and discrimination as moderators of the momentary affect, nicotine
craving, and smoking lapse relationship (aim 2) among Black menthol cigarette smokers who do and do not
use e-cigarettes. Our central hypothesis is that, at the within-subjects level, higher levels of negative affect
than usual will be associated with stronger nicotine cravings, and in turn predict momentary smoking lapse
(any v. no smoking) among Black menthol cigarette smokers during a quit attempt. We will recruit 150 Black
Arkansan menthol cigarette smokers aged 21-64 who plan to quit smoking in the next 30 days (n=100 cigarette
only smokers; n=50 cigarette-e-cigarette dual users) to test our hypothesis on the primary outcome momentary
of smoking lapse (any v no smoking). Secondary outcomes include time to smoking lapse, time to smoking
relapse, and cigarette consumption. We will also conduct exploratory between-subject analyses by e-cigarette
use status. Participants will complete a baseline 7-day pre-quit EMA wave and 7-day post-quit EMA wave, as
well as baseline, 1 month, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up online surveys. Smoking status will be verified
using exhaled carbon monoxide. This study will fill literary gaps on momentary predictors of smoking lapses
among Black menthol smokers and will provide preliminary data for an R01 application. The PI has assembled
an outstanding mentorship team who will guide her rigorous training and career development plans. Through
formal coursework, summer institutes, hands-on training, and external trainings the PI will increase her
competency in EMA/mHealth, randomized behavioral trials, advanced statistics, and tobacco disparities and
regulatory science research. Receipt of this K award will strengthen the PI's likelihood of achieving her career
goal to become an independent researcher and conduct technology-supported observational studies and
interventions that aim to increase successful smoking cessation among socially-disadvantaged smokers."
10890064,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Genomic medicine has led to the discovery of the underlying genetic contributions to hundreds of rare,
hereditary disorders. Advances in diagnosis and treatment, though, have been crucially impaired by patients
feeling of a lack of clinical or social validation, leaving them feeling disbelieved. These feelings of invalidation
delay diagnosis, causing an extended “diagnostic odyssey,” by driving patients to avoid healthcare and leading
to adverse health outcomes. The care for patients with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS), one of the most
prominent rare genetic diseases, is a prime site of such failure. Clinicians may downplay or even dismiss
patients often-disabling musculoskeletal pain, leading patients to report negative experiences and distrust in
clinical encounters. Little work has focused on the experiences and views of such patients or their clinicians,
making it impossible to improve communication and address feelings of invalidation that drive these problems.
Therefore, research is urgently needed to identify and evaluate ways to improve how patients with EDS – as
well as other, similar rare diseases – come to feel validated and invalidated, and how invalidation can be
countered, to supplement and support the breakthroughs in genetics that are revolutionizing care in these
areas. The goal of the proposed study is to characterize the views and opinions of patients with EDS and their
clinicians regarding the role of molecular diagnosis in validating the experiences of patients with rare diseases.
The central hypothesis is that feelings of invalidation directly contribute to an increasingly troubled patient–
provider relationship, and that a molecular diagnosis may alleviate some of those troubles while exacerbating
others. This proposal has three specific aims. Aim 1: Characterize the events and interactions that affect
feelings of validation among patients as they pursued a diagnosis of EDS, using in-depth, qualitative interviews
and a survey, to capture diverse perspectives. Aim 2: Characterize the challenges faced by clinicians in caring
for patients with EDS, using in-depth, qualitative interviews and a vignette-based survey, with clinicians in
primary care, medical genetics, and rheumatology. Aim 3: Develop strategies to improve validation among
patients with rare disease, adapting methods used by the National Academies to convene a longitudinal
working group to discuss outcomes of Aims 1 and 2, to identify concrete, pragmatic communication strategies,
informed by ELSI research, to improve feelings of validation among patients living with EDS and similar
disorders. The PI’s background in ethics and anthropology and the excellent facilities at Indiana University
School of Medicine uniquely position him to execute this study successfully. This proposal extends his skills in
ethics research in medical genomics and rare disease by providing critical training in quantitative data analysis,
patients-centered care in medical genetics, and interventional research. This K01 award will provide the PI the
opportunity to develop into a leading independent investigator in the field of applied Ethical, Legal and Social
Implications (ELSI) research, focused on improving care for patients with rare genetic diseases."
10890122,"The COVID-19 pandemic, transmission mitigation strategies and policies implemented across the United States
led to major disruption in day-to-day life, producing immediate effects on individuals, families and
communities. We hypothesize that the pandemic will have broadly negative health and economic consequences,
but that mitigation strategies and policies will affect participants differently in the short-, medium- and long-term
based on work, family, social, and health circumstances, which can only be thoroughly examined with
longitudinal analyses of data prior to and throughout the pandemic. We propose a “shovel ready” project
leveraging the existing longitudinal data collected in the Fragile Families and Childhood Wellbeing Study
(FFCWS), the longest running population-based US birth cohort, collected before and throughout the pandemic
linked with multilevel COVID-19 related health, social and economic measures, and prospective COVID-19
impact assessments to examine these issues. FFCWS follows a representative sample of 4,898 children born
1998-2000 in large US cities and their parents over 7 waves (3,580 families participated at the last wave),
providing a deep history of social support, economic factors, and health at the individual, family, neighborhood,
city, and state levels. Due to the unique sampling strategy and COVID-19 transmission patterns, over 87%
FFCWS families are considered underserved or COVID-19 vulnerable. Focal children are entering early
adulthood, a period when major adversity may derail that transition and parents are entering middle age where
the impacts of COVID-19 on health and financial resources are likely to have particularly large consequences.
We will also reinterview 1,400 respondents (700 parent-adult child pairs) over two additional waves on health,
economic, and behavior related to COVID-19. In collaboration with the COVID consortium, our aims are to first
compare essential workers (50% of FFCWS parents and 36% of young adults), non-essential workers, and
individuals who lost their jobs (over 20%) during the pandemic on short-term health, economic social and
behavioral outcomes. Second, to investigate immediate and downstream effects of COVID mitigation efforts on
interpersonal, intergenerational and family relationships and health resources. Third, to analyze immediate and
downstream effects of COVID transmission, mitigation efforts, and COVID-related policies on health using
contextual data (i.e., national, state, and local policy implementation and behavior) linked to measures of
individual health in young adults and their parents collected before, and multiple times throughout the pandemic.
We will also examine how these macro-level effects on individuals differ by other contextual measures such as
indicators of structural racism. This project will: 1) share macro-level data on COVID-19 burden and mitigation
strategies that can be linked to other studies, 2) share FFCWS COVID-19 impact survey data, 3) produce
scholarly products on the short-term (2020-21), mid-term (2022-23), long-term (2024-26) effects of the COVID-
19 pandemic in a vulnerable population representative of children born in large US cities and their parents."

Reading Disability (RD) is the most common learning disability, affecting 10 – 15% of school age children. It
incurs major functional impairments at all stages of life, with a wealth of data documenting lifelong disadvantages
in educational and occupational attainment. Therefore, identifying effective and affordable treatments for RD is
a high priority for reading researchers, clinicians and educators. Problematically, current evidence-based reading
interventions largely rely on services by trained specialists, either in well-resourced classrooms or clinical
settings. As such, under-resourced schools (or countries) often are unable to provide reading interventions for
their students. In recent years, technology-based reading interventions have been proposed as a means of
overcoming these challenges, as they can be administered in the home, without direct expert supervision -
thereby minimizing resource demands. In the area of reading-focused EdTech, GraphoLearn has emerged as a
leader, with the largest evidence-base to date. However, the vast majority of studies to date have been conducted
in highly controlled settings, rather than the home environment it was intended for – leaving open questions
about effectiveness. Additionally, similar to any intervention, not all children with RD benefit equally from
treatment; however little attention has been given to identifying predictors of treatment response.
Here we propose to evaluate the effectiveness of home-administered GraphoLearn through the implementation
of a large-scale, randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 450 reading disabled children (boys and girls, ages 6.0-
10.0). To accomplish this goal rapidly and with minimal cost, we will recruit participants from the Healthy Brain
Network [HBN], an ongoing study of mental health and learning disorders in children, ages 5.0-21.0, whose
family have concerns about behavior and/or learning (target n = 10,000; current n = 3000+). The availability of
comprehensive characterizations (e.g., demographic, cognitive, mental health, EEG, multimodal MRI) for all HBN
participants makes the sample optimal for exploring an extensive set of participant and environmental factors
that may affect treatment outcomes (i.e., demographic, cognitive, emotional, neurobiological, environmental).
Specific aims of the proposed work are to: 1) Evaluate the effectiveness of GraphoLearn in a large sample of
children with RD, and 2) Identify participant-related and environment-level factors that are significantly
associated with GraphoLearn outcomes. To accomplish this latter aim, sophisticated machine learning
approaches (Random Forest Regression models) will be employed."
10890132,"SUMMARY
 Mitochondrial dysfunction is a common contributing factor to degenerative diseases, including the
neural and muscular systems; yet mechanistic studies in mammals are limited because adequate tools and
approaches are lacking. Moreover, a greater understanding of the protein translocation mechanisms in model
organisms such as S. cerevisiae and zebrafish is needed, because protein translocation is linked to
metabolism, signaling, and mitochondrial quality control and stress pathways such as mitophagy. Long-term,
modulating mitochondrial protein import pathways therefore is a potential target for treating diseases.
 The overall goals of this proposal are (1) to increase our mechanistic understanding of protein import
pathways into mitochondria in both yeast and mammalian cells and (2) to understand how defects in protein
translocation contribute to disease. Attenuating protein translocation pathways can alter the location of
mitochondrial proteins that are dual-localized (located to mitochondria and another compartment), change
mitochondrial stress pathways, and induce selective turnover of mitochondria via mitophagy. However, there is
a critical gap in developing small molecule probes with specificity for modulating mitochondrial protein import
specifically in mammalian cells while minimizing off-target effects.
 Three specific study aims are proposed to accomplish these goals. In Aim 1, a new cell based screen in
mammalian cells to identify modulators for all mitochondrial protein import pathways and specific cargo will be
implemented. In Aim 2, a series of experimental approaches will be used to characterize specificity of the
probes, to minimize off-target effects in mammalian cells and yeast, with the goal of developing specific
probes. In Aim 3, existing and new small molecules will be characterized in mechanistic studies, particularly
focusing on how defects in protein import alter mitochondrial stress pathways in mitophagy.
 In addition to increasing fundamental knowledge about the mechanisms of protein translocation in
mitochondria, this application may have a broad impact on public health because our approach will provide
new tools that will provide a strategy for developing therapeutics for diseases that can be modified by
attenuating protein translocation."

Evidence-based treatment for childhood obesity exists, yet a fundamental knowledge-to-action gap has
significantly limited the uptake of recommendations into clinical practice, particularly in low-income settings.
Persistence of this gap represents a large-scale public health threat, as the earliest generation of children living
through the obesity epidemic now enters adulthood, they are the first in US history to have a shorter life
expectancy than their parents, mainly due to rising rates of obesity-related cancers and cardiovascular
disease. A central challenge in delivering recommended treatment is the intensity; ≥26 hours of face-to-face
contact are necessary to achieve health benefits and risk reduction. The long-term goal is to close the
knowledge-to-action gap by disseminating effective implementation tools that will deliver the current child
obesity treatment recommendations in diverse community settings. The objective of the proposed project is to
develop and test an implementation strategy that pairs primary care pediatric clinics with municipal Parks and
Recreation (P&R) centers to deliver the current treatment recommendations with high fidelity, while allowing
crucial adaptations for the local and cultural context. The central hypothesis is that effective pediatric obesity
treatment is possible to achieve, but only with strong implementation supports to ensure fidelity to evidence-
based recommendations and adaptability to local resource constraints and population needs. Guided by strong
preliminary data on effectiveness and implementation feasibility, this hypothesis will be tested through three
specific aims: 1) Develop a web-based platform that will support the implementation and broad dissemination
of the shared clinic-P&R model in low-resource settings; 2) Evaluate the implementation platform using an
interrupted time series design anchored in the Process Redesign Framework and reporting qualitative and
quantitative measures of provider and organizational characteristics, implementation process and outcomes,
child outcomes, and caregiver outcomes; and 3) Design a dissemination and sustainability strategy, using the
PCORI Dissemination Framework, that considers relevant factors including community resources, funding
stability, organizational capacity, partnership development, program requirements, and sustainability. The
approach is innovative because it is a strong example of value-based care, a new horizon for alternative
payment models in the current environment of health care reform. The proposed research is significant,
because it will deliver implementation tools into the hands of front-line pediatric health care providers and over
33,000 park and recreation centers nationally. If successful, the expected outcomes will dramatically improve
access to effective treatment in diverse communities, and deliver on the existing recommendations for millions
of children with obesity in the United States."

Ca-Calmodulin dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) is an important regulator of cardiac function,
and dysfunction in pathological states, regulating ion channels, Ca transporters, myofilaments
and nuclear transcription. CaMKII may normally fine-tune these processes. But in pathological
conditions like heart failure (HF), chronic autonomous CaMKII activation can over-phosphorylate
targets, contributing to arrhythmogenesis due to acute effects on several ion channels and Ca-
handling proteins. Chronic CaMKII activation is also a hallmark of several pathological states
and acute or genetic CaMKII inhibition can reduce arrhythmias and the progression of HF. Thus
understanding fundamental aspects of CaMKII regulation in cardiac myocytes is critical
understanding dysfunction and potential therapeutics. We and others discovered several novel
post-translational modifications (PTMs) that can trap CaMKII in an activated state, rather than
turning on & off rapidly with local Ca transients. Autophosphorylation, oxidation, GlcNAcylation
and S-nitrosylation within a regulatory hotspot on CaMKII creates memory and autonomous
activity, even when Ca/CaM falls. There are also 3 PTMs at other sites that suppress CaMKII
activation. Aims 1 and 2 will directly measure how these PTMs differentially affect activation and
memory of CaMKII in adult cardiac myocytes, to fill a major knowledge gap in this field. Aim 3
will test whether CaMKII S-nitrosylation at a single site is required for the heart’s intrinsic
response to increase Ca transients and contraction in response to acute and chronic pressure
overload (or the Anrep effect). CaMKII has well-recognized roles in HF with reduced ejection
(HFrEF), but its role in HF with preserved ejection (HFpEF) is unclear. Aim 4 will directly test the
engagement of CaMKII in two new HFpEF models. The proposed studies will have major impact
on our understanding of how CaMKII activity is regulated in heart, in ways that promote
pathology and might be targets for therapeutic intervention."

Epigenetic modifications regulate genome function. My research is focused on defining the
scope, mechanisms, and functional consequences of epigenome dynamics during development,
using the powerful genetic model system Arabidopsis thaliana. DNA methylation (5-
methylcytosine) is a heritable epigenetic mark associated with highly intertwined processes
including transcriptional gene silencing, transposable element (TE) repression, and regulation of
genomic imprinting. DNA methylation is concentrated in TEs to prevent their transcription and
proliferation, but this genome defense system comes at a potential cost – the methylation of
TEs or their remnants can inappropriately silence the transcription of proximal protein-coding
genes. Active DNA demethylation by 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylases (also referred to as
DNA demethylases) functions to counteract DNA methyltransferases. But how these two
antagonistic activities are balanced to maintain the genome in a stable epigenetic state – where
transposable elements are kept methylated and silenced and genes are kept relatively free of
methylation and can be expressed – is a major question across eukaryotes and is one focus of
our current research. Our efforts in this area will significantly increase understanding of how the
activity of epigenetic pathways is modulated in response to the state of the epigenome and how
this information is integrated over cellular, developmental, and generational time scales.
Although epigenetic homeostasis appears to be a major force in the soma, developmentally-
regulated epigenetic reprogramming is essential for successful reproduction. DNA
demethylation in the female gamete establishes imprinted gene expression in a placenta-like
extra-embryonic seed tissue after fertilization. A critical unanswered question is how epigenetic
changes that are initiated by DNA demethylation are subsequently maintained, or not, when
maternal and paternal genomes are combined after fertilization and as cells take on distinct
identities. My laboratory applies diverse genetic, genomic, computational, and comparative
evolutionary approaches to address these fundamental questions in epigenetics."
10890140,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cocktails of antiretroviral drugs (ART) have been successful in reducing viremia to undetectable levels in HIV+
adult subjects who have access to them and who can remain adherent. Yet, the suppressive drugs are unable
to eliminate latent virus in cellular and tissue compartments and are thus required for continued remission.
While ART is the standard of care for HIV+ mothers and their infants who are exposed to infection risk before,
during, and after birth, it has not been possible to test the impact on viral reservoirs upon treatment
interruption. We have developed a robust, reproducible nonhuman primate (NHP) model for transmission in
utero, peripartum and breastfeeding, in order to examine new therapeutic regimens for pre-exposure
prophylaxis (PrEP) or post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Passively transferred bNAbs can provide sterilizing
immunity when used as PrEP in nonhuman primate models, and have also been recently shown to prevent the
establishment of viral reservoirs when given as PEP within days of viral exposure. Studies designed to
understand the mechanism of action of antibodies is a critical next step. The central hypothesis of this research
proposal is that novel, orthogonal therapeutic treatment with ART, a CCR5-blocking antibody, and potent
neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (bNAbs) will result in highly controlled viremia and undetectable
viral reservoirs in babies born to HIV-infected mothers. Newborn and infant rhesus macaques when infected
orally with SHIVSF162P3 develop widely dispersed and rapidly diverging viral quasispecies in blood and
tissues within the first few days to weeks of infection, resulting in high and persistent viremia. However, in
newborn macaques that receive ART or bNAbs at 24-30 hours after exposure, permanent viral seeding is
prevented, but delays in treatment result in rebound upon treatment cessation. The project will explore the
effects of combination and sequential treatment with ART, Leronlimab, and bNAbs, which we predict will result
in prevention of viral reservoir establishment when used as PrEP, and in reduction or elimination of viral
reservoirs when used as PEP in the first few weeks after virus exposure. We will show the effects of reduced
infectious centers by in vivo imaging with positron emission tomography and compare these results with
standard virological assays and RNAscope imaging. Ulimately, we hope that this combination therapy will lead
to translation into the clinic so that HIV-exposed and vertically infected babies can be treated for limited periods
of time and experience durable viral remission without further treatment."

Project 3: Defining and defeating the mechanisms of outer membrane biogenesis in Gram-negative bacteria
Gram-negative bacteria are surrounded by an outer membrane (OM) composed of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that
creates a formidable permeability barrier preventing the uptake of many drugs. The spread of acquired antibiotic
resistance mechanisms among Gram-negative bacteria combined with the intrinsic resistance conferred by the
OM has severely limited treatment options for infections with these organisms. Therefore, the development of
new antibiotics effective against Gram-negative bacteria is an urgent medical need. To enable the discovery of
these treatments, our CARBIRU team will uncover new vulnerabilities and targets required for OM assembly
using E. coli as a model organism. Our approach will be three-pronged. Aim 1 will focus on the essential Bam
machine that assembles beta-barrel proteins in the OM. We have purified and characterized different states of
the six-member complex, including an intermediate state engaged with a substrate. To determine which states
of the machine are the most effective to target with drugs that disrupt the OM permeability barrier, we will use
our nanobody screening platform to identify nanobodies that selectively bind purified complexes locked in
different conformations. The ability of the nanobodies to engage with surface exposed Bam epitopes on cells
and promote cell killing or permeability will then be assessed. Structures of the nanobody-bound complexes will
also be determined using cryo-EM methods that successfully elucidated the structure of the stalled Bam
machine. The results will provide insights into the mechanism of Bam function and define susceptible domains
within the machine. The second aim will investigate the role of the essential membrane protein YejM in regulating
LPS synthesis. LpxC is the committed step in the pathway, and it has long been known to be subjected to
proteolysis by the FtsH protease. However, it has remained unclear how LpxC proteolysis is regulated to
coordinate LPS synthesis with OM assembly. We will test the hypothesis that YejM is responsible for this
coordination and elucidate the regulatory mechanism. The results will teach us how the important drug target
LpxC is regulated in enterobacterial pathogens and identify new ways to disrupt LPS synthesis for antibiotic
development. Finally, we will investigate the mechanism by which undecaprenyl-phosphate (Und-P) is recycled.
Und-P is the lipid carrier used for the synthesis of most cell surface polysaccharides, including peptidoglycan
and the O-antigen of LPS. Our genetic and bioinformatic analyses identified two conserved protein families as
candidates for the long-sought flippases that recycle Und-P. We will investigate their role in Und-P transport and
how their inactivation affects OM assembly and OM modifications that promote antibiotic resistance. Because
Und-P recycling is central to cell envelope assembly, the results will define an attractive new class of targets for
antibiotics or antibiotic potentiators. Overall, our results with these conserved systems will be highly relevant to
the development of novel treatments for infections with a broad-spectrum of Gram-negative pathogens."

Despite innovations in diagnosis and treatment, colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one the most common causes
of cancer-related deaths in the United States. During tumorigenesis, the extracellular matrix (ECM) drastically
stiffens, resulting in a self-amplifying feedback loop, furthering cancer progression; in CRC, increased matrix
elasticity is correlated with more advanced stages and worse treatment outcomes. Cells sense tissue stiffness
via integrins, which relay biochemical signals down many pathways, including the Rho/ROCK pathway. The
Rho/ROCK pathway has been shown to be highly dysregulated in many cancers, but its role in CRC is still highly
debated: some studies have shown elevated levels in metastatic lesions, whereas others have correlated
inactivation of this pathway with metastasis. Herein, we propose to study the mechanical contributions to RhoA
activation and how this may lead to increased proliferation and signaling, with a particular emphasis on
comparing the mechanical environments of the colon and the liver—the most common metastatic site, which has
been shown to be significantly stiffer than the primary tumor tissue. We will develop a novel hydrogel biomaterial
that can stiffen around cells from 1kPa (primary tumor) to 6kPa (liver metastatic tumor) upon exposure to 365nm
light over the course of the week, by employing photomediated oxime ligation, a chemistry we have pioneered
in our previous work for making photostiffening hydrogels as well as immobilizing full-length proteins in natural
and synthetic materials. To encode for subsequent cell release for downstream assays, we will develop a suite
of enzymatically sensitive peptide crosslinkers to enable bioorthogonal, user-defined hydrogel degradation. In
Aim 2, we will examine RhoA activation in primary patient-derived CRC tumor organoids as a function of
progressive stiffening of the matrix, and compare to levels of RhoA activation in metastatic cancer organoid lines
in stiff gels, via pull-down assays, Western blotting, and a lentivirally transduced biosensor construct. In Aim 3,
we will investigate the mechanical memory of RhoA activation in metastatic tumor organoid lines and whether is
reversable upon systematic softening of the matrix back to baseline, primary colon stiffnesses. We expect results
from these studies will result in novel insights into the role of matrix mechanics in CRC progression and
potentially open the door for biophysical routes of tumor resolution and treatment."

Developmental language disorder (DLD) describes the idiopathic disorder(s) of language that occurs in
approximately 7% of the population. Although DLD is understudied in adulthood, it is clear that the
communication challenges in DLD extend beyond adolescence. The barriers to educational and vocational
achievement for adults with DLD include persistent difficulties in learning and memory. Recent work suggests
that these difficulties with learning and memory include deficits in overnight memory consolidation. Thus, an
effective support for learning and memory function in adults with DLD must include strategies for both
overcoming initial challenges in learning, as well as in mitigating a deficit in consolidation of learned
information. In this project, we combine insights from the neurobiology of learning and memory, chronobiology,
and speech perception, to determine the optimal training schedule for perceptual memory retention in
adults with and without DLD. We have two Aims in this project: First, we will recruit 240 adults (120 with/120
without DLD) to participate in a speech-perceptual training to take place in one of six different training
schedules over 24 hours. We predict that our manipulation of training schedules will interact with circadian
preference and timing relative to overnight consolidation, such that we may discover the optimal practice
schedule for speech sound retention for adult learners with & without DLD. Our focus on speech-sound
information will allow us to track the learning and memory of linguistic form that is relatively independent from
preexisting knowledge; moreover, speech perception is also a known difficulty for individuals with DLD. Under
our second aim, we will recruit an additional 300 adults (150 with/150 without DLD) in order to determine how
optimal training schedules interact with reflexive and reflective learning strategies in adults with and without
DLD. We will achieve this aim by tracking the time course of learning and retention in adults participating in
reflexive and reflective categorization training in one of six training schedules. This will provide us with
generalizable insights into optimal training schedules for learning targets beyond the speech domain. The
knowledge to be gained from this work will contribute to the basic science of learning and memory in adults
with and without DLD. In addition, the factors that influence the successful retention of speech have substantial
implications for intervention practices for other developmental disorders in which speech representations are
implicated (speech sound disorder, dyslexia)."

 The goal of this proposal is to determine how lineage-specific repressive epigenetic landscapes are
established to safeguard cell identity. Current dogma is that pioneer TFs initiate lineage-specific activation
processes by locally opening chromatin. In contrast, significantly less is known about how repressive epigenetic
landscapes are dynamically reshaped during cell differentiation. This knowledge gap creates a major stumbling
block in developing high-fidelity cell reprogramming technology. Hence, it is essential to define how alternative
lineage programs are repressed and how this process can be manipulated. Intriguingly, our preliminary data
unexpectedly revealed that pioneer TFs are involved in this process. We developed a new doxycycline (dox)-
inducible CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) tool to target two pioneer TFs: OCT4 in human pluripotent stem cells
(hPSCs) and FOXA1/A2/A3 (FOXA) in hPSC-derived endoderm differentiation. We found that OCT4 and FOXA
play critical roles in repressing alternative-lineage programs. In fact, gene expression changes in OCT4/FOXA-
CRISPRi cells correlate better with directional changes of the repressive H3K27me3 mark than with those of
H3K4me1/3 active marks. To identify mechanisms underlying OCT4/FOXA-directed repression, we focused on
the OCT4 and FOXA binding peaks that co-localize with the H3K27me3 domain. Interestingly, we found that
these loci are highly enriched at key alternative-lineage genes, and unbiased motif analysis revealed significant
enrichment for a PRDM14 (a key pluripotency TF) binding motif at OCT4 sites and a PRDM1 (a key germ-cell
TF) binding motif at FOXA sites. This data provides the first indication that PRDM1 may play an important role
in endoderm specification. Further, our ChIP-qPCR assays confirmed that OCT4-CRIPSRi hPSCs were impaired
in recruiting PRDM14, PRC1/H2Aub, and PRC2 at OCT4-bound H3K27me3 sites. Intriguingly, our preliminary
co-IP assay suggested that FOXA interacts with PRC1, and prior co-IP studies showed that OCT4 interacts with
PRC1, and PRDM14 and PRDM1 interact with PRC25–9. Collectively, our findings led to our overarching novel
hypothesis that pioneer TFs play a crucial role in establishing Polycomb repressive domains at key alternative-
lineage genes by recruiting PRC1 and/or PRDM TFs, which in turn recruit PRC2. We will test this hypothesis in
two Aims:
 Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that OCT4 and FOXA play instructive roles in recruiting PRCs and PRDM TFs to
establish lineage-specific Polycomb repressive domains.
 Aim 2: Determine how PRDM1 impacts accurate lineage restriction during human endoderm specification.
 The successful completion of our Aims will provide valuable insights and reveal novel mechanisms underlying
lineage-specific Polycomb repression to safeguard cell identity. In the long-term, this study will likely open new
avenues to manipulate cell fate by selectively repressing alternative regulatory programs, with potential future
therapeutic applications in regenerative medicine."

Identifying brain-behavior associations for the purpose of informing individual differences, illness trajectories,
and neural mechanisms is one of the primary goals of psychiatric neuroimaging. The massively multivariate
nature of neuroimaging data, which consists of spatially detailed images of brain structure and function,
combined with high-dimensional behavioral data pose significant challenges to meeting this goal. The
emerging replication crisis in neuroimaging research has exposed limitations of commonly used spatial extent
inference (SEI) methods for analyzing imaging data. These include unrealistic assumptions about the spatial
covariance function of the imaging data that lead to highly inflated error rates. This project will develop a new
robust semiparametric inference framework for neuroimages to address the need for methods that are robust
in real-world data, integrate these methods into the pbj R package, and develop a graphical user interface
(GUI) to make the methods accessible to neuroimaging scientists. We will use the methods to study how
multidimensional symptoms of psychosis are related to brain function and structure in the Psychiatric
Genotype-Phenotype Project (PGPP) collected and Vanderbilt University Psychiatric Hospital (VUPH) and to
study cross-sectional and longitudinal changes in functional connectivity in the public-access Nathan Kline
Institute Rockland Sample (NKI-RS). We will evaluate the methods using realistic bootstrap-based
neuroimaging simulations. In Aim 1 we will develop a multidimensional semiparametric procedure for SEI that
will leverage computationally efficient parametric and nonparametric bootstraps for inference. In Aim 2 we will
expand the framework to repeated measurement models (including longitudinal data), that will allow scientists
to robustly model associations of subject-level covariate measurements and brain structure or function. In Aim
3, to address the need for alternatives to hypothesis testing in psychiatric neuroimaging, we will develop
semiparametric Coverage Probability Excursion (CoPE) sets that can be used to construct spatial confidence
intervals for semiparametric effect sizes. These methods will be made available to the neuroimaging
community through the pbj R package and GUI, and disseminated at neuroimaging conferences."

 Cochlear Hair Cell (HC) loss is a leading cause of noise-induced and age-related hearing loss
worldwide. Regeneration of HCs in response to damage has been observed in nonmammalian species, such
as birds and fish, but is not observed in the mature mammalian cochlea. Although Supporting Cells (SCs), a
diverse population of cells offering metabolic and structural support to hair cells, show the capacity to produce
hair cells in neonatal mice, this plasticity is lost by postnatal day 5. Previous work from our lab has identified
the de-differentiation of SCs into a more progenitor-like state as a key component of the HC regenerative
process, as hair cells and supporting cells arise from a common progenitor pool during cochlear development.
Supporting cell de-differentiation, the downregulation in expression of supporting cell-specific genes and
upregulation in expression of, allows the progenitor-like cells to respond to HC fate-inducing cues.
 Preliminary studies have identified members of the NFI and ZBTB families of transcription factors as
potential regulators of SC identity, maintaining SCs in a terminally differentiated state and preventing
endogenous reprogramming. The NFI factors have previously been studies in the context of retinal
regeneration, where they have been shown to regulate retinal Müller glial cell differentiation. Additionally,
disruption of NFI factor function has been shown to promote conversion of Müller glia into retinal neurons.
Zbtb20 has been implicated in astrocytogenesis, and has been linked to Primrose syndrome, a rare
developmental disorder which is known to cause hearing loss.
 The overarching hypothesis of this grant proposal is that Nfia/b/c/x and Zbtb20 are crucial in
maintaining SC identity, and that loss of one or more of these factors will enable SC reprogramming
and HC regeneration in stage P5 mouse tissue. This hypothesis will be tested using in vitro cochlear
organoid culture derived from stage P2 and P5 murine cochlear sensory epithelia. Additionally, the function of
Zbtb20 will be studied in vivo and in a HC damage model. I will use RT-qPCR, fluorescence imaging of a HC
reporter line, immunolabeling, EdU pulse experiments, and scRNA-sequencing in Aim 1 to determine if gain of
function of NFIA/B/C/X or ZBTB20 inhibits cochlear SC reprogramming and SC-based HC formation at stage
P2 in vitro and in Aim 2 to determine if loss of function of NFIA/B/C/X or ZBTB20 enhances cochlear SC
plasticity and SC-based HC formation at stage P5 in vitro. In Aim 3, I will use immunolabeling, RT-qPCR, EdU
pulse experiments, and a HC damage model to define the role of Zbtb20 in maintaining SCs in a terminally
differentiated state. These studies will expand our knowledge of SC identity maintenance and the HC
regenerative process and will aid future translational research using regenerative therapies to treat hearing
loss in humans."

10887353,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A key deliverable of the 4DN consortium consists in the sharing of data that pertains to the integration of chromatin
conformation capture (3C) information with the 3-dimensional physical mapping in nuclear space of the corresponding
sequences by multiplexed FISH imaging experiments. To facilitate this integration, the 4DN Imaging Working Group
(IWG) and the Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC)1 have developed a data format and metadata annotation
specifications that allows standardized data exchange for multiplexed FISH/FISH Omics datasets2,3. This community
standard is called 4DN FISH Omics Format (FOF) for Ball-and-Stick Chromatin Tracing (FOF basCT)3 and allows the
exchange of processed results deriving from various imaging techniques for basCT4,5,6,7,8–10,11. The release of FOF basCT
in early 20213 has resulted in the deposition to the 4DN Data Portal of over 70 multiplexed FISH datasets2, adoption
of the format by public repositories12, 13–16, and the development of downstream processing and visualization
pipelines17–19.
Despite these advances, the production of formatted datasets and their upload to the 4DN Data Portal imposes a significant
curation and management burden, negatively impacting productivity. With this supplement, we propose to address this
challenge and significantly improve the efficiency of data exchange. This will be achieved by developing automated FISH
Omics data deposition and sharing pipelines that scientists can use both in 4DN and outside 4DN.
1. We will develop a data format and standardized annotation specifications to describe the results of volumetric Chromatin
 Tracing (vCT) FISH Omics experiments. These specifications will be built specifically to extend the already available
 FOF-basCT, be applicable to technologies such as OligoSTORM, and Oligo DNA-based Point Accumulation for
 Imaging in Nanoscale Topography (OligoDNA-PAINT)20–23, and it will incorporate specifications for the description of
 Oligopaint probes for genomic loci imaging to be compatible with existing genome browsers.
2. We will develop pipelines to ensure that laboratories within 4DN can produce and successfully transfer both FOF-bas
 and vCT (FOF-CT) datasets to the DCIC for incorporation into the 4DN Data Portal. These pipelines will include
 software tools to minimize the burden of manual curation and expedite data ingestion, Quality Control (QC) procedures
 to promote the upload of high-quality datasets, and automated rating of datasets (i.e., minimal, recommended, ideal)
 depending on standardized criteria such as the presence of quality metrics or common coordinated framework (CCF)
 nuclear mapping information.
3. We will develop prototype pipelines to establish the feasibility of sharing metadata-rich raw image data associated with
 FOF-CT results deposited to the 4DN Data Portal2 via general public repositories such as the OME-IDR12, or the BioImage
 Archive 24,25, 2.
The overall impact of the described deliverables will be to generate integrated public datasets to be used to benchmark the
development of tools for different aspects of the multiplexed FISH processing (i.e., drift and chromatic correction, single
particle detection and localization, spot fitting, filtering and calling, and feature segmentation) and post-processing
computational (i.e., machine learning classification and integrated modeling) pipelines."

Reflexive motor behaviors of the intestine including peristalsis are controlled by the enteric nervous system
(ENS); a complex neural network embedded in the gut wall. Perturbations within the ENS contribute to the
development of dysmotility in irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and severe motility
disorders such as chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, but the mechanisms responsible for persistent
changes in enteric neural circuitry are unknown. Recent data show that enteric glia, non-neuronal cells that
surround enteric neurons, regulate neuronal excitability and contribute to neuroinflammation. The overall goal
of this proposal is to define how specialized interactions between enteric glia and neurons regulate motility and
how alterations in those mechanisms contribute to disease. This proposal tests the central hypothesis that
enteric glia are specialized to potentiate the activity of ascending excitatory neural pathways involved in normal
contractile motility, and that disruption of this regulatory system by inflammation contributes to neuronal
hyperexcitability. This dual hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims that utilize genetically encoded
calcium indicators to study neuron-glia interactions, glial chemogenetic actuators to study how glia modulate
specific types of enteric neurons, and a post-inflammatory model of enteric neuroplasticity to study how glia
contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability following inflammation. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that enteric glia
are specialized to sense excitatory neurons and potentiate ascending neural pathways involved in the
contractile phase of motility. Aim 1.1 will use genetically encoded calcium indicators to study glial recruitment
by polarized neural pathways in motility reflexes. Aim 1.2 will combine the chemogenetic activation of enteric
glia with neuronal and glial imaging using genetically encoded calcium indicators to test the hypothesis that glia
differentially affect subsets of enteric neurons. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that glia contribute to neuronal
hyperexcitability following colitis by increasing positive feedback to excitatory neurons and by reducing
inhibitory feedback from inhibitory neurons. Aim 2.1 will study how altered interactions between glia and
excitatory neurons contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability following colitis. Aim 2.2 will use mutant mice and
selective drugs to study how glia contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability through interactions with inhibitory
neurons. The results of this study will provide novel insight into glial mechanisms that regulate the excitability
of enteric neural circuits. A better understanding of the glial mechanisms that regulate motility will facilitate the
development of therapeutics for dysmotility by revealing novel targets to modify gastrointestinal reflexes."

Traumatic stress exposure elicits behavioral and physiological responses that can compromise health and
well-being, generating brain and bodily changes that can intrude on appropriate emotional regulation.
Numerous disease states, most notably post-traumatic stress disorder, share behavioral and physiological
dysfunctions typical of traumatic stress exposure, indicative of a link between stress and disease. The long-
term objective of this research line is to understand brain mechanisms that control behavioral stress
responses, knowledge that will be essential for designing strategies for management of maladaptive behaviors
in stress-linked disorders. This proposal queries the neurocircuitry underlying lasting behavioral pathologies
linked to severe stress, focusing on the role of intralimbic cortex (IL) connections in driving pathology. Prior
research and our preliminary data present strong evidence for reduced IL excitability following severe stress
exposure, and functional hypoactivity of the human IL homolog is associated with PTSD. This proposal is
designed to understand the mechanisms underlying stress-induced IL hypofunction, concentrating on changes
in intrinsic processes and afferent connectivity. Aim 1 is designed to test the necessity and sufficiency of IL
afferent input in causing long-lasting severe stress-induced impairments in fear adaptation (extinction) and
reinstatement of fear following stress reminders, using a rat model of trauma exposure (single prolonged
stress). The role of IL afferent connections from the prelimbic cortex (PL) and ventral hippocampus (vHPA) in
SPS-induced fear pathology will be tested using viral vector mediated expression of excitatory and inhibitory
DREADDs, and circuit mapping employed to test engagement PL-IL and vHPC-IL circuitry . Aim 2 will use
electrophysiological approaches to explore cellular and connectional mechanisms driving IL hypoactivity
following SPS, focusing on intrinsic neuronal excitabilty and synaptic drive by PL and vHPC projections to the
IL. Aim 3 will use a multi-dimensional approach to identify molecular processes underlying IL hypoexcitability,
using an analysis platform integrating genomic, proteome and kinome data. Studies will use bioinformatic
approaches to determine possible drug targets for intervention in males and females. Results of these studies
will inform development of new pharmacological and/or circuit-targeting intervention strategies to promote
stress resilience in individuals exposed to traumatic or severe stress."

There is increasing evidence that early intervention for psychosis in coordinated specialty care (CSC) services
improves outcomes and lives. The outcome of early course psychosis (EP) is heterogeneous, ranging from early
full recovery to treatment resistance and functional decline from the onset of illness. This heterogeneity limits
our ability to predict individual level outcomes needed for treatment planning and for tailoring the type, duration
and intensity of therapeutic interventions. Biomarkers as well as clinical and demographic features, early in the
illness can predict outcome, but taken individually, their prognostic value is limited. Our Bipolar- Schizophrenia
Network for Intermediate Phenotypes (BSNIP) consortium has recently developed, replicated and validated a
biomarker (EEG, eye movement testing, and neurocognition) based categorization (Biotypes 1, 2 and 3) in a
trans-diagnostic sample of cases with idiopathic psychosis (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar
disorder with psychosis), ranging from 18-35 years of age. In this study, we will leverage this categorization,
along with clinical and biomarker data to predict illness trajectory and outcome during follow-up at 1, 6 and 12
months in 320 EP patients across CSC clinics at the five B-SNIP sites. First, we will characterize outcome
trajectories and Biotype structure in EP. Our available data indicate the Biotype structure will be the same in EP
as in our large sample. Second, we will investigate the predictive value of the nine bio-factors and the three
Biotypes identified by B-SNIP for symptomatic and functional outcome. We predict that the EP population will
manifest distinct outcome clinical trajectories (good, intermediate and poor) and will have a Biotype structure
similar to that seen in chronic psychosis subjects, i.e., Biotypes 1, 2 and 3) (hypothesis 1). Biotype-3, and
Biotye-2 cases, will have the best outcomes (defined both categorically, and dimensionally, using symptomatic,
cognitive and functional measures); Biotype-1 will have the worst outcomes to CSC treatment, across all target
time points (hypothesis 2). Notably, Biotype-1 and Biotype-2 cases will have the same level of cognition function
at baseline. Finally, we will investigate the predictive value of clinical (such as diagnosis, illness duration,
substance abuse, and treatment adherence), and biomarker (including neuroimaging) features in a multi-variate
model and will develop a feasible biomarker battery and predictive algorithm for application in community CSC
sites nation-wide. We will thus provide to the field a means for predicting success of EP cases in CSC treatment
to improve clinical practice and to enhance efficient use of available treatment resources."

Opioid-related overdose deaths and incarceration rates have skyrocketed and have
disproportionately affected women. Despite having a higher burden of substance use disorders
and HIV/AIDS than criminal justice-involved (CJI) men, CJI women are less likely to have
access to substance use and HIV treatment. The proposed intervention will link and retain
women with recent CJI in medication-assisted treatment (MAT) programs, identify and connect
women with necessary social services, and provide women with opioid overdose response
training. Specifically, the candidate aims to 1) conduct in-depth interviews with CJI women, MAT
providers, and criminal justice professionals to identify facilitators and barriers to illicit opioid use
cessation and decreases in HIV risk behaviors and exposure to violence among CJI women; 2)
develop a gender-specific and trauma-informed intervention that utilizes peer navigation to
connect CJI women with OUD to MAT programs, necessary health and social services, and
provides opioid overdose response training; and 3) conduct a pilot study (randomized control
trial) to assess the adequacy in which components of the gender-specific and trauma-informed
intervention function together using a sample of 50 community-recruited CJI women who use
opioids illicitly. In order to complete the proposed research tasks, the candidate has composed
a team of internationally recognized scholars as mentors. Through this proposed K01, the
candidate will expand the breadth of her work to treatment for opioid use disorders and common
comorbidities. The research and training outlined in this proposal will allow the candidate to gain
content expertise on social factors that lead to sub-optimal outcomes among CJI women with
OUD, trauma among substance-using and CJI women, while simultaneously developing her
skills in implementing and evaluating clinical trials. The candidate’s long-term career goal is to
develop evidence-based interventions to reduce substance use and its co-occurring health and
social consequences among marginalized and vulnerable communities. The proposed work
helps her make further strides to accomplishing this goal by enabling her to design, implement,
and evaluate a pilot intervention designed for CJI women."
10895445,"ABSTRACT
 Retaining pre-existing patterns of histone modifications during early development and multicellular
differentiation is essential for the maintenance of cellular identity. Histone H3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me) is
associated with the formation of transcriptionally silent, specialized chromatin domains also referred to as
heterochromatin. Heterochromatin establishment is essential for normal centromere and telomere function,
silencing of transposons and repetitive DNA elements and preserving lineage-specific patterns of gene
expression. The loss of H3K9 methylation is associated with genome instability and aneuploidy which are
widely recognized as the most common abnormalities associated with cancer. Heterochromatin establishment
is a dynamic process which involves weak and transient interactions between histone modifiers and their
cognate nucleosome substrates. Counterintuitively, these weak protein-protein interactions produce epigenetic
states that remain heritable across generational timescales. These dynamic properties associated with the
epigenome exposes significant conceptual and methodological gaps that this proposal will principally address:
1) How do dynamic epigenetic complexes consisting of histone modification readers, writers and erasers
assemble in vitro and in living cells? 2) How do histone modifiers traverse a complex chromatin landscape to
locate their sites of action? 3) How is epigenetic memory stored and transmitted across subsequent
generations? The current belief is that histone modifications function as inert scaffolds which passively
promote the localization of histone modifiers to distinct sites in the genome. Based on our recent studies, we
propose an inversion of this paradigm. Our results reveal that H3K9 methylation has an active role in
catalyzing the cooperative assembly of a heterochromatin regulatory complex. Our studies underscore how the
assembly of epigenetic complexes in an H3K9 methylation dependent manner restricts protein-protein
interactions to specific chromatin contexts. In this proposal, we will use in vitro biochemistry to reconstitute
heterochromatin regulatory complexes, single molecule imaging to define the order and timing of assembly of
these complexes in vitro and within a native chromatin context and a high-throughput microfluidic platform to
define how epigenetic memory is propagated within individual lineages. The real-time visualization of
heterochromatin assembly at high spatial and temporal resolution will illuminate how transient molecular
interactions can synergize to establish stable and heritable patterns of gene expression."

Cachexia is a muscle-wasting syndrome that affects half of all cancer patients and a quarter of all patients with
chronic diseases. Scientifically, cachexia is defined by muscle loss in parallel to systemic inflammation (e.g. IL-
6 signaling). Cachexia exists on a spectrum that leads to progressive functional decline and a refractory end-
stage. Refractory cachexia is not responsive to primary treatment, anti-inflammatory therapies, or exercise,
which are effective in earlier phases. The key regulators of the transition to the refractory phase of cachexia are
unknown. Sustained inflammation leads to tissue extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and fibrosis. In muscle,
the ECM regulates muscle physiology and function, which can become disrupted in disease. While muscle
fibrosis is linked to increased mortality in cancer patients, the relationship between ECM and refractory cachexia
is unknown. Since current preclinical models of cachexia are not designed to distinguish early and refractory
phase biology, we developed a new mouse model with an extended lifespan, expanding the opportunity to probe
early and refractory phase cachexia phenomena. The scientific goal of this application is to determine whether
muscle fibrosis is a barrier to responsiveness to therapy in refractory cachexia in our novel model. Aim 1
investigates the individual and combine effects of anti-IL-6 and anti-fibrosis treatments at early and refractory
stages of cachexia on muscle mechanics, function, wasting, and survival. We hypothesize that dual treatment
with anti-inflammatories and anti-fibrotic will rehabilitate the cachexia phenotype at previously refractory stages.
Aim 2 directly examines the role of cachexia related fibrosis in response to exercise. We hypothesize that anti-
fibrotic therapies will improve the efficacy of both endurance and resistance exercises during the refractory
cachexia. These studies will expand our knowledge of the biology of refractory cachexia, broaden our
understanding of the role of ECM in cachexia, and initiate preclinical evaluation of synergistic therapies.

10895448,"Accumulating research has revealed that computations of reward and its prediction occur on multiple levels
across a complex set of interacting brain regions, including those that support memory and navigation. Yet how
the brain coordinates the encoding, recall and use of reward information to guide navigation and memory remains
incompletely understood. Here, we focus on the mechanisms for encoding reward in the hippocampus, a medial
temporal lobe structure that serves a key role in supporting navigation and memory. In the hippocampus, place
cells fire in one or few restricted spatial locations, providing an internal neural representation of the external
world. Place cells are also strongly modulated by reward. For example, place fields (the location where a place
cell is maximally active) cluster near reward locations, resulting in an overrepresentation of those locations.
However, the circuit and cellular mechanisms by which reward controls place cell representations remains
unknown. We propose to examine how the precise spatial and temporal dynamics of dopamine and
norepinephrine control hippocampal representations at the level of individual place cells. In our first aim, we will
perform simultaneous 2-photon imaging of calcium signals and dopamine or norepinephrine signals in CA1
neurons as animals navigate through virtual environments. We will test the hypotheses that dopamine – in
coordination with norepinephrine – can drive place cell representations near rewarded locations and temporally
gate place cell representations to provide a signal for reward certainty. In our second aim, we will use the same
technical approach to test the hypothesis that dopamine and norepinephrine act as a gating mechanisms for the
detection of novelty and determine the temporal dynamics of neuromodulatory-driven novelty detection signals
to the hippocampus. In our final aim, we will examine how the ventral tegmental area and locus coeruleus, which
release dopamine and norepinephrine, mediate CA1 place cells and drive reward-driven place cell
representations. Together, this work will provide new insight regarding the mechanisms of reward-driven
changes to hippocampal representations at a spatial and temporal resolution technical innovations have only
recently made possible. Moreover, this work will establish an approach and framework for future work examining
how neuromodulators control hippocampal representations."

The establishment of left-right (LR) asymmetry is a critical event required for the correct positioning of internal
organs. Defects in human LR axis formation cause birth defects of the heart, vasculature, lungs, and intestinal
tract. The gene network contributing to the generation of LR asymmetry is highly conserved across
vertebrates. In the mouse, the initial asymmetric signals establishing LR axis are determined in the node by
cilia-driven leftward fluid flow (nodal flow). These signals are then transferred to the left lateral plate mesoderm
(LPM), which will undergo asymmetric organ morphogenesis. Nodal, a secretory protein that belongs to the
transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) superfamily, is expressed in the node and travels a long distance to the
left LPM, where it initiates a transient auto-regulatory circuit (involving Nodal and Lefty) that propagates Nodal
signaling and activates expression of the left-sided determinant Paired-Like Homeodomain transcription
factor 2 (Pitx2). The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway also plays a crucial role in LR patterning. In the mouse,
Hh signaling is required to establish the midline that separates the left and right sides of the embryo, as well as
to activate the Nodal-dependent auto-regulatory circuit in the LPM. However, the mechanism by which Hh
signaling regulates the competence of the LPM for Nodal response is not well understood. Thus, identifying the
specific convergence point of the Hh and TGF-b pathways is critical for understanding the in-depth mechanism
underlying LR asymmetry determination, and therefore to provide better diagnosis, preventive and therapeutic

LR asymmetry-related birth defects.
We recently found that a novel target of the Hh pathway, Neuron-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (Ndnf),
regulates axial rotation and intestinal looping in the mouse. In the proposed work, we will incorporate
biochemical, molecular, and genetic approaches to (Aim 1) assess the source, (Aim 2) determine the
transcriptional regulation, and (Aim 3) investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of Ndnf in LR
determination."

We recently found that a novel target of the Hh pathway, Neuron-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (Ndnf),
regulates axial rotation and intestinal looping in the mouse. In the proposed work, we will incorporate
biochemical, molecular, and genetic approaches to (Aim 1) assess the source, (Aim 2) determine the
transcriptional regulation, and (Aim 3) investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of Ndnf in LR
determination."

This is a K23 resubmission application for Dr. Brian Mac Grory, a vascular neurology investigator pursuing
patient-oriented clinical research focused on the identification of novel populations with underexplored
cerebrovascular disorders requiring personalized secondary prevention strategies. Based on his own
preliminary data and recent publications, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that central retinal artery
occlusion (CRAO) – a form of ischemic stroke affecting the retina – may be an indicator of underlying cardiac
disease and a sentinel of future, potentially lethal, cardioembolic stroke. CRAO is formally recognized as a
form of ischemic stroke but there is an incomplete understanding of its mechanistic underpinnings, with most
research to-date focused on its association with carotid artery stenosis. Testing this application’s central
hypothesis will address a fundamental knowledge gap about the mechanisms of CRAO. This K23 award
proposes to generate key preliminary data linking CRAO with cardioembolic substrates and set the stage for a
future, multi-center, observational study that will definitively test this hypothesis. Dr. Mac Grory will leverage a
very large population-based dataset (the Medicare 5% Sample) as well as both retrospective and prospective
institutional cohorts. Specific Aims 1A & 1B will determine the association of each of atrial fibrillation and left
ventricular failure with the development of CRAO. Specific Aims 2A & 2B will determine the association of
cardiac, serum and ultrasonographic biomarkers of embolic risk with CRAO and their interplay with carotid
artery stenosis. As part of this proposal, Dr. Mac Grory will undertake a linked, didactic training plan with the
goal of developing as an independent investigator through acquisition of the following key skills: 1) Biostatistics
in observational research including advanced causal inference methodology, 2) Data science applied to
administrative claims databases, 3) Prospective, observational study design, and 4) Vascular biomarker
interpretation. Advanced training in these areas will permit Dr. Mac Grory to realize his long-term career goal of
becoming an independent clinical investigator who leverages interdisciplinary expertise to provide insights in to
the management of understudied cerebrovascular disorders. In pursuit of this goal, Dr. Mac Grory has
assembled a mentoring team with distinct though complementary skillsets in stroke medicine, comparative
effectiveness research, causal inference methodology, cardiac electrophysiology, and neuro-ophthalmology.
Results supportive of this application’s central hypothesis would reveal a new population who may harbor
occult cardioembolic disease. Results that are neutral or negative with respect to this central hypothesis would
be equally valuable as they would allow us to refine the future study of CRAO by focusing on atherothrombotic
mechanisms. With the preliminary data and training obtained from the proposed research, Dr. Mac Grory will
be uniquely equipped to execute future, larger-scale studies uncovering novel populations in whom evidence-
based, potentially life-saving secondary prevention strategies may be deployed."

Even with effective, safe, and simple antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens and effective pre-exposure
prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV treatment and prevention, the US continues to have around 40,000 new HIV
diagnoses each year. Among people with HIV, many experience barriers to accessing needed services and
experience poor clinical outcomes, often exacerbated by geographic, racial, and economic disparities. Along
with the high costs of care, these disparities contribute to ongoing incidence and low rates of diagnosis,
engagement in HIV care, and virologic suppression. Earlier this year, DHHS announced a new plan to End the
HIV Epidemic (EHE) in the US, with a target to decrease new infections by 90% within ten years, prompting
new efforts around how to best mobilize and utilize resources towards this goal. This competing continuation
proposes to expand upon the Cost-effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications (CEPAC) Model, a
computer microsimulation model of HIV disease prevention and treatment, to identify the most effective and
cost-effective combination of strategies to end the HIV epidemic in the US. In addition to evaluating emerging
biomedical therapies for HIV and interventions along the continuum of HIV care, the research team will work
with the public health departments of Los Angeles County, California, and Fulton County, Georgia, to allow for
assessment of specific interventions tailored to the epidemic in different jurisdictions. This proposal has two
specific aims:
Aim 1. To investigate the clinical impact, cost, and cost-effectiveness of interventions throughout the
HIV care continuum, including PrEP for prevention, engagement in care, and new treatment regimens.
Aim 2. To evaluate the clinical impact, cost, and cost-effectiveness of comprehensive efforts to reach
the End the HIV Epidemic targets in the US, and to develop optimization models to assess the most
efficient approach to reaching these goals.
Aligned with the research priorities of the NIH Office of AIDS Research to reduce the incidence of HIV and
evaluate next-generation HIV therapies, the CEPAC team will leverage the strengths of mathematical
simulation modeling along with new optimization methods. This effort will highlight the value of new HIV
therapies and continuum of care interventions and provide evidence to inform decisionmakers about the most
effective strategies to reach the End the HIV Epidemic targets."

This timely and significant K01 award will provide the PI, Dr. del Pozo, with the training and expertise
necessary to achieve his long-term goal of becoming a leading investigator of the health outcomes of policing
in relation to substance use disorders. Drug overdose deaths have reached record proportions in the United
States, driven by powerful synthetic opioids. At the same time, police departments are being called upon to
emphasize public health approaches to behaviors that have traditionally generated arrests. For people with
opioid use disorder (OUD), a way to address these concerns is the practice of diverting them to treatment
using medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) as an alternative to arrest. These connections can be an
effective upstream health intervention, but success relies on an officer’s discretionary judgment, which can be
negatively influenced by a variety of barriers as well as stigma-based norms, attitudes, and beliefs about
MOUD and people with OUD. Effective diversion requires research on why police officers choose to divert or
arrest, how stigma affects these decisions, and how programs and systems can positively influence this
practice. To conduct this research, the proposed award augments the PI’s unique and valuable experience as a
chief of police and his training as a postdoctoral researcher in substance use at Miriam Hospital/Brown
University with a comprehensive plan that provides training in (1) qualitative methods, (2) the science of
stigma, (3) psychometric measurement, (4) analysis of survey data, and (5) implementation science and study
design in police settings. Training will be guided by mentors with exceptional expertise: Dr. Jody Rich (primary
mentor), Dr. Michael Compton, Dr. Beth McGinty, Dr. Valerie Earnshaw, and Dr. Steven Belenko. The training
plan strategically aligns with mixed-methods research that will 1) develop and validate an instrument to
measure police stigma toward people who use drugs, 2) use the Theory of Planned Behavior to identify other
key variables that determine police officers’ intentions to divert people to MOUD, and 3) determine the
officer-perceived barriers and facilitators of effective diversion. Conducted in collaboration with leading police
research organizations and a community advisory board, the project will produce actionable training, policy,
and process recommendations for communities seeking to increase connections to care for OUD, while
meeting several priorities outlined in NIDA’s RFI for its 2021-2025 Strategic Plan: 1) Implementing evidence-
based strategies in real world settings by integrating treatment services into justice settings; 2) Translating and
disseminating research to inform policy and practice; 3) Identifying and developing approaches to reduce
stigma; 4) Developing approaches to reduce health disparities. By the conclusion of this award, the PI will be
positioned to conduct independent research on responses to substance use in police settings, including an R01
Hybrid Type-2 study of the effectiveness and implementation of diversion to MOUD in a sample of US police
departments."
10895406,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In all animals, the maternal-to-zygotic transition allows the transfer of information required for a single zygote to
develop into a mature organism. After fertilization, the maternal program, composed of maternally-inherited
mRNAs and proteins, drives cellular development and is replaced by the zygotic program. Because this
transition occurs primarily in a transcriptionally silent embryo, it relies heavily on post-transcriptional regulation.
Failure to properly regulate maternally-inherited mRNAs generally leads to developmental arrest or
abnormalities. Recent studies have shown that maternal mRNAs are decorated with RNA modifications,
collectively known as the ‘epitranscriptome’, that correlate with different mRNA fates. Moreover, we and others
performed global analyses of mRNA structure dynamics during the maternal-to-zygotic transition and identified
numerous regions that are structurally remodeled during this fundamental process, many of which impact
mRNA decay. These studies suggest that RNA modifications and dynamic RNA structures are emerging as
key regulators of gene expression during the maternal-to-zygotic transition. However, the detailed landscape of
the epitranscriptome and dynamic RNA structures, and their roles in gene regulation during the maternal-to-
zygotic transition remain poorly understood. Furthermore, RNA modifications and structures affect one another
to regulate RNA functions, but little is known about how they interact to control gene expression during
vertebrate development. The primary goal of my lab is to understand how the epitranscriptome and RNA
structures mediate gene regulatory networks, separately and cooperatively, during vertebrate development and
how their dysfunction promotes developmental defects or diseases. Here, we hypothesize that RNA
modifications and structures interact with trans-factors to participate in the post-transcriptional regulatory
landscape driving vertebrate development. To test this hypothesis, we will combine zebrafish —an in vivo
model of vertebrate development— and its genetic toolbox with innovative multi-omics approaches. Over the
next five years, we will inspect the native transcriptome to generate global, yet detailed, maps of the
epitranscriptome during the maternal-to-zygotic transition, and study how specific RNA modifications impact
gene expression. We will also decipher the RNA folds formed by dynamic regions of the transcriptome and
analyze their effect on RNA regulation. We will identify trans-factors interacting with RNA modifications and
structures of interest and study the consequences of their loss-of-function on gene expression and vertebrate
development. Finally, we will examine how RNA modifications and structures cooperate to modulate post-
transcriptional regulation. Successful completion of these investigations will greatly increase the existing
knowledge of how RNA modifications and structures orchestrate post-transcriptional regulation, and will
expand our understanding of the molecular mechanisms shaping vertebrate development."

 This proposal seeks to understand the impact of genetic and social risk factors on Alzheimer's disease (AD)
age at onset, disease progression and biomarkers trajectories in Hispanic populations. Under the guidance of
primary mentor Dr. Randall J. Bateman, the training and research plan will build upon Dr. Jorge Libre's expertise
in behavioral neurology and epidemiology of AD in Hispanic populations to prepare him for an independent
career that integrates genetics, social science, and life course epidemiology into the study of AD. Dr.Llibre will
pursue a mentored research scientist program of training at Washington University, that will advance his
knowledge and skills in (1) enhanced knowledge of the genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease, genetics
epidemiology and advances in the analysis of molecular genetic data, (2) statistical methods for longitudinal
analysis, (3) clinical and biomarkers assessments of AD and (4) use large data for the study of AD. These are
the areas needed to further develop his expertise and become a successful, independent investigator.
 The research proposed in this application was designed to significantly contribute to the field of AD in
Hispanics populations. The research plan will capitalize on deeply phenotype cohorts and large populations
studies including Caribbean-Hispanics (10/66 study, Caribbean American Dementia and Aging Study [CADAS],
Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network [DIAN]), Central and South American (10/66 study, DIAN) and
Hispanics living in the US (US-Health and Retirement study [HRS], DIAN), which may provide a unique
understanding of disease onset, progression, and biomarker rate of chance in different populations subgroups.
Furthermore, we will explore AD trajectories in Hispanics with Dominantly Inherited AD (DIAD) and sporadic AD
(sAD), which may provide a full spectrum of AD in Hispanic populations. The proposed datasets include detailed
information on education, employment histories, cardiovascular risk factors, rich neurocognitive assessments
and biomarkers. DIAN recently received an Alzheimer Association award to study Familial AD in Hispanic
populations by enrolling research participants from Latin America (Mexico, Colombia, Brazil Argentina), which
Dr. Llibre will use on his K award and as the starting point for his eventual R01 application.
 The proposal will explore the influence of genetics and social disparities of health on age at onset, cognitive
profiles, and biomarker trajectories in Hispanic populations. This research will begin to fill a critical gap in AD
knowledge by uncovering novel genetic and gene by environment interactions pathways leading to dementia in
Hispanic populations, of which Dr. Llibre will use to determine future areas of independent research in Hispanics.
This evidence can help identify strategies most likely to reduce the population burden of AD in Hispanics
populations, as well as the disparities therein."

The primary goal of this K23 award is to provide Dr. Minjin Kim with the structured advanced research training,
protected time, and mentoring necessary for improving health disparities, health promotion, disease prevention,
and innovation using technology to improve health and to reach underserved, under-resourced populations.
Candidate: Dr. Kim is a transcultural nurse scientist dedicated to health disparities research using a narrative or
“storytelling” approach to capture the voices of a diverse range of people and communities. Her long-term goal
is to design and implement sustainable disease prevention programs leveraging technologies that are theory-
based, culturally inclusive, and personally relevant to reduce health disparities and promote health equity,
improve preventive health behaviors and outcomes, and reach underserved, high-need populations. Dr. Kim’s
short-term goal is to employ storytelling interventions leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots that facilitate
timely, effective, and sustained motivation for vaccination to prevent HPV-related infections and cancers.
Research: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a sexually transmitted infection with 3 out of 4 new infections
occurring in individuals aged 15 to 24. Although HPV vaccine is safe and effective at preventing HPV-related
infections and cancers, our preliminary study has shown that only 1 in 5 English-speaking, college-educated
Korean American women aged 18 to 26 in the Northeast U.S. had received the HPV vaccine (19%). Dr. Kim’s
storytelling video-based intervention leveraging AI chatbot technology (K-Talk) delivers a user-centered
experience to promote HPV vaccination behavior among Korean Americans aged 18 to 26. The study aims to 1)
adapt and refine the previously developed K-Talk and 2) conduct a pilot Multiphase Optimization Strategy-based
trial to assess feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of K-Talk. The proposed study assesses the
primary outcome (HPV vaccine uptake) by obtaining photo documentation of an HPV vaccination card. This
study has a substantial opportunity to reach underserved, hard-to-reach Korean Americans and other minorities.
K-Talk is a promising intervention to promote HPV vaccination as a means of cancer prevention.
Mentoring/Training: With the expertise of the transdisciplinary mentoring team and consultants from inside and
outside of Cincinnati, Dr. Kim will achieve her appointed research and career goals in five domains to advance
her program of research through this award. These domains are: designing intervention studies using state-of-
the-art research design, mHealth and chatbot-based technologies to improve health communication and
dissemination of the interventions, conducting and managing clinical trials and pragmatic trials, advanced
statistical methods for clinical trials data as well as communication and leadership skills. The proposed research
and training will enable Dr. Kim to independently conduct a future pragmatic trial (R01) that evaluates efficacy of
the K-Talk intervention piloted in this proposal."
10895546,"Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), a viral pathogen associated with moderate to severe respiratory illness in children, also infects the nervous system in rare cases and causes neurological complications such as polio-like acute flaccid myelitis (AFM). Despite a significant disease burden, no approved antiviral drugs or vaccines are available for EV-D68. Due to its medical importance, EV-D68 is currently listed as a priority pathogen by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Because the occurrence of the next EV-D68 outbreak cannot be predicted, the need for a potent, broadly acting, and safe EV-D68 inhibitor is urgent. The objectives of this proposal are to explore novel viral proteins as antiviral drug targets and to develop corresponding chemical probes as tools for target validation. This proposal is built upon our recent discovery that the EV-D68 2A protein exerts cysteine protease activity that is specific for the viral polyprotein VP1-2A junction and its protease activity can be inhibited by an FDA-approved oral drug, telaprevir. We further showed that telaprevir had submicromolar to low micromolar potency against several contemporary human EV-D68 strains from clades A and B in different human cell lines, including human neuronal cells. The antiviral potency of telaprevir (IC50) against EV-D68 was similar to that of HCV, indicating clinical relevance of repurposing telaprevir as an EV-D68 antiviral. The mechanism underlying the inhibition of the EV-D68 virus by telaprevir was independently elucidated using a serial viral passage experiment, leading to the selection of an N84T mutation near the active site of EV-D68 2Apro protein that reduced the potency of telaprevir in enzymatic and cellular antiviral assays. To validate the hypothesis that EV-D68 2Apro is essential for viral replication both in vitro and in vivo, our goals are to develop 2Apro inhibitors with favorable pharmacokinetic properties and to use them as chemical probes to validate EV-D68 2Apro as a viable antiviral drug target in cell culture as well as in a neonatal mouse model of EV-D68-induced paralytic disease. Specifically, we propose to design more potent and selective EV- D68 2Apro inhibitors through structure-activity relationship studies of telaprevir. All designed compounds will be systematically tested in in vitro enzymatic and cellular assays and profiled for pharmacokinetic properties. Prioritized lead compounds will be selected to test in EV-D68 mouse models. The expected outcomes of the proposed research are to validate EV-D68 2Apro as a viable antiviral drug target and demonstrate the in vivo antiviral efficacy of EV-D68 2Apro inhibitors."
10895557,"SUMMARY
Mutations that activate proto-oncogenes or inactivate tumor suppressor genes are the root causes of tumor
initiation, but recent genomic analyses also detect these mutations in many cells of healthy tissues. These data
and classic skin carcinogenesis studies suggest that mutations in proto-oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes
are tolerated and maintained in epidermal progenitor cells (EPCs) until elusive mechanisms transform these
precancerous cells into stem-cell-like tumor propagating cells (TPCs) that can support tumor formation and
growth. We transcriptionally profiled these TPCs in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) models and defined a gene
expression signature that distinguishes TPCs from EPCs. Within this signature, we identified the transcription
factors PITX1 and SOX2 in >60% of mouse and human SCCs, even though they are epigenetically repressed
and not detectable in normal skin epithelial cells. We showed PITX1 and SOX2 are required for SCC growth in
mouse and patient-derived SCC models highly enriched on gene regulatory enhancers accessible in TPCs but
not EPCs, and responsible for the expression of SCC signature genes. Although PITX1 and SOX2 are pivotal
for squamous carcinogenesis, it is still unclear what events trigger their de novo expression in TPCs, and whether
their ability to bind condensed (inactive) chromatin and open it to activate SCC-specific gene expression
reprograms EPCs into TPCs. Here, we propose to test the hypothesis that oncogenic RAS and
inflammation together or independently activate RUNX1, which initiates expression of PITX1 and then
SOX2, allowing them to transcriptionally reprogram EPCs into TPCs that promote squamous
carcinogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we propose to: 1) determine whether and how inflammation-induced
RUNX1 activity promotes de novo PITX1 expression in normal and pre-cancerous skin epithelial cells; and 2)
determine whether and how ectopically expressed RUNX1, PITX1, and/or SOX2 reprogram EPCs into TPCs to
promote SCC initiation. To accomplish these aims, we already established genetic gain- and loss-of-function
approaches in autochthonous mouse and human SCC models along with genome-wide analyses (ATAC-seq,
ChIP-seq, 4C-seq, RNA-seq) and fluorescent transcriptional reporter assays. We are uniquely positioned to
reveal the molecular events that explain: 1) how PITX1 and SOX2 become expressed de novo in mouse and
human SCCs, 2) whether SOX2 and PITX1 establish or use SCC-defining gene regulatory enhancers to control
the expression of SCC signature genes, and 3) how these changes in gene expression transform precancerous
cells into TPCs that promote squamous carcinogenesis. Our proposed research will provide molecular insights
that promise to guide the development of approaches to prevent or treat SCCs in patients and/or define
mechanisms that may promote the initiation of other cancers including but not limited to lung, esophageal, and
pancreatic SCCs, which are among the most common deadly cancers."
10895561,"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) GPCR subtype 5 (LPAR5) is abundantly expressed by human and murine CD8
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and functions as an inhibitory receptor that represses T cell receptor (TCR)
signaling leading to inhibition of tumor immunity. Specifically, stimulation of LPAR5 by physiological levels of
LPA significantly impedes antigen specific TCR-induced Ca2+ mobilization, T cell activation, proliferation and
cytolytic tumor cell killing functions, resulting in an impaired anti-tumor immune response. Indeed, CD8+ T cells
lacking LPAR5 expression are more effective at reducing the growth rate of EG7 lymphoma and B16 melanoma
tumors in mice compared to wild type (WT) CD8+ T cells. Moreover, Lpar5 -/- mice have 85% reduction in the
incidence of B16 melanoma-derived lung metastasis compared to WT littermates, with a robust CD8+ CTL
infiltration observed in the Lpar5 -/- mice that developed few lung metastasis. These data highlight a unique role
for LPAR5 as an immune checkpoint molecule regulating immune surveillance and cytotoxic effector function.
The objective of this proposal is to identify small molecule inhibitors of LPAR5 as clinically applicable
immunomodulators for cancer treatment. A virtual screening (VS) of 2 million compounds using validated
LPAR models identified more than 300 hits of which 90 were selective for LPAR5 antagonist compounds with
diverse scaffolds. In addition, a high throughput screening (HTS) campaign of 200K compounds and secondary
analyses of 19 validated hits have already resulted in the identification of two distinct molecular scaffolds. The
most promising hit, SRI-42730, demonstrated LPAR5 antagonism in five independent assays: β-arrestin
recruitment, Ca2+ mobilization, TGFα-shedding, IL-2 production implemented in HTS platform and in vivo
efficacy in the B16 murine melanoma metastasis model. The novel hits and analogs we have already identified
will be used as tool compounds in the following proposed studies: 1) Perform hit-to-lead medicinal chemistry
optimization of LPAR5 antagonists. Computational approaches will include scaffold hopping on HTS hits, and
the generation of a pharmacophore model to aid synthetic optimization of potency and selectivity of newly
designed analogs; 2) Determine the specificity of novel antagonists at LPA GPCR subtypes and autotaxin
lysophospholipase enzyme; 3) Rank specific antagonist hits by potency in boosting antigen-specific TCR
activation and IL-2 production in the presence of LPA; 4). 8 key compounds will then be evaluated in cellular
assays from which 3 compounds will undergo PK analysis prior to in vivo tox studies and animal efficacy
studies. 5) Determine efficacy of nominated three potential lead compounds in boosting tumor immunity
using murine and allogeneic human in vitro tumor killing assays and in vivo murine metastasis seeding and
progression models. The impact of this research will be the identification and nomination of a single lead
compound and a pool of structurally diverse LPAR5 antagonists for further preclinical development."
10895506,"Project Summary/Abstract
Understanding how niches regulate stem cells is critical to human health because aberrant regulation by the
niche can cause tumor formation or tissue atrophy. Well-studied niches form in predictable structures following
reproducible morphogenetic changes, suggesting niche structure is regulated and functionally important. This
has not been directly studied. Additionally, the mechanisms that determine the initial positioning of niches during
development remain understudied. To address these deficits, we study the Drosophila posterior signaling center
(PSC)—the niche of the larval lymph gland. The PSC maintains hematopoietic progenitors, and it induces
differentiation of a special immune cell upon immune challenge. The PSC forms during embryogenesis: its cells
migrate dorsally, where they ultimately reside, coalesced at the lymph gland posterior. Preliminary data indicates
that mutants without visceral mesoderm (vm) have dispersed PSCs and fewer PSC cells. As such, the overall
hypothesis is that the vm guides PSC positioning to the lymph gland posterior. We further hypothesize that a
coalesced PSC is required for its optimal function as a niche. Aim 1 will identify the role of vm and its mechanism
of action in instructing PSC formation via live-imaging of vm mutants to identify the timing and type of the PSC
defect, and then testing vm candidate cues with vm-specific RNAi knockdown of the cue followed by analysis of
PSC positioning. The PSC signal transducer will be identified by PSC-specific RNAi knockdown of candidate
transducers. Ectopic expression of the vm cue in a nearby tissue will reveal if the cue is a true guidance cue
sufficient to guide PSC positioning, or whether it confers competency to respond to other positional cues. Aim 2
will investigate how PSC coalescence contributes to niche function by causing PSC dispersion and then
assessing PSC functions. Ability of the dispersed PSC to maintain progenitors will be tested by quantitating PSC-
dependent progenitors, and ability to generate an immune response by challenging larvae with parasitoid wasp
infection, and then quantitating a specialized immune cell type. The PSC can sense the organism’s nutrient and
immune environment, but it is unknown if it senses feedback from the cells it regulates. This will be tested with
lineage-specific ablation of progenitors or mature hemocytes in the lymph gland with Gal4/UAS-driven apoptosis.
Then the level of PSC maintenance and differentiation signals will be measured for comparison to controls.
Accomplishing these aims will reveal principles of niche formation, how niche structure impacts its function, and
whether a niche receives feedback from the tissue it supports. Research training will take place at the University
of Pennsylvania under the advisement of the Sponsor, the PI’s thesis committee, and Penn faculty as needed.
The training plan consists of an integrated and creatively unique sequence of mentorship experiences to prepare
the PI for their career. Training includes several opportunities to improve written and verbal communication, and
professional development activities (course, conferences, seminars) for the PI to transition to a new research
topic for an academic postdoctoral fellowship."
10895508,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hypertension affects half of American adults but poses an especially severe burden on African Americans.
Disparities in hypertension diagnosis, treatment, and control outcomes are spatially patterned. This spatial
patterning is hypothesized to be due to area-level socioeconomic risk factors and area-level structural resources
(e.g., healthy foods, recreation, healthcare, and housing). Leveraging detailed spatial data provides unique
opportunities to drill down below common area-level studies and elucidate the mechanisms by which area-level
factors produce hypertension disparities. Spatial social polarization (SSP) indices are potentially key to
understanding hypertension disparities. SSP indices measure the extent to which populations are distributed at
extremes of privilege and deprivation of socioeconomic domains. SSP indices can be meaningfully expanded to
measure structural resources, representing key opportunities to examine hypertension disparities. Despite such
promise, little research has evaluated the association between socioeconomic SSP and hypertension; and no
prior research has quantified structural SSP or its relationship with hypertension disparities. The scientific
objective of this proposal is to estimate the impact of eight SSP domains on hypertension disparities, evaluating
both socioeconomic SSP (race/ethnicity, income, education, residential segregation) and structural SSP (food,
recreation, healthcare, and housing) domains. The central hypothesis is that living in areas with high SSP
increases hypertension disparities. This innovative project will leverage data from (1) the Cardiovascular Health
Study (CHS); (2) the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Strokes (REGARDS) study; (3) private
and public claims data from Optum and Medicare; and (4) spatial data from the Retail Environment and
Cardiovascular Disease (RECVD) study with geographic linkages to CHS and REGARDS cohorts. Research
aims will (1) estimate the population-level effects of socioeconomic SSP predictors of hypertension prevalence,
incidence, treatment, and control outcomes among Black and White adults; (2) develop a structural SSP index
using measures of structural resources, and estimate the association between structural SSP and hypertension
among Black and White adults; and (3) evaluate the extent to which socioeconomic and structural SSP mediate
Black-White hypertension disparities. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds on the
applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics. The training plan includes measuring and modeling
hypertension-specific SSP in diverse populations, analyzing large claims data, and applying causal inference
methods. The combined research and training plans will prepare the applicant for a successful independent
research career in epidemiology. The proposed research will improve public health surveillance of hypertension
disparities, provide the evidence required to inform the development of SSP interventions, and invite further
research on the causal pathways linking concentrations of privilege and deprivation to health disparities."

This application is for an Independent Scientist Award (K02) from the National Institute on Aging. The
candidate, Dr. Thomas W. Buford, is an Associate Professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of
Alabama at Birmingham. Dr. Buford has to date established a strong scientific track record in aging and the
preservation of physical function. His long-term goal is to establish a sustainable research program focused on
identifying and developing therapeutic strategies for the preserving physical independence among older adults.
The objective of this application is to provide the candidate with the protected time necessary to acquire
knowledge and skills needed to incorporate two inter-related areas, cognitive health and pain management,
into his existing research program. These areas represent two major epidemics in aging including chronic
opioid abuse and cognitive disorders including mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s, and other dementias.
While these areas are recognized as high-priorities for older adults and are associated with declining physical
function, few investigators to date have routinely incorporated these factors into prospective studies concerning
the preservation of physical function among older adults. Acquiring expertise in these areas will provide the
candidate with a more nuanced view of the key issues surrounding the preservation of physical independence.
Award activities will also lead to and expanded skillset, ultimately contributing to an improved ability to design
and execute research studies capable of making meaningful impacts on the health and quality of life of older
adults. The training plan includes three primary objectives which are to: 1) Acquire new knowledge and skills to
the assessment and maintenance of cognition in aging, 2) acquire new knowledge and skills in the assessment
and treatment of pain in older adults, and 3) advance mentoring and leadership skills necessary to support a
sustainable research program. The research plan is designed to integrate with the training plan to provide the
candidate with opportunities to 1) utilize established data sources to explore novel relationships between
cognition/pain and indices of physical function, and 2) participate in prospective data collection to learn
laboratory methods in these areas and generate novel data in these areas. His advisory team includes
established, well-funded experts in both cognition (Ronald Lazar, PhD; Virginia Wadley, PhD) and pain (Roger
Fillingim, PhD, Burel Goodin, PhD) in aging as well in biostatistics (Gerald McGwin, PhD) and research
leadership (Marcas Bamman, PhD). This outstanding team will facilitate the candidate’s success in integrating
these new concepts with his existing research. This K02 award will provide the candidate with protected time to
expand his research program which will enhance the overall creativity and sustainability of his research.
Ultimately this progress is expected to enhance his potential to make significant contributions to the field of
healthy aging and to improve the training of future mentees by creating a more interdisciplinary approach
incorporating principles from physical, cognitive, and pain sciences."
10897812,"Abstract
In contrast to other HIV-associated cancers, the incidence of cervical cancer has not declined in the era of
antiretroviral therapy (ART), and is the most common cancer among Kenyan and Ugandan women. These
countries each have high HIV prevalence, which greatly accelerates the progression of cervical cancer, even in
women receiving ART and achieving “reconstituted” immune systems. Better methods of screening are
needed, and we need to understand cofactors related to HPV infection, the virus that causes cervical cancer.
The long-term objective of our project is to help eradicate cervical cancer in HIV-infected Kenyan and Ugandan
women. We will test our approach in a study of HIV-infected women. First, we will evaluate HR-HPV DNA
testing of self-collected vaginal swabs combined with VIA in detecting biopsy-proven cervical intraepithelial
neoplasia grades 2, 3, or worse (CIN 2/3+) in HIV-infected women living in Kenya or Uganda. We
hypothesized that detection of biopsy-proven CIN 2/3+ is higher among HIV-infected women with both HR-
HPV DNA positivity and VIA abnormality compared to those with only one or neither of these tests positive.
Second, we will determine if aflatoxin, a carcinogenic and immunosuppressive compound found in
contaminated corn, is a risk factor for oncogenic HPV detection and cervical cancer among HIV-infected
Kenyan and Ugandan women. We hypothesize that regardless of HIV-status, aflatoxin is a risk factor for HR-
HPV detection, HR-HPV persistence, and biopsy-proven CIN 2/3+, that the impact of aflatoxin on HR-HPV
detection, HR-HPV persistence, and biopsy-proven CIN 2/3+ will be significantly greater in HIV-infected
women than in HIV-uninfected women, and that the immunosuppressive effects of aflatoxin impair the host’s
ability to control HIV in spite of ART use. Accomplishment of our aims will help improve care for all women in
Kenya and Uganda, and help in the battle against cervical cancer in HIV-infected women."

Basic science, translational, and clinical research in Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery is making
remarkable advances that affect the way we treat patients. A critical component of nourishing and expanding
such improvements in patient care is to facilitate the partnership of clinicians and basic scientists. One way to
achieve this is by training more clinician-scientists. Herein, we propose to implement an otolaryngology
research training program designed to cultivate clinician-scientists. Our Otolaryngology Clinician-Scientist
Training Program is designed to provide residents and medical students with intense research experiences, a
structured didactic program, and close mentorship and guidance in how to integrate clinical and research
activities. Trainees will be ingrained with the philosophy that research is intrinsic to an academic surgeon’s
career and that they should build their career by sustaining excellence in both research and clinical care. We
will heavily recruit trainees from underrepresented groups. If our training program is successful, our graduates
will become independent NIH-funded investigators in faculty positions in academic departments. The ultimate
long-term goal, of course, is for them to improve human health by advancing our field via scientific discovery

10868072,"Project Summary
Unmeasured confounding is a major source of bias in causal inference for drug-related public policy
evaluation, and a sensitivity analysis is typically needed to examine how sensitive a related causal conclusion
is to unmeasured confounding. Existing sensitivity analysis methods are underdeveloped in drug-related policy
evaluation and can severely harm the evidence for (or against) causal claims. For example, in matched
observational studies, one of the most widely used causal inference methods in policy research, existing
sensitivity analysis methods typically focus on the case when the treatment is binary or there is a single
outcome; also, they often ignore possible subgroup-specific effects. However, many drug-related policy
measures are non-binary (e.g., ordinal or continuous), such as alcohol or tobacco tax rates, minimum legal
purchase ages, alcohol policy scores, tobacco control index, and mobility scores. Also, drug-related policies
are often evaluated using several outcomes, either those related to different types of drug use, or those related
to different aspects of society such as health, justice, and economics. Finally, due to existing disparities in
drug-related outcomes, there is an intense focus on accurately measuring the effects of drug-related policies
among subgroups defined by race and socioeconomic status. The broad objective of this project is to develop
a universal sensitivity analysis framework for unmeasured confounding in matched observational studies that
can work with binary or non-binary treatments, single or multiple outcomes, and overall or subgroup-specific
effects. There are three specific aims. Aim 1 will develop a universal sensitivity analysis framework for matched
observational studies with general (binary or non-binary) treatments. Aim 2 will further develop the sensitivity
analysis for multiple outcomes and subgroup-specific effects. Aim 3 will illustrate the proposed sensitivity
analysis by studying the causal influences of mobility policies, such as social distancing policies and
transportation policies where the measures (e.g., mobility scores) are continuous in nature, on drug-related
outcomes (e.g., drug overdose deaths, tobacco use, and excessive drinking). We will evaluate the effect on the
overall population and those among different racial groups. Aim 3 will also develop a publicly available and
user-friendly R package to implement our universal sensitivity analysis framework."

The mission of the Intermountain PREP (IM-PREP) is to build a diverse biomedical research workforce reflecting
the talent pool of our diverse population. The University of Utah is committed to fortifying, sustaining, and
amplifying the STEM pipeline that trains and launches a diverse research workforce. IM-PREP will specifically
address the leaks in the pipeline leading from undergraduate to doctoral training of groups underrepresented in
STEM. IM-PREP will recruit students from diverse backgrounds, including pipeline relationships with Historically
Black Colleges and Universities. These students demonstrate a strong drive for research and would benefit from
additional research-intensive training experiences and professional development, enhancing both their
successful transition to top-tier doctoral programs, as well as their long-term retention in PhD-based career
tracks. In order to accomplish these goals, IM-PREP will provide key proposed activities that include (1) holistic,
culturally-competent mentored experiences to undertake hypothesis-driven research; (2) scientific coursework
and professional workshops that enhance strong oral and written communication skills, and instill successful
strategies for applying to graduate school; (3) an innovative, inclusive support system that develops and
implements an Individual Development Plan (IDP), in a mastery learning context, to enhance trainee self-efficacy
and authentic scientific identity. Throughout the training process, we employ a matrix mentoring approach that
incorporates peer and near-peer support, cultural STEM communities and diverse role-models. Our approach is
built on University-wide momentum and infrastructure dedicated to supporting STEM equity, diversity and
inclusion. As part of its institutional commitment, the University of Utah funded a pilot IM-PREP program
beginning last spring, and we have shaped our proposed extramural program based on practical experience
developing and leading the IM-PREP pilot and mentoring its diverse trainees. We are confident that IM-PREP
will fortify its Scholars’ critical thinking and research mastery and develop a resilient mindset to persist in graduate
training and beyond, where they will join and lead a more diverse biomedical research enterprise."

Background: We recently revealed that glioblastoma (GBM) contain cell populations with distinct metabolic
requirements, with fast-cycling cells (FCCs) harnessing aerobic glycolysis, and treatment-resistant slow-cycling
cells (SCCs) preferentially engaging lipid metabolism. How the different tumor cells interact with immune cells
and how this metabolic heterogeneity shapes the immune landscape in GBM has yet to be understood.
Objectives/Hypothesis: The objectives of this study are to understand the mechanisms of communication in
the tumor microenvironment, specifically to characterize the metabolic interactions between SCCs (a
therapeutically resistant population that drive disease progression and recurrence) and the immune compartment.
Here, we will investigate a model of intercellular communication within GBM where SCCs shape an
immunosuppressive tumor milieu, which in turn assume metabolic support to SCCs by providing them with lipids,
which are essential for SCC metabolism and function. Importantly, we will test multiple genetic and clinically
amenable pharmacological approaches disrupting this metabolic interplay to antagonize GBM.
Specific aims: Our specific aims will be 1) Dissect the relationship of SCCs with the tumor microenvironment,
2) Delineate how recruited immune suppressive cell mediate SCC-driven tumor progression, and 3) Establish
that immune infiltrates provide metabolic support to SCCs by providing lipids.
Study design: The link between tumor heterogeneity and tumor immune landscape in GBM will be deciphered
with specific investigations of the metabolic interplay taking place between these cellular compartments.
In aim 1, we will delineate the cell lineage (SCC vs FCC) relationship with immune infiltrates by investigating
their genomic profile and spatial organization, using single cell RNA sequencing technology and GeoMx Digital
Spatial Profiling, respectively. We will also evaluate the role of the specific adipokine, Lipocalin-2, in shaping the
immune microenvironment. In aim 2 we will employ multiple approaches disrupting the macrophage, myeloid-
derived suppressor cell, and regulatory T cell compartments, and compare the effect on survival, growth and
chemotherapy sensitivity of SCCs and FCCs. In aim 3 the use of fluorescently labeled lipids combined with flow
cytometry and time lapse imaging will enable the comparison of lipid transfer between immune cells, FCCs and
SCCs. Finally, in vivo experiments will test the hypothesis that targeting lipid trafficking (inhibition of FABP3 or
ApoE) or lipogenesis (statin treatment) provide therapeutic benefits by affecting SCCs and rendering the overall
tumor more responsive to chemotherapy. Based on the recently reported synergistic effect of statins with immune
checkpoint inhibitors, we will also evaluate the combination of statins with anti PD-1 therapy.
Impact: Successfully completed, this project will validate therapeutically amenable approaches targeting
metabolic communication to improve brain tumor associated morbidity and mortality."

The HIV pandemic continues to pose significant challenges, with disparities in progress evident in the St. Louis
area and Missouri at large. Populations left behind from the benefits of effective prevention and treatment
interventions bear a disproportionate burden of new infections, morbidity, and mortality. Black men and women
are particularly affected, with alarmingly higher prevalence rates compared to their white counterparts.
Additionally, Missouri's rural regions face elevated risks of HIV outbreaks due to rising syndemics and limited
investments in public health. To address these urgent issues, the scientific working group (SWG) of the
Midwest Developmental Center for AIDS Research (D-CFAR), led by Drs. Michael Durkin and Dima Dandachi,
aims to establish a collaborative community involving academics, regional stakeholders, and community-based
partners. This collaboration will conduct pragmatic, community-engaged, and stakeholder-embedded research
targeted towards neglected populations affected by HIV. The project's success is rooted in two key ingredients:
a cohort of passionate emerging investigators from local universities, dedicated to innovative health care
delivery and harm reduction principles, and strong partnerships with community-based organizations and
regional public health agencies. The SWG will leverage these assets by facilitating regular interactions
between academics and practitioners, fostering idea exploration, and providing funding for academic-
practitioner partnerships. The proposed aims are as follows: Aim 1: Develop a multidisciplinary research
collaborative for neglected populations in the Missouri epidemic, comprising researchers, community-based
organizations, and public health practitioners. The collaborative will meet regularly, employing the Nominal
Group Technique to prioritize research ideas and foster a shared vision for impactful, pragmatic research that
can contribute to ending the HIV epidemic in Missouri. Aim 2: Establish a community-academic research
incubator to develop community and practitioner-led proposals for D-CFAR pilot funding mechanisms. The
research agenda generated in Aim 1 will serve as the foundation for future research aims. This incubator
program will provide support, mentoring, and coordination to turn ideas into tangible community-based
research projects, focusing on partnerships between academic institutions and non-academic stakeholders.
The impact of the Neglected Populations SWG will significantly contribute to the overall goal of the CFAR to
enhance research infrastructure in the state. By prioritizing community-based research for neglected
populations, the SWG aims to create unique opportunities that combine the expertise of groups with
lived/practitioner experience in HIV treatment and prevention with that of academic medical center
researchers. This inclusive approach will lead to a substantial increase in novel research proposals and a
strengthened funded research base, ultimately advancing efforts to combat HIV and improve health services
for underserved communities."

 Protein Homeostasis in Health and Disease
 April 24 - 28, 2024
ABSTRACT
This proposal is a request for financial support for a meeting on PROTEIN HOMEOSTASIS IN
HEALTH AND DISEASE to be held at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory from April 24 - 28, 2024.
This meeting is the premier international forum for presentation of new results in this exciting area
across biology and medicine and is attended by representatives from virtually every major
laboratory in the field. The explosion of new information on how the folded state of proteins is
acquired and maintained in vivo and the relevance of this process to essentially all biological
processes for healthy aging and risk for degenerative diseases of aging including
neurodegeneration, cancer, and metabolism guarantees an excitement and urgency of this
meeting. Because of the recent developments on stress signaling in aging and disease, we will
open the meeting with this session to integrate across diverse forms of cell stress responses
followed by sessions on chaperone mechanisms and co-translational folding and ribosome quality
control. We will then explore the roles of stress granules and phase transitions, protein
degradative mechanisms, organellar proteostasis and misfolding and aggregation in aging and
neurodegenerative diseases. We will close with a session on therapeutic strategies for protein
conformational diseases of aging. These fundamental questions are at the heart of the biology of
proteostasis that will be complemented by the sessions on aging and proteostasis failure in
diseases of protein misfolding including Alzheimer’s disease, ALS, Parkinson’s disease and
Huntington’s disease. The themes of aging, proteostasis failure, and diseases of protein
misfolding are well integrated throughout each session, and emerging principles on protein client
interactions and alternate protein conformations will be dominantly displayed. The diverse protein
quality control strategies used by compartments of the cell to ensure the integrity of the secretory
and organellar pathways during times of protein folding stress will be represented by emerging
topics on spatial quality control within a cell. The field of heat shock proteins and molecular
chaperones has grown exponentially and draws interest not only from traditional scientific
disciplines in the basic sciences but also from diverse areas of biomedical research including
neurodegenerative disease, infectious diseases, cancer, heart disease and aging. The meeting
will have eight lecture sessions, two poster sessions, two lightning presentation sessions, a (new)
panel discussion on careers in science and a daily lunch with the speakers. The sessions include:
1) Cell Stress Response in Biology, Aging and Disease; 2) Chaperone Mechanisms; 3) Co-
translational Folding and Ribosome Quality Control; 4) Stress Granules, Phase Transitions and
Intrinsically Disordered Proteins; 5) Degradation Mechanisms - Autophagy Lysosomal Pathway
and the Ubiquitin Proteasome System; 6) Misfolding and Aggregation in Aging and
Neurodegenerative Diseases; 7) Organellar Proteostasis and Spatial Quality Control in Aging and
Disease; and 8) Therapeutic Strategies for Protein Conformational Diseases of Aging. Each
session will consist of eight to nine oral presentations and will be co-chaired by an invited speaker.
Generally, two speakers will be pre-invited per session with the remainder to be selected from
submitted abstracts, thus ~60-65% of speakers will be from submitted abstracts to ensure balance
of junior investigators, gender, and all forms of diversity. As well, we will have two lightning
sessions, each with ten talks each of 2 min. to highlight key presentations from the poster
sessions. This balance of talks allows the meeting to feature presentations by leading scientists,
to be responsive to exciting new developments, and to encourage diverse participation that
recognizes new investigators."
10897732,"Gestational hyperglycemia and gestational diabetes (GDM) are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes for mothers and newborns. Additionally, GDM, in particular, can also be detrimental to metabolic outcomes later in life. A large genetic study, ‘The Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study’ previously identified a unique genetic association near hexokinase domain component-1 (HKDC1) to gestational hyperglycemia. This study has been confirmed by others and also shown to be associated with GDM. This grant renewal intends to continue our investigation of this important link to gestational glucose metabolism. The focus of this proposal is based on our data that HKDC1 interacts with the mitochondrial outer membrane protein, VDAC, in hepatocytes, where this interaction is disrupted when the amino terminus of HKDC1 is deleted. Further data shows that overexpression of HKDC1 in the liver improved glucose tolerance during pregnancy in mice and our data suggests that this results in a metabolic shift in the carbon flux toward anabolic pathways. Now, it is important to investigate the molecular basis of HKDC1 interaction with mitochondria and the impact of such interactions on mitochondrial morphology and function. Further, we expect that genetic variants contribute to GDM risk via HKDC1 expression, though the specific causal variants remain elusive. In sum, this proposal will mechanistically explore the role of HKDC1 in gestational glucose homeostasis and the genetic variants driving its expression in humans."

Group B Streptococcus (GBS), is a Gram-positive pathobiont that commonly colonizes the gastrointestinal and
lower female reproductive tracts but can cause adverse health outcomes in neonates and vulnerable adult
populations. GBS has also been increasingly associated with diabetic wound infections and is the third leading
cause of death from skin and subcutaneous infection. It is estimated that over 500 million people have diabetes
today with one of the most common complications being chronic wounds that fail to heal due to other diabetic
complications and their high susceptibility to bacterial infection. Our lab recently performed dual RNA-sequencing
on GBS infected wound tissues from diabetic mice (Db). Results showed significant increased transcription of
many known GBS metal transport systems in Db wounds compared to culture controls including zinc
(adcABC,adcAII,lmb), manganese (mtsABC), and an unknown metal transport system (nikABCDE). Preliminary
results show that the putative GBS Nik transporter has high protein similarity and structure to the known E. coli
nickel ABC-type transporter and is turned on under metal stress indicating it may play a role in GBS metal
homeostasis. We also observed significant increased transcription and concentration of host calprotectin (CP),
a neutrophil-derived metal chelator, in infected Db wounds compared to uninfected controls. Metal transport
systems are key players in maintaining metal homeostasis of divalent cations, nutrients that are needed for all
living organisms, while CP is a hallmark of inflammation and is involved in nutritional immunity where the host
starves invading pathogens of nutrients necessary for survival. The role of the putative nickel transport system,
NikABCDE, in GBS and during Db wound infection is unknown. Neutrophils also make a toxic byproduct of
glycolysis called methylglyoxal (MGX) that can be broken down by a two-step pathway catalyzed by glyoxalase
A and B. MGX is also increased in Db individuals and is a precursor to advanced glycation end products (AGEs)
which further exacerbate Db complications. GBS contains homologous glyoxalase enzymes and preliminary data
shows glyoxalase A contributes to GBS growth in the presence of MGX. This proposal seeks to characterize the
putative nickel transporter in GBS and investigate the role of GBS MGX detoxification during Db wound infection.
I hypothesize that the putative nickel transporter and MGX detoxification pathway are important for overcoming
metal and MGX stress during infection. These hypotheses will be addressed with both in vitro biophysical and
growth assays and in vivo models of Db wound infection in the following specific aims: (1) characterize the
putative metal ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter, NikABCDE, and (2) characterize the putative MGX
detoxification system in GBS and its role during diabetic wound infection."

There are over 20 million Asians in the US, 60% of whom are immigrants. By 2055, this demographic is
expected to surpass Hispanics to become the largest immigrant group in the country. This includes 1.5 million
undocumented Asians, who experience greater barriers to access than their documented peers. Despite these
trends, national health statistics often lump Asians into an “other” category or exclude them entirely. For Asian
immigrant women, who report greater odds of unintended pregnancies and are less likely to use sexual and
reproductive health (SRH) care compared to their US-born counterparts, detailed SRH data accounting for
their diversity of social, economic, and political experiences is critical to addressing SRH inequities in their
growing community. Moreover, past studies treat immigration status as a binary (documented/undocumented)
and static variable; however, there is increasing recognition that there is a hierarchy of statuses and that status
can change across the life of an immigrant. Building on the PI’s past work with Asian immigrants, the goal of
this study is to provide critical SRH data among the most diverse sample of Asian immigrant women to date.
We propose to establish the first multi-city, sequential mixed-methods study of the SRH of Asian women
across multiple ethnicities and immigration statuses, including naturalized citizens, lawful permanent residents,
temporary workers and students, DACA recipients, and undocumented immigrants. Guided by the social
ecological model and life course perspective, this study will assess multilevel factors that mediate and
moderate associations between immigration status and SRH care use. We first conduct 48 qualitative life
history interviews to examine how sociopolitical experiences of immigration statuses act as barriers to SRH
care use over time (Aim 1). Next, using a novel starfish sampling method used to recruit hidden populations,
we will recruit 2,000 Asian immigrant women aged 18-49 years, including an oversampling of the four largest
undocumented Asian ethnicities (Indian, Chinese, Filipinos, and Koreans) in cities with the highest numbers of
Asian immigrants (Los Angeles, New York City, Houston, and Atlanta). Using quantitative survey data, we will
1) examine how immigration status is associated with use of recent SRH services; 2) explore histories of
immigration statuses and assess cumulative risks on SRH care use during sensitive periods (e.g. childhood,
adolescence, adulthood) (Aim 2); 3) and examine mediators and moderators (Aim 3). In order to improve the
quality, relevance, and accessibility of our research, we will partner with the National Asian Pacific American
Women’s Forum (NAPAWF), the first national Asian reproductive justice organization, and its chapters located
in each of our cities of interest. In addition, we will closely engage the knowledge, expertise, and sensitivities of
local community-based organizations throughout California, New York, Texas, and Georgia. Our short-term
goal is to identify and inform multi-level SRH outreach and intervention efforts, which will help us achieve our
long-term goal to improve the SRH equity of immigrants, families, and communities."

This Research Specialist proposal will support my 2 main roles in my Unit Director's (Nima Sharifi, M.D.) research
program. My primary role is focused on laboratory management, animal model (mouse) projects, and clinical
studies in my Unit Director's laboratory, while my secondary role is as Program Manager for the Genitourinary
Malignancies Research Center (GUMRC), which is led by my Unit Director. For the Unit Director's laboratory in
addition to maintaining safety and compliance of all research personnel, I am essential to the advancement of
laboratory techniques, diagnostic tools and critical planning required to meet the goals of our NCI-funded and
other cancer research. I am significantly involved in all in vivo animal model work including preparation and
submission of all protocols to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), as well as the surgical
and technical portions of the experiments. I am instrumental in training our unit's personnel (clinical fellows,
residents, postdocs, technologists and students) in these critical techniques (both in vivo and lab based) in an
effort to maintain scientific congruence while ensuring that laboratory personnel adhere to IACUC, Institutional
Review Board and Institutional Biosafety Committee rules and regulations. For my Unit Director's laboratory, our
primary focus remains on prostate cancer. While treatment of localized disease results in favorable outcomes,
metastatic prostate cancer remains incurable. The frontline treatment for advanced metastatic prostate cancer
is medical or surgical castration to reduce androgen hormone levels, referred to as androgen deprivation therapy
(ADT). When successful, ADT reduces intratumoral androgens, resulting in absence of androgen receptor (AR)
signaling. However, these tumors commonly develop ADT-resistance and are termed castration-resistant
prostate cancer (CRPC). Our research goals focus on how prostate cancer cells can produce their own steroids
in response to ADT, thus leading to cancer progression. By understanding the foundations of CRPC and the
mechanisms that drive therapeutic resistance, we aim to identify new drug targets and treatments for diagnosis
and treatment. For my Unit Director's clinical studies and extending into our GUMRC, I participate in study
conceptualization and function as the intermediary between the Unit Director and our clinical collaborators. The
GUMRC is focused on basic and translational studies of GU malignancies (prostate, bladder, and kidney). The
center is an inter-disciplinary translational partnership that leverages Cleveland Clinic's research and clinical

Molecular investigations of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias over the past decade have largely relied on postmortem specimens due to the inaccessibility of the brain in living people. At least two serious limitations are inherent to this framework. First, the molecular impact of death and the preceding agonal process on the human brain are unknown. This uncertainty looms over the field as a potential confounder of virtually all modern neurobiological studies of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias in humans. Second, profiling the brain postmortem decouples molecular biology from deep neuropsychiatric assessment and neuroimaging. As a result, a holistic narrative of how molecular biology influences brain structure and functions dysregulated in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias has failed to emerge. These serious limitations could be addressed by the ability to molecularly profile the brain in living people. Here, we address these serious limitations through the Living Brain Project, wherein we perform comprehensive multiomic molecular profiling of living and postmortem human brain tissue. The primary innovation of the LBP is a safe, scalable procedure for sampling the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in living people. We will profile the genome, transcriptome (bulk and single-cell), proteome, metabolome and lipidome in over 500 living and postmortem human subjects. Analyses of this data will identify molecular signatures differentiating the living and postmortem states. We will harness these insights to determine the extent to which they have confounded postmortem studies of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. Finally, we will integrate these multiomics datasets with neuroimaging and neurocognitive assessments from the same individuals. To our knowledge, the proposed experiments and analyses will comprise (1) the largest molecular study of the living human brain, (2) the largest molecular comparison of living and postmortem human brain tissues, and (3) the largest effort pairing multiomic molecular profiles of the brain with neuroimaging and deep neurocognitive phenotyping from the same living individuals. We anticipate fundamental advances in knowledge of human brain biology and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias will be made by making this rich dataset freely available to scientific community."

The Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) supports the Egg Safety and Quality
Management (ESQM) program which is well positioned to participate in the Egg Regulatory
Program Standards (ERPS) implementation. The ESQM program was in the unique position of
being involved in the initial development of the ERPS, cooperatively, along with Iowa and the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This three-plus year comprehensive experience with
ERPS allows ESQM an excellent opportunity to continue and expand the work, while
maintaining consistency and enhancing the food safety and quality consumer product goals and
missions of CDFA and ESQM.
In congruity with the FDA’s desired outcomes under this Cooperative Agreement, ESQM is
dedicated to the ERPS goals to assess and build on the ESQM regulatory foundation, contribute
to the improvement of the ERPS, help develop and implement electronic information sharing
protocols, strengthen a foundation for pursuing regulatory actions and outbreak investigations,
improve the ESQM outreach and education for egg producers and maintain a commitment to
complete compliance and integration of the ERPS.
Through this funding opportunity, ESQM will hire an Environmental Scientist (ES) to complete
the ERPS Standards, which will entail a full self-assessment of the program and action plans for
making improvements to close the identifiable gaps. The ES would lead the ESQM program
through all the improvement plan steps to achieve full implementation. The Environmental
Scientist will work with the FDA to draft protocols and agreements in order to fulfill the goal of
electronic information sharing. These goals target the implementation, further improvement,
and promotion of the ERPS as a national integrated food safety system."

 The excitement about nanomedicine stems from the potential application of nanoscience to solve
challenging medical problems. Inorganic nanoparticles (iNPs) exhibit unique properties that favor their diverse
application in medicine, engineering, science, and technology. The large surface-to-volume ratio of these iNPs
provides sites for the attachment of multiple drugs or imaging agents for therapy and imaging of diverse human
diseases. Further conjugation of biological entities, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, confers specific
targeting of these iNPs to desired tissues in vivo. Recent studies have shown that the intrinsic properties of some
iNPs can be harnessed for therapeutic outcomes. Still, spontaneous stimulation of intrinsic therapeutic effects
through interactions of the NPs with intracellular organelles, proteins, or molecular processes is difficult to
control, leading to significant off-target toxicity. An alternative therapeutic approach is to transform some iNPs
into nanoscale energy transducers. Quantum dots, upconversion NPs, carbon nanomaterials, and photocatalytic
NPs are some nanoscale energy transducers that have shown promise in the treatment of human diseases. The
excellent redox properties of these nanophotosensitizers offer high spatiotemporal control and precision
phototherapy upon absorption of light. Two major limitations of current phototherapeutic interventions are the
limited penetration of light used to activate the photosensitizers, which confines therapy to shallow lesions, and
the frequent reliance on molecular oxygen to generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species, a condition that
precludes the effective treatment under the hypoxic conditions found in many solid and hematologic tumors.
 Recently, we developed radionuclide stimulated therapy that leverages the interaction of Cerenkov radiation
emitting radionuclides to stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species from photosensitizers. The
spatiotemporal therapeutic effects of these interactions allow the treatment of diverse diseases without tissue
depth limitation that affects light-based therapies. Supported by new concepts grounded in robust preliminary
data, we propose to (1) explore new nanostrategies to overcome the impediment to delivering NPs to tumors,
(2) disrupt the protective interactions of cancer with stromal cells to enhance treatment response, and (3) exert
sustainable therapeutic effect via multidimensional combination therapy to achieve disease-free survival.
 At the completion of this study, we would develop new nanoplatforms for the treatment and imaging of cancer
and bone lesions."
10868891,"Project Summary/Abstract
Skeletal muscle atrophy occurs as a consequence of many chronic diseases and conditions such as
disuse. Protein turnover is important in maintaining skeletal muscle health and contributes to the
process of atrophy and growth. Protein degradation is central to the process of muscle atrophy, for
which the E3 ubiquitin ligases are critical in targeting specific proteins for degradation. The role of many
E3 ubiquitin ligases in muscle are unknown and specific substrates have yet to be identified. The overall
objective of this proposal is to determine the role of the conserved E3 ligase, Ubiquitin Protein Ligase
E3 Component N-Recognin 5 (UBR5), in skeletal muscle atrophy and growth. We have previously
observed UBR5 to be increased in multiple mammalian models of growth and recovery from atrophy.
My central hypothesis is that UBR5 is critical for protein turnover and maintaining muscle mass
via mTORC1 regulation. Robust preliminary data supports this hypothesis: 1) Loss of UBR5 induces
skeletal muscle atrophy and chronic hyperactivation of mTORC1 activity, and 2) Genetic activation of
protein synthesis increases UBR5 and induces muscle growth. I propose two specific aims:
 Aim 1 will define the importance of UBR5 in the process of atrophy and growth. I will address
this aim using a muscle knockdown of UBR5 in a model of nerve crush to look at the loss of muscle
mass and the ability for muscle to recover following a period of disuse. Protein turnover will be assessed
via stable isotope labelling to determine rates of protein synthesis and breakdown under atrophy and
growth conditions with UBR5 suppression. Aim 2 will seek to understand the relationship between
UBR5 and protein synthesis via Akt/mTORC1 signaling and how this potential interaction influences
overall skeletal muscle health. I will address this aim using a combined approach of UBR5 or Akt gene
manipulation with and without rapamycin treatment (an mTORC1 inhibitor).
 With the completion of these pilot studies, I expect to identify novel mechanisms for
understanding the process of muscle atrophy and growth. This will allow us to explore new therapeutic
strategies for improving an individual’s quality of life where muscle wasting is present and improve
recovery."

Low-resource settings have a high burden of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection, but insufficient laboratory
infrastructure for diagnostic tests and antimicrobial susceptibility determination, leading to syndromic
management, which misses a high proportion of cases and results in the overuse of antibiotics. Together, those
factors contribute to driving the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a global public health threat.
Two novel strategies can combine to address those challenges. First, the use of CRISPR-based technology
permits the development of low-cost, point-of-care (POC) assays, which can be used in resource-limited
settings. Second, determination of molecular resistance markers can facilitate resistance-guided therapy,
thereby reducing the selective pressure towards AMR. The study aims are: 1) adapt and validate existing
CRISPR-based assays for POC detection of N. gonorrhoeae and ciprofloxacin susceptibility, 2) develop a
multiplexed CRISPR-based assay for N. gonorrhoeae cefixime susceptibility, and 3) evaluate the feasibility and
acceptability of the POC N. gonorrhoeae and AMR assays among two health centers in Botswana. The study
is based upon our preliminary work in the development of Cas13a-based diagnostics for N. gonorrhoeae and
ciprofloxacin susceptibility, and will leverage clinical specimens collected as a part of an ongoing trial at the
Massachusetts General Hospital Sexual Health Clinic, as well as through existing collaborations in Botswana.
This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) supports the career development
of Dr. Lao-Tzu Allan-Blitz, an instructor of medicine with experience in the epidemiology of and novel diagnostic
assays targeting AMR sexually transmitted infections (STI). The K23 will support Dr. Allan-Blitz to develop
expertise in 1) assay development for POC detection, and 2) assay implementation and evaluation. To achieve
the proposed research and training aims, Dr. Allan-Blitz has assembled a team of mentors who are world
experts. Dr. Jacob Lemieux, who is an expert in metagenomics, DNA sequencing, and CRISPR-based assay
development, will serve as the primary mentor. In addition, his Co-Mentorship team includes Dr. Pardis Sabeti,
a world expert in computational genetics, microbial genomics, diagnostic technologies, and disease
surveillance in Africa, and Dr. Shahin Lockman, a world leader in implementation science research with
longstanding collaborations in Botswana. The proposed research and training aims will leverage strong,
longstanding collaborations and the robust research infrastructure between Brigham and Women's Hospital,
Massachusetts General Hospital, the Broad Institute, and the Botswana Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership.
Finally, the K23 award will advance Dr. Allan-Blitz's career goal of becoming an expert in assay development
for AMR STI and assay implementation, as well as facilitate his transition to research independence."

 Adolescents and Young Adults (AYAs) with blood disorders are at high risk of poor physical, emotional,
and social quality of life. On average, they suffer from seven unique, chronic, distressing symptoms. Over 60%
report insufficiently treated pain. AYAs with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) are at particularly high-risk; their pain,
anxiety, depression, and impaired social and cognitive function persist into adulthood. My central hypothesis is
that AYAs with serious illness experience poor outcomes in part because the stressors of illness compound the
stressors of development. The goal of my research program is to develop interventions to help AYAs navigate
those stressors, in turn alleviating suffering and improving quality of life. To date, I have focused on the population
of AYAs with cancer and been largely successful; I am currently the PI of 4 NCI R01-funded clinical trials testing
the efficacy of a novel resilience coaching program for high-risk teens with cancer or their families.
 I am also committed to mentoring the next generation of scientists focused on improving the outcomes
of youth with serious illness. I have been the primary research mentor for 21 trainees and early career faculty;
all 21 remain involved in patient-oriented research at academic institutions. It is critically important to me to
bolster the diversity of the research (and future mentor) workforce; for this reason, 100% of my mentees identify
as women and/or under-represented in medicine (URiM). As a testament to this commitment and my skills, I
received the “Excellence in Mentoring Women” award from the University of Washington in 2021.
 Here, I address 2 critical barriers to my continued success: First, few evidence-based psychosocial
interventions are ever integrated in routine clinical care. I want to collaborate with clinicians and communities to
implement my interventions. Second, Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) impact intervention-efficacy. I want to
robustly collect SDOH and better address their impact on intervention efficacy. I will address these barriers via 3
specific learning objectives: (1) Enhance my skills in collecting and investigating SDOH; (2) Develop
knowledge in Dissemination and Implementation Science, with a focus on community-based adaptation and
engagement; and (3) Develop skills in using the Electronic Health Record (EHR) to assess SDOH and patient-
centered outcomes; and 3 specific research aims: (1) Determine the feasibility and acceptability of a novel,
community-based Collaborative Care Model to deliver the Promoting Resilience in Stress Management (PRISM)
intervention among N=25 AYAs with sickle cell disease; (2) Leverage the electronic health record to characterize
relationships between SDOH and outcomes among youth with non-malignant blood disorders; and (3) Examine
relationships between SDOH and intervention efficacy using existing data from my R01-funded trials. These
career development and research activities are significant because they will provide me and my mentees
opportunities and skills to maximize the reach and impact of our interventions, in turn improving the physical,
emotional, and social quality of life of patients and communities in need."

Colon cancer remains the 3rd most commonly diagnosed cancer and the 3rd highest cancer related mortalities
in both men and women. Tumors are often resected, but there are less treatment options available for those
diagnosed in later stages. Immunotherapy has had mixed results in colon cancer and thus, new therapeutic
strategies are needed to improve outcome for particularly late stage patients. We have been examining
mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells as a subset of T cells that display innate effector qualities, with the
potential to be harnessed as HLA-independent immunotherapeutic agents.
We have found that MAIT cells have the potential to decrease tumor growth and have identified a potential
mechanism by which MAIT cells enhance innate immune cell responses in order to promote anti-tumor
immunity. Based on our novel preliminary data, we propose to test the hypothesis that MAIT cells have the
capacity for anti-tumor effects, through both direct cytotoxicity in a T cell receptor-dependent manner, and
indirect mechanisms through the recruitment of innate immune cells. To test this hypothesis, we propose
carefully designed experiments to examine the potential of MAIT cells for therapeutic potential using primary
human cells in organoid models and mouse tumors in therapeutic approaches in preclinical models.
Furthermore, we will test this therapeutic approach in combination with checkpoint therapy to enhance anti-
tumor cytotoxic activity. Data collected for this project could lead to a novel immunotherapy approach for
gastrointestinal cancers."

Black individuals have for decades been disproportionately impacted by kidney failure and rapid progression of
kidney disease when compared to their White counterparts. Black individuals with APOL1 high-risk alleles are
particularly vulnerable to accelerated chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and kidney failure. However,
these high-risk genotypes only occur in about 12-14% of Black individuals, and they do not guarantee CKD
progression or kidney failure. Other risk factors, such as hypertension, HIV, and COVID-19, are thought to
confer additional second-hit risks. Structural racism (SR)—defined as discriminatory policies and practices
promoted through reinforcing systems (e.g., housing, wealth, health care) –– is also widely understood to be a
contributor to racial disparities in kidney health. I hypothesize that SR acts as a “third hit” which contributes to
excess risk of adverse kidney health outcomes among Black individuals with APOL1 risk alleles. Through four
complementary aims, I will characterize the effects of structural racism on kidney health among Black
individuals with high-risk APOL1 alleles and design and test a patient-centered intervention to mitigate effects
of SR on health outcomes. In Aim 1, I will engage a multidisciplinary stakeholder board to collaborate in the
analysis and interpretation of mixed-methods studies in Aims 2 and 3, and in the design and evaluation of a
patient-centered pilot intervention in Aim 4. In Aim 2, I will quantify the longitudinal effects of SR with poor
kidney health leveraging 3 large APOL1-enriched cohort studies. In Aim 3, I will characterize the experiences
of structural racism of Black patients with APOL1 who have CKD and their clinicians with SR in health settings
and their communities using qualitative analyses (photovoice, focus groups, semi-structured interviews).
In Aim 4, in collaboration with the stakeholder board, I will pilot a patient-centered, navigator-led intervention
designed to mitigate the effects of structural racism on kidney health. Throughout the award period, I will
pursue training in advanced epidemiologic and statistical science, including longitudinal analysis and multilevel
modeling, and develop skills in patient-centered clinical trial design and execution. Training goals and research
aims are aligned and integrated to support a holistic experience. The robust training and world-class
mentorship supported by this award, and Mount Sinai's enriched training environment and extensive
resources, will prepare me for a career as an independent investigator dedicated to mitigating the devastating
impact of structural racism on kidney health and eliminating kidney health disparities."

Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) is one of the key co-inhibitory molecules upregulated upon T cell activation and
is a hallmark of T-cell exhaustion. Despite the fact that PD-1 blockade has become a revolutionary strategy in
treating cancer and infectious diseases, the mechanobiology of PD-1 has not been studied. This is the gap that
tne present Physical Science – Oncology Project (PS-OP) aims to fill. The significance of the PS-OP’s unique
mechanobiology angle lies in the therapeutic potential of targeting the mechanoregulation of PD-1 to treat a wide
variety of diseases, including melanoma, which is the focus of this PS-OP. The approaches of the PS-OP’s
multidisciplinary team combine four physical science (PS) tools with two mouse models of melanoma. They
represent the unique strength of the Zhu lab and the Ahmed lab, and enable investigation of PD-1
mechanobiology in silico, in vitro and in vivo. The first PS tool is DNA-based mechanical tension probes (MTP)
and tension gauge tethers (TGT) that report and limit, respectively, cell-generated forces on PD-1. The second
PS tool is three biomembrane force probe (BFP)-based single-molecule methods that quantify force regulation
of in situ PD-1–PD-ligand interactions with concurrent imaging of intracellular signals in single cells. The third
PS tool is molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that reveal structural changes of PD-1 in complex with its ligands
under force and the bonding dynamics at atomic level. The fourth PS-tool is microfluidic-based devices for cell
trapping, stimulation, and analysis. Preliminary studies of the project demonstrate that: 1) cells actively pull on
PD-1; 2) force on PD-1 elicits catch bonds to regulate ligand bonding; 3) force induces rearrangement of the PD-
1–PD-L2 binding interface to form new atomic-level interactions; 4) mutating specific amino acids on PD-1 alters
its force, catch bond and function; and 5) PD-1’s inhibitory signal suppresses antigen recognition by disrupting
the synergy between TCR and CD8 in pMHC binding. These data support the hypothesis that force critically
regulates ligand bonding and signaling of PD-1; as such, targeting the PD-1 mechanoregulation may represent
a novel approach to immunotherapy. This hypothesis will be tested by three specific aims: 1) Determine the
forces on PD-1 and their impact on PD-1 ligand bonding, signaling and function; 2) Modulate T cell function by
targeting PD-1 mechanoregulation; and 3) Investigate the therapeutic potential of manipulating PD-1 catch bonds
in tumor mouse models. These studies will elucidate the mechanisim of PD-1 signaling, improve one’s
understanding of CD8+ T-cell responses to melanoma, and suggest new immunotheraputic strategies to treating
cancer."

10868439,"Current vestibular rehabilitation intervenes upon vestibular impairments (balance, gaze stability, and
dizziness). Activity and participation are reduced in people with vestibulopathy, but are not addressed in
vestibular rehabilitation protocols. Approximately 40% of people with vestibulopathy do not fully recover and
transition to a state of chronic disability, which often results from reductions in activity and participation, and.
Evidence from rehabilitation science within other populations suggest that return to full activity and participation
is related to functional mobility status, and also several behavioral, personal, and environmental factors.
Similarly, we suspect that cognitive, mood, and personal (confidence, coping, and fear avoidance) factors that
are modifiable, may impact activity and participation in people with vestibulopathy. It is also unknown whether
improvements in activity and participation are related to remediation of impairments following vestibular
rehabilitation. Activity and participation represent important domains to target to optimize outcomes and reduce
chronic disability. This career development award will establish Dr. Brooke Klatt as a clinical scientist with
expertise in 3 primary domains: (1) cohort design and analysis; (2) qualitative methodology, and (3) complex
rehabilitation intervention development and behavioral clinical trial methodology. Dr. Klatt has assembled a
multi-disciplinary team of experts in rehabilitation intervention development and implementation (Jennifer
Brach, PhD, PT and Elizabeth Skidmore, PhD, OTR/L), activity and participation assessment and
epidemiological methods (Andrea Rosso, PhD, MPH), behavioral impacts on vestibular recovery (Jeffrey
Staab, MD), and clinical trial methodology (Megan Hamm, PhD and Charity Patterson, PhD, MSPH). Dr. Klatt
will conduct a series of studies to develop an enhanced vestibular intervention that will augment current
vestibular rehabilitation targeted to improve activity and participation. She will investigate whether impairments
(balance, gait, gaze stability, dizziness, cognition, and mood) as well as personal factors (confidence, coping
skills, and fear avoidance) are related to activity and participation in people with vestibulopathy (Aim 1), and
she will determine if reductions in vestibular impairment is related to improvements in activity and participation
(Aim 2). She will use stakeholder input from clinicians and patients to determine the delivery features that show
the greatest promise for improving activity and participation in people with vestibulopathy (Aim 3). Dr. Klatt’s is
plan to develop effective interventions to enhance current vestibular rehabilitation addresses the NCMRR
research priorities to mitigate acquisition of secondary conditions by using a multimodal approach to promote
vestibular plasticity and sensorimotor function. The proposed training will be the foundation for a future R01
application examining the efficacy of the enhanced vestibular intervention to improve activity and participation

10868448,"Rapid advances in genomic technologies are transforming our understandings of both human
health and human history. These technologies also promise unprecedented power to intervene
on the bodies of individuals with or at risk of disease and even to alter the identities or futures of
individuals not yet born. Such knowledge and power imply immense responsibility to use them
in ways that promote core ethical values, including individual and collective welfare, social
justice, protection of the vulnerable, and respect for both the autonomy of persons and the
interests of communities. Fulfilling these responsibilities requires a diverse, highly trained cadre
of interdisciplinary scholars prepared to engage critically and respectfully with the profound

independent investigators in the field of ELSI research. The program, housed within the
Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the Perelman School of Medicine, will
achieve this goal through three core components: 1) mentored original research leading to high-
impact empirical and conceptual scholarly publications; 2) individualized didactic training
including, when appropriate, a Master of Science in Medical Ethics degree; and 3) intensive
career development preparation. Trainees will participate as fellows for three years. An
outstanding program faculty, consisting of 13 experienced ELSI scholars and mentors with
appointments in departments at the Perelman School of Medicine, the School of Arts and
Sciences, and the Penn Carey Law School, will serve as preceptors to program trainees.
Trainees will present at and participate in the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy’s
monthly works-in-progress and seminar series, attend a wide range of seminars and
conferences across the University focused on genetic medicine and science as well as on
ethics, law, economics and health policy, and present at national meetings. Trainees will also
gain exposure to genetic medicine through shadowing expert geneticists and counselors drawn
from the full spectrum of adult, pediatric and reproductive genetics practice. Finally, trainees will
serve as members of one of the UPenn institutional review boards (IRBs) that review ELSI-
related research. The program will ensure the fullest possible range of discipline and
background among enrolled trainees by extensive targeted outreach to diverse and
underrepresented academic communities."
10868572,"ABSTRACT
Glioblastomas rank among the most lethal of all human cancers. Current standard-of-care therapy for
patients afflicted with glioblastoma offers only palliation. Treatment failure derives from numerous causes,
including the presence of stem-like tumor cells, called glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). GSCs contribute to
radioresistance, chemoresistance, invasion, immune escape, and angiogenesis. Previously, we reported that
critical nodes in methyl donor metabolism and methyl utilization ranked among the most consistently
overexpressed pathways in glioblastoma relative to normal brain. Targeting methyl donor metabolism
expression reduced cellular proliferation, self-renewal, and in vivo tumor growth of GSCs. Thus, methyl donor
metabolism is a promising GSC-specific therapeutic target in glioblastoma that would result in disrupting
oncogenic DNA hypomethylation. In preliminary studies, we have extended our efforts to bridge metabolic
reprogramming in glioblastoma with maintenance of stemness through regulation of epitranscriptomics to
identify metabolic and molecular targets that are preferentially active in GSCs. Leveraging a combination of
genetic and pharmacologic inhibitors, we have identified key regulators that manifests as altered
epitranscriptomic methylation events to maintain GSCs.
In the proposed studies, we will interrogate the functional contributions of selected metabolic enzymes in
oncogenic metabolite production and reprogramming of the tumor cell state to maintain stemness. We will
investigate the metabolic control of cell state through the metabolites generated or lost in GSCs and then
define the specific molecular regulators responsible, including a focus on stemness mediators. In preliminary
studies, we find that altered metabolism in GSCs induces alterations in the post-transcriptional regulation of
mRNAs that shift the RNA profiles towards a stem-like state. We now seek to understand the metabolic and
epitranscriptional regulator underlying these observations to determine the molecular regulation of highly
malignant tumor cell populations and support the development of better therapeutic interventions. Moreover,
epitranscriptomics may serve as a pharmacodynamic measure of selected targeted therapeutics and that
target metabolically regulated epigenetic modulators.
To translate these efforts into proof-of-principle novel preclinical paradigms, we are using agents that target
metabolic targets and epitranscriptomics. These small molecule inhibitors can potentially be combined with
other therapies to create therapeutic paradigms for glioblastoma. To generate the most effective therapeutic
model, we will interrogate the preclinical utility of novel targeted therapies that disrupt the metabolic and
epigenetic reprogramming with potential to accentuate the efficacy of conventional therapy. Collectively, the
proposed studies will lay the foundation for improved understanding of metabolic reprogramming in cancer
stem cell biology with possible translation to improved oncologic care."
10868574,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading global killer among infectious diseases and the leading cause of death among
people with HIV. Among the estimated 9 million TB survivors each year, up to half are left with impaired lung
function and chronic respiratory symptoms. More than four times as many quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)
are lost to post-TB lung disease (PTLD) as are lost to TB mortality. Although there has been growing recognition
of PTLD in recent years, there are no known interventions to prevent or treat this devastating outcome. This
knowledge gap is due in large part to a fundamental lack of data on mechanisms driving PTLD.
 Lung damage from TB is often viewed as an inevitable consequence in those who present “too late;” however,
recent studies by our group and others suggest an alternative paradigm where much of PTLD can be prevented
by giving host-directed therapies during TB treatment. Defining the biological pathways that drive PTLD and the
populations at risk will provide a rare opportunity to address one of the most common global causes of chronic
lung disease in people with and without HIV.
 In the Inflammation and Fibrosis in Pulmonary TB (INFIN-TB) study, we will test the hypothesis that pulmonary
neutrophilic inflammation (Aim 1) and profibrotic activity (Aim 2) occurring early during TB treatment increase
the risk of PTLD. We will enroll a prospective cohort of 250 people, 125 with HIV and 125 without HIV, with newly
diagnosed, drug-susceptible pulmonary TB and will follow them for 12 months, from the time of TB diagnosis
and treatment initiation until 6 months after completion of TB treatment. To ascertain relevant pathophysiology
from the site of disease, we will collect airway samples at multiple time points in addition to comprehensive
measurements of lung function and high-resolution CT scans. For Aim 1, we will determine the association
between sputum levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8, a matrix-degrading enzyme released by
neutrophils, and the risk of PTLD, as measured by formal lung function testing. For Aim 2, we will determine the
association between sputum levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, a master regulator of fibrosis, and
PTLD. Secondary analyses will determine whether HIV modifies the relationship between neutrophilic or
profibrotic activity and PTLD, and will include additional biomarkers of neutrophil and profibrotic activity in both
sputum and exhaled breath condensate, in addition to direct assessment of collagen deposition in the lungs
using a novel collagen-binding PET probe. By focusing on the complementary pathways of neutrophil-mediated
lung damage and profibrotic repair and remodeling, and then connecting activity in those biological pathways to
clinically significant impairments in lung function among TB survivors, this study will be the most comprehensive
study of PTLD to date. The knowledge gained from this study will directly inform future mechanistic and
therapeutic studies with the goal of reducing rates and severity of PTLD and improving long-term outcomes for
millions of TB survivors each year."

Mating is essential for procreation, and it profoundly affects animals’ physiology, behavior, and wellbeing,
particularly in females. Associating mating experience with a valence––either appetitive for a positive stimulus,
or aversive for negative––allows females to adjust their mating strategy and exhibit appropriate behavioral
responses in subsequent encounters. Yet, the molecular and cellular substrates that assign, store, retrieve, and
update mating valence in females are largely unknown.
 I will interrogate how the valence of sexual stimuli is assigned and expressed using the fruit fly, Drosophila
melanogaster, as a model system. I have identified a neural pathway (PLM pathway) that conveys the
mechanosensation of copulation to the brain, where Myoinhibitory peptide is released upon copulation.
Intriguingly, the PLM pathway is required for to develop wild-type valence for mating; thus, the PLM pathway
provides a superb entry point to explore how mating valence is formed and maintained. We have generated and
amassed an unparalleled collection of genetic tools to visualize and manipulate these neurons, and I have
established novel behavioral paradigms to evaluate mating valence in female Drosophila.
 In the proposed study, I aim to delineate the molecular and cellular substrates that underlie the generation
and expression of mating valence in female. I will also explore how an orthogonal experience––social
experience––regulates females’ mating valence. To achieve these goals, I will carry out three complementary
projects that exploit multidisciplinary approaches and cutting-edge tools in molecular genetics, anatomy,
physiology, and behavior. First, we will determine the molecular and cellular pathways that link PLM neurons
with the fly’s primary learning centers, where valence is assigned. Next, by exploiting candidate genes identified
in transcriptome comparison in virgin and mated females, I will elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms
that underlie the dramatic morphological changes of PLM pathway neurons that likely alter female mating latency.
Finally, I will identify genes in the fly’s stress-response pathway that convey pathological social exposure to
modulate females’ mating behavior. Together, these results will substantially advance our understanding of the
molecular and neural pathways that underpin the generation and regulation of females’ mating valence."

 Protein phosphorylation is an essential post-translational modification that plays pivotal roles in the regulation
of protein function, localization, and stability and governs most cellular processes, including cell division.
Phosphorylation by protein kinases, including the master regulators Cdk1, Plk1, Aurora kinase A and Aurora
kinase B, are required to coordinate the functions of a wide array of substrates to promote faithful transit of cells
through mitosis. Indeed, dysregulation of mitotic kinase functions underlies many human diseases such as birth
defects and cancer.
 In particular, the kinase Plk1 promotes mitotic entry by regulating Cdk1/cyclin B activity, centrosome
separation and maturation, as well as spindle assembly. Plk1 is required for the removal of sister chromatid
cohesion and spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) signaling, and fine-tunes microtubule-kinetochore attachment
dynamics. Plk1 also contributes to mitotic exit and cytokinesis by regulating the anaphase promoting
complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and recruiting proteins to the central spindle and the midbody. Example Plk1
substrates that facilitate these functions include docking/scaffolding proteins, motor proteins including kinesins,
structural proteins, proteases, E3 ubiquitin ligases, and other kinases.
 While entry into mitosis is driven by the activation of kinases and a net increase in phosphorylation, dynamic
regulation of phosphorylation levels is needed for mitotic progression and exit. We found that Plk1 inhibits PP6
to promote its own activation. However, PP1 and PP2A-B56 restrain Plk1 activity to silence the SAC. Thus,
complex regulatory interactions between kinases and phosphatases control mitosis.
 Our overarching goals are to identify and uncover the principles that govern phosphorylation signaling in
mitosis as a means to better understand cell division. Specifically, we will focus on the role of Plk1 as an apical
mediator in mitosis and it is regulatory interactions with other kinases and phosphatases. To accomplish this, we
will develop and apply a combination of proteomic, bioinformatic, cell biological and biochemical strategies to
connect kinases to their substrates, investigate substrate function, and uncover new regulatory interactions of
kinases and phosphatases
 Our past studies have enabled us and other researchers to functionally interrogate specific mechanisms that
underlie many biological processes of interest. We are dedicated to sharing our findings with the research
community and will continue to do so as publically available resources."
10866187,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This K01 application is for Sunny C. Lin, PhD, MS, whose research focuses on improving the equity, efficiency,
and effectiveness of health information technology use for adults with Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementias (ADRD). Adults with ADRD account for over 40% of all emergency department (ED) visits among
patients over age 64, and are more likely to experience poorer quality ED care than those without. Adults with
ADRD who are racialized as Black may be especially at risk of experiencing poor quality care due to racial
prejudice, structural racism, and stereotyping. Among older populations, especially those with ADRD, access
to patient data is often critical to providing high quality ED care. However, obtaining reliable data from adults
with ADRD is often difficult or impossible. To fill this gap, many ED providers rely on health information
exchange (HIE) to access patient data. HIE can aid in diagnoses, reduce medication errors, and reduce time
spent in the ED. Moreover, studies have highlighted the potential for HIE to improve racial equity in ADRD care
by reducing physician bias in diagnostic and treatment decisions, increasing access to specialty care, and
identifying social needs. However, prior work has found that HIE efforts are often fragmented by upstream
determinants such as competition and resources, limiting data flows and potentially leading to racial inequities
in data access. There is a critical need for research on racial equity in HIE, especially among adults with
ADRD, a growing and vulnerable patient population. The aim of this proposal is to assess racial equity in HIE
connectivity and use and determine whether HIE is associated with better ED quality for adults with ADRD.
Utilizing two novel and complimentary datasets on adults with ADRD (i.e., Medicare claims and Electronic
Health Record event log data), Dr. Lin will 1) characterize racial disparities in ED quality, 2) identify patterns of
HIE use and its impact on ED process measures of quality, and 3) identify patterns of HIE connectivity and its
impact on ED outcome measures of quality. Dr. Lin’s career goal is to become an independent investigator
and nationally-recognized expert on equity in health information technology. Through this award, Dr. Lin will
achieve the following goals: 1) learn how social systems lead to and reinforce racial inequities in ADRD and
ED care, 2) become familiar with systems science techniques for understanding how racial inequities in
HIE data flows emerge, and 3) gain skills and experience in analyzing EHR event-log data. The proposed
research and training activities are made possible through the resources and expertise housed in Dr. Lin’s
home institution, Washington University in St. Louis, including: the Center for Advancing Health Services,
Policy & Economics Research, the Institute for Informatics, Data Science, and Biostatistics, and the Knight
Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center. Dr. Lin has the support of an exceptional mentorship team composed
of experts in health policy and equity, systems science and EHR event-log analysis, and ADRD and ED care."
10869165,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Liposarcoma (LPS) is the most common type of soft tissue sarcoma. The most common subtypes are well-
differentiated (WDLPS) and dedifferentiated (DDLPS) liposarcoma which are characterized by genomic
amplification of murine double minute 2 (MDM2), a negative regulator of p53, in over 90% of cases, while 7% of
human WD/DDLPS have a p53 mutation. Patients have a high risk of recurrence after surgical resection and
patients with metastatic disease have poor overall survival due to the poor response rates of the systemic
chemotherapy. While immunotherapy has shown tremendous efficacy in solid tumors, research focusing on the
immune biology of sarcoma has been slower than other tumor types. There is an urgent unmet need to
understand the liposarcoma tumor microenvironment (TME) to enable the discovery of new and efficacious
immunotherapeutic approaches for sarcoma patients. Memory T cells play crucial roles in anti-tumor immunity.
Resident memory T cells (TRM) which reside in tumors may be best suited to immunity against cancers growing
in tissues. Our group and others have demonstrated a favorable role of TRM in the TME with associated improved
patient survival across multiple tumor types. Characterization of memory T cells in LPS, and whether TRM are
present and functional, has not been explored. DDLPS patients who had improved progression-free survival in
a phase II trial of treatment with a PD1 inhibitor were found to have the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures
(TLS), an ectopic lymphoid structure that consists of T-cell and B-cell rich regions and other immune populations,
in their tumors. Since PD-1 inhibitors work by blocking this protein on T cells, it is imperative that we understand
how TRM interact within the TLS and TME. In order to mechanistically test this, an in vivo spontaneous
immunocompetent tumor model is necessary since cell-line derived tumors lack the complex tumor evolution
that occurs alongside immune responses. Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) more dependably
mimic the human stoma and tumor microenvironment. Currently, there is no established spontaneous tumor
murine model for liposarcoma. Our first Aim is to validate an AAV8-Ap2.2-eGFP/Cre PTEN f/f p53 f/f C57BL/6
LPS GEMM model and characterize the intratumoral and systemic immune responses. The tumor and immune
characterization in this model will be compared to human data in order to establish the validity of using it as a
preclinical model. Our second Aim is to generate a Cre-inducible MDM2-overexpressing GEMM needed to
model the most common oncogenic drivers reported in human liposarcoma. The successful completion of this
project would highly impact the sarcoma community by providing a necessary model for use in preclinical studies
for the pursuit of novel and effective immunotherapeutics for patients."
10869226,"Abstract
Adolescence is a critical period for the development of a range of mental health conditions in females and
males, particularly those marked by impairments in cognitive control. This research is focused on adolescent
maturation of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) circuit, which is functionally linked to motivation, reward,
and cognitive control. A unique feature of adolescent development of this circuit is the long-distance outgrowth
of ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA axons from their prepubertal location in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) to
the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), thereby strengthening connectivity between subcortical and cortical
regions regulating cognitive control. The adolescent outgrowth of axons from the NAc to the mPFC coincides
with the pubertal rise in gonadal steroid hormones, primarily estrogen in females and testosterone in males.
Both hormones organize the nervous system during critical periods of development, including adolescence,
resulting in structural and functional sex differences. The proposed studies will test the hypotheses that: Aim 1)
gonadal hormones program the adolescent outgrowth of dopaminergic axons from the NAc to the mPFC; and
Aim 2) adolescence is a sensitive period for hormone-dependent organization of the mesocorticolimbic circuit.
A unique combination of virally mediated tract tracing techniques will be used to identify the synaptic
varicosities of VTA neurons that extend their axons from the NAc to the mPFC during adolescence in female
and male rats that either do or do not experience gonadal hormones during adolescence. The first hypothesis
predicts that prepubertal gonadectomy will result in reduced DA innervation of the mPFC in both females and
males and that hormone replacement (estrogen in females, testosterone in males) during adolescence will
restore innervation. The second hypothesis predicts that hormone replacement in prepubertally
gonadectomized rats in adulthood will not restore DA innervation of the mPFC. Because these exploratory
studies predict hormonal effects in both females (estrogen) and males (testosterone), analyses will focus on
within-sex comparisons of hormone status during adolescence or adulthood, rather than sex differences. This
research will advance fundamental understanding of the developmental plasticity of the mesocorticolimbic
dopamine circuit and how it is influenced by gonadal hormones in females and males. It will reveal not only
how typical maturation occurs and within what developmental window(s) it can occur, but also how it can go
awry (e.g., atypical timing of puberty onset). Knowing how typical maturation can go awry will provide novel
insights into the developmental processes during puberty and adolescence that could lead to the emergence of
psychopathology marked by deficits in cognitive control."
10871515,"This is a project to study to a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor
(AHRR) gene that may influence the lung cancer risk of Black/African American (B/AA) subjects. AHRR is a
negative regulator of detoxification responses involved in the metabolism and elimination of tobacco smoke
carcinogens. B/AA men have the highest rate of lung cancer death compared to all other groups; they show a
12% higher lung cancer incidence rate and a 15% higher lung cancer death rate than White/European (W/E)
men. Elevated AHRR expression has been implicated in lung cancer risk; thus, a SNP that improves AHRR
function would likely increase lung cancer risk. We have identified a missense SNP, rs35008248, in AHRR exon
4 that, while rare in W/E subjects, is present one third of B/AA subjects. The SNP was not included in most
previously used arrays and has only recently begun to be studied. Preliminary data from GWAS explorer shows
no significant associations in W/E subjects but suggests an association with smoking in B/AA males (p=3.87E-
3) and with smoking-related cancers in B/AA subjects (p=0.04927). As B/AA individuals comprise only a small
fraction of the subjects (<4%), power to determine the role of SNPs in this group has been limited. AHRR is a
negative regulator of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Upon tobacco smoke exposure, AHR binds to
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, enters the nucleus, and dimerizes with ARNT. The AHR/ARNT dimer binds to
xenobiotic response elements (XREs), switching on genes involved in the inactivation/secretion of xenobiotic
compounds. In a negative regulatory loop, AHR/ARNT turns on AHRR, which also binds to ARNT. The
transcriptionally inactive AHRR/ARNT complex competes with AHR/ARNT for XRE sites, dampening the
detoxification response. The reference allele of rs35008248 (T) encodes a leucine at position 114, while the
alternate allele (C) encodes a turn-inducing proline. Combined annotation-dependent depletion (CADD)
suggests the SNP might affect AHRR function. In the co-crystal structure of the AHRR/ARNT heterodimer,
leucine 114 borders a loop entwining ARNT. We hypothesize that a proline at position 114 constrains AHRR
loop conformation, thereby stabilizing AHRR/ARNT interaction, increasing the repressive effect of AHRR/ARNT
heterodimers, interfering with the detoxification response, and increasing lung cancer risk of B/AA smokers,
34% of whom carry the minor allele. Here we propose to test for associations between genetic variation at
AHRR with lung cancer outcomes using existing large-scale genetic data in B/AA individuals (Aim 1), to use
CRISPR-based genome editing to engineer the minor allele into the genome of our unique immortalized human
alveolar epithelial cell lines and assess its effects on the response to tobacco smoke in vitro (Aim 2), and to test
whether the amino acid at position 114 affects the kinetics of the interaction between AHRR and ARNT (Aim
3).Together, the specific aims of this pilot project will provide insight into the role of a potential functional SNP in
AHRR that is common in B/AA subjects and that could help explain their increased lung cancer risk."

Individuals with Down syndrome (DS), the genetic condition caused by trisomy 21 (T21), display widespread
auditory dysfunction, with current estimates indicating that ~80% of this population may have one or more forms
of hearing loss. Despite the obvious importance of hearing for neurodevelopment, speech development, learning,
cognition, social integration, inclusion in the workforce, and overall well-being, the mechanisms by which an
extra copy of chromosome 21 causes hearing loss are unknown. Therefore, additional research in this area has
potential for transformative discoveries that could improve multiple dimensions of development, health, and
quality of life in this population. To fulfill this unmet need and transform the field, we have assembled a multi-
disciplinary team of synergistic expertise to develop the following Specific Aims:
1. To complete deep phenotyping of peripheral auditory and vestibular function in DS. We will complete a
deep characterization of auditory and vestibular function in a cohort of 300 participants via behavioral and
physiologic assessments including air and bone conduction behavioral audiometry, otoacoustic emissions,
standard tympanometry, wideband acoustic immittance, and auditory brainstem response testing. We will also
administer a battery of vestibular function assessments and complete a detailed annotation of health histories,
with an emphasis on co-occurring conditions and previous use of ototoxic medicines.
2. To identify dysregulated biological processes underlying hearing loss in DS. Paired to efforts in Aim 1,
we will collect biospecimens, including blood samples and nasopharyngeal swabs, to complete both hypothesis-
driven and hypotheses-generating analyses of underlying mechanisms, including analyses of the transcriptome,
proteome, metabolome, neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation markers, and variations in the microbiome.
These datasets will enable the identification of novel biosignatures associated with different etiologies of hearing
loss and vestibular deficits.
3. To define cause-effect relationships between gene triplication and hearing loss in a mouse model. We
will complete deep phenotyping of hearing loss in a mouse model of DS that displays this phenotype, including
imaging studies to monitor for structural differences, wideband acoustic immittance measurements, distortion
product otoacoustic emissions, tests of vestibular function, and measurements of otitis media. These studies will
be complemented by assays not possible or very difficult in humans, such as single cell transcriptomics and
cochlear endolymphatic potentials. Lastly, we will define the preclinical value of potential pharmacological
interventions and narrow down the genomic region(s) driving hearing loss in mice.
Funding of this proposal will enable a multidisciplinary team of experts to address a major knowledge gap in the
field, with clear potential for transformative discoveries that would benefit those with DS."
10873345,"Project Summary/Abstract
Network models are increasingly invoked to characterize the neurobiological underpinnings of mental illnesses.
Dysfunction within specific circuits promotes the formation of specific symptoms. This suggests an opportunity
to treat specific symptoms by modulating specific circuits. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)
is capable of circuit-specific neuromodulation. It is also an established treatment for Major Depressive Disorder
(MDD). Clinical experience suggests that rTMS treats different symptom constructs by stimulating different
circuits. However, there remains a critical lack of mechanistic evidence to support putative network
mechanisms of rTMS, limiting its ability to treat patients with more personalized and optimized approaches.
This mechanistic proposal will first use resting-state functional connectivity (FC) MRI and customized analytic
pipelines to characterize functional network topography in healthy and depressed individuals at high resolution.
This data will be used to derive rTMS targets functionally situated in discrete prefrontal networks (e.g., control,
default, salience, limbic/reward). Next, patients will take part in a within-subject design in which they undergo
rTMS to each target on separate days. Each target will be stimulated four times on a given day, and after each
stimulation changes will be measured with: (1) REST-BOLD MRI (to assess FC changes), (2) TASK-BOLD
MRI (to assess changes in BOLD activation on paradigms validated to test RDoC constructs), (3) state-based
questionnaires or (4) neuropsychological tests. This work will facilitate individualized neuromodulation
approaches based on network topography. This will pollinate large-scale clinical trials assessing the effects of
differential circuit modulation. It will also illuminate circuit-construct relationships across neuropsychiatric
disorders."
10871594,"Survivors of childhood cancer treated with anthracycline chemotherapy or chest-directed radiation are at
substantially increased risk for developing cardiomyopathy that progresses to heart failure (HF). Compared to
the general population, survivors have a 15-fold greater risk of HF and 7-fold excess risk of death due to
cardiovascular (CV) causes. Within this vulnerable clinical population, African American (AA) survivors face a
disproportionate burden of cardiac morbidity and mortality, largely driven by the higher burden of potentiating
CV risk factors and cardiomyopathy. In our recent work, we found the prevalence of cardiomyopathy was 2.5-
times higher among AA survivors than Non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). However, existing survivor-directed HF
risk prediction models are not race-specific. Given effective strategies to identify/detect cardiomyopathy and
prevent HF in survivors are likely to differ by race/ethnicity, we hypothesize that novel race-specific
cardiomyopathy risk prediction models developed and validated exclusively in AA survivor cohorts will
significantly enhance clinical risk stratification in this population. Using data from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort
(SJLIFE) with up to 1,200 AA survivors that is unprecedented in terms of its size and extent of clinical
characterization, we propose to: (a) perform a first-of-its-kind analysis to systematically identify influential
predictors and develop (“train”) new cardiomyopathy risk algorithms in 700 AA survivors with existing deep
clinical annotation from direct, in-person assessment and whole-genome/-exome sequencing data; and (b)
validate (“test”) these novel risk models in independent SJLIFE AA survivor data (N~481). Our specific aims are
to: (1) develop and independently validate clinical risk prediction models for cardiomyopathy for AA survivors
considering primary cancer treatments and conventional CV risk factors, followed by incremental model-building
to include informative cardiac biomarker, lifestyle risk, and personal-/area-/policy-level social determinants of
health (SDOH) predictors; (2) identify genetic predictors for cardiomyopathy and evaluate their added
contributions to clinical risk prediction; and (3) contextualize the performance of these novel models, including a
generalizability assessment in existing independent data from AA survivors in multi-institutional studies (N=349)
and comparative analyses considering published/validated HF risk models. Along with a race-specific study
design, key innovations of our approach include the comprehensive assessment of predictors that have not been
evaluated previously in survivor HF risk prediction models (e.g., cardiac biomarkers; personal-/area-/policy-level
SDOH) and novel utilization of genetic data that can potentially maximize cardiomyopathy risk prediction,
including genetic analyses of echocardiographic parameters predictive of cardiomyopathy and the development
of polygenic risk scores that capture genetic susceptibility for treatment-related cardiomyopathy risk. Ultimately,
achieving these aims have the potential to advance precision survivorship care while contributing to efforts to
reduce racial/ethnic disparities in cardiac-related morbidity/mortality among childhood cancer survivors."
10878331,"Project Summary
Zika virus (ZIKV) causes congenital ZIKV syndrome in infants exposed in utero following maternal ZIKV
infection via mosquito bite or sexual transmission during pregnancy. It is estimated that 3-23% of ZIKV cases
are due to sexual transmission. More than half of ZIKV-infected men shed ZIKV in semen, and some men shed
ZIKV in semen for up to 6 months post-disease onset. In human semen, ZIKV infects several cell types
including epithelial cells and immune cells. Using a mouse model, infection of epididymis epithelial cells has
been shown to be critical for acute ZIKV shedding in semen. The role of immune cells in ZIKV shedding in
semen is unknown, though we detected persistent ZIKV infection within the epididymal lumen, rather than the
epididymis epithelium, suggesting immune cells may be critical for persistent ZIKV shedding. The most closely
related virus to ZIKV, Spondweni virus (SPOV), is poorly shed in semen despite dissemination to the male
reproductive tract. ZIKV containing the prM/E structural genes from SPOV is shed in semen at significantly
lower levels during acute infection. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms of ZIKV
shedding in semen and sexual transmission. The objectives of this study are to identify the viral factors and cell
types that contribute to acute and persistent viral shedding in semen. The hypothesis is that ZIKV shedding in
semen is driven by viral structural genes and persistent infection of immune cells in the male reproductive tract.
Two specific aims will address this hypothesis: 1) Determine the role of viral structural genes in acute ZIKV
shedding in semen; and 2) Determine the role of immune cells in persistent ZIKV shedding in semen. In the
first aim, we will use our reverse genetics system to generate a reverse genetics system for SPOV and a
chimera containing ZIKV prM/E structural genes within SPOV. Viruses will be used to infect male mice, and
viral shedding in ejaculates will be measured. Cell types differentially infected within the epididymis epithelium
will be identified. In the second aim, macrophages will be depleted from ZIKV-infected mice during acute and
persistent infection. Viral shedding in semen and infection of the epididymis will be measured. The research
proposed here is innovative because it assesses ejaculates, which are biologically relevant samples for sexual
transmission, and a novel role for immune cells in ZIKV sexual transmission. Upon successful completion of
the proposed research, the anticipated contribution of this work will be the identification of the flavivirus factors
that dictate viral shedding in semen and the cell types that contribute to viral shedding in semen. This
contribution is expected to be significant because it will increase our understanding of how viruses are sexually
transmitted."
10881686,"I have been studying prostaglandins and other lipid-derived mediators that regulate
renal function for a long time. Over the years, we have defined the role of COX-
2/mPGES-1/PGE2-mediated prostaglandin pathway, nuclear receptors PPARgamma
and liver X receptor, and nitro-oleic acid in renal health and disease. Our recent work
has demonstrated an important interplay between the lipid mediators and (pro)renin
receptor-mediated intrarenal renin-angiotensin system after the demonstration that renal
PRR and intrarenal renin are under the control of COX-2/EP4 pathway. Our results
suggest that (pro)renin receptor serves as a common downstream pathway leading to
fine-tuning urinary Na+ and water excretion and long-term control of blood pressure. The
seminal discoveries include the following: 1) activation of PRR with prorenin but not
renin stimulates epithelial Na+ channel, 2) PRR controls the in vivo renin activity, ENaC
and aquaporin- 2 expression in the collecting duct, 3) deletion of collecting duct PRR
results in diabetes insipidus and downregulation of aqoporine-2, 4) soluble PRR (sPRR)
stimulates renal aquoporine-2 and urine concentrating capability, and 5) site-1 protease
(S1P) but not furin or ADAM19 contributes to the generation of sPRR. During the past 5
years, we have published 22 papers on this topic in highly prestigious journals such as
PNAS, JASN, Hypertension, etc. In 2016, I was selected to deliver Lewis K. Dahl
Memorial Lecture at the Council on Hypertension in Orlando. My research program has
been well funded by extramural grants. During this reporting period, I have received
multiple NIH RO-1 grants and a Merit Review Award with total costs exceeding $10M.
The recent submission of the renewal application of the Merit Award has been selected
for funding. I have published a total of 161 peer-reviewed articles and delivered more
than 100 lectures all over the world. Our work is highly relevant to the VA mission since
a significant number of veterans are affected by hypertension and renal disease for
which PRR is believed to play a major role and may serve as a novel target for new
drug development. Importantly, my research has high translational potential in the areas
of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and metabolic disease. I have developed multiple
technologies at various stages from preclinical evaluation to Phase II clinical trial for
treatment of these diseases. So far, I holds 5 patents with 3 on the use of nitro-oleic
acid for the treatment of CKD and metabolic disease and 1 on the similar therapeutic
use of sPRR. The nitro-oleic acid technology was licensed to Complexa, Inc, a biotech
company that has successfully completed multiple Phase I clinical trials on nitro-oleic
acid (commercialized as CXA-10), raised $100 million, and launched a Phase II clinical
trial with CXA-10 in 2018. A second technology related to the development of a
recombinant soluble PRR as an insulin-sensitizing agent is currently under preclinical
evaluation. Novo Nordisk has expressed strong interest in this technology and is
performing internal validations. Recently, the mid-term progress report for my RCS was
rated excellent with the scores of 1.25 from primary reviewer and 1.1 from the
secondary reviewer."
10890037,"ABSTRACT
Nanomedicine provides new opportunities to solve medical problems that were previously perceived as
unsolvable by clinicians. One such problem is drug resistance in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).
Attempts to overcome the resistance using small molecule inhibitors have failed to restore the drug sensitivity.
Alternative compensation survival pathways emerge to allow the regrowth of the tumor. To abate the tumor
growth, we need to suppress more than one survival pathway with minimal or no side effects. Nanoparticles
possess the ability to selectively and simultaneously arrest multiple survival pathways to control the growth of
the tumor. However, nanoparticles to co-knockdown multiple cross-linked survival pathways have not been
explored yet. We recently identified two targets AXL and FN14 and demonstrated that the cross-talk between
these markers is responsible for resistance in EGFR mutant NSCLC. Subsequently, we designed nanoparticles
to simultaneously co-knockdown both AXL and FN14 in the tumor, disrupted the cross-talk, and successfully
overcame drug resistance in murine models. The logical next step is to validate the findings in clinically relevant
animal models and patient samples. It is equally important to optimize the size of nanoparticles further to
maximize deep tumor delivery with favorable in vivo characteristics. Therefore, in this proposal, we will
synthesize different sizes of NP, understand their ability to penetrate deep inside the tumor to fully restore drug
sensitivity for a long-lasting therapeutic response. We will use patient tissues, patient-derived organoids, drug-
resistant cell lines, orthotopic animal models, and patient-derived xenografts to establish the efficacy of the
nanoplatform. The data will validate our new nanoparticle platform, as a promising strategy to combat drug
resistance in NSCLC and catalyze clinical trials in the future."
10890126,"Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor. After surgery, radiation and
chemotherapy, five-year survival is 60-70% overall. Survivors show severe physical and cognitive disabilities,
often unable to live independently. Medulloblastoma exists in four distinct molecular subgroups (WNT, SHH,
Group3, Group 4). An incurable subgroup of SHH driven tumors show amplification of the MYCN transcription
factor. How can we target N-myc in medulloblastoma? N-myc’s ability to regulate protein synthesis is tied both
to its oncogenic potential and to interactions with the mTOR serine-threonine kinase. We hypothesize that N-
myc hijacks the translational machinery regulated by the mTOR serine threonine kinase to drive transformation;
and that targeting translation control represents a therapeutic strategy for N-myc driven cancers. Employing
ribosome profiling technology, we surprisingly found that in addition to roles as a global regulator of protein
synthesis, N-myc interacts with mTOR to regulate translation of 13 mRNAs belonging to the folding machinery,
functionally important for N-myc driven medulloblastoma. The mechanisms by which N-myc directs the
translation of these specific subsets of mRNAs to drive tumorigenesis and whether these potential vulnerabilities
can be leveraged to develop targeted therapies remain outstanding questions. In this proposal, we will
mechanistically dissect how N-myc hijacks the translational machinery for its oncogenic activity. Using novel
genetic approaches, we will separately evaluate the importance of eIF4E and eIF4A in our N-myc driven
genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models. We will also test new clinical drugs against eIF4A and eIF4E,
analyzing GEM models, and patient derived orthotopic xenografts. Successful completion of these aims will
delineate how N-myc interacts with mTOR to regulate key subsets of translational targets, and elucidates
druggable mechanisms in N-myc driven medulloblastoma."

Tissue diagnosis is essential for cancer care and research, and addressing HIV-related malignancies in Malawi
and South Africa will be critically dependent on ensuring reliable access to robust pathology services.
Achieving this requires strategic and multidisciplinary coordination of human and material resources for
diagnostic pathology over time, as well as across geographic sites and scientific projects. This is a difficult
undertaking even in high-income countries, and logistical challenges are significantly amplified in low- and
middle-income countries. Initiatives to improve cancer care and research in SSA require accurate, cost-
effective, and data-driven approaches to tissue acquisition and diagnosis, and strong regional pathology
networks are an essential foundation to ultimately improve patient outcomes and conduct impactful research.
Recognizing this, the UNC-Malawi-South Africa Cancer Consortium (UMSACC) will establish a shared-
resource Pathology Core. The core will comprise of investigators from UNC Chapel Hill, UNC Project-Malawi
and Kamuzu Central Hospital in Malawi, the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa and Stellenbosch
University, South Africa. The Pathology core will provide advanced and comprehensive diagnostic support to
the multi-institutional research projects in this proposal through development of a central pathology review

10891626,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The gut microbiome comprises hundreds of microbial species that inhabit the human gastrointestinal tract and
impact host health in a myriad of ways. Diverse microbes coexist in the gut by specializing in distinct
colonization strategies which collectively give rise to a complex microbial ecosystem with emergent functional
properties. Despite the critical nature of the specialized ecological roles in explaining the composition and
function of the microbiome, colonization strategies employed by the majority of gut microbes remains poorly
defined. The proposed research will take two approaches to broadly assign colonization strategies to diverse
gut microbes. A first part of the proposed project will employ comparative genome analyses to determine the
distribution of established microbial functions across the gut microbiome and to guide the discovery of novel
colonization strategies. A second part of the project will utilize unbiased growth assays to identify members of
the microbial community adapted for diverse colonization strategies. The molecular basis of identified
colonization strategies will be further interrogated through the application of genetic and biochemical
approaches. By assigning ecological context to diverse members of the gut microbiota, these studies will
advance a basic understanding of the gut ecosystem that could benefit the development of diagnostic and
therapeutic microbiome-based technologies."
10893342,"Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor T (PTPRT) is frequently mutated in human cancers, including colorectal
cancer. PTPRT has two tyrosine phosphatase domains. While the membrane-proximal domain is an active
protein tyrosine phosphatase, it has been thought that the C-terminal domain is a pseudo-phosphatase lacking
enzymatic activity. Our preliminary data demonstrated that the pseudo-phosphatase domain of PTPRT is an
active enzyme, termed denitrase, that removes nitro-groups (NO₂ at the 3-carbon position of the phenol ring of
tyrosine) from the Y333 residue in ERK and Y404 residue paxillin. We demonstrated that nitro-Y333 (nY333) Erk
increases its kinase activity, whereas nitro-Y404 (nY404) paxillin is likely to transduce cell signal through a
“reader” (nY binding protein). Further, we generated denitrase-inactivating mutant knockin mice and showed that
the mutant mice are susceptible to carcinogen-induced colon tumor development. Recently, several recent
bioinformatics studies demonstrated that PTPRT mutations, including those in the denitrase domain, are
enriched in metastatic colorectal cancers, suggesting that inactivation of PTPRT denitrase promotes tumor
metastasis. Thus, we hypothesize that the PTPRT-regulated ERK and paxillin nitration signaling pathways play
a critical role in colorectal progression and metastasis. Three aims are proposed to test this central hypothesis
by determining the role of: (1) PTPRT denitrase-regulated paxillin nitration signaling in colorectal cancer
progression and invasion; and (2) PTPRT denitrase-regulated Erk nitration signaling in colorectal cancer
progression and metastasis. Protein tyrosine nitration is currently believed to be a byproduct of reactive
oxygen/nitrogen species and not regulated by enzymes. Success in our proposed studies will establish protein
tyrosine nitration as a critical player in colorectal tumor progression and metastasis."
10893424,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In this proposal, we will develop new images modes on the QT Ultrasound® tomographic breast scanner and
demonstrate that the scanner with the new image modes can accurately identify the response of breast cancer
patients to chemotherapy. A poorly met clinical need in breast cancer therapy is providing inexpensive and
accurate ways to identify patient responses to chemotherapy early during the course of therapy. For many breast
cancers, lack of patient response to initial therapy is predictive of poor outcome, whereas pathological complete
response strongly correlates with extended survival. Conventional clinical surrogates of response based on
anatomical information such as physical assessments, mammography and standard clinical ultrasound provide
poor early assessments of treatment response. We demonstrated that quantitative analysis of ultrasound
backscatter (QUSB) using conventional hand-held clinical scanners can provide promising metrics of response
of breast cancer to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC/AC) within one week of therapy initiation. These QUSB
results would benefit greatly from improved volumetric accuracy that conventional scanning platforms do not
support, such as transmission and attenuation losses in the signals.
 We propose to solve these issues by integrating QUSB with the newly available QT Ultrasound® breast
scanner. This FDA cleared and marketed scanner delivers 3D quantitative images of the breast including sound
speed, (SOS) reflectivity (R) and attenuation (A) values. The QT Ultrasound® breast scanner corrects refractive
and interface attenuation losses. It also provides compounding of multiple angles of view that will further improve
QUSB variance. The scanner’s parameters of SOS, R, A, and mm3 volume measuring accuracy provide
supplementary quantitative features likely to contribute robustness to early identification of response.
 We believe that the QUSB+QT Ultrasound® breast scanner can identify response at a level better than MRI.
Even if response identification is only comparable, QUSB+QT Ultrasound® savings in costs, ease of use,
noninvasive native contrast, and patient acceptance would markedly simplify management of breast cancer
therapy and deliver considerable practical advantage and increased accuracy. Therefore, our scientific premise
is that QUSB integrated on the QT Ultrasound® breast scanner will provide improved identification of early
response of breast cancer patients to NAC. Our preliminary data demonstrate that QUSB techniques can identify
nonresponders and predict patient outcomes. Our preliminary results also demonstrate that QUSB techniques
integrate with the QT Ultrasound® platform and benefit from improved QUSB bias and variance. Therefore, the
proposal consists of three aims. The first specific aim is to implement, test and validate QUSB techniques on the
latest QT Ultrasound® breast scanner for clinical data acquisition. The second specific aim is to quantify the
capacity of QUSB+QT Ultrasound® quantitative data to identify nonresponders. The final specific aim is to
quantify the capacity of QUSB+QT Ultrasound® quantitative data to predict patient outcomes."
10893433,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Poor access and insufficient patient education regarding OAB chronicity, expected outcomes, costs, and
potential side effects lead to unrealistic patient perceptions about therapy and suboptimal therapy duration,
particularly in vulnerable populations. This thus leads to poor treatment access, adherence, and
undertreatment. My long-term goal is to develop as an independently funded investigator and international
leader who will pioneer interventions that improve OAB therapy access, adherence and outcomes, thereby
reducing the burden of this chronic condition. The overall objective for this K23 proposal is to design an
innovative, stakeholder-informed strategy that incorporates barriers to treatment (such as social determinants
of health) and improves patient access to therapy options and therapy adherence. The central hypothesis is
that unmet patient expectations and knowledge due to lack of access and suboptimal provider-to-patient OAB
healthcare delivery are a barrier to treatment adherence. This central hypothesis will be tested pursuing two
specific aims: 1. Evaluate an adapted UI mobile health tool for use in a diverse, multicultural population of
women with OAB and identify barriers and facilitators to access, treatment adherence and engagement from
multiple key stakeholders. 2. Conduct a pilot study to evaluate the usability and feasibility of using a mobile
health tool to improve OAB knowledge, engagement and treatment plan adherence in a diverse group of
women with OAB. The rationale for the proposed research is that its completion is expected to provide a strong
evidence-based framework for the continued development and future implementation of cost-effective,
evidence-based interventions to improve OAB therapy access and adherence. Combined these results are
expected to have an important positive impact by positioning me to submit a competitive R01 application
proposing a randomized controlled efficacy trial for improving therapy access, adherence, and OAB outcomes
during the fourth year of this award."
10893440,"Abstract
 Frontonasal dysplasia (FND), also known as median cleft face syndrome, is a major class of craniofacial
birth defects that profoundly impact the form and function of the face. FND patients require multiple corrective
surgeries and often suffer life-long impairment. Whilst most FND cases occur sporadically with unknown
etiology, loss-of-function mutations in each of the three ALX family genes, ALX1, ALX3, and ALX4, have been
identified as the genetic causes for autosomal recessive FND, with disruption of ALX1 associated with severe
facial clefting and extreme microphthalmia in FND3 patients while mutations in ALX3 and ALX4 resulted in
milder but clinically distinctive frontonasal malformations. Little is known about how ALX transcription factors
regulate craniofacial development, and the overall molecular mechanism controlling frontonasal development
is poorly understood. In preliminary studies, we have generated Alx1 mutant mice using CRISPR-mediated
genome editing and found that they recapitulated the FND3 phenotypes, including reduced frontonasal bones
and cartilages, cleft palate, and microphthalmia. We found that Alx1-/- embryos exhibited ectopic neuroglial
differentiation and reduction in ectomesenchymal gene expression in the frontonasal prominence. Moreover,
Alx1-/-Alx4-/- double mutant mouse embryos exhibited increased ectopic cranial ganglia and much severer
frontonasal deficiency than Alx1-/- mutants. Previous studies in multiple animal model systems revealed that
the Twist1 transcription factor, whose expression is activated in cranial neural crest cells at the onset of
migration, is critical for ectomesenchyme specification. Remarkably, while the molecular mechanism acting
downstream of Twist1 in promoting ectomesenchymal fate is still unclear, Twist1-/- mouse embryos failed to
activate the expression of all three Alx genes in cranial neural crest cells. Our finding of ectopic neuroglial
differentiation in the frontonasal regions of Alx1-/- and Alx1-/-Alx4-/- embryos suggests that Twist1 and the ALX
transcription factors act in the same molecular network to regulate cranial neural crest fate determination
between the ectomesenchymal and neuroglial lineages. The specific aims of this research project are to
determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating ALX transcription factor function in frontonasal
development and to unravel and reconstruct the gene regulatory network consisting of Twist1 and ALX
transcription factors regulating cranial neural crest differentiation. Results from these studies will fill a
longstanding critical gap in craniofacial developmental biology and lead to new improvements in molecular
diagnosis and treatment/care of a large number of craniofacial disorders."
10885289,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
In the face of a changing climate, there exists an urgent need to study the effects of the summertime home
thermal environment on the health and wellbeing of low-income older adults. We recently developed a platform
for continuous measurements of home thermal environment and daily measurements of sleep, gait, and
subjective wellbeing—all of which are either directly or indirectly influenced by thermal environment. Our first
aim is to determine cohort-level relationships between ambient temperature and outcomes related to sleep,
gait, and comfort, and examine the extent to which these relationships vary at the individual level. Our second
aim is to explore frailty and sex as potential effect modifiers of the relationships between home ambient
temperature and outcomes related to sleep, gait, and well-being in older adults living in subsidized housing.
Both aims will be completed by continuously measuring the home thermal environment of 50 low-income older
adults living in subsidized housing facilities in Boston for four summertime months. Participants will use a
validated wearable device to measure outcomes related to sleep, complete periodic smartphone-based
assessments of gait, and complete daily questionnaires to report their present subjective comfort. The
proposed study will establish that the home thermal environment has a substantial impact on health and
wellbeing of low-income older adults and will enable us to develop clinical interventions, public health
measures, and engineering solutions that minimize the impacts of hot weather on this vulnerable population.
The career development plan builds upon the applicant’s knowledge about the built environment and helps him
1) advance his clinical and practical knowledge of the effects of aging and age-related conditions (e.g., frailty)
on physiology and system function, especially as they relate to sensitivity of sleep, physical function, and other
meaningful patient-reported outcomes to environmental factors; 2) Gain experience in the conduct of research
involving low-income and/or underserved older adults and understand their specific needs; 3) Gain statistical,
professional, and leadership skills to develop and lead an independent research program focused on aging
and the built environment. The applicant will be working within a well-funded infrastructure that provides the
resources of numerous NIH- and foundation-funded grants. The resources available at the Marcus Institute for
Aging Research provide the intellectual expertise and support needed to conduct long-term at-home
monitoring of older adults, subject recruitment, and statistical analysis that are needed for the successful
completion of Aims. Additionally, Harvard Medical School provides numerous resources for career
development, including career development seminars and counseling, grant-writing courses, the scientific
cores of Clinical Translational Science Center (Harvard Catalyst); one of the world’s largest medical libraries,
and opportunities to apply for pilot grants and special courses to enable junior faculty to expand their expertise."
10885368,"The overall objective of this K01 is to propel the continued upward trajectory of the career development of Dr.
Rahemi as an independent researcher. Her research focus is on decision making for persons with Alzheimer’s
disease and related dementias (ADRD) and their caregivers and the role of advance care planning (ACP), us-
ing large datasets and data science. This K01 will position her to achieve her career goal of supporting ADRD-
related decision making for end-of-life care in racial minority populations. Research: The specific aims are 1) to
identify variation across racial/ethnic groups and cognitive function levels in the relationship between ACP and
healthcare use and 2) to describe predictors of caregivers’ perception of patient care quality. To address these
aims, she will obtain training in data science, including advanced statistics, explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI), and state-of-the-science ADRD and aging. The Health and Retirement Study (HRS), including HRS
post-mortem proxy interviews and HRS-linked Medicare data, will be used. This project will provide evidence
on nuanced interactions between a mix of variables and racial disparities in end-of-life care for minority older
adults with or at risk of ADRD and their caregivers—groups vastly overlooked in end-of-life research. Candi-
date: Dr. Rahemi is an Assistant Professor of Nursing at Clemson University. She has substantial training in
quantitative research using secondary data analytic approaches (e.g., HRS dataset analyses and training) to
investigate ACP and healthcare use among minority and ADRD populations. Building upon her Carolina Center
on Alzheimer’s Disease and Minority Research pilot project using HRS data, this K will allow her to model com-
plex determinants of racial disparities in ACP and end-of-life care. Two training goals will support her success
in becoming an independent researcher: 1) develop expertise in state-of-the-science on aging, ADRD, and
ACP and 2) gain skills in advanced statistics, XAI, and secondary analysis of large datasets in interdisciplinary
aging research. Mentors/Environment: This career development plan includes experiential and hands-on re-
search training on related projects led by Dr.s Demiris and Jarrín. Dr. Rahemi and her mentors have developed
a 3-pronged strategy to address her career goals and training needs: 1) a robust and interdisciplinary team of
mentors and collaborators who will guide her research and career development; 2) an innovative research pro-
ject integrated with her training goals that are scientifically relevant and rigorous; 3) an assembly of course-
work, workshops, and seminars offered by artificial intelligence (AI) programs, the Alzheimer's Association In-
terdisciplinary Summer Research Institute, the National Institute on Aging, and the Hartford Institutes for Geri-
atric Nursing, complemented by professional interactions that build upon existing resources at Clemson Uni-
versity and affiliated institutes. This project will provide training, mentorship, and research experiences founda-
tional to Dr. Rahemi’s career development as an independent investigator improving ACP and eliminating dis-
parities in end-of-life care among racial/ethnic minority older adults living with ADRD and their caregivers."
10887620,"SUMMARY
Stressful and traumatic experiences can contribute to mood disorders in some individuals while others are
resilient to this process, and pharmacological tools for treating major depression (MDD) are effective on only a
subset of patients. Moreover, MDD affects women nearly twice as often as men, but the neurobiological
underpinnings of this discrepancy are unclear. Over the past five years of the current funded project, we
demonstrated that lower excitability of ventral hippocampal glutamatergic projections to nucleus accumbens
(vHPC-NAc) drives increased resilience to stress-induced anhedonia in male mice compared to females, and
that this effect is caused directly by testosterone in males. However, the mechanisms by which testosterone
regulates excitability of the vHPC-NAc remain unknown. Testosterone produces many of its effects through
activation of the androgen receptor (AR) which can alter cell function through signaling cascades in the cytosol
or through directly binding to DNA and altering gene expression. We have shown that vHPC-NAc neurons
produce AR and respond to AR antagonists, and our preliminary data show that eliminating AR in vHPC-NAc
neurons increases excitability. This leads to our overarching hypothesis for years 6-10: that testosterone
activation of ARs in vHPC-NAc decreases excitability through changes in gene expression to drive behavioral
resilience to stress. This is significant, as identification of AR targets/mechanisms driving resilience may generate
novel therapeutic strategies that would be particularly beneficial in females, an unmet need due to the sexual
disparity in mood disorders. We will address this using three specific aims: 1) Uncover the mechanisms of
testosterone-driven reduction in vHPC-NAc excitability using novel transgenic mice and classical pharmacology;
2) Uncover the mechanisms of testosterone-driven resilience to stress using novel mouse lines and a circuit-
specific intersection dual viral vector approach; and 3) Determine circuit-specific gene expression driven by sex,
testosterone, and the androgen receptor using translating ribosome affinity purification. Given the established
role of vHPC circuitry in emotional regulation, the gene expression studies proposed here will meaningfully
impact basic psychiatric research and may elucidate novel treatment strategies for psychiatric disorders that
could be particularly beneficial to female patients. Moreover, our understanding of basal sex differences in brain
circuitry is lacking, so this work will inform not only stress studies, but will increase understanding of sex as a
biological variable in all behaviors that engage vHPC circuitry."
10887625,"Project Summary:
 Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a debilitating autoimmune disease that affects millions. Unfortunately, the
incidence of T1D is rising. The strongest genetic factor in T1D is the MHC class II locus. Some MHC haplotypes
are associated with higher risk to T1D, while others provide dominant protection. Yet, the mechanism remains
unknown. Recent studies suggest that environmental factors, such as the microbiome, also contribute to the
increasing incidence of T1D. While both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the risk of developing
T1D, little is known of how MHC II genetic factors interact with microbial factors. The non-obese diabetic (NOD)
murine model recapitulates many features of T1D in humans including the dominant protection associated with
the MHC class II locus. NOD mice spontaneously develop T1D, but autoimmunity can be prevented by transgenic
expression of the MHCII E allele (Eα16/NOD mice). Recent published studies and new preliminary data from
our laboratory suggests that microbiota are critical for this protection. The goal of this proposal is to identify
immunomodulatory bacteria and immune system pathways that can be used to develop preventative T1D
therapies for genetically at-risk patients
 To rigorously study the early-life microbiota, we developed a novel consortium of 9 culturable bacteria
(which we call PedsCom) that represent over 90% of the bacteria in pre-weaning diabetes-protected Eα16/NOD
mice. To investigate immunomodulatory mechanisms of specific bacteria, we are applying gnotobiotic techniques
using the PedsCom consortium and genetic models of disease utilizing Eα16/NOD mice. The experiments
outlined in this proposal will elucidate the mechanisms by which MHC II molecules interact with intestinal
microbes to prevent T1D. In Aim 1, I will investigate if MHC II E expression impacts early-life events to shape
microbial colonization by comparing colonization dynamics and humoral responses to commensal bacteria in
the NOD and Eα16/NOD mice colonized by the PedsCom consortia. In Aim 2, I will determine if the PedsCom
consortia of early-life microbes are sufficient to prevent T1D and whether peripheral regulatory T cells prevent
T1D in Eα16/NOD mice by studying PedsCom, specific pathogen free (SPF), and germ-free colonized mice.
 During this fellowship, these investigations will expand my technical skills, improve my aptitude for
experimental design and analysis, and enhance my ability to communicate findings to the scientific community.
I will complete this fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania, which offers programs, courses, and structured
mentorships that will aid my career development. In addition, I will take advantage of opportunities offered by
the Immunology Graduate Group and the Medical Scientist Training Program to enhance my abilities as an
educator and a clinician. With the resources available to me, I will explore the fundamental and clinically relevant
questions in this proposal to gain the skills necessary to become a successful physician scientist."

Cellular mechanisms mediating the transition from a state of general anesthesia to an awake state are not
understood. Patients emerge from anesthesia passively without the use of mechanistically targeted
interventions, creating an unpredictable clinical outcome marked by behavioral phenomena like emergence
agitation and delirium. Many anesthetics act either directly or indirectly to change excitatory/inhibitory balance
in the brain, highlighting the importance of understanding inhibitory networks in emergence. My research
program focuses on the effects of general anesthesia on inhibitory plasticity during the transition from
anesthetized to awake state in mice. My prior work examines neuroligin-2, a central organizer of the inhibitory
synapse, using cell-type and circuit specific manipulations. Neuroligin-2 is a cell adhesion protein that acts as a
scaffold to regulate general inhibitory synaptic function and is recently implicated as an independent regulator
of intracellular signaling and disease. I demonstrated that neuroligin-2 manipulation modulates agitation and
related behaviors in mouse models. My established expertise in stress-induced inhibitory synaptic plasticity
provides a strong foundation for the following three complementary research areas investigating general
anesthesia emergence. (1) Inhibitory cell plasticity in emergence from anesthesia: Research area 1 will
focus on effects of general anesthesia emergence on inhibitory cell plasticity, starting with an investigation of
key inhibitory postsynaptic genes, like neuroligin-2, using targeted knockdown and electrophysiology studies.
Single cell sequencing transcriptomic investigations will characterize all cell types and synaptic constituents
modified by emergence. (2) Brain-wide cell type-specific circuit activity in emergence: Research area 2
will investigate whole brain circuit changes induced by general anesthesia emergence using activity mapping
and light sheet microscopy at single cell resolution, along with recordings of neuronal activity using genetically
encoded optical sensors expressed in anesthesia-regulated circuits. (3) Preclinical models for emergence
delirium across the lifespan: Research area 3 will develop and validate preclinical rodent models of
emergence delirium using machine learning approaches, in order to study vulnerability to anesthesia-induced
delirium across the lifespan. Together, these three projects form an overarching research program to
understand mechanisms of emergence from the inhibitory cellular to circuit to behavioral levels of analysis,
providing a holistic view of emergence. We must understand the mechanisms of anesthetic emergence across
all levels in order to design pharmaceutical interventions to bring about safer and predictable emergence."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the world. Comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation
(CR) programs have repeatedly been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality while improving symptoms and
quality of life for patients living with this chronic disease. While referral rates to CR programs for patients
following a coronary event or procedure have slowly begun to increase in recent years, patient participation in
these programs has not. Further, adherence and completion of CR programs for those patients enrolled also
falls well short of target. There are a number of known barriers to participation in and completion of CR, which
contribute substantially the widening gap between CR referral, enrollment, and completion of CR.
The objective of this proposal is to determine the effectiveness of a mobile health (mHealth) remote case
management platform for increasing CR adherence, improving CVD risk factors, and improving patient-
centered outcomes. This prospective, randomized controlled trial of CR using a mHealth remote case
management platform compared to conventional center-based CR has been developed through interaction
with a number of key stakeholders including patients, clinical CR support staff, scientists, physicians, and
healthcare leaders. All non-surgical patients who have experienced a myocardial infarction, acute coronary
syndrome, percutaneous coronary intervention, have stable angina, or have heart failure will automatically be
referred to CR and be eligible to participate in this trial.
We anticipate that patients who utilize the mHealth remote case management platform will have improved
clinical outcomes compared to conventional center-based CR, as evidenced by increased adherence to CR
programming, improved CVD risk factors, and improved rehospitalizations/mortality."

Biobanks are an enormously valuable resource for genomic research. However, inadequate diversity among
specimen donors limits their generalization for translational research. The lack of representativeness of
biosamples has the potential to limit the application of precision medicine within underrepresented
communities and may inadvertently exacerbate health disparities. Biobanks created using stored newborn
screening bloodspots can be particularly valuable resources in efforts aimed at addressing the need for
samples from diverse populations: they represent virtually the whole population of infants in a given state, and
can be accessed by a wider range of researchers and institutions than smaller repositories with narrower
research goals. However, the storage and future research use of newborn bloodspots has itself experienced a
long history of national controversy given that state newborn screening programs do not obtain informed
consent for collection and testing, and only a few states have subsequently added consent for the research
use of leftover bloodspots. Ongoing lawsuits among some state programs and policy debates at both the state
and federal levels have further mired any progress to promote the use of newborn screening bloodspots for
important health research, including studies that assess health disparities. The implementation of consent
processes at the state level may become necessary for the continued utilization of this important resource. The
proposed renewal of our R01 will address these concerns by: identifying determinants, strategies,
mechanisms, barriers, and facilitators of consenting quality across hospitals serving diverse and underserved
populations for the retention and research use of residual dried bloodspots for the Michigan Biotrust of Health
(Aim 1); engaging members of underrepresented and non-English speaking communities in Michigan to
support implementation of an electronic informed consent intervention (EICI) in diverse hospital settings (Aim
2); and implementing and evaluating the EICI consent approach within four major hospitals across the state of
Michigan serving underrepresented persons, Spanish and Arabic speaking participants, and the general
population (Aim 3)."

Penn State Cancer Institute’s (PSCI) PROMISE program (Penn State Research training in Oncology and
Medicine to Inspire Student Engagement) is a holistic approach to inspire, attract, and retain cancer researchers
for the 21st century biomedical workforce. The program engages STEM college undergraduates and medical
students in an immersive program that provides authentic individual and team research experiences,
demonstrating first-hand how new cancer research discoveries are translated into clinical and societal practice.
Additional program workshops provide support training in both professional and personal skills needed for
sustained research careers. PROMISE emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of modern cancer research. We
will recruit motivated and talented students from a variety of disciplines and create an environment in which
cancer research is approachable and accessible for all participants. The PROMISE design is built upon a
relational pedagogical model with peers, near-peers, and faculty to promote participants’ sense of belonging in,
and contributing to, the cancer research community. The long-term goals of PROMISE are to instill in participants
a comprehensive understanding of cancer as a disease (how it is prevented, controlled, and treated), while
stimulating interest in oncology careers and providing skills needed for durable research careers. To achieve
these goals, Specific Aim 1 will provide integrated training in basic, clinical, and populations science approaches
through mentored research experiences. The PROMISE: Research for Life training focus will show students how
interdisciplinary research is conducted to solve current oncology problems and to save lives through effective
cancer management. Under the experienced mentorship of PSCI scientists and clinicians, the cohort will learn
the language, techniques, strategies, and concepts used every day by cancer researchers. Specific Aim 2 will
enhance trainee effectiveness through intensive support activities and rigorous program outcomes evaluations.
Workshop activities will provide the opportunity to experience peer acceptance, identify role models, and
overcome potential roadblocks to a successful research career. Events with stakeholders highlight how
advances in clinical oncology and societal practice are driven by research discoveries. Specific Aim 3 will create
a diverse coalition cohort from varied disciplines that includes underserved students, and inspire them to pursue
advanced training in cancer research and/or clinical oncology. STEM students who do not traditionally enter
biomedical careers will learn basic cancer biology and realize they can contribute to advancing cancer health
outcomes through collaborative research. Peer and near-peer mentors will support self-identification as a cancer
researcher and faculty will provide authentic role models for future career paths. Participation in PROMISE will
be life-changing for our cohort, as students will have experienced the critical importance of modern cancer
research to saving the lives of individuals, a perspective that will inspire them to pursue cancer research careers
and sustain them during their advanced training years."
10895571,"Most U.S. children living in out of home care (OOHC) have debilitating impairments regulating emotions and
behavior and the success of treatment efforts for these children depends principally on caregivers’ capacity to
provide developmentally enriching, therapeutic care. While living in OOHC, the adults who care for these
children during the critical hours outside of formal therapy play central roles in their treatment. Yet, OOHC
caregivers receive little education about how to meet the unique relational needs of the children they serve and
lack a clear understanding of their own therapeutic role in each child’s rehabilitation. In addition, the most
commonly-used training programs for caregivers in OOHC cover an eclectic range of topics without a specific
focus on relational skills, and few have empirical support. Ultimately, in order for OOHC services to optimize
children’s rehabilitation and mitigate the long-term sequelae of developmental trauma, it is imperative to
provide opportunities for caregivers to develop skills for eliciting developmentally enriching interactions (DIs)
during their ordinary care routines. Toward that goal, we propose two specific aims. Aim #1: Produce a video-
based Developmental Interaction Workshop Series (DIWS) that enables caregivers to repeatedly observe and
practice specific forms of DI and to create opportunities to increase their frequency during daily care routines.
The DIWS will include two 4-hour sessions for caregivers and supervisors, as well as two 90-minute sessions
for supervisors. A beta version will be implemented in one Residential Care (RC) agency, revised as needed,
and then fully implemented in three RC agencies. Aim #2: Evaluate the DIWS using mixed methods (staff and
child surveys, staff interviews, and ethnography) in four RC agencies to document preliminary evidence of its
impact, acceptability, and feasibility. We expect the DIWS to lead (1) caregivers to become more capable,
motivated, and purposeful about eliciting DIs in their caregiving role, and (2) caregivers and children to
perceive a greater prevalence of DIs during routine daily activities. We will also identify individual,
organizational, and implementation-related factors related to uptake. The DIWS will provide a
developmentally-informed framework for understanding and enhancing the child-adult relationships in
OOHC. Mixed-method evaluation results will provide the foundation for future RCTs of the program’s
efficacy, inform program improvements, and facilitate its wider dissemination."

The Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1, hereafter referred to as HIV) currently infects ~40 million
people worldwide, and the number of infected individuals continues to rise. In the absence of a cure, antiretroviral
therapy represents the primary treatment option, because it slows disease progression and reduces new
infections. Integrase (IN) Strand Transfer Inhibitors (INSTIs) are a class of antiretroviral therapeutics that block
integration of viral DNA into host chromosomes, a process that is mediated by the viral IN enzyme, which
assembles into oligomeric nucleoprotein complexes on the ends of viral DNA, termed “intasomes”. INSTIs
selectively target intasomes and represent first-line therapies in the clinic. However, the emergence of IN variants
resistant to INSTIs is becoming a greater clinical problem. Structural biology approaches can shed light on the
mechanisms underlying drug action and resistance, providing useful information for rationally improving the
current INSTIs. When complemented with ancillary techniques, such as biochemical activity assays, biophysical
thermodynamic and kinetic measurements, cellular virology, and diverse computational approaches including
free energy calculations, the structures precisely detail mechanisms of resistance against specific INSTIs and
provide guidance for designing and developing novel 3rd generation INSTIs to fight infections. In this proposal,
approaches centered around using revolutionary advances in cryo-electron microscopy for structural studies will
show how INSTIs interact with their natural drug target, the HIV intasome (both WT and mutant), and elucidate
the mechanisms by which resistance to these drugs emerges. There are three Specific Aims that will: (1) extend
and build upon current efforts to provide a mechanistic understanding of both why and how select viral resistant
variants (VRVs) arise in response to the clinically used drug Dolutegravir (DTG) or the most potent
developmental in-house compound that 4d, which is currently under pre-clinical evaluation; (2) broadly identify
and analyze novel mechanisms and pathways of drug resistance that arise in response to treatment with 2nd
generation drugs, highlighting both primary and compensatory mutations, and providing strategies to predict
future variants; (3) select for residual resistant variants arising in response to treatment with novel 3rd generation
INSTIs that were synthesized based on the concept of substrate mimicry, many of which effectively inhibit viral
resistant variants that arise in response to treatment with 2nd generation clinically used INSTI drugs, and explain
mechanisms underlying the superior potency of novel compounds. This work will improve our understanding of
an important class of drugs used to treat people living with HIV, identify mechanisms, pathways, and patterns of
clinically relevant resistance to INSTIs, and provide specific guidelines for their rational improvement."
10897124,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neuropsychiatric complications persist in people with HIV (PWH) despite suppressive antiretroviral therapy. Two
common, often disabling conditions in PWH are cognitive impairment (CI) and major depressive disorder (MDD).
However, the pathophysiology of central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction in PWH that results in these
conditions remain elusive and thus a HIV high priority topic. The trafficking of activated peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs), specifically CD14+CD16+ monocytes, into brains of virally suppressed (VS)-PWH
has emerged a putative contributor to neuroinflammation. We propose to test our hypothesis that VS-PWH will
have blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption mechanistically linked to targeted, circulating soluble
cytokines/chemokines and upregulation of PBMC surface proteins. The latter interact with tight junction and
adherens junction proteins to weaken the BBB, promoting PBMC diapedesis into brain. BBB disruption may
promote persistent neuroinflammation and altered neuronal activity contributing to neuropsychiatric sequela. To
this end, we propose cross-sectional imaging and lumbar puncture to assess BBB integrity, with baseline and
longitudinal neuropsychiatric assessments and blood sampling. 350 VS-PWH and 100 HIV-uninfected (HIV-)
individuals will be recruited from the Johns G. Bartlett Clinic within the Johns Hopkins Hospital and in the
surrounding Baltimore community. First, we aim to assess the effects of well-controlled HIV on the BBB and its
contribution to neuropsychiatric conditions (Aim 1). We will assess BBB integrity using a novel, non-contrast
magnetic resonance imaging technique that uses water-extraction-with-phase-contrast-arterial-spin-tagging
(WEPCAST), to determine BBB permeability to water, and thereby to small molecules. We have shown this to
be sensitive to BBB change in mild cognitive impairment, a precursor to Alzheimer’s disease. Moreover, we have
found WEPCAST to be well-tolerated and estimate PS values well in VS-PWH. Second, we aim to assess the
relationship between circulating soluble markers, PBMC-associated markers, and BBB permeability to small
molecules, which collectively may promote diapedesis into brain (Aim 2). We target factors implicated in a
heightened transmigration of activated PBMCs across the BBB into brain, where they may contribute to neuronal
damage and neuropsychiatric burden in VS-PWH. Finally, we aim to examine the relationship of activated
PBMCs that transmigrate an intact BBB model to BBB permeability to small molecules (Aim 3). We innovate with
the real-time assessment of ex vivo cellular function (BBB model) and in vivo BBB measures (WEPCAST). After
5 years of funding, this R01 will advance our understanding of BBB integrity and related PBMC migration into
the brains of VS-PWH, which may contribute to neuroinflammation and related neuropsychiatric burden. These
findings will inform next steps in the development of therapeutic approaches to minimize PBMC contribution to
neuroinflammation in VS-PWH."

From eukaryotes to prokaryotes, proper protein folding is essential to cellular function. Disulfide bond formation
contributes to the overall protein folding process, stabilizing structures and protecting against degradation.
Disulfide bond-forming machines that facilitate proper protein folding are well recognized in eukaryotes and
Gram-negative bacteria. In contrast, a major disulfide bond-forming pathway has only recently been identified in
the Gram-positive Actinobacteria Actinomyces oris, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and Corynebacterium
matruchotii. In these organisms, a membrane-bound thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase named MdbA catalyzes post-
translocational folding of exported proteins. Importantly, genetic disruption of mdbA abrogates assembly of
adhesive pili and biofilm formation, alters cell morphology, and attenuates bacterial virulence. Nonetheless, how
actinobacterial cells cope with stress and protein misfolding is not well understood. To address this fundamental
question, we began to analyze the proteomes of Actinobacteria and found that most PBPs harbor 2 or more
cysteines; intriguingly, deletion of pbp1A or pbp1B in C. diphtheriae resulted in a cell morphology defect that
mirrors that of mdbA mutations. With a genetic approach, we then screened for viable suppressor mutants when
C. diphtheriae mdbA mutant cells grown at non-permissive temperatures. Serendipitously, we discovered
another thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase, which we named TsdA (tsd for temperature-sensitive dsb-forming).
Preliminary studies reveal that TsdA contains a thioredoxin-like fold found in MdbA, suggesting that TsdA may
serve as a specialized disulfide bond-forming machine to encounter cell stress. Finally, we identified a potential
protein disulfide bond isomerase that may serve as a safeguarding system to rescue misfolded proteins. As we
continue employing A. oris and C. diphtheriae as experimental models in this renewal application, by using a
multidisciplinary approach that combines genetics, biochemical and biofilm assays, and crystallography, we aim
to examine the molecular coupling between oxidative protein folding and cell wall biosynthesis in Actinobacteria,
to elucidate the mechanism of oxidative protein folding mediated by a compensatory thiol-oxidoreductase
machine in response to stress, and to elucidate a pathway for protein disulfide bond isomerization in
Actinobacteria.

can be widespread; however, it is unclear why nigral DNs show such exquisite vulnerability compared to
other cell types, including other DN populations. Post-mortem studies suggest that oxidative stress (OS)
contributes to familial and sporadic PD. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important signaling molecules
but high levels of intracellular ROS will damage DNA, lipids and proteins. High energy needs and dopamine

experimental systems to better understand nigral DN vulnerability, identify novel disease-relevant signaling
mechanisms, and improve molecular subtyping and patient stratification. Our long-term goal is to understand
the vulnerability of nigral DNs through the interplay of genetics, cell type specific functions that confer
vulnerability and quantifiable phenotypes to identify new therapeutic targets. In support of this goal, we have
developed knock-in human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) reporter lines to identify and isolate tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH)-positive DNs from large-scale organoid spin cultures. Using CRISPR mutagenesis we
created isogenic loss-of-function models of early-onset autosomal recessive PD (PARKIN-/-, DJ1-/- and
ATP13A2-/-) in TH-reporter cell lines. We detected dysregulation of mitochondrial proteins, significantly
increased OS and cell death in isogenic PD cell lines in midbrain DNs, but not in isogenic WT-control DNs. To
understand nigral DN vulnerability we propose to use our isogenic reporter PD model and single-cell RNA
sequencing approaches of human midbrain, hypothalamic and forebrain DNs to identify populations of cells
that show increased vulnerability to OS and cell death and identify differentially affected DN populations.
Expression and network analysis will identify cellular functions that confer vulnerability. We have developed
genetic tools to distinguish primary dysregulation from emerging phenotypes to further the mechanistic
understanding of genotype-phenotype interactions. Using innovative CRISPR-activation and inhibition
technologies we will test identified candidate genes for their potential to ameliorate OS phenotypes and cell
death in our PD model. Our model is conceptually and technically innovative and will illuminate common and
unique pathways that confer vulnerability or protection in nigral DNs and propose novel strategies for
prevention and treatment to improve the lives of patients and their caregivers."

10897134,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychological disorder that can occur following
trauma exposure. PTSD risk is twice as high in women. Furthermore, risk of posttraumatic symptoms (PTS) is
intergenerational, in that children of mothers with PTS are more likely to have PTS themselves, perpetuating
the cycle of pathology. Despite this intergenerational risk, there remains little known about the impact of PTS
on early parenting behavior, relational health, and infant behavioral and biological risk outcomes.
 A positive maternal caregiving system during infancy is vital and sets the stage for a child’s healthy
emotional and social development. There are many aspects of the maternal caregiving system that are
important, but growing evidence suggests that maternal sensitivity (warmth and attentive, appropriate, timely,
and consistent parental responsiveness toward infant signals and cues) and mother-infant emotional
connection are particularly critical factors for an infant’s secure attachment development and stress regulation.
Deficits in the ability to flexibly regulate emotions following such interactions with the infant may therefore
underlie particular problems with positive parenting behaviors. Women with PTS show hyperactivation in fear
circuitry and deficient regulation of these circuits; which may lead to decreased positive parenting behavior and
mother-infant emotional connection. Examining the role of maternal PTS in emotional reactivity and
regulation associated with infant cues will provide insight into important mechanisms that lead to
impairment in maternal sensitivity and mother-infant emotional connection. Examining the role of
maternal PTS and parenting on behavioral and physiological reactivity patterns in these newborns will
also aid in our understanding of the effects of PTS on early emotional and stress regulation
development in children of women with PTSD, helping to establish a mechanistic model of risk that will
inform clear treatment targets in traumatized populations.
 In the current application, we will examine how maternal PTS affects neural and physiological response
to infant stimuli, maternal sensitivity and mother-infant emotional connection, and infant behavioral and
physiological outcomes among trauma-exposed women at 6 weeks, 4 months, and 9 months postpartum. We
will examine the aims listed below in 120 mother-infant dyads recruited in Atlanta, GA."

Sciences (UCSDHS) trains PhD students and post-doctoral scholars in cancer research that emphasizes
discovery and application/development of informatics tools and omics technologies. The design of CBIO training
is driven by three rationales: (i) Basic research discoveries are essential to advancements in cancer diagnosis
and treatment; (ii) Cancer omics data combined with model organism research have accelerated the discovery
and analysis of novel cancer genes and pathways; and (iii) Investigation of cancer biology in the human system
requires proficiency in omics technologies and computational tools. The duration of each trainee appointment is
for two-years with the goal to (a) foster research excellence in advanced systems and approaches, (b) provide
foundational knowledge in cancer biology and bioinformatics, (c) develop translational insights through Tumor
Boards at the Moores UCSD Cancer Center, (d) keep pace with cancer research advancements through journal
clubs, seminars, workshops, and national conferences, (e) uphold scientific ethics, rigor and reproducibility
through coursework, workshops, refreshers and reinforcements, (f) develop trainee professional careers through
coursework, workshops and annual updates of myIDP plans, and (g) promote a collaborative community through
monthly scientific meetings and annual retreats. The CBIO program faculty conduct cancer research with
demonstrated productivity and expertise in diverse experimental systems. Besides biologists, biochemists and
geneticists, our faculty also include mathematicians and computer scientists working on the leading edge of
computational cancer research. CBIO faculty are held to the highest scientific standard and our senior faculty
each has a strong track record in training graduate students and postdoctoral scholars. CBIO and its predecessor
has had a successful track record in mentoring junior faculty, who bring new research and teaching expertise to
the program. CBIO has appointed 10 predocs/9 postdocs using the 3 predoc/3 postdoc slots awarded each year
and propose a continuation of 3 funded predoc and 3 funded postdoc positions in the next funding cycle. CBIO
trainees are PhD students and postdoctoral scholars with outstanding academic records and cancer-focused
research projects, selected from large pools of highly qualified candidates. The majority of our former trainees
are conducting research in academia, biotech, and pharmaceutical companies with others pursuing careers in
teaching, scientific writing and clinical practice. An Executive Committee of CBIO selects and evaluates trainees
and faculty with annual input from our External and Internal Advisory Committees. CBIO has added value to
research and education at UCSDHS by offering a new Cancer Genomics journal club, by organizing a new
training area on Computational Biology and Data Science in the Biomedical Sciences graduate program, and by
catalyzing collaborative research leading to new shared grant funding. Building on these successes, CBIO will
continue to serve as a hub for big data cancer research and education at UCSDHS in the years to come."

Adolescence is one of the most critical periods of neurodevelopment. The brain undergoes a profound
reorganization during this stage, including the formation and stabilization of neural circuits that control decision-
making. We, and others, hypothesize that age-related improvements in decision-making are driven by changes
in brain circuits that encode specific decision-making mechanisms. Direct evidence supporting this hypothesis,
however, has been limited. The prefrontal cortex in particular undergoes an intense restructuring during
adolescence and brain imaging studies have observed robust changes in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and
anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The OFC and ACC are altered in individuals with mental illness, which is thought
to be the mechanism underlying decision-making deficits that emerge in these clinical populations. When and
how these alterations occur is not known, but emerging evidence suggests developmental changes in subcortical
projections to the OFC and ACC may be involved. Here, we propose to use in vivo calcium imaging and
optogenetic techniques coupled with computational modeling, to longitudinally assess circuit and neuronal
activity in behaving rats at multiple adolescent ages to determine how developmental changes in OFC and ACC
networks mediate improvements in decision-making. In Aim 1 we will determine how encoding of attention and
reward-prediction errors in amygdala and ventral tegmental area (VTA) projections to the OFC improves across
adolescence in rats using a reversal-learning task. We will then use a new transsynaptic tracing approach in Aim
2 to demonstrate that attention and reward prediction errors controlled by amygdala and VTA projections are
integrated into OFC neurons to determine the degree to which action values are updated and strengthened
during adolescence. Finally, Aim 3 studies will investigate the role of OFC projections to the ACC in integrating
value updating with current action value estimates that guide adaptive decision making. Together, these studies
will provide key insights into the developmental mechanisms that guide complex decision making. Our normative
data will provide a framework for identifying and understanding the neurodevelopmental mechanisms of mental
illness, and inspire future translational studies."

In addition to supplying nutrients to support growth, breast milk also has important immune functions that
provide protection against infection and influence the maturation of the neonatal immune system. Many
epidemiological studies have demonstrated that breastfeeding protects against a variety of allergic and
autoimmune diseases and several rodent models have demonstrated that breast milk fosters lasting immune
tolerance to specific environmental antigens. In this application, we focus on the potential immune modulating
effects of butyrophilin (BTN1A1). BTN1A1 is structurally related to the B7 co-signaling molecules that regulate
T cell activation or tolerance. It is expressed in the apical membrane of mammary epithelial cells during
lactation and participates in the trafficking and secretion of intracellular lipid droplets from mammary epithelial
cells into milk. We now present preliminary data showing that the BTN1A1 found in milk also regulates T cell
responsiveness, both within the neonatal gut as well as systemically. Furthermore, the effects of BTN1A1 on T
cell responsiveness persist well after the exposure to BTN1A1 ends at weaning. Therefore, our hypothesis is
that that BTN1A1 contributes to the development of immune tolerance in neonates and is required for breast
milk to inhibit the development of reactive airway disease to the environmental antigen, ovalbumin. The goal of
this R21 application is to test this hypothesis through two “high-risk” but “high-reward” aims. Aim 1 will begin
to characterize the molecular pathways by which milk BTN1A1 inhibits T cell activation by utilizing the power of
unbiased, high-throughput sequencing techniques. We propose: 1) single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of
splenic T cells from mice that consumed milk±BTN1A1; 2) scRNAseq on T cells isolated from peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from healthy human donors and exposed to anti-CD3/28 ± recombinant
BTN1A1; and 3) the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) to define
BTN1A1-dependent epigenetic changes in T cells. Aim 2 will test whether BTN1A1 mediates immune
tolerance to environmental allergens in vivo. Exposing lactating mothers to Ova has been shown to generate
tolerance to Ova in their suckling offspring, preventing Ova-induced reactive airway disease in those offspring
when they are challenged with Ova after weaning. Using this experimental paradigm, we will test whether
BTN1A1 is required for the protective effect of breast milk against Ova-induced lung disease. The proposed
studies investigating the immune regulating functions of BTN1A1 will contribute important knowledge regarding
how breast milk affects the neonatal immune system and lowers the risk of atopy and autoimmunity."

Program is innovative in depth, comprehensiveness and integration of its evidence-based supportive elements:
student pay, broad array of experiential placements, full integration of weekly Group Mentorship and tailored
Training (provided by skilled aging research facilitators from similar cultural backgrounds), co-occurring peer
mentorship and support, and finally, its fidelity to rigorous evaluation and dissemination of results and
materials. MADURA is positioned for success, given the convergence of experienced program leadership,
strong program development and evaluation teams, pay for students who must earn income in order to stay in
school, exemplary willing advisors and complimentary training activity partners, and existing linkages with
Hispanic/Latino student networks. The carefully conceptualized MADURA Program brings together the
leadership, advisors, training and placement experiences to successfully promote diversity in
Aging/Alzheimer's disease MSTEM careers for participating Hispanic/Latino undergraduates, within the
nurturing context of a University energized around improving diversity and inclusion.

10897006,"7. Project Summary / Abstract
Animal reproduction requires the production of sperm and eggs which undergo fertilization to construct a new
organism through embryogenesis. To accomplish this feat, the cell division machinery must undergo a
dramatic series of modifications to adapt to these developmental transitions. Human oocytes arise
embryonically and arrest in meiotic prophase, where they will remain for as long as decades until a hormonal
stimulus triggers their growth and cell cycle re-entry. After enduring this extended arrest, oocytes must
accurately segregate chromosomes in meiosis, be fertilized, and then divide with high fidelity. It is well-
appreciated that human oocytes lose their competency for meiosis, fertilization, and development as the length
of this arrest and the maternal age increases, resulting in markedly increased incidence of aneuploidies,
miscarriage and development disorders. The ability of an oocyte to persist through prophase arrest is therefore
of paramount importance for the human life cycle, but is a challenging state to study, and we know relatively
little about how it is molecularly regulated.
The goal of this proposal is to define the molecular program that maintains oocyte competency for future
division during extended arrest, and how this state is influenced by the ovarian environment. A challenge for
addressing this question has been the limited availability of mammalian oocytes, which are among the rarest
cells in the body. To address this challenge, I have developed strategies for extended in vitro culture of
biochemical quantities of oocytes from the sea star Patiria miniata, a powerful model organism whose oocytes
share common features and conserved molecular mechanisms with humans. Leveraging this advantage, I will
perform a series of cell biological and high-throughput analyses to interrogate the transcriptional, translational,
and post-translational mechanisms that oocytes enact to enforce and persist through their extended arrest.
This approach will open new doors for understanding important aspects of human fertility, and will enable my
transition to independence as an investigator committed to the study of development and fertility."

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHC) is a subtype of biliary tract adenocarcinoma with a poor prognosis and
rising incidence. SEER data recently documented an average 4.4% rise over the past decade. Similarly, an
analysis spanning 18 years reported a 7% annual increase in incidence, the highest of any biliary tract subtype.
Both studies highlight the abysmal survival of patients with IHC, the latter reporting a median of approximately 6
months. Most patients with IHC have unresectable disease at diagnosis, and even those few fortunate enough
to undergo resection recur commonly. For these patients, treatment options are limited, with systemic
chemotherapy representing the standard, and in most cases, the only approach. Combination therapy with
gemcitabine (GEM) and a platinum agent is the current gold standard, but its benefit is limited, offering a median
overall survival of approximately 12 months. Recently, our group completed a phase II single-arm study of
regional chemotherapy using continuous infusion hepatic arterial (HAI) floxuridine (FUDR) combined with GEM
and oxaliplatin (OX). The median overall survival was 25 months, with four patients responding sufficiently to
undergo resection. Based on these promising results, the primary goal of this proposal is to establish the efficacy
of HAI FUDR added to the most active systemic regimen (GEM/OX) for the treatment of unresectable IHC in a
multi-center randomized phase II study, with the primary endpoint of progression-free survival.
Further improvements in the management of IHC have been hindered in large part by a poor understanding of
the biology of the disease. IHC is among the most genomically heterogeneous solid tumor, resulting from the
wide array of risk factors and multiple potential cells of origin. Significant heterogeneity has been shown not only
from patient to patient, but even within the same tumor. This feature has precluded precise characterization of
molecular pathogenesis, made it difficult to identify effective targeted therapies, and results in inaccurate
assessment of the mutational landscape when based on a single biopsy. The proposed clinical trial provides an
ideal opportunity to address these gaps. We will evaluate intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) using targeted exome
sequencing of multiple tumor biopsies and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from a large cohort of patients and use these
findings to stratify patients with respect to response and survival. For the subset of patients that progress while
enrolled in the trial, we will obtain tumor biopsies and blood at the time of progression to elucidate mechanism(s)
of treatment resistance by tumor DNA and cfDNA sequencing. Using these same samples, we will establish
patient-derived organoid models for functional evaluation of genetic predictors of treatment response. Finally,
we will use radiogenomics, or the merger of quantitative imaging with molecular analyses, to explore non-
invasive stratification of patients based on mutational patterns and to quantify the degree of heterogeneity. Using
an integrated analysis approach, these studies will provide a foundation for multimodal risk stratification for IHC."
10897055,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Vascular interventions used to treat severe atherosclerosis often fail due to the development of arterial
restenosis secondary to neointimal hyperplasia. In the United States, the only therapies approved for use in
humans aimed at reducing restenosis are drug-eluting stents and balloons. However, these drug-eluting
devices have proven to be problematic with respect to re-endothelialization, thrombosis, and death, and have
led to the release of FDA warnings in 2019. Thus, there is a great need for new technology that will promote
restoration of a healthy vasculature following revascularization. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop
a novel, targeted, drug-releasing nanotherapeutic that will be administered intravenously yet localize
specifically to the site of injury to prevent neointimal hyperplasia. Dr. Kibbe and Professor Stupp’s laboratories,
through funding from a National Institutes of Health Bioengineering Research Partnership R01, have
developed a highly innovative targeted nanotherapeutic comprised of peptide amphiphile (PA) molecules that
self-assemble into three-dimensional nanofibers and are covalently modified to include a collagen-binding
peptide (CBP) that targets the nanofiber to collagen. Nitric oxide (NO) was incorporated as the therapeutic
given its many vasoprotective properties that promote vascular health and inhibit neointimal hyperplasia. Our
laboratories demonstrated that this NO-releasing targeted nanofiber is biocompatible, specifically targets the
site of vascular injury following tail vein injection and inhibits the development of neointimal hyperplasia at 2
weeks—an effect that remains durable out to 7 months in healthy rats. With the success of these studies, it is
time to advance this research to the next stage required for ultimate clinical translation. In humans, vascular
interventions are performed in the setting of atherosclerosis with its associated oxidative stress. Thus, we aim
to advance the technology platform beyond what we have already developed by incorporating additional
targeting moieties and therapeutics that are sensitive to the atherosclerotic milieu. We hypothesize that our
multi-modal nanotherapeutic will target vascular injury and prevent restenosis at the site of intervention in an
atherosclerotic environment. To investigate this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: 1)
Develop and evaluate a targeted nanofiber with specificity for the site of arterial injury in atherosclerotic rat
models; 2) Investigate the safety, efficacy and biodistribution of a multi-modal therapeutic targeted nanofiber
platform at inhibiting neointimal hyperplasia following arterial injury in atherosclerotic rat models; and 3)
Evaluate the safety and efficacy of the multi-modal targeted nanofiber platform at preventing neointimal
hyperplasia and restenosis in a preclinical atherosclerotic swine model of arterial balloon injury. Completion of
these aims will result in the development of a multi-modal targeted therapeutic nanofiber platform that will
prevent restenosis following vascular interventions in an atherosclerotic environment. Further, completion of
these studies will position us to start pre-IND meetings with the FDA to begin first-in-human testing."

We request funds for a novel mass spectrometer, the Orbitrap Astral, to be located at the Massachusetts General
Hospital (MGH) and to be used for proteomics studies focusing on cancer and Alzheimer’s disease research.
 The proteome is defined as the entirety of all proteins in biological systems, and it encloses many different
aspects such as (i) protein expression and concentration, (ii) posttranslational protein modification such as
phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, and ubiquitination, (iii) protein interactions, (iv) intracellular protein
localization, (v) enzyme activities, and many more. Most of this information can only be accessed through directly
measuring the proteome, and this is enabled through proteomics technology with mass spectrometry being the
most important tool. Nevertheless, proteomics usage is small when compared to the wide usage of genomics
technologies, and we believe this hinders progress in a better understanding of complex diseases such as cancer
and neurodegenerative disorders and ultimately a better treatment of these diseases. So why is proteomics not
more broadly used in disease research and has not been incorporated into the diagnostics in clinical treatment?
We believe two major reasons are a lack of sensitivity when compared to genomics technologies and a lack of
sample throughput, which impacts studying complex diseases and results in high costs of proteome analysis.
 Both hurdles were addressed by the development of a novel mass spectrometer by Thermo Fisher
Scientific, the Orbitrap Astral, which includes a new extremely fast mass analyzer with unprecedented sensitivity.
This high-resolution accurate-mass (HRAM) analyzer enables extreme scan rates (200 Hz) at single ion
detection limits and provides unprecedented performance across all current mass spectrometry-based
proteomics approaches including isobaric labeling-based multiplexed quantification and data-independent
acquisition (DIA). First data generated with the instrument show that the Orbitrap Astral is a game changer for
proteomics that will redefine what can be achieved in the field. It outperforms existing mass spectrometers by
several folds in mapping cell line and tissue proteomes, plasma proteomes, phosphoproteomes, and proteomes
of low sample inputs (single-cell proteomics).
 The instrument will benefit the research of 13 projects (9 major and 4 minor users) in cancer and
Alzheimer’s disease research and will be available to NIH-funded researchers beyond the MGH in Boston and
nationwide. It will be supported by all levels of institutional levels, including the MGH Cancer Center, and the
MGH Executive Committee for Research. Institutional funds are committed to installing, maintaining, and
running the platform. We believe that the Orbitrap Astral will drive new discoveries in cancer and Alzheimer’s
research and beyond including the identification of disease biomarkers for detection and monitoring progress,
for identifying cancer vulnerabilities including combination treatment targets for overcoming treatment resistance,
and as a platform to develop even faster and deeper methods for exploring disease proteomes."

In 2010, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC) and D. E. Shaw Research (DESRES) partnered to make
the Anton special-purpose molecular dynamics (MD) supercomputer available to the national biomedical
research community for the first time. Anton enabled researchers to simulate biomolecular systems two orders
of magnitude faster than any conventional supercomputer, allowing researchers access to the critical
multi-microsecond and longer timescales on which most biologically-significant molecular processes take
place. In 2016, with operational support from NIH, DESRES made available a next generation Anton 2 system
at PSC at no cost. This multimillion-dollar gift from DESRES, with NIH support, provided a unique opportunity
for researchers to tackle even more groundbreaking biological questions. The primary goal of this project is to
provide the national biomedical research community with access to the next-generation Anton system — Anton
3. Anton 3 will provide an order of magnitude increase in simulation speed with respect to Anton 2, as well as a
ten-fold increase in the maximum chemical system size, up to seven million atoms. Since demand for Anton 3
will be high, our goals are focused not only on providing access but also on maximizing the value of this limited
resource to the community — recognizing that the creativity of the broad, diverse biomedical research
community is one of our most powerful resources for innovation. Anton 3 will be integrated as an NSF
ACCESS resource provider, and the accessibility and impact of Anton 3 will significantly increase by engaging
in their broadening participation, outreach, and training programs. Through these outreach efforts, researchers

underrepresented groups in biomedical research. In addition, the hundreds of long-timescale MD trajectories
researchers generate on Anton systems constitute a unique and valuable data collection that can be used to
gain additional biomedical knowledge and advance the application of machine learning protocols to augment
molecular dynamics simulations. These important datasets will be available to researchers and educators
worldwide through a web portal and co-located on the PSC’s Bridges-2 and Neocortex systems for classroom
instruction and research, including reanalysis, machine learning, and data mining."

There is currently no recognized way of accurately predicting who will recover from post-traumatic headache (PTH)
during the acute phase following concussion and who will go on to develop persistent post-traumatic headache (PPTH), a
condition that is difficult to treat effectively. Clinical experience with treating secondary headaches suggests that
treatment is most effective when initiated early after headache onset, before headache patterns become persistent. So, why
don't clinicians treat all patients with PTH acutely following concussion? Although it is likely to be beneficial to treat
those patients who are at high risk for PPTH as early as possible, medication side effects and toxicities make it potentially
harmful to administer unnecessary medication to those patients who would recover on their own without treatment. The
inability to identify which concussed patients with acute PTH are at high risk for PTH persistence leaves clinicians
without the knowledge needed to make informed decisions regarding how aggressive to manage patients with acute PTH.
Study Goal: to develop a prognostic biomarker signature for PPTH using clinical data as well as structural and functional
brain neuroimaging and to assess the predictive accuracy of an ensemble biomarker signature for the early identification
of patients at high risk for PTH persistence. The accurate prediction of individuals who are at high risk for PTH
persistence would allow clinicians to recommend early and more aggressive management with the intention of preventing
PTH persistence. A predictive model for PPTH could also guide clinical trials that will test the utility of innovative
therapies to prevent PPTH by allowing for enrichment of the subject cohort with patients at high risk of PPTH.
R61 Phase: During the R61 phase this study will develop brain imaging and clinical feature prognostic biomarker
signatures for PPTH using machine-learning algorithms. The imaging and clinical biomarker signatures will be developed
by laboratories that will first work in-parallel, and then the laboratories will combine the neuroimaging and clinical
biomarkers using an ensemble approach. Results of this study will determine important clinical factors (e.g.
demographics, medical history, brain injury characteristics, headache characteristics, speech patterns) and brain imaging
markers (e.g. regional volumes, cortical thickness, white matter tract integrity, perfusion, functional connectivity) for
predicting PTH persistence Additionally, the predictive weight of specific clinical factors and neuroimaging features for
characterizing patients who are at higher risk for developing PPTH will be determined. R33 Phase: Once the predictive
weights of clinical factors and neuroimaging features are determined, the clinical testing battery and neuroimaging
sequences can be pruned down and optimized to include only those that have high predictive power for PPTH. The
scanning sequences used in this study are commonly available MRI sequences, making their use feasible across healthcare
centers. This optimized and shortened testing sequence can be translated into clinical practice and integrated into PTH
clinical trials for early identification of those individuals who are at high risk for PTH persistence.

Opioids are the most effective analgesics but are associated with severe side effects including respiratory
depression, tolerance, and addiction. These factors helped cause the opioid abuse epidemic in the US, making
drug overdose the leading cause of accidental death in the US. Thus, the identification of safer analgesics with
diminished side effects and abuse potential is critical to address the ongoing crisis. Clinically used opioids
predominantly exert both their analgesic and adverse effects through their action on the µ-opioid receptor (MOR).
While several approaches were taken towards safer analgesics, these efforts are limited by a lack of
understanding the complex biochemical networks engaged and activated by MOR in response to ligand binding.
This proposal builds on recent evidence suggesting that (1) MOR signaling is dependent on the interplay between
subcellular localization and membrane trafficking in a ligand-specific manner and (2) MOR shows ligand-
dependent effects on its protein interaction network and the signaling pathways it activates. Thus, delineating
the MOR-initiated signaling pathways for endogenous peptides and addictive opioids and how these are
coordinated by receptor location and trafficking provides potential new strategies for therapeutic modalities and
safer analgesics. The overarching goal of this proposal is to combine quantitative proteomics, functional
genomics, and opioid receptor biology to systematically discover and characterize regulators of MOR signaling
and trafficking in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons. We will combine proximity labeling mass
spectrometry and quantitative phosphoproteomics to systematically delineate interaction networks that MOR
engages and map the signaling pathways it activates. To study the functional role of proteomic targets in MOR
signaling and trafficking, we will develop and apply reporter assays for receptor signaling and trafficking in
CRISPRi gene regulation screens. Finally, we will test mechanistic hypotheses from proteomic and genetic
screens on how novel regulators of trafficking and signaling fine tune the cellular response of MOR activation.
Our proposed approach will yield mechanistic insights into MOR-initiated signaling pathways and how these are
regulated by receptor trafficking. Identifying key regulators of MOR activation will fill a critical gap for designing
safer, pathway selective analgesics and treatments for opioid addiction."

 By combining mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics with genomics, epigenomics, and
transcriptomics, proteogenomics holds great potential to better illuminate cancer complexities than individual
‘omes. During the past 10 years, the Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) has performed
comprehensive proteogenomic characterization of >1,500 tumors across 10 cancer types. These studies not
only yield novel biological and clinical insights into different cancer types but also produce valuable datasets and
computational tools that can be further used by the broad scientific community. The next phase of the CPTAC
program seeks to expand the current success to more cancer types and translational research focusing on
clinically relevant questions. Our integrative proteogenomic data analysis center (iPGDAC) is one of the current
CPTAC funded PGDACs. We have participated in the studies of all CPTAC cancer types and have played a
leading role in data analysis for several cancer types. This application seeks to continue and enhance our
contribution to the next phase of the CPTAC program. The overarching goal of our PGDAC is to accelerate the
translation of cancer proteogenomic data into better understanding of cancer biology and improved cancer
treatment. We will continue developing and improving our computing tools, workflows, and web portals that have
already been successfully used in the CPTAC studies for sequence-based and pathway/network-based
proteogenomic data integration. In addition, we will address unmet needs in post-translational modification
(PTM)-related analyses by using protein sequence and natural language-based deep learning techniques to
improve PTM peptide identification, to predict genomic variant impact on PTMs, and to connect PTM sites to
existing knowledge. Using unique tools from our team and cutting edge statistical inference and machine learning
algorithms, we will perform integrated analysis on proteogenomic data from the CPTAC studies to: 1) create a
comprehensive molecular and cellular portrait for each patient’s tumor; 2) identify and characterize molecular
and tumor microenvironment/immune subtypes; 3) prioritize functional genomic aberrations using
proteogenomic data; 4) reveal molecular mechanisms of cancer phenotypes; and 5) develop predictive models
for patient prognosis and treatment response. Our PGDAC brings to the CPTAC network a fully integrated,
completely established program with expertise in all the critical areas specified by the RFA. We have a proven
track record of leadership in computational proteogenomics and successful collaboration in the CPTAC network,
and we expect to broadly advance the field through this project."

Breast cancer has the largest number of new cases in world (11.7%). Although the prognosis of
breast cancer patients is generally favorable due to early detection and comprehensive treatment,
20%–30% of patients will still develop distant metastases and cases with progressive stage only
have a median two-year survival time. Breast cancer is widely recognized as a heterogeneous
disease in the sense of both primary tumor metastatic capacity and time to metastatic spread of
disease. High-quality population-based cancer surveillance data are needed to: (1) describe
cancer burden, patterns, and outcomes in order to (2) inform cancer prevention, detection and
control activities; and (3) evaluate interventions on the basis of past and future trends so that
optimal approaches to alleviate burden and suffering from cancer can be adopted. However, the
laborious manual curation process makes the population wise surveillance data collection
challenging. It has been shown in studies that a large percentage of total registry cost is devoted
to labor for data curation, even in the low-income countries. In this project, our mission is to build
a flexible NLP toolset that can be executed locally at the institution level and will curate the clinical
and patient-centered outcomes of breast cancer patients by parsing longitudinally acquired clinic
notes, radiology and pathology reports. In order to test the generalizability of the tools and to
initiate their deployment for data collection, we will partner with both Georgia SEER and California
state cancer registry and will curate the outcome data of past 10-years breast cancer patients
from two institutions across US representing diverse patient populations - Emory University
hospital (Georgia) and Stanford Medical Center (California). We will leverage the previously
developed tools and technologies and extend them to automatically curate the clinical and patient-
centered outcome data – recurrence date and site of recurrence, treatment administered, mental
and physical outcomes – from clinic notes and convert these into structured and query-able
format. The NLP tools will be dockerized and run locally at the hospital registry level for automated
outcome curation. Finally, the NLP extracted outcomes will be shared with State Cancer registry
for evaluation. From a methodological perspective, the framework and the open-source software
tools developed can be employed for cancer research beyond the scope of our project for curating
outcomes regardless of the problem domain."

Endothelial activation, dysfunction, and barrier disruption are hallmarks of inflammation-related diseases, such
as malaria, sepsis, and viral hemorrhagic fever. Cerebral malaria is a severe complication of infection with
Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites. In patients with cerebral malaria, red blood cells infected with
malaria parasites bind within cerebral microvessels leading to microvascular obstruction, thrombosis,
breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and severe brain swelling. The molecular mechanisms of how the
complex parasite and host inflammatory stimuli cause breakdown of the blood-brain barrier are only partially
understood, and strategies to restore BBB integrity remain limited. Kinase inhibitors are potential drugs to
stabilize the endothelial barrier following hyperinflammatory damage. This project builds on our recent findings
that specific kinase inhibitors promote endothelial barrier strengthening and protect against thrombin-induced
barrier disruption. In this project, we will investigate the mechanism(s) of action of barrier-protective kinase
inhibitors using in vitro human brain endothelial cell models and study how endothelial cells integrate signals
from host and parasite inflammatory products. Using a new 3D human brain microvessel model, we will also
study how flow disturbances interact with host and parasite stimuli in endothelial activation and barrier
disruption. Finally, we will evaluate the efficacy of barrier-protective kinase inhibitors using a combination of the
in vitro 3D human brain microvessel model and an experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) mouse model. The
proposed studies will study kinase regulation of endothelial barrier integrity and investigate the potential of
kinase inhibitors to stabilize endothelial barrier properties, with the long-term goal of developing new
therapeutic approaches to treat a wide spectrum of clinical disease associated with endothelial dysfunction."

valued element of Mayo Clinic; indeed, all research at Mayo Clinic is directed towards translation of scientific
knowledge to improve patient care, with almost 60% of our NIH funding base classified as clinical research or
trials. In recognition of the importance of continued advances in CTS to the Mayo Clinic mission, our
institutional leadership has entrusted the Mayo Clinic Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences (CCaTS)
to be the engine of translational innovation and the institutional advocate for CTS and translational research.
CCaTS has served as a CTS innovation incubator for numerous efforts that were created with CCaTS funding
and are now supported by the institution. The overall vision of CCaTS is to enable high-quality, team-based
multidisciplinary research that accelerates clinical trial innovation, facilitates digital health transformation, and
partners with our stakeholders and communities to improve patient care and health for all people. Our team-
based culture has been described as one of “boundarylessness,” wherein organizational barriers are removed
to enable talent, innovation, and knowledge to converge where needed. In this context and that of our
longstanding commitment to patient-focused research, we are uniquely positioned to accomplish the following
Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will simplify and accelerate the work of translation to improve health for all by
advancing clinical trial innovations and digital health transformations, streamlining methods and processes,
and developing novel informatics solutions that increase efficiency and drive implementation of discoveries that
improve health and promote health equity. In Aim 2, we will enhance our education programs through the
expanded reach of competency-based, learner-focused solutions, training a diverse, inclusive, multidisciplinary
CTS workforce to be prepared to address the urgent health care needs of all communities in a rapidly changing
environment. In Aim 3, we will engage local community members and patients to be active partners in
translational teams, expanding research capabilities of underserved communities, including rural populations.
Our goal is to improve health and reduce health inequities by helping these communities realize the benefits of
CTS. In Aim 4, we will expand national and regional partnerships and strengthen collaborative CTS networks
in all aspects of CTS and education, focusing on sharing innovative approaches and prioritizing diversity,

10895896,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Multiple myeloma (MM), the 2nd most common hematologic malignancy, remains incurable with high rates of
relapse and drug resistance despite recent advances in treatment options such as autologous stem cell
transplantation, novel immunomodulatory agents, and proteasome inhibitors. Shorter duration of initial
response predicts poor prognosis even in the modern era of novel agents. Several clinical features and high-
risk cytogenetics are currently in use for stratifying patients by severity of disease. However, a substantial
number of patients continue to have poor outcomes without known negative prognostic factors. Aberrant
epigenetic modifications have been linked with more aggressive types and progression of MM. In addition to
DNA methylation and histone modifications, accumulating evidence suggests that post-transcriptional
regulation involving RNA modifications, particularly N6-methyladenosine (m6A), is associated with initiation and
progression hematological malignancies. Emerging evidence suggests that m6A is also involved in the
development and prognosis of MM. However, the role of m6A in outcomes of MM remains largely unknown due
partly to the lack of quantitative methods to map whole-transcriptome m6A at high resolution. Some notable
challenges of existing m6A profiling approaches include 1) low resolution; 2) not quantitative; and 3) the
requirement of a large amount of input materials that are typically not feasible in clinical settings. To address
these clinical and technical needs, we designed the m6A-selective allyl chemical labeling and sequencing
(m6A-SAC-seq), which features transcriptome-wide profiling of m6A at single-nucleotide resolution with
modification fraction information. The objective of this application is to use the m6A-SAC-seq to map
transcriptome-wide m6A in CD138+ tumor cells from MM patients to identify m6A modifications associated with
treatment outcomes. We will apply this novel technology in banked CD138+ cells collected at the time of
diagnosis for ~100 newly diagnosed patients with MM enrolled in our NCI-funded clinic-based survivorship
study as well as ~30 samples from a Phase II clinical trial. Our central hypothesis is that specific m6A
signatures in CD138+ tumor cells at the time of diagnosis correlate with outcomes in patients with MM. We will
identify altered m6A in transcripts associated with early relapse and response to first-line therapy (Aim 1) as
well as minimal residual disease (Aim 2). With respect to outcomes, we expect to 1) identify specific m6A
signatures and involved pathways that are associated with treatment outcomes among patients with MM; and
2) establish the m6A-SAC-seq for broader clinical applications. The proposed research is highly significant,
because it is expected to vertically advance understanding of the biological basis for treatment outcomes of
MM and promote the development of a new paradigm for prognostic risk stratification based on m6A
modifications that has broad translational importance in the personalized management of high-risk patients."

Decades of research have revealed that the composition of the human gut microbiome directly impacts human
health, yet we still do not understand the mechanisms underlying formation and maintenance of this complex
community. Counterintuitively, increasing evidence suggests that competitive interactions play a role in
maintaining community stability. While genes encoding components of diverse systems involved in interbacterial
antagonism are widespread in human gut metagenomes, the specific antagonistic interactions occuring in situ
remain elusive. One of the pathways mediating interbacterial antagonism is the Esx secretion system, which is
conserved in two prominent gut phyla, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. While this pathway has been shown to
mediate contact-dependent interbacterial antagonism by a limited number of Gram-positive species in vitro,
many questions remain about its physiological function. Antibacterial toxins secreted by the Esx machinery are
present throughout human gut metagenomes, suggesting that Esx-mediated antagonism could occur in this
community. These findings led me to propose to identify the targets of Esx-mediated interbacterial
antagonism in a model natural community, the murine gut microbiome. To accomplish this goal, I will take
advantage of the fact that bacteria express cognate immunity genes to prevent self-intoxication by secreted
toxins. In Aim 1 of my proposed studies, I will use bioinformatics and in vitro functional assays to identify Esx
toxin and immunity genes encoded in a model murine gut metagenome derived from wild-caught mice. My
preliminary findings indicate at least two antibacterial Esx toxins are encoded in this natural gut microbiome. In
Aim 2, I describe an in situ conjugation strategy to deliver the immunity genes identified in Aim 1 to all members
of the murine gut community. I hypothesize that expression of immunity genes in bacteria targeted by specific
Esx toxins will increase their abundance in a community. Therefore, by identifying changes to community
composition that depend on immunity genes, I can determine the targets of Esx-mediated antagonism in situ.
This unique approach to examine interbacterial antagonism under physiological conditions will significantly
improve our understanding of the physiological function of the Esx system in gut bacterial species. It will also
provide the first direct characterization of antagonism between gut microbiome constituents. The methods I
propose to develop may additionally later be applied broadly to the characterization of diverse antagonistic
pathways present in gut bacterial species, an essential next step needed to define the mechanisms shaping gut
microbiome composition and ultimately human health. By working in the lab of Dr. Joseph Mougous at the
University of Washington and with my experienced collaborators, I will be able to learn diverse techniques,
practice effective mentoring strategies, and hone my scientific communication skills. This high-quality training
will enable me to succeed as an independent researcher studying microbe-microbe interactions."
