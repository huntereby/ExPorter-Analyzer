Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness in the industrialized world and has a global prevalence of
an estimated 95 million people (1). Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and diabetic macular edema (DME)
originate from persistently elevated glucose levels leading to microvascular ischemia, retinal neovascularization
(RNV), and vascular leakage (2, 3). Antibodies and therapeutics designed to sequester free vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) are the current standard of care (4-8). Due to the short half-life of anti-VEGF therapies,
monthly intravitreal injections are needed to maintain remission (4-7). Repeat injections risk intraocular
inflammation, infection, and ocular hemorrhage (9). An alternative approach is to use RNA interference (RNAi)
to silence the expression of the pathogenic proteins. The recent advancements in siRNA modifications (10) and
FDA approval of the third siRNA therapeutic in as many years demonstrate the renewed potential of RNAi,
though like other anti-VEGF therapies the duration of action is a key limitation. We propose to evaluate the
feasibility of intracellular RNA therapeutics delivered by intravitreal injection of a nanoparticle carrier to
inhibit neovascularization and extend the duration of therapeutic efficacy substantially relative to
current treatments. We recently demonstrated the effectiveness of intravitreally administered fusogenic porous
silicon nanoparticles (F-pSiNPs) for VEGF-siRNA delivery in a DL-alpha-aminoadipic acid (DL-AAA) rabbit
model of RNV. This project aims to rigorously test and optimize this system for extended efficacy. In Aim 1, we
will evaluate two methods of siRNA loading into the nanoparticles: calcium silicate condensation and grafting of
cyclic silanes. These systems will be optimized for loading capacity, encapsulation efficiency, and in vitro release
kinetics. The fusogenic-lipid membrane coating of the F-pSiNP system will be optimized using extrusion and
solvent exchange methods. The candidate formulations will be characterized by spectroscopic, DLS, and Cryo-
EM methods. Cellular uptake and duration of action will be validated in vitro using RT-qPCR and flow cytometry.
The most promising formulations will then be tested by intravitreal injection in Aim 2 using VEGF-siRNA and
Ang-2-siRNA payloads in the DL-AAA model of RNV (11, 12). F-pSiNPs will be given as a single dose and
monitored for 6 months for changes to vascular leakage using fluorescein angiography. These results will then
be benchmarked against commercially available antibody therapeutics aflibercept and faricimab. In Aim 3, F-
pSiNP formulations tested in Aim 2 will be conjugated with pendent surface peptides to test the hypothesis that
selective cellular targeting may dramatically improve efficacy. The targeting and internalization peptide iRGD
will be used for these studies. iRGD is currently in clinical development to improve chemotherapeutic uptake in
tumors, and was selected for its ability to target cell surface integrins and neuropilin-1, which are
characteristically overexpressed in neovascularization. This proposed project represents a first step in
developing and testing a novel platform for intraocular siRNA delivery with both clinical and scientific utility."
10929473,"Even before COVID-19, pneumonia with respiratory failure was a very common cause of hospitalization.
Unfortunately, many patients who survive pneumonia have persistent health problems for months or years
afterwards. The objective of this Effective Primary Care Practices that Enhance Recovery Trajectories
after Pneumonia (EXPERT) study is to use appreciative inquiry to help primary care clinicians take better care
of pneumonia patients in the 6 months after hospital–by taking a strengths-based approach for
transformational change to design and test a new systems-level intervention.
We will use a multi-methods approach wherein quantitative analysis of primary care actions and qualitative
interviews with expert primary care clinicians and patients are used to refine an innovative intervention in a
participatory prototyping pilot trial. The pilot trial targets mechanistic process outcomes linked to increased
hospital-free days for pneumonia survivors. Our team from primary care, hospitalist medicine, critical care,
palliative care, sepsis, informatics, clinical epidemiology, medical sociology, and clinical trials, will:
Aim 1: Quantitatively analyze granular EHR data to identify and refine candidate components for a
primary care intervention to improve post-pneumonia care. We will leverage large, feature-rich datasets
from our team’s 3 diverse health systems to identify specific orders, referrals, and billing services by primary
care clinicians that are substantially more frequent in the 6 months after pneumonia than before and temporally
associated with reduced subsequent hospitalization. Aim 2: Qualitatively analyze the experiential insights
of primary care clinicians and pneumonia survivors to identify and refine candidate components and
identify enablers and barriers for the post-pneumonia intervention. We will conduct semi-structured
interviews and focus groups with PCCs and pneumonia survivors across 4 states to evaluate key actions and
implementation factors for successful post-pneumonia recovery. Aim 3. Refine and pilot a novel
multicomponent primary care intervention to improve delivery of post-pneumonia care that will lead to
improved health outcomes for pneumonia survivors. We will use a novel stakeholder-engaged strategy of
participatory prototyping to iteratively optimize the intervention and evaluate its effects on target mechanistic
outcomes in an eight-site cluster randomized pilot trial design.
EXPERT’s research addresses a fundamental knowledge gap in post-pneumonia care, a public health priority.
We propose to use appreciative inquiry to help primary care do what primary care does well, and to optimize
an intervention that makes it easier for them to do so."
10868548,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 A major challenge in mental health care includes inconsistent outcomes of current psychotherapeutic,
pharmacologic, and brain stimulation interventions. We theorize that across individuals, heterogeneous neural
underpinnings manifest at a systems level, leading to impaired domains of function and specific diagnoses.
This heterogeneity causes the same intervention to produce different outcomes across individuals. To
overcome this challenge, we hypothesize that systems-level brain activity (neural oscillations) contains the
information necessary to predict both individual variation in a domain of brain function and identify biomarkers
to guide the individualized implementation of an intervention. To test these hypotheses, a model brain system
is needed with sufficient variation and complexity to produce heterogeneity in behavior and intervention
outcomes. Prior work, including our own preliminary data, demonstrates such behavioral variation exists
across individuals and sexes in an outbred rat strain (Sprague Dawley) performing the delay discounting task
(DDT) and risk discounting task (RDT). When brain stimulation (Aim 1), pharmacologic (Aim 2) or
chemogenetic (Aim 3) interventions have been implemented in these rats, they produce heterogeneous effects
on task performance across individuals making this an excellent model system to evaluate our hypotheses.
Our proposed proof-of-concept study will determine the potential utility of neural oscillations as biomarkers
reflecting individual variation in the neural underpinnings of delay and risk discounting and the predisposition of
those individuals to respond to interventions. We will use machine learning to determine if: 1) oscillations can
predict variation in task performance across individuals and time; 2) oscillations can predict individual
intervention outcomes; and 3) changes in oscillations induced by interventions are predictive of corresponding
changes in DDT or RDT performance.
 Further enhancing the translational relevance of this proposal, the neural systems that modulate the
value of rewards associated with delay and risk discounting share homology between rodents and humans and
have been linked to important clinical outcomes. For instance, the excessive reduction of reward value by
delay relates to a significant risk for poor outcomes in multiple psychiatric conditions (e.g., ADHD,
schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder). Abnormal delay and risk discounting have also been linked
to specific behaviors, including suicide, violence and risky substance use, enhancing the impact of the
proposed studies. As an early-career investigator, funding for this proposal would allow me to launch an
innovative translational research program aligned with NIMH strategic goals focused on developing systems-
level brain activity biomarkers to guide the individualized implementation of interventions for patients with
mental illness."
10884499,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The high mortality rate in ovarian cancers is explained in part, by late-stage clinical diagnosis where
intraperitoneal tumor burden is already prevalent and widespread. Shedding and implantation of transformed
secretory cells, originating from the fallopian tube, is considered one of the main initiators of ovarian cancer.
During the early stages of this disease, secretory fallopian tube cells gain mutations that support migration
(against the direction of fluid flow) to the ends of the fallopian tubes (fimbriae). At the fimbriae, the mutated
fallopian tube cells form small early precursor lesions. Both the ovaries and fallopian tubes are suspended within
the abdominal cavity, where the environment further exposes early precursor tumor cells to dynamic shear
stresses. We therefore hypothesize that the fluidic shear stress stimulates the early precursor lesions in the
fallopian tubes and modulates their dissemination to the ovary and peritoneal organs.
In order to test this hypothesis, we will utilize microfluidic devices and bioreactors to circulate cell growth medium
around transformed human and mouse fallopian tube cell lines that are supported on an agarose-collagen,
polysaccharide-protein scaffold. Human immortalized fallopian tube cells with varying degrees of genetic
mutation will be probed for changes in cell replication, migration, invasion, cell death, and genetic variation after
stimulation of shear stress. Our preliminary data suggests a robust increase in the expression of GPRC5A in
fallopian tube secretory epithelial cells (FTSEC) under shear stress stimulation. Therefore, we will validate this
discovery in FTSEC cell lines with driver mutations and patient-derived cells, and investigate the GPRC5A
molecular pathway and its components that are activated in FTSEC under shear stress stimulation, by utilizing
gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays. Shear stressed and static control mutated fallopian tube cells will
be tested for stemness and the capacity to initiate tumors in immunodeficient mice. Stimulated transformed
fallopian tube cells will also be injected into immunocompromised mice to investigate the cell’s ability to colonize
and form tumors. These studies will also be performed in mice with intact immune systems in order to assess
whether immune cells impact growth and dissemination. Given that no published studies have yet identified the
role of shear stresses in dissemination of early precursor lesions in ovarian cancers, the proposed work can
potentially have much broader impact. For example, with our dynamic microfluidic and 3D bioreactor models,
mechanotransduction and immunotherapy drugs can be screened for development of effective cancer therapies.
The components of the shear stress-induced mechanotransduction that are identified in our proposed work,
could also be utilized in early detection of ovarian cancers. As a result, the important role of shear stresses in
the fluidic niches of ovarian cancers will be established. Lastly, our study on the mechanical regulation of
transformed epithelial cells will be highly relevant to fundamental biology and clinical translational alike."
10894119,"Project Summary:
Membrane protein (MP) biogenesis begins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is a complex process, as
domains on both sides of the ER membrane, and within the membrane bilayer, must fold and assemble. MPs
understudy include ABC-Transporters, P-Type ATPases, G-protein coupled receptors, and BRICHOS proteins.
Missense mutations that cause misfolding and premature degradation of MPs give rise to diseases such as
cystic fibrosis, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, retinitis pigmentosa and idiopathic lung fibrosis. In order to
prevent toxic accumulation, misfolded MPs are targeted for ER-associated degradation (ERAD) by E3 ubiquitin
ligase complexes. The ER transmembrane Hsp40 DNAJB12 (JB12) recruits cytosolic Hsp70 to the
cytoplasmic face of the ER and together these chaperones deliver the misfolded MPs to ERAD machinery. In
order for a misfolded protein to be a candidate for ERAD however, it must be competent for extraction from the
confines of the ER membrane and delivered to the cytosolic proteasome. Misfolded proteins with structural
restraints that prevent entrance into the proteasome necessitate an alternative quality control mechanism to
ensure degradation. Misfolded MPs expose surfaces in the ER lumen, membrane, and the cytosol, so the
coordinated action of ERQC factors in different locations manage this challenge. Mistakes in MP protein
management are fatal when rogue clients adopt a toxic shape that enable rogues to damage membranes and
dominantly poison essential cell functions. Hsp70 and Hsp40s act with folding and degradation machines to
triage MPs. They shield against proteotoxicity through suppressing aggregation, refolding clients, selection of
clients for degradation and regulating flux though protein biosynthetic systems. A major problem to ERQC
systems are the MPs that accumulate in thermodynamically stable intermediate states that are non-native and
self-associate to form oligomers, amorphous aggregates, and amyloid-like fibrils. Such misfolded conformers
bury surfaces that are normally recognized by ERQC factors, and their thermodynamic stability hinders the
unfolding events required for their extraction from membranes and degradation in the narrow central cavity of
the proteasome. Thermodynamically stable MP intermediates are resistant to ERAD and we discovered that
they are degraded by a JB12 dependent ER-phagy mechanism. The overall goal of the experiments included
in this proposal is to define nodes of cross-talk between the Hsp70 chaperone system, ERAD and ER-phagy
that are essential for cell viability and proteome maintenance."
10864037,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) manifests in nearly 70% of patients treated with anti-
neoplastic drugs and persists after treatment discontinuation, thereby impacting patient quality of life. The anti-
depressant duloxetine (selective inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine uptake) offers limited pain relief, while
long-term use of opioids for chronic pain carries safety risks. Thus, novel non-opioid analgesics are needed for
pain management in cancer patients. Our findings show that supraspinal (in the brain) delivery of cocaine and
amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide II (CART II) reverses pain-like behaviors (tactile) in male and female
mice with CIPN. Multiple behavioral outputs would provide clinical face validity and bolster translatability of a
given target, thus a comprehensive dose-evaluation of CART II anti-hyperalgesic effects during chronic pain
states of CART II in both sexes at multiple endpoints of chronic pain in both sexes is warranted. Previous studies
have uncovered broader pharmacological actions of CART II and systemic administration of a neuropeptide
likely will impose a challenge, so it is critical to determine the neurochemical signaling mechanisms of CART II
in CIPN. While the lack of a known receptor for CART II has prevented such mechanistic studies, we discovered
that Lysophosphatidic Acid Receptor 2 (LPAR2) is a high affinity receptor for CART II in the brain. We used cell-
based assays and in vivo pharmacology tools to show that supraspinal LPAR2 is necessary CART II-induced
acute analgesia. However, the role of LPAR2 in chronic pain states has not been evaluated. Our findings also
demonstrate that therapeutic doses of supraspinal CART II increase glutamate release in ventrolateral
periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc) in naïve mice, and previous work shows excitatory
inputs into these brain sites can relieve neuropathic pain states. However, neurotransmission during CIPN in the
vlPAG and NAcc has not been fully established. The central hypothesis in this proposal is that CART II produces
its anti-hyperalgesic effects via activation of LPAR2 and increased glutamate release. Thus, we propose to fully
examine anti-hyperalgesic actions of this signaling pathway in vlPAG and NAcc in males and females via two
independent yet interconnected aims. Aim 1 will comprehensively evaluate dose-dependent anti-hyperalgesic
effects of supraspinal CART II in 4 different behavioral output measures (tactile, cold, anxiety, depression) to
interrogate any sex differences in therapeutic potential for CIPN. Incorporation of a positive allosteric modulator
and knockout mice will reveal if LPAR2 is necessary and sufficient for the anti-hyperalgesic actions of CART II.
Aim 2 will examine CART II-mediated neurotransmission as a mechanism of action for its anti-hyperalgesic
effects in CIPN. Collectively, the expected results will address significant gaps in understanding of the
supraspinal mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain states and interrogate the CART II/LPAR2 axis as a novel
therapeutic strategy in reversing already established CIPN."
10896206,"SUMMARY. Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) (“bird flu”) devastate the poultry industry, threaten
wildlife, damage economies, and constitute a permanent pandemic threat. HPAIVs emerge from low pathogenic
avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs) upon transmission from wild waterfowl (e.g., ducks, geese, gulls), their main
reservoir, to terrestrial poultry (e.g., chickens, turkeys). The transition from LPAIV to HPAIV results from the
insertion of nucleotides coding for multiple basic amino acids in the protease cleavage site of the viral
hemagglutinin (HA) gene during replication of the viral genome by the influenza virus polymerase. This change
in HA leads to systemic virus dissemination characterized by an endotheliotropism in poultry with mortality rates
up to 100%. In contrast, systemic virus dissemination, severe disease and endotheliotropism upon HPAIV
infection are rare or absent in most species of duck, wild and domestic. Interestingly, the transition from LPAIV
to HPAIV has only been observed in influenza viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes. Moreover, although LPAIVs
circulate extensively in wild waterfowl, there is no evidence that they can evolve into HPAIVs in these species.
HPAIV emergence is currently unpredictable because the mechanisms of initial emergence through nucleotide
insertion by the influenza virus polymerase, and subsequent process of natural selection in avian hosts remain
poorly understood. To understand the molecular mechanism of nucleotide insertion, we have recently predicted
subtype-specific RNA stem-loop structures at the HA cleavage site. Here, we hypothesize that the stem of the
stem-loop structure refolds during viral RNA replication leading to the template closing on itself, trapping the
polymerase in the loop and causing it to stutter and insert nucleotides. Additionally, we hypothesize that specific
RNA sequences present in H5 and H7 stem-loops determine why insertions only occur in these subtypes. To
test these hypotheses, we successfully developed in vitro polymerase assays, including single-molecule assays,
with which nucleotide insertions in HA RNA can be reliably detected with high throughput via circular
resequencing. Secondly, we hypothesize that intrinsic differences in the ability of HPAIV to spread systemically
in poultry versus waterfowl determine the process of natural selection of HPAIVs from LPAIVs and explain the
host species-specificity of HPAIV emergence. More specifically, we hypothesize that HPAIV are selected in
poultry and not in waterfowl because of their endotheliotropism in poultry supporting their systemic
dissemination. To test this hypothesis, we designed competition experiments between LPAIV and HPAIV to
study the natural selection at the host level in chickens (as a model for poultry) and ducks (as a model for
waterfowl) and at the cellular level using newly developed in vitro transwell co-culture models of primary
respiratory and intestinal epithelial and endothelial cells of chickens and ducks. Increased knowledge about
HPAIV emergence will fill crucial knowledge gaps on influenza and may provide a point of action to
predict – and thus possibly control - HPAIV emergence and subsequent outbreaks that are threatening
animal and human health."

Cervical cancer incidence is increasing dramatically (2.5% per year) in Puerto Rico (PR), with increased
occurrence of regional (1.7% per year) and distant (4.7% per year) stage cancer, which reflects a real increase
and indicates missed screening opportunities. Unfortunately, 80% of cervical cancer cases diagnosed in PR
occur among low-income women covered by Medicaid or Medicare, who also have a 70% greater likelihood of
being diagnosed with cervical cancer. Cervical cancer screening uptake continues to decline in PR, particularly
among low-income Medicaid enrollees, mainly seen by government clinics. Barriers to cervical cancer
screening in PR are mainly due to personal (lack of transportation, obesity-related embarrassment) and
environmental (repeated disaster events that hampered screening uptake and made recovery slow) factors.
The absence of evidence on the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and budget impact of patient navigators has
limited its adoption among government clinics in this US territory. Multicomponent interventions that can
address common screening barriers and improve screening participation in clinic-based settings or avert the
need for a clinical-based visit could help improve screening uptake and follow-up care. Our preliminary work
suggests the feasibility and acceptability of HPV self-sampling in PR. We now propose a hybrid type 1
effectiveness-implementation study using a four-arm multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted
within government OBGYN clinics in PR. We will assess the effectiveness of patient reminders plus patient
navigation and HPV self-collection (individually and in combination) compared to patient reminders alone in
increasing cervical cancer screening, timely colposcopy, and cervical precancer treatment (Aim 1). The
secondary aim will evaluate key implementation outcomes, including patient and provider receptivity, reach,
level of implementation and fidelity, and sustainment intentions. We will then develop an open-cohort
microsimulation model to evaluate the population impact, cost-effectiveness, and budget impact of alternative
strategies (Aim 2) to inform their potential applicability at delivery organization, community, and territory levels.
This study will provide much-needed knowledge that is necessary to successfully facilitate the adoption and
sustained integration of optimal strategies that will improve cervical cancer screening participation and reduce
magnifying disparities in Puerto Rico."
10851904,"Abnormal and potentially life-threatening blood clotting is seen in other severe infections, such as SARS-
CoV-2, MERS, and H1N1 influenza. Platelets are produced by megakaryocytes. Enhanced
megakaryopoiesis is found in severe COVID-19. Increased megakaryopoiesis is commonly found in
autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
Hypercoagulation also accounts for a significant percentage of mortality and morbidity in cancer patients.
However, the regulation of megakaryocyte differentiation and function, however, remains poorly
understood. The gut microbiome shapes tissue homeostasis beyond the gut through release of
metabolites or microbial ligands. The link between the gut microbiome and megakaryocyte function is
poorly understood. Our preliminary data demonstrate that fiber-fermenting gut bacteria that generate
short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) downregulate the ACE2 receptor, the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2
infection and transmission; SCFA treatment led to reduced viral burdens in both mice and hamsters
following infection with SARS-CoV-2 or a pseudovirus expressing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. In
addition, our work uncovered a potentially novel function of SCFAs in limiting the coagulation response
via the Sh2b3-Mpl axis to modulate megakaryopoiesis and platelet turnover. This proposal aims to define
the role of the gut microbiome in the regulation of megakaryocyte maturation and function at steady state
and in viral infection. This goal will be accomplished with the following 3 Specific Aims: 1. Define the role
of the gut bacteria in steady-state maturation and function of megakaryocytes; 2. Interrogate the role of
the gut microbiome in megakaryocyte maturation and function in viral infection; 3. Define the role of
SCFAs in megakaryocyte maturation and function in homeostasis and viral infection. We will decipher
the SCFA-Sh2b3-Mpl axis in the regulation of megakaryopoiesis and platelet turnover at steady state in
viral infection, and explore the benefit of using SCFA-producing gut bacteria or pectin fiber to control
megakaryocyte response in viral infection.
This work will uncover a link between the gut microbiome and megakaryocyte response at steady state
and in viral infection. Our findings will potentially identify specific gut commensal bacteria or metabolites
that, either directly or indirectly, modulate the maturation of megakaryocytes and function; this knowledge
can be leveraged in the development of therapeutics to treat uncontrolled megakaryopoiesis in various
disease settings. These bacteria and metabolites of interest, including SCFAs as our data supported,
could be additionally used as biomarkers to predict the risk of excessive megakaryopoiesis."

This application seeks the continuation of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC)'s longstanding
and highly successful Cancer Cell Biology Training Program (CCBTP), the flagship and sole predoctoral-only
cancer-focused T32 of UNC's Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center. CCBTP is now in its 25th year. As we
always have more highly qualified applicants than we can accommodate, we request renewed support for all six
predoctoral training slots. The premise of CCTBP is that the biology of cancer cells is an interdisciplinary
biomedical science encompassing experimental approaches and didactic knowledge from diverse fields. The
CCBTP mission is to train the next generation of basic and translational cancer biologists, preparing them to
contribute in both academic and non-academic careers. As a non degree-granting program, CCBTP provides
trainees with unique opportunities beyond their departmental requirements and offerings. In this renewal
application, CCBTP seeks to build on past success, while also recognizing that the landscape of cancer research
and training has entered a new era of very dynamic change. Precision medicine and the genomic era of big data
in cancer research continue to evolve at warp speed. Dramatic improvements in technology have enabled
increased understanding of the contributions of single cells to specific populations, and to the interactions of
cancer cells with their tumor microenvironment of stromal and immune cells. To keep the CCBTP program fresh
and to best address the needs of future cancer biology trainees, we have critically evaluated the program and
remodeled some aspects to keep abreast of this changing landscape. Our refreshed program thus includes a
revised core course on cancer pathobiology and signaling, a new core course developed specifically for CCBTP
on cancer immunology and the tumor microenvironment, and our unique experiential course on targeted cancer
therapeutics. In the past cycle, CCBTP added novel interactions with faculty mentors, improved the diversity
pipeline, and obtained enhanced institutional support. We continue to build on all of these improvements. Going
forward, in addition to continued emphasis on both basic and translational cancer biology, trainees have new
opportunities to develop and utilize their knowledge of state-of-the-art methodologies to profile and dissect the
cancer genome, kinome and proteome; to become familiar with bioinformatics and computational biology; to
engage with the rapidly emerging areas of immunotherapy and the tumor microenvironment; to understand and
apply the most appropriate and useful model systems to study cancer biology; to enhance the rigor and
reproducibility of their research; and to engage thoughtfully with the larger world outside their own labs and
institution. CCBTP trainees describe their community as one of the most important and valuable aspects of their
predoctoral training. The CCBTP serves a vital role in our mission of training to support the pipeline of future
cancer biologists, preparing them to accelerate progress in the understanding and treatment of cancer."
10901908,"Project Summary/Abstract
Meiotic recombination is essential for the reductional cell division in mammalian germ cells and thus for the
development of haploid gametes, i.e., sperm and eggs. Recombination is initiated by hundreds of DNA double-
strand breaks (DSBs) introduced genome-wide that are catalyzed by the SPO11 protein. Faithful transmission
of the genome to subsequent generations requires proper repair of these numerous DSBs, primarily through
recombination with the homolog. DSB formation is regulated in meiotic cells by the ATM kinase, which is
known to be a primary responder to DSBs in mitotic cells, such that in the absence of ATM, meiotic DSBs
increase ~10-fold.
 We recently discovered that meiotic DSBs are at risk for provoking germline rearrangements, in
particular deletions and tandem duplications involving nonhomologous end-joining, especially in the absence of
ATM. These events are consequential in terms of disrupting the genes in which these hotspots occur as well
as the associated PRDM9 binding sites that govern recombination at those loci. Thus, our findings reveal a
previously hidden potential for germline mutagenesis that is likely to affect human health and genome
evolution. In humans, recent long-range sequencing of Icelanders supports this impact. This proposal pursues
aims to understand the mechanisms that give rise to these events, the range of events at meiotic DSBs, and
the effect of age. We hypothesize that other rearrangements are possible at meiotic DSBs than what we have
previously identified. Thus, in the first aim, we propose to determine the range of mutagenic outcomes that can
arise from meiotic DSBs, including long-range deletions and duplications and chromosomal translocations. In
the second aim, we examine factors that may impact the formation of deletions. We focus on the effect of DNA
end processing at two steps, SPO11 removal and end processing, and recombination. Further, we address
whether gaps formed at nearby DSBs are substrates for homologous recombination and the impact of paternal
age in the rearrangement events at meiotic DSBs."

White matter (WM) circuitry is the basis for neuronal communication in the human brain and exhibits robust
abnormalities in all major psychiatric, neurological, and developmental conditions. The ENIGMA consortium has
already performed the largest, most well-powered coordinated studies of WM microstructural variability within
and across several major mental disorders and illnesses. We have already discovered common patterns of
deficits in our most highly powered, and internationally representative studies of severe mental illnesses to date,
including schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD). The overlap in the
patterns of microstructural variation in these disorders also correlate with the overlap in genetic risk suggested
by large scale GWAS. These emerging findings within the ENIGMA consortium motivate a highly-powered,
rigorous, and in-depth study of disease and genetic effects on WM tracts and circuits implicated in severe mental
illnesses. Here we launch an initiative that unites leaders in the fields of neuroimaging harmonization and
analysis, diffusion connectivity, psychiatry, psychiatric genetics, statistical genetics, neuroimaging genetics,
workflow automation, and AI and distributed data science. Our proposed work will extend the collaborative study
of mapping brain-imaging biomarkers and the variability that drives underlying vulnerability to risk of mental
illness. All our findings will be made publicly available, as in all prior ENIGMA studies. Here we extend methods
for the public distribution and dissemination of findings through NeuroDISK - an ontologically integrated, user-
friendly platform, for user-driven sub-analyses based on cohort level meta-data. This innovative framework
enables continuous data integration and updating of findings. In our Specific Aims, our multidisciplinary and
highly productive team of investigators will: 1) perform a global coordinated GWAS of microstructure metrics in
over 100,000 individuals of all ages scanned with diffusion MRI in a discovery and replication framework; 2)
distribute a novel AI-driven protocol to extract and quality control the midsagittal corpus callosum metrics from
the more commonly collected, T1-weighted structural MRIs, to map and harmonize developmental trajectories
of callosal maturation and degeneration across the lifespan; we will accommodate MRI data of research and
clinical quality, and identifying genetic architecture for callosal thickness, area, and curvature; 3) constructing an
integrated ENIGMA-DSI Studio pipeline offering high-throughput tractography and fiber analytic methods on the
DSI-Studio software to identify structural dysconnectivity in ENIGMA working groups on SCZ, BD, MDD; 4)
distribute and disseminate publicly available, containerized tractography and fiber analytic protocols with image
acquisition specific considerations, and means for continuous data integration and analyses in our novel
NeuroDISK framework."

Substance use disorders are prevalent, are associated with serious morbidity and are common causes of
preventable death. Although providers have at their disposal a number of evidence-based treatments, such
treatments tend to be of near-moderate effect size, leaving some patients as non-responders. Work is needed
to enhance existing or develop new treatments with higher effects sizes. This mid-career investigator award in
patient-oriented research would enable Joseph Sakai, MD release from clinical and administrative duties to allow
continued career development activities, to expand his lab’s work on neuromodulation and addiction and to
provide high-quality mentorship to early career investigators. Dr. Sakai is involved in several medication trials for
the treatment of alcohol use disorder and is contact PI for a UG3 award to test deep brain stimulation for
treatment refractory methamphetamine use disorder utilizing a crossover design. This mid-career award, if
funded, would allow Dr. Sakai’s lab to test the safety and feasibility of an accelerated transcranial magnetic
stimulation treatment protocol for methamphetamine use disorder. In addition, this trial would allow effect size
estimation to power a future trial. Each project allows key opportunities for trainee participation and mentorship
as described in the application. Dr. Sakai is director of the CU-Pathways resident research track, which seeks to
develop research-oriented physician scientists in the Department of Psychiatry. Because of that program’s
successes, CU was awarded an R25 to support that track and match 2 residents per year through the NRMP
(Sakai MPI). Dr. Sakai has also been very active with the DPRG T32 post-doctoral research fellowship training
program which was renewed in 2022 (Sakai is associate director, and is primary mentor for 2 post-docs in that
program). Thus, Dr. Sakai has formalized roles within major departmental mentorship programs with a specific
focus on physician scientists; all programs emphasize and value recruitment of individuals from backgrounds
under-represented in medicine."

 Functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) portends a bleak prognosis and is a common
consequence of ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM, NICM), where adverse
annular and left ventricular (LV) remodeling and/or infarction alters mitral valve (MV) function.
Prior studies demonstrate significant increases in mortality risk as severity of FMR increases;
mortality rates range from 15-40% at 1 year. Furthermore, as the prevalence of heart failure
(HF) is rising, FMR is projected to double from over 2 million patients in 2000 to over 4 million
patients in the United States by 2030. Defining FMR severity, optimal timing of intervention, and
most appropriate method for intervention remain controversial. Recently, MITRA-FR and
COAPT trials demonstrated contrasting survival benefit with percutaneous MV repair,
demonstrating the importance and need for more optimal selection criteria. Currently, the patient
selection criteria for Mitraclip therapy are solely based on MV anatomy and controversial
echocardiographic criteria for FMR severity. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) provides an
exciting opportunity to address numerous unmet needs regarding characterizing FMR and the need
for more optimal selection criteria for improving outcomes. Superior accuracy and reproducibility for
quantification of LV size and function, and gold standard tissue characterization, positions CMR as
the ideal imaging modality for comprehensively characterizing FMR and the underlying myopathic
processes that significantly impact response to FMR therapies. The goal of the current research is
to develop personalized risk prediction for FMR patients through explainable unsupervised
phenomapping enriched with advanced CMR imaging biomarkers, and to determine the CMR
predictors of reverse remodeling following modern therapies for FMR."

memory, cognitive function, and brain development. Hebbian plasticity is intrinsically unstable due to its
positive feedback nature, and has to be balanced by homeostatic mechanisms, which maintain the stability of
overall neuronal activity. A major gap in the field concerns the incomplete understanding of cellular pathways
by which neurons maintain homeostasis and how these mechanisms interact with Hebbian plasticity,
especially on fast time scales. Our preliminary data suggest that a recently discovered neuronal membrane
proteasome (NMP) may be involved in the fast homeostatic mechanism in vivo. NMPs are expressed in the
tadpole brain and degrade nascent proteins in vivo. Inhibition of NMP activity led to a rapid increase in
spontaneous neuronal activity and abolished learning-induced behavioral improvement in a visuomotor
behavior paradigm. Activity-induced de novo synthesis of proteins that are important for the expression of
downstream plasticity mechanisms is a hallmark of Hebbian plasticity. We hypothesize that NMP-mediated
degradation of activity-induced nascent proteins serves as a negative feedback mechanism for fast
homeostatic regulation of neuronal activity in response to plasticity-inducing activities. We will test this
hypothesis in a well-established visually driven experience-dependent plasticity paradigm in Xenopus laevis
tadpoles, which allows the combination of biochemical, physiological, molecular genetics, and behavioral
experiments in an intact neural circuit with physiologically relevant sensory stimulation. Most critically, this
experimental system provides the fast temporal resolution that is pivotal for the investigation of the rapid
degradation of nascent proteins by NMPs in vivo. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will use in vivo BONCAT labeling
to characterize the proteolytic activity of NMPs under different activity regimens and use expansion
microscopy to delineate the spatiotemporal expression profile of NMPs in the optic tectum over development.
In Aim 2, we will combine in vivo Ca++ imaging with molecular genetic tools to examine how NMPs regulate
spontaneous and visually-evoked activity in tectal neurons, and determine whether NMP-mediated regulation
of neuronal activity is cell-autonomous. In Aim3, we will use time-lapse structural and functional imaging and
the visual avoidance behavior to assess the functional role of NMPs in experience-dependent plasticity at
both cellular and circuit levels in the visual system. The proposed experiments will generate data for in-depth
understanding of the NMP function in vivo. These results will shed light on a novel proteostasis-based fast
homeostatic mechanism and lay the groundwork for future studies to further elucidate downstream cellular and
molecular pathways underlying the functional interplay between activity-dependent proteostasis of nascent
proteins and experience- dependent plasticity mechanisms."

 Lipid-induced podocyte injury is an emerging molecular pathway contributing to the progression of
glomerular diseases (GDs) of metabolic and non-metabolic origin. Research by others and us has highlighted a
role for impaired reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) and altered sphingolipid metabolism in lipid-induced
podocyte injury in GDs, yet, a common druggable pathway regulating both RCT and sphingolipid metabolism in
podocytes remains to be identified.
 Among several lipoproteins, Apolipoprotein M (APOM) is mainly located in high density lipoprotein (HDL)
particles where it facilitates RCT to HDL but also acts as a chaperone to transport sphingosine-1-phosphate
(S1P) through the circulation. S1P signaling occurs through binding of APOM/S1P complexes to S1P receptors
(S1PR1-5), which regulate many physiological processes, including migration, proliferation, and cell survival.
 We recently demonstrated significantly decreased glomerular APOM (gAPOM) mRNA expression in
patients with GD enrolled in the NEPTUNE cohort. Our new preliminary data show that decreased gAPOM
correlates with decreased plasma APOM (pAPOM), with increased glomerular sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1),
the enzyme that converts sphingosine to S1P, and S1PR4 expression and with eGFR decline. We observed a
similar gene expression pattern in Col4a3 KO mice, a mouse model of GD, and in Col4a3 KO podocytes, which
was associated with glomerular/podocyte cholesterol and S1P accumulation due to impaired RCT and activation
of S1P/S1PR4 signaling leading to increased apoptosis which was prevented by recombinant human APOM
(rhAPOM) treatment. Importantly, the therapeutic effect of rhAPOM in preventing podocyte apoptosis in Col4a3
KO podocytes was superior to SPHK1 or S1PR4 antagonism. Finally, we demonstrate that treatment of human
podocytes with exogenous S1P increases podocyte apoptosis and causes albumin leakage in a microfluid device
as well as in ApoM deficient Col4a3 KO mice.
 Based on these observations, we hypothesize that GDs represent a state of gAPOM deficiency causing
impaired RCT and activation S1P/S1PR signaling in podocytes, thereby causing lipotoxic podocyte injury. We
propose a highly translational approach with three specific aims to 1) investigate if gAPOM deficiency correlates
with the activation of glomerular S1P/S1PR signaling, is associated with decreased pAPOM levels and predicts
outcomes in patients with GD, 2) to investigate the role of podocyte APOM deficiency on RCT and S1P/S1PR4
signaling, and 3) to investigate the therapeutic potential of recombinant human APOM in an experimental model
of GD.
 If successful, this translational study may lead to the clinical development of APOM as a biomarker in GDs
and to the use of recombinant APOM as a novel therapy for GDs."

More than 6 million adults are suffering from heart failure in the United States. Heart failure is associated with
high mortality rate while also reducing the quality of life. Early recognition of heart failure and timely
interventions can help reducing the disease burden to individuals and to overall healthcare system. However,
more than half of HF patients are HF with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF) while the majority
of existing HF treatments are for HF with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF). This is because
HFpEF is a heterogenous syndrome, and its etiology is not well understood. A new NIH-funded initiative,
HeartShare Study, aims to fill this knowledge gap to identify subtypes of HFpEF potentially with different
treatment options using deep phenotyping, multi-omics, and machine learning approach. However, there is still
a need for low cost and accessible tools 1) for screening large patient populations for HFpEF risk to support
preventive risk modification strategies and 2) for identifying HFpEF subtypes to assist targeted therapeutics.
The goal of this ancillary study is to utilize low cost and accessible electrocardiogram (ECG) data via artificial
intelligence (AI) for prediction of incident HFpEF risk and subtyping of prevalent HFpEF.
We and others have shown that AI applied to ECG data can discriminate patients with reduced and preserved
EF with high accuracy [1-5]. We recently developed and validated an ECG-based 10-year HF risk prediction
model using artificial intelligence (AI) [6, 7]. These findings led us to hypothesize that AI applied to ECG data
can predict HFpEF risk and identify specific HFpEF subtypes. The goal of this ancillary study is to test our
hypothesis by leveraging retrospective ECG and clinical data from: a) NIH-funded studies with gold standard
ascertainment of HFpEFand b) real-world ECG and clinical data from three large healthcare systems (WFU-
Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC; UT-University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis,
TN; and LUC-Loyola University Chicago) and c) data from the HeartShare Study. Building on our expertise, we
propose developing ECG-based risk prediction and classification of HFpEF subtypes by completing three
Aims:
Aim 1. Develop an incident HFpEF prediction model using data from NIH-funded studies: We will utilize
high quality and accurate data from NIH-funded studies to develop AI model predicting risk for incident HFpEF.
Aim 2. Develop an incident HFpEF prediction model using real-world Electronic Health Records (EHR)-
derived data: We will first utilize very larger and diverse EHR-based real world data to develop incident
HFpEF risk prediction model. We will then harmonize it with the NIH-data based model via transfer learning.
Aim 3. Develop, test and implement ECG-based HFpEF phenotyping. This aim will utilize data from
prevalent HFpEF patients to classify HFpEF subtypes."

10868745,"Schistosomiasis is by far the most important helminth parasitic disease of humans. Vaccines are unavailable,
the only effective treatment involves repeated dosing with a single drug, and drug resistance is now a major
concern. Schistosomes require aquatic snails for transmission. Mass drug administration alone has proven
ineffective at eliminating schistosomiasis. It is now widely accepted that an integrated approach that includes
targeting the snail stage is essential. Yet current snail control strategies are unsustainable, involving toxic
chemicals or introduced predators or competitors. New approaches are needed to break transmission at the
snail stage. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which snails and schistosomes interact is key for
finding new strategies to interrupt transmission. Yet knowledge about molluscan immunology is far from
adequate, and decades of painstaking research on the molecular basis of snail-schistosome compatibility
have yielded just a handful of candidate genes and mechanisms.
BS90 is a highly resistant strain of Biomphalaria glabrata (Bg) that, until recently, was considered completely
resistant to all known strains of Schistosoma mansoni (Sm). BS90 has been the subject of many functional
studies of why it is so resistant to infection by Sm. So finding the genes behind that trait would be a major
advance. We recently determined that two genomic regions we previously discovered using another snail
population are involved, and that one or more additional loci still need to be mapped.
One strain of Sm can infect some BS90 snails, but there is genetic variation within the outbred BS90
population for susceptibility. In preliminary work we found that a gene in, or linked to, a region we named
PTC2 is involved in this resistance polymorphism. The susceptible haplotype appears to act dominantly,
suggesting that some molecule on the parasite side must bind to something on the host side to evade the
host immune response. Thus, finding the snail protein involved could lead to a key ligand used by
schistosomes to defeat the Bg immune response.
We will use a combination of GWAS and QTL mapping approaches to narrow down (1) the remaining
genomic regions in BS90 snails that make them more resistant to Sm than other populations of snails, and
(2) the region/s that control susceptibility to the one strain of Sm that can infect BS90. We will annotate and
rank candidate genes within each region (based on predicted function and on sequence or expression
difference between haplotypes). Then test candidate genes using RNAi and/or CRISPR knock-out lines.
Identifying new resistance genes will substantially advance our knowledge of snail-schistosome
immunology. We hope to eventually be able to genetically manipulate natural snail populations to make
them less able to transmit schistosomes. Identifying key resistance genes and characterizing their function
will be an essential first step toward that goal."
10932164,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Nearly all provider groups in Medicare’s five-year Oncology Care Model alternative payment program
expressed a goal to reduce hospital use by cancer patients, but very few achieved this. Identifying potentially
avoidable hospital care for cancer patients using diagnosis codes is difficult: depending on the definition used,
20-60% of hospital visits may be avoidable. The leading diagnosis code-based definition is the chemotherapy
outpatient quality measure (OP-35), which collects emergency department (ED) and inpatient admissions with
~300 discharge diagnosis codes into 10 avoidable conditions. Unlike similar measures of avoidable hospital
care for general patients, OP-35 has not yet been clinically validated. While OP-35 allows payers to compare
groups of providers, two issues limit its usefulness to cancer providers: First, clinicians might agree that some
OP-35 conditions (e.g. nausea/vomiting) are treatable in an outpatient or urgent care setting, but that others,
such as hematemesis (bloody vomiting), would be difficult to evaluate outside of a hospital. Second, OP-35
reports only a percentage of hospital visits to each provider group, obscuring what exactly is driving avoidable
hospital use. Based on preliminary work, we propose to develop a classification of actionable scenarios leading
to hospital care (e.g. patient required non-emergent procedure; patient did not call for triage help beforehand)
so that cancer providers can better understand how to reduce this frequent, disruptive, and costly aspect of
treatment. We will assemble an integrated dataset from tumor registry, electronic medical record (EMR), and
regional health information exchange data, for a diverse sample representing a range of cancers across all
insurance types, including the uninsured. This dataset will identifiably link >75% of all hospital visits in a 100-
mile radius of Dallas, TX, to the EMR of three large health systems in the region. Our aims are: Aim 1:
Clinically validate diagnosis code-based measures of avoidable hospital care (including OP-35) with clinician
EMR review; re-categorize hospital visits into actionable scenarios; and specify a new measure for oncology
urgent care-treatable conditions. H1: Most OP-35 defined avoidable will not be avoidable based on clinician
review. H2: Actionable categories of clinical scenarios will be identifiable in the EMR, and can be further
specified by a measure that identifies conditions treatable in an urgent care setting. Aim 2: Prospectively
validate our actionable categories and new oncology urgent care-treatable conditions measure with patients
and ED clinicians using post-discharge interviews. H1: Patients and ED clinicians will largely agree with our
categorizations, with some refinements. Aim 3: Conduct a national survey of cancer provider groups to assess
the feasibility and applicability of our new definitions for avoidable hospital care, in the context of their acute
care management capabilities. H1: A broad range of cancer providers will find our definitions feasible and
useful. Findings from our study will advance quality measurement and data-driven care improvement, and will
be especially useful to participants in Medicare’s upcoming Enhancing Oncology Model payment program."
10924068,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The goal of this project is to dissect the immune evasion mechanisms and enable immunotherapy for children
with high-risk Group 3 medulloblastoma (G3MB) via systems immunology approaches. Brain tumors are the
leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children. Medulloblastoma is the most prevalent malignant pediatric
brain tumor and is characterized by four major molecular subgroups, among which G3MB is the most aggressive
form and features MYC overexpression. The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) is poorly
understood in G3MB, and no immunotherapy is available for children with this high-risk disease. Systems
immunology approaches—especially single-cell and spatial multi-omics profiling and in vivo CRISPR-based
functional screening—have proven powerful in dissecting tumor–TME interactions and identifying novel
immunotherapy targets in various cancer types, but very few studies have integrated these approaches. In our
preliminary studies, we applied two unique immunocompetent genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs)
of MYC-driven G3MB and performed scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq and spatial transcriptomics profiling. We enriched
immune cells from the TME by sorting CD45 positive cells for single-cell studies. Our preliminary analysis of
single-cell and spatial omics data revealed striking interactions of neural stem cell-like tumor cells with
macrophages and other immune cells that potentially create a suppressive TME and drive immune evasion in
mouse G3MB. We also performed in vivo CRISPR screening in tumor cells using the GEMMs to identify
modulators of tumor development, which demonstrated the feasibility of in vivo functional genomics screening
in our preclinical models. In this project, first, we propose to utilize cutting-edge single-cell and spatial omics
technologies to characterize the two G3MB GEMMs at different stages of tumor progression. We will use our
network-based tools to integrate these multi-omics data to dissect the dynamic tumor–immune interactions and
underlying “hidden” drivers that drive the immune exclusion and suppression during G3MB progression. We will
also validate discoveries of G3MB from mouse studies in patient samples. We will develop a cloud-based portal
to visualize and explore our single-cell and spatial data and tumor–TME interactomes of G3MB. Second, we will
establish the mechanistic basis of tumor–T cell interactions and strategies to enable adoptive T cell therapy for
G3MB by discovering functional drivers and putative targets in both tumor cells and T cells. To this end, we will
apply both candidate approach and in vivo CRISPR screening in immunocompetent GEMMs to identify tumor-
intrinsic modulators that will remodel the suppressive TME and sensitize G3MB tumors to adoptive T cell and
CAR-T cell therapies. We will also test if targeting inhibitory factors for T cell function will enable and optimize
effective adoptive T cell therapies against such tumors. Our studies promise to provide new insights into
mechanisms of tumor–TME interactions in G3MB and manifest legitimate immunotherapeutic opportunities."

The liver is responsible for maintaining blood glucose homeostasis. It is able to deposit large amounts of glucose in the
form of glycogen and release glucose rapidly from its glycogen storage when needed. The hepatic glycogen metabolism
maybe altered in diseases such as glycogen storage disorders, diabetes mellitus, and liver cirrhosis. Liver biopsy allows
direct quantification of glycogen concentration, but it is highly invasive and cannot easily be repeated. 13C nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy provides a non-invasive way to detect glycogen in the liver, but it is not
clinically feasible due to the requirement of specialized imaging hardware. Recently, we have discovered a new contrast
mechanism that allows the detection of glycogen based on its nuclear Overhauser enhancement (GlycoNOE). This
method enables us to detect glycogen in vivo using standard MRI hardware. In our initial mice study, we found a linear
relationship between glycoNOE signal and glycogen concentration and demonstrated that the change in liver glycogen
could be measured dynamically. In this project, we aim to develop a new imaging technique to utilize this contrast
mechanism in the human liver. To achieve this we will (1) develop and optimize a fast, 3D free-breathing, fat-water
separated imaging approach that is suitable for glycoNOE detection in the human liver; (2) compare the NOE signal
measured at fed and fasting state to validate that the change in signal reflects the change in glycogen content; and (3)
dynamically measure the change of glycogen upon glucagon injection, which further validates the glycoNOE signal and
also measures the rate of glycogen degradation. The new imaging technology will be applicable to brain and body
imaging based on the nuclear Overhauser enhancement / chemical exchange processes. By providing a non-invasive,
real time measure of the change in glycogen level in the liver, it will be possible to study glycogen metabolism in health
and in diseases such as diabetes mellitus, glycogen storage diseases, and other liver conditions."

Chronic heart failure (CHF) has become epidemic in developed nations accounting for about 6.5 million patients
in the US alone. Although the use of β-adrenergic blocking agents, ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin II receptor
blockers have been highly effective in slowing the progression of the disease and reducing mortality, there
remains an extremely high mortality and morbidity rate for patients diagnosed with CHF. In about half of patients
with CHF, complex ventricular arrhythmias, including non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, are present and
sudden cardiac death (SCD) is common. Abnormalities and alteration in cardiac sympathetic control of the heart
are linked to life threatening arrhythmias, CHF and SCD. Current methods for chemical treatment of
sympathetically mediated arrhythmias offer only short-term (i.e., lasting a few hours to one day) effect by
temporarily blocking stellate ganglion (SG) neuronal activity with local anesthetics (i.e., SG blockade).
Recurrent drug-resistant cardiac arrhythmia patients may be offered surgical stellate ganglionectomy to
permanently remove part of the SG. Although this surgery is effective for removing cardiac arrhythmias, it is not
the first choice of treatment recommended by cardiologists because of the invasive nature of this procedure.
Here, we propose an innovative strategy to chemically ablate the SG function by blocking its surrounding
vascular supply, thereby inducing sympathetic neuronal apoptosis and cell death. In our preliminary study, we
developed an injectable hydrogel delivery system based on FDA approved biopolymers with encapsulating
sunitinib (SU) loaded microspheres. SU is an FDA approved small molecule that has anti-VEGF receptor and
other tyrosine kinase activities for patients with neuroendocrine tumors. We demonstrated that SU could be
sustained released from our delivery system and the released SU could disrupt the in vitro angiogenesis and in
vivo vascular bed after injection into the rat SG. We thus hypothesize that sustained released SU disables the
SG function by disrupting its vascular supply and subsequently reverses the CHF-associated cardiac
arrhythmia (Aim 1) and regulates cardiac remodeling (Aim 2). This application will use highly integrative
techniques to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of SU loaded delivery system, including novel Rosa-tdTomato
flox/flox::Tie2 Cre reporter mouse model, tissue clearance technique, molecular biological techniques and
whole animal experiments (in vivo conscious electrocardiogram telemetry recording, cardiac electrical mapping,
pressure-volume loop analysis). We believe that this proposed research will lay a solid scientific and
technological foundation for developing a new therapy for the patients with CHF and other cardiomyopathy and
improve the quality of life of these patients."
10915575,"PROPOSAL SUMMARY
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a highly prevalent intestinal disorder for which there is currently no cure.
The current treatment is comprised of anti-TNF therapy which alleviates the symptoms but does not target the
cause of the disease. Mutations in the X-linked Inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) have been identified in IBD
patients, suggesting that reduced XIAP activity causes IBD. One of the characteristic manifestations in IBD is
excessive death and damage to the intestinal epithelium, which contributes to intestinal inflammation because
of the compromised intestinal epithelial barrier against luminal microbiota. We propose to target the root cause
of IBD by directly restoring XIAP activity to homeostatic levels in patients with IBD. XIAP is the most potent
inhibitor of caspases and apoptosis. Reduced XIAP is associated with increased activation of the inflammasome
pathway of innate immune host defense and the upregulation of inflammatory tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and
interleukin (IL)-1b cytokines, resulting in hyperinflammation, which is also a characteristic of IBD. We predict
that regaining the normal activity of XIAP in IBD would control the excessive cell death of intestinal epithelial
cells and restore the healthy function and homeostatic turnover of the intestinal epithelium. The studies we
propose here will exploit the pro-apoptotic protein ARTS, which negatively regulates XIAP and promotes its
degradation by the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System. We hypothesize that ARTS serves as an important
therapeutic target for IBD by boosting the reduced activity of XIAP back to normal. Working with murine and
human colonic organoids, we will test the idea that reduced activity of XIAP in cells harboring IBD-associated
mutations can be overcome by inhibition of ARTS. Since expression of ARTS is induced in response to stress
and DNA-damage, this may also account for reduced XIAP activity in IBD patients without XIAP mutations. Thus,
strategies to raise XIAP activity may have broad impact beyond cases in which XIAP mutations are implicated
in IBD. Utilizing a complementary approach, we will modulate the activities of ARTS and XIAP using a proprietary
panel of small-molecule “ARTS-antagonists” and “XIAP-agonists” which we have identified. We seek to provide
proof-of-concept that our “ARTS-antagonists” and “XIAP-agonists” will be able to restore to normal the XIAP
function in cells with IBD-associated XIAP mutations as a novel treatment strategy for IBD. We will also test
these small molecules in an animal model of IBD. We have two specific aims: (1) Determine the role of ARTS
in regulating XIAP-induced apoptosis and inflammation in IBD, and (2) Identify the most potent ARTS-antagonist
and XIAP-agonist small molecules that restore XIAP expression and function in IBD models. Our proposal
provides a radical new approach for regulating XIAP by its natural antagonist ARTS, whose therapeutic
exploitation has not yet been investigated. Our long-term goal is the clinical development of compounds that
reverse damage to the intestinal epithelium and promote mucosal healing for an effective and long-lasting
treatment of IBD."
10730200,"Pneumocystis (PC) pneumonia remains a serious complication of HIV infection and other immunocompromised
states. Recent ICD9/10 data show that since 2008 there are consistently 14-15,000 hospitalizations per year
with an average cost of close to $1B per annum in the US alone. Moreover treatment for PCP has not changed
in 25 years and there is concern of anti-microbial resistance and drug:drug interactions with TMP-SMX (the
frontline therapy for PCP). The well-known inverse relationship between CD4+ lymphocyte count and the risk
of PC infection does not hold all of the answers to mechanisms of host defense against this infection. In the prior
funding period, we made significant progress on defining the Pneumocystis transcriptome in both ascus and
trophozoite forms as well as the surface proteome of both forms through surface labeling of the fungus using
techniques that were developed for Candida. We identified troph proteins such as Meu10, a GPI-anchored
protein, as well as ascus specified proteins such as glucan synthetase 1 (GSC1). We were able to clone and
express the GSC1 ectodomain in yeast, and immunization of mice with GSC1 resulted in antibodies that stain
the surface of the ascus and prevent transmission of Pneumocystis in cohousing experiments. We also made
significant progress on diagnostic assays to discriminate colonization from infection. Several groups ae now
using quantitative PCR with copy number thresholds, which may be a valid approach. In the prior funding period
developed and validated a troph specific assay that selectively eradicates the ascus. Furthermore, RNAseq
analysis revealed the troph to be much more metabolically active than the ascus. Thus, we have developed life-
form specific assays that will be tested in clinical specimens. We hypothesize that GSC1 immunization can
prevent pneumocystis transmission and that mucosal immunization is superior to subcutaneous immunization.
We also predict that GSC1 antisera or monoclonal antibodies directed against the GSC1 ectodomain can
mitigate Pneumocystis IRIS. Moreover, as our RNAseq analysis has also revealed that the troph is clearly the
replicative form of the organism in the lung, we hypothesize that an assay to detect troph specific genes will be
diagnostic of PJP due to the detection of the replicative form of the organism. We will also determine the genetic
heterogeneity of these target genes in samples from 4 continents. We will test this hypothesis with the following
specific aims: Aim 1. Determine the immunogenicity and efficacy of systemic (subcutaneous or IM) versus
mucosal GSC1 immunization to prevent PCP. Aim 2. Determine the efficacy of anti-ascus or anti-troph
antibodies to treat established PCP and immune reconstitution syndrome (IRIS). Aim 3. Determine and validate
life-form specific PCR/CRISPR assays in murine and human samples and assess genetic heterogeneity of these
targets in samples from North America, Africa, and western and eastern Asia."
10844416,"Muscle-directed gene transfer is integral to the treatment of severe muscle degenerative disorders such as
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors represent the most advanced
platform for in vivo gene delivery through intramuscular (IM) injection or systemic delivery to various types of
muscles. A major hurdle for this approach is the potential for immune responses, which may limit the efficacy
and duration of therapy and can also be a source of serious immunotoxicities. Cytotoxic T cell responses against
viral capsid and transgene products and complement activation have been observed in patients. The latter is
likely caused by antibody-capsid complexes that form within days after high-dose systemic delivery. Neutralizing
antibodies (NAb) that form after vector administration persist long-term, tend to be cross-reactive with various
serotypes, and preclude re-administration of the vector. Our most recent collaborative studies in the canine DMD
models illustrate the potential for CD8+ T cell responses against Cas9 nuclease employed in gene editing to
correct muscular dystrophy. It is therefore imperative that we better understand the immune response
mechanisms in AAV muscle gene transfer. To take on this task, we formed a collaborative team that combines
the expertise in basic immune mechanisms of AAV muscle gene transfer with expertise in translational research
in animal models of DMD. Our preliminary studies directly support the hypothesis that innate immune sensing
drives adaptive immunity against the transgene product upon muscle-directed AAV gene transfer, and in
particular CD8+ T cell responses. Depending on vector dose, multiple innate signaling pathways have either
critical or redundant roles. We further hypothesize that vector engineering combined with specific interventions
minimizes deleterious immune responses, thereby preserving therapy. We specifically propose to i) define the
mechanisms that link innate immune sensing to adaptive immune responses in AAV muscle gene transfer; ii)
prevent deleterious immune responses against transduced/gene-edited muscle following systemic AAV vector
delivery, and iii) develop a novel protocol for re-administration of systemic AAV delivery. We will continue to use
a model antigen (ovalbumin) to dissect the response mechanisms in skeletal muscle upon genetic or
pharmacological disruption of these pathways; combine engineering of the vector genome with targeted
interventions; and define the impact of dystrophic muscle on immune responses. We will use our ovalbumin
platform to determine if the mechanisms identified for intramuscular injection also apply to systemic delivery of
liver-detargeted AAV vectors to skeletal muscle. Further, we will evaluate the B and T cell responses against
therapeutic transgene products (micro-dystrophin and Cas9). Finally, we have developed a novel protocol based
on transient antibody-mediated depletion of B cells and the B-cell growth factor BAFF."
10910159,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The male ejaculate of internally fertilizing organisms is a diverse mixture of components including sperm and
numerous other macromolecules that are transferred to females during mating. Research on male contributions
to fertility has mainly focused on sperm, and, more recently on proteins present in the seminal fluid. While these
studies have greatly advanced our understanding of postcopulatory interactions, the relatively high incidence of
idiopathic infertility suggests that investigation of understudied molecules in the ejaculate may yield novel insights
into novel factors mediating reproductive outcomes. We previously discovered the transfer of RNA from males
to females during copulation in Drosophila arizonae. In this proposal, we provide evidence gathered with funding
from our recent R21 award demonstrating translation of male RNA transcripts within cells of the D. arizonae
female reproductive tract. Building off this work, the goals of the proposed research are to establish functional
effects of seminal fluid RNAs on the female postmating response (Aim 1), investigate how they function in
females (Aim 2), and identify the source and mechanisms by which they are packaged in males (Aim 3). We
capitalize on unique aspects of our D. arizonae/D. mojavensis study system that combine to make a genetically
tractable, manipulative experimental system that is particularly well suited to investigate the function of male
RNA within the female reproductive tract. With this powerful system we combine proteomic analyses using our
recently developed Variant Assisted SILAC Proteomic Analysis (VASPA) approach with detailed investigations
of individual mdFTPs (male-derived female translated proteins). Given that RNA appears to be a conserved
feature of male ejaculates, we expect our findings will have broad significance for better understanding
postcopulatory interactions across a range of species, including humans."

Early alcohol use is associated with many negative psychosocial and health outcomes and delaying initiation of
drinking and promoting effective harm reduction remains an important public health goal. Parents are an early
potent source of alcohol socialization. Though parental modeling of drinking has been studied extensively,
much less research has considered other ways in which parents socialize youth about alcohol (alcohol-specific
socialization). This proposal focuses on prevalent modes of alcohol-specific socialization, discussions about
the risks of alcohol and sipping/tasting alcohol with parental supervision. An alarming finding is that these
modes of parental alcohol-specific socialization are not uniformly protective, and in fact, can increase risk for
drinking. It is critically important to understand the reasons underlying these unexpected findings as this has
enormous implications for guidance provided to parents. Interpersonal interactions are the medium through
which parent socialization operates, and we propose that it is necessary to consider the quality and nature of
parent-adolescent dyadic interactions to fully understand parent alcohol-specific socialization and harm
reduction efforts. This study builds on interpersonal theory to characterize the quality and nature of parent-
adolescent dyadic interactions using (1) continuous assessment of interpersonal dynamics (CAID) during
discussions about alcohol and (2) assessments of parenting style to address the following aims using a
longitudinal sample of 250 early adolescent-parent dyads: (1) Characterize parent-child dyadic interactions
during discussion of alcohol and other topics using CAID; (2) Test the association of frequency of parent-child
alcohol risk discussions and sipping/tasting alcohol with trajectories of adolescent attitudes and beliefs about
alcohol (cognitive susceptibility to drinking) and trajectories of alcohol use, and whether characteristics of
dyadic interactions and parenting style moderate these associations; (3) Test adolescent alcohol attitudes and
beliefs (cognitive susceptibility to drinking) as potential mediators of associations with alcohol use described in
aim 2; (4) Test change in parent-adolescent dyadic interactions and parenting style during the transition from
early to middle adolescence and the association of these changes with in alcohol use. Addressing these aims
will provide much needed clarity on parent alcohol-specific socialization and provide guidance for more
effective public health messaging and preventive interventions.
Evidence for parental harm reduction efforts to reduce risk for underage drinking is mixed. The proposed
research addresses a critical need to clarify parent-adolescent interpersonal dynamics that render prevalent
parental harm reduction efforts protective or risk enhancing. Findings from this study will inform public health
messages and preventive intervention approaches to consider not just what parents should say and do to
reduce teen drinking, but how they implement harm reduction strategies."
10892866,"High risk for premature mortality is one of the most pressing issues faced by the growing population of aging
autistic adults. Autistic adults are disproportionately more likely to have chronic conditions, leading to increased
risk for mortality compared to the general population. However, one major barrier to identifying those at greatest
risk for mortality is the absence of accurate predictive tools for this population. Our objective is to establish a
novel, machine-learning derived mortality risk index for autistic older adults. We will leverage our team’s unique
expertise in autism aging research, population-level administrative data analysis, and machine learning to
achieve our specific aims: (Aim 1) identify comorbidities and geriatric complaints that differentially influence time-
to-mortality for autistic and non-autistic older adults; (Aim 2) compare existing mortality risk indices to a novel,
autism-specific index for predicting autistic older adults’ risk of mortality; (Exploratory Aim 3) determine the
distribution of mortality risk among autistic older adults in local healthcare systems as a precursor for prospective
studies. We will achieve these aims through the synergistic use of national administrative billing data and local
electronic health records data. In Aim 1, we will apply a machine learning technique called “logic forest” in an
innovative way to identify specific comorbidities and age-related conditions, or combinations thereof, that
differentially influence time-to-mortality among autistic and non-autistic older adults using the most recent nine
years of national Medicare data. In Aim 2, we will apply a stochastic hill climbing optimization technique, a type
of machine learning, to national Medicare data to develop an algorithm-based index that quantifies autistic older
adults’ risk of mortality based on comorbidities and demographic characteristics. We will compare the predictive
validity of our novel autism-specific algorithm-based index to the Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidity indices,
the gold-standards of mortality risk measurement among the general population. Last, in Exploratory Aim 3 we
will obtain sample size estimates for prospective studies by quantifying mortality risk among aging autistic adults
in two large healthcare systems using the Charlson, Elixhauser, and our novel autism-specific mortality risk
indices. Findings of this study will have practical applications for researchers to identify participants for
prospective observational and intervention studies and clinicians to identify high-risk cases for special
management and intervention. This study is responsive to NOT-AG-21-020 in that we will analyze existing
Medicare claims data to examine “subgroups of older adults with special needs” and “health outcomes in complex
multimorbid older adults”. Further, this study is aligned with the NIA’s Strategic Plan as we seek to “understand
disparities related to aging and [inform] strategies to improve the health status of older adults” on the autism
spectrum. This project will have a high public health impact yielding critical new information about mortality risk
among a historically understudied aging population that can ultimately be used to improve life-expectancy among
autistic people."
10890166,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Naturally occurring osteosarcoma in dogs has been proposed as a promising translational platform to serve as
an intermediary between mouse studies and human clinical trials because it develops in the presence of a fully
intact immune system and demonstrates a similar clinical progression to the human disease. Furthermore,
canine osteosarcoma is a naturally occurring, heterogenous disease that recapitulates the spectrum of
histopathologic, immunologic, and genomic complexity of the disease in humans. However, despite the promise
of the dog model, the true translational potential of this model remains unproven and important species
differences in overall outcomes exist that are often not accounted for in the traditional design of translationally
focused dog trials. To optimize the design and translational impact of canine osteosarcoma trials moving
forward, this proposal seeks to establish the breadth and range of natural outcomes for this disease together
with deep characterization of the tumor microenvironment and immune landscape. To attain these objectives,
we propose the following two aims, 1) Determine natural disease progression and outcomes in a
contemporaneous prospectively enrolled population of dogs treated surgically for naturally occurring
osteosarcoma, and 2) Inform optimal design and establish biologically based outcome assessments for
translational canine osteosarcoma studies. This work will enroll client-owned dogs with naturally occurring
osteosarcoma through the NCI Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium (COTC), a well-established trials
network of veterinary academic institutions. In addition to primary clinical outcome measures for dogs treated
with surgery alone, deep characterization of the tumor microenvironment and immune landscape will allow us to
better understand the impacts of inherent biology and chemotherapy resistance, define the role of the immune
system in the natural progression of disease, and to compare molecular and immune signatures between pre-
existing human and canine osteosarcoma datasets. Hence, this canine trial paired with correlative bio-marker
studies are aimed to expand and improve the utility of the canine osteosarcoma model by ensuring that future
dog trials can be optimally designed to provide reliable information for the benefit of human patients with
chemotherapy resistant osteosarcoma."
10931548,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Patients with aggressive cancers often present with no pharmacologically actionable mutations and poor or no
sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade, thus deriving only modest improvement in disease-free survival from
targeted therapy and immunotherapy. Tumor heterogeneity adds further complexity by fostering reprogramming,
adaptation, selection, and ultimately expansion of drug-resistant cells, as well as emergence of an
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), both of which are ultimately responsible for patient relapse
and poor outcome. Addressing these challenges—i.e., identifying more universal, mechanism-based targets for
pharmacological intervention and assessing their potential value in highly heterogeneous tumors—is critically
dependent on the availability of accurate, comprehensive, and cell type-specific molecular interaction networks
(cellular networks, hereafter), which underlie both the cell-autonomous behavior of cancer cells and their
interaction with other TME subpopulations. The proposed Cancer Systems Therapeutics (CaST) Center, will
continue its highly productive collaboration within the U54 Cancer Systems Biology Center (CSBC) network by
extending its successful network-based methodologies—which integrate cutting edge computational advances
and novel experimental technologies, including use of 3D structure and multi-omics-based evidence. This will
support studying cancer as a fully integrated system of co-evolving, interacting subpopulations, comprising both
molecularly distinct, coexisting malignant cell states as well as non-malignant cell states recruited to the tumor
microenvironment and potentially reprogrammed to implement a pro-malignant, immunosuppressive milieu. The
ultimate goal of this proposal is to leverage recent advances by CaST center investigators to elucidate the
Mechanism of Action of clinically relevant drugs and late-stage experimental compounds to target individual
subpopulation to either drive combination therapy or to rescue immunotherapy in drug resistant tumors."

10932922,"Abstract: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most common inflammatory skin diseases with an estimated
prevalence approaching 5% in adults and is typically characterized by pediatric onset, pruritis and persistance.
Research has indicated that AD is associated with an impaired epithelial barrier that promotes sensitization to
environmental antigens and a type II immune response. Despite advances in AD research, the causative
mechanism(s) leading to the persistent type II immune response remain unclear. Our recent publication and
Prel Data indicate that the dermis and subcutis contain fibroblasts that appear to be involved in establishing type
II inflammatory reactions in skin. Understanding how dysregulation of skin fibroblasts contributes to
downstream events that they may intitiate formation of inflammatory AD-like lesions is the focus of this
proposal.
Our Prel Data show that dysregulation of NF-kB signaling in Prx1+ fibroblasts leads to upregulation of CEBPb
in fibroblasts, upregulation of CCL11 and tissue eosinophilia followed by type II skin lesions resembling human
AD. Our mouse model shares many similarities with human AD-like lesions involving both the dermis and
epidermis at the histologic, cellular and molecular levels. Prel Data compares single cell RNAseq analysis from
our study with published scRNAseq databases from human AD lesions. scRNAseq analysis from our model and
human AD show fibroblast dysregulation involving CCL11 and CEBPb. Moreover, using RNAScope we have also
shown that validated human AD samples contain increased numbers of dermal fibroblasts co-expressing CEBPb
and CCL11 compared to matched control human skin, also consistent with our murine model. Thus, we propose
novel preclinical and translational studies (Aim 1) to define molecular mechanisms by which fibroblast
dysregulation mediated by CEBPb induces an inflammatory phenotype in these cells. Aim 2 will determine the
role of eosinophil infiltration as a key intermediate for triggering type II immune response in AD-like skin. Aim
3 will use spatial transcriptomics (GeoMX) and RNA seq to explore equivalent mechanisms in human fibroblasts
and AD specimens and translational studies using inhibitors as potential treatments for AD. We expect the
proposed studies along with recent reports in the literature to contribute to a paradigm shift in understanding
AD pathogenesis regarding fibroblast dysregulation and contribute to development of new therapeutic
interventions that may prevent the development of AD."

 Volumetric muscle loss (VML) is a debilitating injury caused by trauma or disease to skeletal muscle that
leads to incapacitating fibrosis and loss of limb function. We and others have identified delayed clearance of
apoptotic neutrophils as a primary mediator of fibrosis via detrimental effects on satellite cell and macrophage
behavior. Because macrophages are critical regulators of wound healing and also the primary cell type that clear
apoptotic neutrophils in a process called efferocytosis, macrophage cell therapy is a promising therapeutic
approach, but is limited by two main challenges: 1) Macrophages are highly plastic cells that rapidly shift
phenotype in response to microenvironmental cues. Therefore, a strategy is needed to control their phenotype
in situ following administration, to prevent them from changing phenotype in response to pro-inflammatory cues
at the site of injury. 2) High manufacturing costs and regulatory hurdles prevent the use of autologous (patient-
derived) macrophages, especially because very high numbers are required, but allogeneic (donor-derived)
macrophages elicit a strong T cell-mediated adverse immune response. We developed an innovative
biomaterial-mediated macrophage cell therapy strategy that simultaneously addresses both of these challenges.
In this strategy, referred to as Particle-Assisted Control over Macrophage-Neutrophil interactions (Pac-Man), the
macrophages are first loaded ex vivo with polymeric biodegradable microparticles that slowly release
dexamethasone intracellularly, thus controlling macrophage phenotype from the inside out following their
administration to sites of injury. Dexamethasone was selected because it causes an anti-inflammatory/pro-
regenerative phenotype in macrophages, increases their efferocytosis of apoptotic cells, and suppresses their
ability to activate T cells. Thus, the intracellular release of dexamethasone following administration of the
macrophages to sites of injury is expected to make them clear detrimental neutrophils, resolve inflammation, and
suppress T cell activation to prevent rejection of allogeneic cells. In Aim 1, the functional phenotype of the
adoptively transferred Pac-Man macrophages will be rigorously characterized over time in vitro and in vivo using
flow cytometry, gene expression profiling, and analysis of their interactions with apoptotic neutrophils. Effects on
muscle repair will be assessed using histology and functional mechanical testing. In Aim 2, the potential to use
an allogeneic cell source will be tested in vitro and in vivo using primary human immune cells from mixed donors
and mice from different strains. This project will advance an innovative off-the-shelf, translational cell therapy to
enhance clearance of apoptotic cells, which would be transformative for the treatment of fibrotic injuries such as
VML and many others."

 Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a common and commonly devastating form of human epilepsy that lacks
preventive or disease modifying therapy. An estimated 30% suffer recurrent seizures despite symptomatic
treatment with anticonvulsants. One cause of TLE is status epilepticus (SE). Defining the molecular
mechanisms by which SE induces TLE promises to identify molecular targets for therapies. We therefore
conducted extensive target validation experiments which revealed TrkB-PLCγ1 as a druggable molecular
target that can prevent TLE in adult mice. The goal of our drug discovery program is to develop small molecule
inhibitors for TrkB-PLCγ1 signaling to treat TLE. With the support of Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network
(BPN), we identified multiple compounds within distinct series with demonstrated in vivo efficacy for inhibition
of TrkB-PLCγ1 signaling in mouse brain. Our Specific Aims are to benchmark, expand, and optimize novel
small molecule inhibitors of TrkB-PLCγ1 signaling. Successful completion of the work proposed will identify a
leading series for entry to the Discovery Phase of BPN program."

New pandemic influenza A virus (IAV) strains can arise when mutations enable host adaptation. Mutations that
overcome host range restrictions are important in viral emergence and zoonotic infections. Zoonotic spillover
into humans with avian IAV subtypes, such as H5N1 and H7N9, have mortality rates as high as 60%. While
significant progress has identified many mutations that allow IAV to adapt to new host species, we have an
incomplete understanding of the depth of viral mutations generated during viral replication. Defining the
heterogeneity of viral mutations will shed light on the viral genetic diversity that enables zoonotic spillover.
Critically, IAV infection in humans occurs in heterologous cell populations in the respiratory tract that correlate
differently with the likelihood of virus transmission. Single cell analysis of these different cell types with both
human and avian IAV strains will allow us to explore how virus strain and cell type influences viral diversity.
Drop-based microfluidics is a method in which the host cell and virus are compartmentalized within picoliter-
sized drops, creating millions of micro-environments, allowing for high-throughput analysis. Drop-based
microfluidics therefore provides an ideal platform for the study of viral genetic diversity from fast evolving RNA
viruses in the laboratory. Our long-term objective is to understand the evolution of IAV that leads to host
adaptation, virulence, transmission, and ultimately zoonotic spread. To begin to address this long-term
objective we will evaluate single cell IAV genomic heterogeneity by 1.) quantifying the genetic diversity arising
from avian and seasonal human IAV infections of individual human primary cells and 2.) performing
evolutionary studies by serial passaging IAV viruses at a single cell level. These two independent, but
complementary aims are directed at understanding: (Aim 1) how specific cell types impact viral genetic
diversity and zoonotic risk, and (Aim 2) how viral diversity evolves when system and population level
bottlenecks are altered. The proposed research will broadly impact the field of single cell virology by
characterizing the role that viral diversity plays in virus propagation, transmission, and evolution. These studies
will yield fundamental mechanistic insights into virus-host cell dynamics, which may aid in developing
efficacious vaccines and therapeutics that can target rapidly evolving IAV and other RNA viruses."

The Michigan Center for Contextual Factors in Alzheimer’s Disease (MCCFAD) aims to foster and
enhance innovative research in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) with the
long term goals to 1) advance ADRD-relevant social and behavioral science research in
underserved and underrepresented communities while; 2) diversifying the research workforce
dedicated to healthy aging. This Center builds on a longstanding commitment to advance Diversity, Equity,
Inclusion and Access (DEIA), as well as deep existing infrastructure and research strengths in ADRD and
aging research at the University of Michigan (UM). The Center focuses on the contexts in which ADRD is
experienced. Knowledge concerning the contexts of ADRD is quite limited but has been shown to be critical for
elucidating sociocultural, economic and behavioral contributors to and consequences of health disparities
generally and ADRD disparities specifically. The MCCFAD emphasizes ADRD research in three priority areas:
epidemiology, health economics, and culturally sensitive care. The rationale for these three areas is directly
related to the continued lack of a comprehensive understanding of the contextual complexities inherent in
ADRD disparities, the need to enhance diversity in the professional research workforce addressing the brain
and cognitive health of older adults, as well as dynamic changes in the demographic and multi-cultural
composition of the U.S. population. The MCCFAD promotes diversifying the research workforce dedicated to
healthy aging through collaborations with other NIA-sponsored Centers and programs via connections with R1,
R2 and doctoral/professional universities in Michigan, and by administering inclusive and accessible
educational programs for diverse scholars. The Center’s four Cores are: Leadership and Administrative (LAC),
Research and Education (REC), Analytic (AnC), and Community Liaison and Recruitment (CLRC). Specific
aims are to: (1) Advance ADRD-relevant disparities research in epidemiology, health economics, and
culturally-sensitive care; (2) Recruit and mentor 15 AD-RCMAR Scientists (RS) from the pilot-study investigator
stage through professional publications and independent research applications and funding; (3) Connect with
Middle Eastern North African (MENA) and Latino communities to broaden understanding of intra- and inter-
cultural factors affecting participation in ADRD research. The Center profits from the groundbreaking,
successful work of their extensive network of experienced mentors and experts. These resources, along with
planned structure and activities will ensure that the MCCFAD will continue to have a significant impact in
diversifying the research workforce dedicated to healthy aging while enhancing research to better understand
AD and related forms of dementia across various contexts."

interactions, communication, and information flow. Further, it leverages existing resources at the University of
Michigan (UM) and partner institutions (Michigan State University, Wayne State University, Oakland University,
UM-Dearborn) to enable unique linkages for collaborative mentoring and research. Fundamental to the Center
are the pilot projects of the AD-RCMAR Research Scientists. Therefore, the LAC provides oversight and
support for the solicitation and selection of pilot projects for funding and for the recruitment of Research
Scientists for the Center’s Enrichment and Summer Data Immersion programs. This AD-RCMAR focuses on
social and behavioral research that examines contextual factors that influence the experience of ADRD among
different groups. To conduct high quality research in these areas, research should include community
members in all aspects of the research. In conjunction with the Community Liaison and Recruitment Core, the
LAC will continue to build and sustain community partnerships in the most culturally sensitive and appropriate
manner possible. And finally, the LAC ensures organizational and fiscal integrity, program effectiveness, and
compliance with all relevant rules, regulations, and ethical principles. We maximize the use of technology to
implement a structure of segmented responsibility and strong oversight that includes counsel from Internal and
External Advisory Boards as well as Community Partner Boards and Health Professional Steering Committees.
In sum, the LAC oversees, manages, directs, and supports all other MCCFAD Cores to assure that it enriches
the conduct and quality of research on contextual factors in ADRD and ADRD inequalities while also increasing
the diversity of the ADRD workforce."

generation of faculty conducting health research with American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations.
Since 1998, 54 NERC Scientists (51 AI/AN) have accrued over $300 million in sponsored research and published
590 articles, and 26 are now tenured faculty. We propose to continue the mission of NERC, submitted by the
Washington State University as a new application that reflects an institutional transition, and expand to include
research with Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders. The Community Health and Aging in Native Groups of
Elders (CHANGE) RCMAR will be led by 2 MPIs who each bring unique experiences and strengths to the
program. Dr. Buchwald, MD, NERC Program Director since 1998, is a Professor in Washington State
University’s College of Medicine and Director of the Institute for Research and Education to Advance Community
Health. Julie Baldwin, PhD (Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma), is a Regents’ Professor of Health Sciences and
Director of the Center for Health Equity Research at Northern Arizona University. A renowned Native scientist,
she has 3 decades of experience leading health research with American Indian partners. Together, they will
provide day-to-day and long-term leadership and oversight for all CHANGE components. The Specific Aims of
this Core are to: 1) Support logistical operations, including but not limited to a) monitor adherence to required
institutional, tribal, and federal policies and procedures; b) supervise fiscal activities and budget management;
c) work with the REC to proactively recruit Native and other underrepresented minority early-stage investigators;
and d) facilitate collaboration with the other RCMARs and the RCMAR Coordinating Center; 2) Implement and
monitor activities, including to a) coordinate communication and effort within and between all CHANGE
components; b) compile and disseminate program materials to CHANGE stakeholders; c) conduct program
review and process evaluation to ensure appropriate and high-quality outcomes; and d) generate progress
reports and respond to ad hoc requests from the RCMAR Coordinating Center and NIA; 3) Supervise interactions
with regulatory bodies and sponsors, including to a) formalize agreements with community partners and Pilot
Study participants; b) monitor Pilot Study administration, budgets, and compliance with Institutional Review
Board and tribal review requirements; and c) promote collaboration with other NIH-funded programs and
scientists engaged in aging research; and 4) Embed community outreach and engagement throughout the
Center, including to a) engage with tribal providers and healthcare systems; b) ensure culturally desirable

10912026,"ANALYSIS CORE ABSTRACT
By virtually any measure, elderly American Indians, Alaska Natives, (AI/ANs) and Native Hawaiian and Pacific
Islanders (NHPIs) are at higher risk than elderly non-Hispanic Whites for numerous acute and chronic illnesses.
As displaced Indigenous people, they are affected by certain social determinants of health that present
intractable barriers to health equity. In 2021 life expectancy for AI/ANs (72 years) was lower than for Blacks (75
years), Whites (79 years), and Hispanics (82 years). In the same year, the National Center for Health Statistics
noted that life expectancy could not be estimated for NHPIs due to unreliable death certificate data. A diverse
scientific workforce enhances the quality and impact of public health research with underserved populations, and
for many years the NIH has sponsored programs aimed at increasing the number of underrepresented minority
Principal Investigators in its ranks. However, AI/AN and NHPI Principal Investigators continue to account for a
miniscule fraction of academic health research faculty, and in the higher ranks (e.g., Full Professor and
administrative leadership) they are nearly nonexistent. The Community Health and Aging in Native Groups
of Elders (CHANGE) Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) is a continuation of the Native
Elder Research Center RCMAR. Its goals are to recruit, train, and nurture a highly diverse cadre of early-stage
investigators, referred to as CHANGE Scientists, who are pursuing careers dedicated to Native aging and Native
Elders’ health research. The program will recruit 3 Scientists in each of 3 cohorts (9 total). Cohorts progress
together through an 18-month curriculum comprising a 12-month Pilot Study and a 6-month grant writing
program. The CHANGE Analysis Core’s Specific Aims are to: 1) offer state-of-the-art support research
methods support to optimize the study design, measurement, data quality, and scientific validity of data analysis
for CHANGE Pilot Studies; 2) provide mentoring, deliver didactic instruction, facilitate networking, and support
grant writing for CHANGE Scientists; 3) demonstrate applied principles of community-based participatory
research by adopting our novel 5-step rubric for quantitative methodologists; and 4) analyze program evaluation
data collected by the Leadership and Administrative Core and by the Research and Education Component,
catalog and disseminate CHANGE products, and collaborate with the RCMAR Coordinating Center to optimize
the RCMAR initiative’s impact. The Analysis Core team offers expertise in epidemiology, biostatistics,
demography, and qualitative research methods. Core Faculty have many years of experience providing
quantitative and qualitative methods support for Native health research studies led by AI/AN and NHPI Principal
Investigators in collaboration with community partners, and they have a strong track record of mentoring Native
and other underrepresented minority early-stage investigators, including RCMAR Scientists. The Analysis Core
will work to ensure that CHANGE Pilot Studies yield accurate, reliable data; and to promote CHANGE Scientists’
professional development and NIH-funding success."
10912773,"Project Summary – Overall
Receiving high-quality, equitable, accessible, affordable, and well-coordinated health care is fundamental to
the health, wellbeing, function, and independence of older adults, but the current U.S. health care system is not
organized to provide this care. Services are often inaccessible or unaffordable, with persistent structural
barriers that perpetuate unequal access. There is a critical need to grow and support a well-trained scientific
workforce to address these shortcomings and disseminate findings effectively. The Center for Improving
Care Delivery for the Aging (CICADA), a Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) at the
University of Pennsylvania (Penn), is dedicated to these objectives.
In its first funding period, CICADA succeeded in developing a robust learning and longitudinal mentoring
environment for 15 RCMAR Scientists from underrepresented and minoritized backgrounds. Our focus has
been on health services research (HSR), an interdisciplinary scientific field that studies the most effective ways
to organize, manage, finance, and deliver high-quality care; reduce medical errors; and improve health equity.
HSR spans the investigation and discovery of gaps in evidence-based care delivery, the development of
evidence-based interventions to address those gaps, and the study of factors that influence and promote the
uptake and sustainment of evidence-based treatments into routine practice via implementation science. Taken
together, HSR approaches strive to ensure that all aging adults receive high-quality, equitable, evidence-
supported health care and maintain or improve their health and wellbeing as they age.
HSR is particularly in need of concerted efforts to increase representation in its workforce. This has scientific
and clinical costs, as underrepresented and minoritized researchers bring essential perspectives to help
understand and address the sociocultural, economic, political, and environmental determinants of racial and
ethnic inequities in health and health care. Developing a population-representative cadre of researchers and
leaders who can address the challenges and inequities facing aging populations is an absolute priority.
Based in Penn’s Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics (LDI), a cooperative venture that spans all 12
schools and centers at Penn, CICADA has offered exceptional training in quantitative and econometric
methods and supported the next generation of researchers and mentors. In recognition of ongoing needs in the
field, our renewal application seeks to continue and build upon these activities. The overall Specific Aims for
CICADA are: (1) To enhance the diversity of the aging-focused research workforce by mentoring promising
scientists from underrepresented and minoritized groups for careers dedicated to improving health care
delivery and health equity for older adults; and (2) to develop and sustain infrastructure to promote science that
improves the health, wellbeing, function, and independence of older adults—particularly minoritized older
adults—through transformation in health care delivery, with the goal of achieving health equity."
10912774,"Project Summary – Leadership and Administrative Core
This proposed renewal of the Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) at the University of
Pennsylvania (Penn)—the Center for Improving Care Delivery for the Aging (CICADA)—aims to train emerging
scientists from minoritized and underrepresented backgrounds in the interdisciplinary science of equity-
integrated health services research (HSR), an interdisciplinary scientific field focused on improving
organization, management, financing, and delivery of high-quality care and improving health equity. Over the
initial funding cycle, CICADA’s Leadership and Administrative Core (LAC) has united and led a diverse
team of experts to achieve the Center’s overall aims: (1) to enhance the diversity of the aging-focused
research workforce by mentoring promising scientists from underrepresented and minoritized groups for
careers dedicated to improving health care delivery and health equity for older adults and (2) to develop and
sustain infrastructure to promote science that improves the health, wellbeing, function, and independence of
older adults—particularly minoritized older adults—through transformation in health care delivery, with the goal
of achieving health equity.
To accomplish this, the LAC will continue to oversee the Center’s Research Education Component (REC) and
Analysis Core, and to ensure that we achieve the Specific Aims of each core. The LAC will work closely with
the leaders of these three components (CICADA’s “core faculty”), who comprise the Center’s Executive
Committee, to ensure success. The LAC will also continue to work in close partnership with Penn’s institutional
partners (through the Internal Advisory Board), and with national experts in aging and equity-integrated HSR
(through the External Advisory Board). These groups will meet regularly with CICADA leadership and provide
guidance and evaluation of progress toward meeting the overall Aims of the Center. The LAC will also leverage
the resources of Penn’s Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics to ensure CICADA’s success.
In this renewal application, the LAC will build on our prior successes and establish and build on an existing
strong relationship between Penn and Meharry Medical College, an Historically Black College and University.
With Meharry as an affiliated institution and partner, the LAC will oversee CICADA as it takes an equity-first
approach to recruiting and selecting a diverse and talented group of scientists and then training and mentoring
them during their time with CICADA and beyond, so that they may become future leaders in equity-integrated
HSR focused on aging. The LAC has three Specific Aims (1) To advance CICADA’s goals by overseeing,
managing, and coordinating Center activities; (2) To provide leadership to advance discoveries in equity-
integrated HSR at Penn, focused on improving health care delivery and health for aging adults; (3) To foster
and integrate diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) into all aspects of the CICADA environment,
taking an “equity-first” approach to Scientist mentoring and development."
10912775,"Project Summary – Analysis Core
The Analysis Core of the proposed renewal of Penn’s Center for Improving Care Delivery for the Aging
(CICADA) fosters rigorous inquiry in health services research (HSR) and related quantitative and qualitative
skill development by developing infrastructure to promote advances that improve the health, wellbeing,
function, and independence of older Americans, particularly minoritized older adults. The renewed Analysis
Core will build on its current focus on health economics and quantitative skills by adding new capacity in
qualitative, mixed methods, and implementation science approaches. These additions will expand our ability to
promote cutting-edge research methods that center the voices of patients and communities who have been
traditionally underserved in the health care system, in support of true transformation in health care delivery. It
will also equip Scientists with a full suite of HSR skills needed to understand and address complex, multilevel
contextual factors contributing to the health and wellbeing of older Americans. The Analysis Core lowers these
barriers to entry for new Scientists and CICADA Alumni by leveraging Penn’s unique resources. Providing
access to these resources enables RCMAR Scientists to develop into productive, independent, equity-
integrated investigators focused on aging. With these unparalleled resources, CICADA is able to recruit the
most talented researchers in the field from minoritized and underrepresented groups, for training and
mentorship to address the equity and health services issues confronting aging populations.
The Analysis Core has developed, supported, and maintained a CICADA research infrastructure of data
resources, analysis support, and methodological expertise that is easily accessible to RCMAR Scientists and
CICADA Alumni. To support this, our four Specific Aims are: (1) To support RCMAR Scientists with resources
for quantitative research including datasets for conducting high-quality, high-impact research on health care
delivery for aging populations, particularly minoritized older adults; access to skilled data analysts; and a high-
capacity, secure computing environment; (2) To provide RCMAR Scientists with resources for qualitative and
mixed methods research including data collection, transcription, analysis, and interpretation; (3) To train
RCMAR Scientists in the methodological skills necessary for independent careers in equity-integrated HSR,
through individualized mentorship and training in quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods approaches that
are tailored to their research and career goals; (4) To extend Analysis Core consultation services to all
CICADA Alumni, to support their ongoing science related to improving health care delivery in aging and
strengthen the CICADA network."
10895466,"The overall goal of this proposal is to use a social network measurement methodology (Network Canvas)
to capture expanded definitions of family caregivers related to people living with Alzheimer’s disease
and related dementias (AD/ADRD), with special focus on positive/negative relationship aspects. This
proposed methodology will advance PWD-caregiver dyad research to encompass measuring real-world
PWD-caregiver networks. Among people living with Alzheimer’s disease (PWD), there is a significant
population heterogeneity in how individuals define “family” caregivers. Most studies concentrate on the
caregiver-PWD dyad with one singular primary caregiver. This dyad approach may not be represent
real-life, since multiple family members and friends support the care of PWD. Multiple caregivers may
also have differing ideas of obligation, expectations of care, and positive/negative aspects of care. Our
prior research has shown that interactions between caregivers can be positive (e.g., teamwork to
convince PWD to accept help) or negative (e.g., conflicts causing emotional distress). There is a lack
of research on how these interpersonal interactions can be measured on a network level. To mitigate
these relationship measurement gaps, our team has built a free, open-source, NIH funded software
suite for researchers called Network Canvas, that identifies and maps social network data. We aim to:
Aim 1. Measure and map the social network of caregivers of PWD using the Network Canvass
methodology, to examine the population heterogeneity in how individuals define “family” caregivers.
Aim 2. Measure network predictors of positive wellbeing for caregivers and PWD. We will conduct a
large multi-site (IL, IN, HI) study of 200 PWD caregiver networks (up to 1000 people) - using snowball
recruitment to identify/interview members of the networks – and the Network Canvas methodology.
Recruitment will be through interdisciplinary community partners, physician offices, and ongoing NIH-
funded cohorts - representing rural/urban, ethnic/racially diverse, LGBTQ groups. We anticipate
multiple tiers of PWD-Caregiver networks: 1.) consentable PWD (mild, moderate AD) with caregivers,
2.) Caregivers only (PWD with severe dementia/unable to consent), 3.) consentable PWD only, no
caregivers (un-befriended). Mixed method interviews will examine detailed patient-centered outcome
measures, interpersonal interactions (positive/negative), and effects of the networks on the individual.
Through this research, we plan to have a 1.) Better understanding of how to measure caregiver
networks, 2.) Identify which aspects of caregiver networks are most predictive of the impact on
psychological and physical well-being of caregivers and PWD, and 3.) Operationalize a network
measurement approach to understand caregiver systems that will be shareable with other
researchers to provide larger benefit for the caregiver-PWD research community."

This application is submitted in response to RFA-DK-22-502, “Limited Competition: Continuation of the Chronic
Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study (U01)” on behalf of the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) CRIC
Clinical Center. Since its inception in 2001, the CRIC Study has recruited and followed a racially and ethnically
diverse cohort of 5,625 participants with reduced kidney function from 13 recruitment sites at seven Clinical
Centers across the US. The original aim of CRIC was to establish a clinical research laboratory designed to (a)
identify novel predictors of CKD progression, and (b) characterize the manifestations of cardiovascular disease
and identify its risk factors among individuals with CKD. As the landmark prospective cohort study of CKD, the
CRIC Study has accomplished extensive biological, physiological, and social phenotyping, longitudinal follow-
up, and ascertainment of clinical and patient-centered outcomes across multiple domains. Findings from the
CRIC Study have defined trajectories of CKD progression, catalogued development and evolution of
comorbidities in CKD, and identified a diverse array of factors and pathways that explain the progression and
complications of CKD in adults. During the most recent funding cycle (Phase 4: 2018-2023), three innovative
sub-protocol studies were implemented to enrich CRIC data with highly granular home-based assessments of
kidney function and cardiovascular measures. During the fifth and final phase of the CRIC Study, the major
focus will be to (1) ascertain the clinical outcomes for all participants including those enrolled in the Phase 4
sub-protocols, (2) perform analyses linking the sub-protocol measurements to clinical outcomes, (3) integrate
data from multiple domains to identify sub-phenotypes underlying the heterogeneity in CKD progression
outcomes, (4) conduct final study visits for the full CRIC cohort eligible for Phase 5, (5) create mechanisms for
future data collection via linkages with external sources of health data, (6) generate tools and resources to
facilitate ongoing use of CRIC data and biospecimens by a broad group of investigators, and (7) support UIC
CRIC participant enrollment into the recently funded UIC Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) CKD
Recruitment Site. During the first four phases of the CRIC Study, the UIC research team enrolled nearly 1,200
participants and has been successful in retention, protocol implementation, data quality, and scientific
productivity. Additional noteworthy achievements include a strong focus on heath disparities in CKD, a
significant number of UIC investigator-led publications, leadership on funded ancillary studies, and the
promotion of new physician-scientists. Consequently, the UIC team is well positioned to make a substantive
contribution to the consortium by generating new scientific output and successfully transitioning the CRIC Study
from its active prospective cohort phase to a long-lasting resource for supporting ongoing and future
mechanistic, epidemiologic, and translational investigations."
10848436,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite significant recent advances in precision medicine, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains
near-uniformly lethal. While the most frequent genomic alterations in PDAC are not presently druggable and
conventional therapies are often ineffective in this disease, immune-modulatory therapies hold promise to
meaningfully improve outcomes for PDAC patients. Development of such therapies requires an improved
understanding of the immune evasion mechanisms that characterize the PDAC microenvironment, including
frequent exclusion of antineoplastic T cells and abundance of immune-suppressive myeloid cells. We recently
found that cancer cell-intrinsic glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 2 (GOT2) shapes the immune
microenvironment to suppress antitumor immunity. Mechanistically, we found that GOT2 functions beyond its
established role in the malate-aspartate shuttle and promotes the transcriptional activity of nuclear receptor
PPARd, facilitated by direct binding to PPARd ligand arachidonic acid. While GOT2 in PDAC cells is dispensable
for cancer cell proliferation in vivo, GOT2 loss results in T cell-dependent suppression of tumor growth, and
genetic or pharmacologic PPARd activation restores PDAC progression in the GOT2-null context. This cancer
cell-intrinsic GOT2-PPARd axis promotes spatial restriction of both CD4 and CD8 T cells from the tumor
microenvironment, and fosters the immune-suppressive phenotype of tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells. Our results
to date demonstrate a non-canonical function for an established mitochondrial enzyme in transcriptional
regulation of immune evasion, and here we propose to exploit this novel GOT2-PPARd axis to promote a
productive antitumor immune response with the following specific aims. Aim 1: Assess the therapeutic
potential of targeting the GOT2-PPARd axis in established PDAC. We will perform preclinical evaluation of
GOT2/PPARd pathway inhibition together with therapeutic approaches aimed to increase antitumor T cell activity
in diverse mouse models, validate our findings in patient specimens with known clinical outcomes and mutational
status, and assess heterogeneity across the patient population with respect to the association between GOT2
signaling and T cell spatial regulation. Aim 2: Analyze the immune evasion mechanisms driven by cancer
cell-intrinsic GOT2. We will apply in vitro co-culture systems, in vivo assays testing a suite of GOT2 mutants
with varying fatty acid signaling capacity, and unbiased transcriptional analyses to understand the stepwise
mechanisms mediating paracrine regulation of immune evasion. Aim 3: Interrogate fatty acid-mediated gene
regulation by GOT2 and PPARd. We will analyze the genome-wide binding patterns of PPARd and additional
immune-modulatory transcription factors putatively regulated by GOT2, and characterize chromatin states in the
context of fatty acid signaling perturbations that prevent or permit antitumor immune responses. This work will
leverage our recent identification of a novel immune suppression mechanism in PDAC, with the potential to
inform on new therapeutic combinations poised for clinical translation."
10904758,"The structures of biomacromolecules at atomic resolution (< 2.0-2.5 Å) are of enormous importance to
understand their physiological functions and roles in diseases. An exemplary critical need of high atomic
resolution is to resolve the location of proton/hydrogen which plays vital roles in various biological processes.
Deuteration renders neutron scattering techniques unique advantages in high contrast (signal/background) to
locate D/H. Like X-ray crystallography which has contributed majority of known biomolecule structures, high
quality single crystals are the prerequisites for both X-ray and neutron data collection. It is worth mentioning that
despite the recent progresses in electron microscopy techniques, true atomic resolution remains a formidable
challenge to achieve. Lower resolution structures are associated with ambiguity and could mislead basic
biomedical research as well as drug design/development applications. With the understanding on the
fundamental limitations and technical hurdles associated with currently adopted ensemble-based methods, we
propose to develop a single-entity method (named NanoAC) which will offer unprecedented capability to
synthesize crystals one at a time, under real-time monitoring and with predictive crystal quality. A single nanotip
will be employed to spatially confine supersaturation as the sole nucleation site. Electroanalytical and optical
methods will monitor the whole crystallization process in real-time to capture quantitative signatures for the
nucleation and crystal growth at single entity resolutions. Those signatures will enable active controls in kinetic
transitions, and be quantitatively correlated with its diffraction quality and/or crystal habits. The insights will inform
crystal synthesis such that nucleation kinetics and growth rates of each individual crystal will be finetune to
improve crystal quality and to tune crystal size/habits. Prototype soluble proteins, nucleic acids and membrane
proteins will be used as defined in this early-stage technology development program. The new toolbox, once
established, will provide paradigm-shift capabilities to improve the crystal quality in diffraction and size/habit
controls, to tackle challenging material systems currently not-crystallizable, and also feature high efficiency in
time and/or materials. The overarching goal will be pursued through three interrelated aims. Aim 1 will establish
real-time monitoring signatures for the generalization of NanoAC to crystallize soluble biomacromolecules and
complexes. Aim 2 will correlate diffraction quality and crystal habits with monitoring signatures. Aim 3 will further
develop single nanopipettes as ‘magic wand’ to crystallize membrane proteins."
10930983,"Project Summary/Abstract
Whole-genome sequencing of population biobank cohorts holds great promise for enabling accurate prediction
of genetically-mediated risk for heritable human diseases and traits. Such information has the potential to be a
powerful resource for precision medicine, informing preventative and therapeutic decisions. To more fully
realize this potential, new statistical methods are needed to incorporate all genetic variants – including
structural variants, blood-derived somatic mutations, and rare SNPs and indels – into genetic risk models.
These classes of genetic variation, which are known to include many variants with large effects on disease
risk, can be detected in high-coverage whole-genome sequencing data now being generated at biobank scale.
However, such variants have not been accessible from previous genetic data sets (which have relied on SNP-
array genotyping and imputation). Consequently, existing methods for polygenic prediction have typically
considered only common inherited SNPs and indels.
We propose to develop a suite of statistical methods to enable these additional classes of genetic variants to
be incorporated into models of genetic risk, thereby improving predictive power. For variant types that are
currently difficult to ascertain even from whole-genome sequencing data – including somatic mutations and
some types of structural variants – we will develop new genotyping algorithms that improve statistical inference
by harnessing information across large sequenced cohorts. We will efficiently integrate information across all
variant types into genetic risk models using fast Bayesian regression methods. We will apply these approaches
to train genetic risk models for common diseases using data from very large biobank sequencing projects.
This project will have three specific aims. First, we will develop and apply methods for incorporating structural
variants into polygenic scores. Many structural variants are known to confer substantial disease risk but are at
imperfectly modeled by existing polygenic scores, such that directly including such variants will increase
prediction accuracy and cross-ancestry transferability. Second, we will develop and apply methods for
incorporating somatic mutations detectable in blood-derived DNA into genetic risk models. Such acquired
mutations, often indicative of clonal expansions of blood cells, provide an orthogonal source of risk compared
to the inherited variants considered by standard polygenic scores. Third, we will develop and apply efficient
computational methods for training polygenic score models on biobank-scale sequencing data. These methods
will allow model-fitting to be performed on individual-level genetic data, optimizing prediction accuracy. We
anticipate that these efforts will significantly improve performance of genetic risk models trained on current and
future population-scale whole-genome sequencing data sets."
10914872,"Enhancer RNAs Boost MYC-Chromatin Interaction to Regulate Gene Expression and Tumorigenesis
Summary: Our long-term goal is to determine how MYC’s RNA binding function contributes to its role as a
master regulator of gene expression in physiological and pathological conditions. In last three decades, MYC
has been extensively studied as a DNA-binding transcription factor. However, whether MYC can interact with
RNA and, if yes, how such interactions would contribute to MYC function are poorly understood.
 In our preliminary study, we have shown that MYC may be a novel RNA-binding protein with a
preference to bind with enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). In addition to characterizing MYC as an RNA-binding
protein, we have also identified a MYC-bound eRNA MERG1 that can regulate breast cancer growth via
recruiting MYC to its cognate enhancer. With these observations, we hypothesize that (1) MYC is an RNA-
binding protein and (2) eRNA-mediated MYC-chromatin binding is important for MYC’s transcriptional
regulation and oncogenic function. We propose three specific aims to test our hypotheses. In Aim 1, we will
investigate if MERG1 is an oncogenic eRNA in ER+ breast cancer. In aim 2, we will investigate the molecular
mechanism of MYC’s RNA binding function. In aim 3, we will build MYC-eRNA regulatory network.
 Our project will add a new dimension to mechanistically study the MYC-mediated gene regulation.
Successful completion of the project will establish novel tools to investigate MYC-RNA binding function for
the broader MYC research community. The investigation of MYC RNA binding function will also lay the
foundation to develop novel strategy to target MYC in cancer."

Fatal overdose is a major cause of mortality among people who use opioids (PWUO). Yet, fatal overdose can
be prevented when naloxone is promptly administered. Bystanders of an overdose are well positioned to
administer naloxone and can include both people who use and do not use drugs. In our prior work, we have
shown that PWUO can be peer educators (PEs) for overdose prevention. In previous interventions we have
focused on training network members who use drugs to respond to an overdose. Yet, pilot data suggests that
overdoses are also often witnessed by people who do not use drugs. Drug user stigma may impact PWUO
engaging in conversations about overdose prevention with non-using networks as well as non-using network
members’ willingness to always carry naloxone. Based on pilot data, we propose expanding an overdose peer
education intervention to focus on non-using network members and to address drug user stigma. The
intervention seeks to prepare network members to respond to an overdose and normalize discussion about
overdose prevention planning between PWUO and their network members. Using an RCT study design, 300
index PWUO will be recruited along with 450 network members. The indexes will be randomly assigned to the
(1) standard of care (SOC) or (2) an experimental peer education condition (PEC). The proposed design allows
examination of the effectiveness of the intervention to train non-using network members and enhance
communications among PWUO and their network members. We will use mHealth to assess geographic
coverage of peer education and geospatially situated stigma in order to understand factors associated with the
geospatial coverage of the PEs. The RE-AIM framework will guide the collection of qualitative interview data to
identify barriers and facilitators to intervention implementation. Participants will be assessed every 6 months for
2 years. The proposed design also will allow for the longitudinal examination of pathways between social and
psychological, and mental health factors and overdose behaviors which can guide future interventions.
 Aim 1: Implement and evaluate an equal attention 2-group RCT PWUO peer educator intervention that
 focuses on training network members, especially non-drug using network members, to encourage overdose
 prevention and response behaviors.
 Aim 2: Assess factors associated with geospatial coverage of peer outreach and geospatially/socially
 situated drug user stigma using EMA/mHealth."
10877833,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
BRAFV600E mutations are common in anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC, 50-75% positive), which is refractory to
standard treatment and has high mortality rates. Monotherapy with BRAF inhibitors is ineffective in patients
with BRAFV600E-mutant ATC. Although, combination therapy using a BRAF inhibitor, and a mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor is more effective than BRAF inhibitor monotherapy, acquired resistance is
common because BRAF and MEK act on the same downstream target and largely the same pathway. A
feature of resistance to BRAF inhibition or combined BRAF and MEK inhibition is increased sensitivity to
agents that induce ferroptosis (a distinct mechanism of programmed cell death dependent on iron). Moreover,
it has been shown that treatment-resistant (including BRAF inhibitor-resistant) cancer cells (persister cells) are
associated with a mesenchymal state that is dependent on GPX4 (a gatekeeper and suppressor of ferroptosis)
and show increased sensitivity to ferroptosis induction. Our unpublished preliminary data show that ferroptosis
induction is more pronounced in BRAFV600E-mutant than wild type ATC cells and that combination BRAF
inhibition and ferroptosis induction has synergistic activity in causing cell death in BRAFV600E-mutant ATC cells.
The long-term goal is the development of novel science-based treatment strategies for ATC that improve
patient outcomes. The overall objective in this application is to determine the safety and preclinical therapeutic
efficacy of combined BRAF inhibitor and ferroptosis induction treatment in BRAFV600E-mutant ATC. The central
hypothesis in this proposal is that combination therapy with BRAF inhibitor and ferroptosis induction will have
synergistic/additive anti-cancer activity in BRAFV600E-mutant ATC. The rationale for this project is that
determination of the safety and preclinical therapeutic efficacy of ferroptosis induction with BRAF inhibition is
likely to offer a strong scientific basis for translation of this novel combinatorial treatment strategy to the clinic.
The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Evaluate the safety and anticancer
activity of targeting ferroptosis in combination with BRAF inhibition in BRAFV600E-mutant ATC in vitro and in
vivo; and 2) Evaluate the efficacy of combined ferroptosis induction and BRAF inhibition compared to
combination BRAF and MEK inhibition. The research proposed in this application is innovative, in the
applicant’s opinion, as it represents a significant departure from the current strategy of targeting BRAF only or
a single signaling pathway in BRAFV600E-mutant ATC to the concept that combined treatment with a BRAF
inhibitor and ferroptosis induction will result in more robust and synergistic/additive anticancer activity. The
proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide a strong scientific justification for future
studies that could provide a new mechanism-based treatment regimen for BRAFV600E-mutant ATCs that could
result in durable response. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential of offering new opportunities for the
development of novel therapeutic strategy for BRAFV600E-mutant ATC."
10917295,"As one of the Chemicals of Concern (CoC) identified by the US Department of Homeland Security, aldicarb
belongs to the Cholinergic Warfare and Pesticides category. As the most toxic carbamate pesticide – a potent,
fast-acting inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), aldicarb is readily absorbed from all routes of exposure,
including oral and dermal exposure. In all species tested, the acute oral toxicities of aldicarb are similar. Due to
its physical properties documented in literature, aldicarb could be used by terrorists to cause mass casualty.
Organophosphorus (OP) warfare/pesticides and carbamate pesticides have a common mode of action for their
neurotoxicity as AChE inhibitors. Currently available options for treating this type of poisoning, such as
administration of atropine or co-administration of atropine and pralidoxime (2-PAM), have limited efficacy. There
have been extensive efforts in development of improved options for treatment of OP poisoning. Relatively less
studies have been carried out in development of aldicarb poisoning treatment. Reported studies indicated that
2-PAM had neither positive nor negative effects on survival in animal studies on aldicarb intoxication. This
outcome is understandable, as 2-PAM was developed to reactivate phosphorylated AChE (an intermediate
formed from the inhibition reaction of AChE with an OP), but not carbamylated AChE (an intermediate formed
from the reaction of AChE with a carbamate like aldicarb). It is highly desired to develop a new, effective post-
exposure treatment option for aldicarb poisoning. This investigation will focus on rational design and discovery
of an engineered enzyme capable of rapidly and efficiently detoxifying aldicarb as a catalytic aldicarb
bioscavenger for aldicarb poisoning. As an effective bioscavenger, it must be able to react with aldicarb more
rapidly than AChE so as to protect AChE from reaction (carbamylation) with aldicarb. In preliminary studies, we
have demonstrated that an Fc-fused cocaine hydrolase (Fc-CocH), developed previously in our lab for treatment
of cocaine use disorders (CUDs), can more potently bind with aldicarb than with AChE and wild-type
butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and can also catalyze aldicarb hydrolysis. In further in vivo rescue experiment, this
Fc-CocH protein powerfully rescued all mice that had been injected intraperitoneally (IP) with a lethal dose (~2
× LD50) of aldicarb. With the encouraging preliminary data, taking advantage of our positive experience in
preclinical and clinical development of Fc-CocHs, we propose to first evaluate an in-house library of Fc-CocHs
for their activities with aldicarb in order to select the one with the highest catalytic activity for aldicarb hydrolysis
and the best overall in vivo profiles, followed by lead optimization to optimize its catalytic activity against aldicarb,
substrate selectivity, post-exposure in vivo efficacy, and toxicity/immunogenicity profiles. Accomplishment of this
investigation will deliver a couple of safe, highly efficient aldicarb hydrolases that are promising for treatment of
aldicarb poisoning. The one with the best overall in vivo profiles will serve as a clinical candidate, and the second
best will serve as a backup, for further preclinical and clinical development in the future."

Single cell transcriptomics has transformed the field of brain cell type classification, allowing simultaneous
measurement of enough molecular features from enough cells to categorize neurons quantitively and with high
conservation across brain areas and species. Furthermore, cells classified by their genes have largely
coherent shapes, electrical properties, spatial locations, and projects targets, bringing the dream of multimodal
cell type definitions ever closer to reality, but also introducing major challenges of sifting through all this
disparate information to learn any given thing. To address these challenges the Allen Institute has developed a
series of high-quality reference data sets, a standard format for organizing and sharing their associated cell
type classifications, and a host of web tools for exploring these cell types. The Cell Type Knowledge Explorer
(CTKE), released in December 2021, is designed for exploration of transcriptomics, electrophysiology,
morphology, spatial localization, and epigenetics of individual cell types in the primary motor cortex of mouse,
marmoset, and human. The Allen Brain Cell (ABC) Atlas, to be initially released in late 2022, will enable users
to explore a cell type taxonomy and spatial map of the whole mouse brain, dramatically increasing the breadth
of cell types covered by the CTKE, while continuing to enable user-friendly data exploration. Both resources
present cell type taxonomies in a manner unique to the field of neuroscience.
 These data, standards, and web tools continue the open science practices that have been a keystone
of the Allen Institute since the release of the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas almost two decades ago. To enable users
not just to find, but also to successfully utilize these tools, the Allen Institute has an established Training,
Education, and Outreach program to support users of its resources at various career and learning stages. Cell
type and taxonomy scientific resources, in particular, rely on skills spanning neurobiology, genetics, applied
math, and computer science, posing challenges for both students and professionals, and extending this
program to support such tools would be particularly valuable to the neuroscience community.
 The goal of the Scientific and Public Outreach of Cell Type Taxonomies (SPOCTT) initiative is to
make these public resources more widely accessible to the general and scientific communities,
through a combination of consolidation, collaboration, training, education, and outreach efforts. By
offering both scalable training resources and personalized support to prospective users of taxonomies and
tools, we will (1) promote use of cell type taxonomies and associated tools (specifically the CTKE in year 1 and
the ABC Atlas in year 2), (2) set BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN) and Allen Institute taxonomies
as scientific standards for studying the brain in health and disease, and (3) broaden the reach of the Allen
Institute to a younger and more diverse neuroscience community."
10908618,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 While body weight is tightly regulated in healthy individuals, obesity results from failed homeostatic
mechanisms that protect individuals from metabolic disease. Obesity already plagues approximately 100 million
people and costs approximately $200 billion dollars annually in this country. Thus, it is imperative that we find
better ways to treat obesity before this problem gets out of control. The brain contains unexplored potential
avenues for obesity treatment. While it has been clear that neural mechanisms can dramatically shift energy
homeostasis, these mechanisms have been poorly described to this point. Specialized neurons detect changes
in energy status. Because the brain exhausts almost a quarter of all nutrients in the body, it is especially
important for the brain to keep energy levels in a normal range. Therefore, there are undiscovered, or not
completely discovered, built-in systems into the brain that maintain energy homeostasis.
 Recent studies have aimed to understand the function of distinct sets of cells in the brain involved in
individual aspects of metabolic function. This has recently been revealed to be the case for a key area of the
brain called the ventromedial hypothalamus. We have published papers that identify a set of cells within this
brain area is essential for hypoglycemic counterregulation, a critical factor for diabetes treatment. These cells
are intermingled in the same area with others that are essential for energy balance by stimulating energy
expenditure. Removing the neuropeptide pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide centered on the
ventromedial hypothalamus induces obesity. Because there are no direct connections from the ventromedial
hypothalamus with peripheral organ targets, these functions must be controlled through a downstream site to
that responds to pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide.
 In this proposal, we aim to identify both the anatomical and the cellular targets in the regions that
ventromedial hypothalamus neurons project. Our preliminary data indicate that ventromedial hypothalamus
neurons only project to a few sites. These projections particularly overlay with the caudal divisions of the preoptic
area, a region critical to energy expenditure control. We will employ genetic mouse models in conjunction with
AAV-driven gain or loss of function experiments to test the hypothesis that dietary signals that communicate fuel
adequacy to engage the neuropeptide in the ventromedial hypothalamus and action within the preoptic area on
neurons that are inhibitory and contain the receptor for the neuropeptide. We will define the dietary signals that
require the ventromedial hypothalamus neuropeptide and downstream communication by these cells. We will
then determine the downstream regions that requires activation by the neuropeptide receptor and communication
by these cells. Then, we will identify the inhibitory cells within the preoptic area that contain the neuropeptide

Disorders (ADRD) is mixed and arises from a range of study designs. Few prospective cohort studies exist in
the US, where associations between bilingualism and ADRD may be confounded by socioeconomic status
(SES) and immigration status. We propose to fill this gap by examining the association between bilingual family
of origin and ADRD over 50 years later in Project Talent, a sample of 377,000 individuals representative of the
current cohort of older Americans. Project Talent participants completed a comprehensive battery of measures
in 1960 when they were in high school (age 13-17), including data on languages spoken in the home, cognitive
tests, socioeconomic factors, and parental immigration status. We will extend assessment of family
immigration status back to 1950 by linking participant data to the newly released 1950 individual census
records. The cohort already has established linkages with the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services
(CMS) and National Death Index (NDI) which we propose to update. This will ascertain ADRD outcomes when
the cohort is 76-80, a period of rapid increasingly incidence. We will address three major questions through a
life course epidemiology lens. First, has been unclear if bilingualism is associated with ADRD incidence in
general, or with age of diagnosis. Our follow-up period allows us to address both questions, which reduce to an
issue of shifting relative risks with age. The design also permits us to address another issue that has been
largely ignored, competing risk censoring. Second, SES and immigration status may be important confounders
of any links. Detailed measurements of both family SES and immigration status will permit us to determine
whether one or both of these factors confound any observed associations between family of origin bilingualism
and ADRD. As well, adolescent cognitive ability may function as a mediator, explaining a portion of the
association. Third, our sample is large enough to explore questions of moderation by language type, and
speculations about mediation or moderation by attained education (the latter within a subsample followed up at
age 29). In summary, the proposed study would be the largest to date on these questions of which we are
aware and features a sample directly relevant to the current generation of US older adults."

Mobility, orientation, and spatial awareness can be challenging for people who are blind. Navigating new or unfamiliar
environments without sight can be confusing and stressful, and potentially dangerous. As a consequence, it has been
reported that at least 30% of blind individuals do not make independent trips outside of their home.
For sighted and blind travelers alike, maps represent a valuable tool for spatial cognition. Maps can be made
accessible to blind users using tactile format, or as multimodal vibrational/audio maps (a format pioneered by co-I
Giudice, himself a blind individual). Research has shown that, when given the opportunity to explore an accessible
map beforehand (pre-journey learning), blind travelers may achieve better spatial awareness of locations, which may
help with maintaining orientation and determining new routes.
Tactile maps are traditionally created by professionals, often following “tricks of the trade” and using non-standardized
symbols. Recently, there has been a push towards systematic approaches to tactile map creation that would enable
wider diffusion and consistent spatial symbols rendering. Online services (e.g., TMAPS) have been created, that allow
anyone to specify a certain region to be mapped, and have a tactile map automatically generated for that region,
sourcing from an open access geographical information system.
Existing systems for on-demand map creation, however, can only map outdoor areas. There is no such service for
building indoors, and in fact, very little research work has addressed the systematic production of tactile indoor maps.
Indoor environments are generally less structured than typical urban layouts. Moving about in a building may require
spatial knowledge at multiple scales (from the general building structure to the internal layout of a room). And, unlike
widely available GIS data sets, obtaining detailed floor plans in a format amenable for tactile map creation can be
challenging.
In this application, we propose research and development focusing on a system for the semi-automatic creation of
accessible maps (in tactile and vibrational/audio format) of indoor environments. This work will stem from a prior web
application (SIM, developed by PI Manduchi’s team) that allows anyone to trace an existing floor plan to generate an
embossable map. Our research activities will be organized around the following Specific Aims: Facilitating acquisition
and “vectorization” of floor plans (Aim 1); Automatic conversion of a vectorized map (expressed in terms of spatial
primitives) to an accessible map at any desired scale, by means of cartographic generalization operators and carefully
designed symbol sets (Aim 2); User studies with blind subjects, designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the maps
produced by our new SIM system (Aim 3); Transferring the new SIM web app technology to our partner institution,
the Vista Center for the Blind of Palo Alto, which will make it available as a service to interested stakeholders."
10883752,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Unsuccessful regulation of affect and physiology (RAP) is central to many forms of psychopathology, including
depression, one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. A core feature of major depressive disorder is
persistent sadness, which often results from difficulty successfully regulating affect and physiology.
Heterogeneity in the course of illness and response to treatment in depression is likely due to the presence of
multiple phenotypes that confer risk via distinct mechanisms. Individuals with remitted depression (rMDD)
appear to be less successful than controls on two distinct dimensions of regulation in everyday life: Perceived
success – how successful explicit regulation is at improving affect; and Physiological success – the degree of
parasympathetic augmentation following regulation attempts, primarily an implicit regulation process.
Classifying individuals into subgroups (i.e., phenotypes) according to scores on each regulatory dimension can
have clinical utility, providing distinct mechanism-based targets for remediation based on explicit and/or implicit
regulation. Our approach involves three phases: First, we plan to characterize regulation phenotypes by
screening young adults with rMDD (n=184) and healthy comparisons (n=68) based on our previously
successful dimensional ambulatory assessment of RAP in everyday life. Second, participants will complete
deep phenotyping in the lab to validate neural and physiological mechanisms underlying their phenotypic RAP
classification. Third, we will examine the remediating effects of heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback on
proximal measures of RAP success in everyday life, particularly for subgroups who demonstrated unsuccessful
RAP. By identifying and elucidating mechanisms of phenotypes based on ecologically-valid measures of RAP
success, this study will help to parse the heterogeneity that exists within depression. Determining how HRV
biofeedback impacts everyday regulation success for specific phenotypes can serve as an initial step toward
guiding precision medicine. Thus, this project is highly responsive to NIMH’s strategic plan to identify when,
how, and for whom to intervene."
10881777,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sleep is critical for infant physical and cognitive development and yet understanding sleep time and timing is a
source of stress to parents and families. Thus a better understanding of when infants sleep, specifically the
transition from two to one naps, will support infant cognitive development and contribute to guidance for families.
The objective of the proposed research is to examine, longitudinally, the role of multiple sleep bouts in memory
consolidation across the triphasic to biphasic sleep transition in infancy. The overarching hypothesis is that naps
maintain their usefulness across these transitions, but that multiple naps become less essential to the
preservation of memories as infants naturally transition to one nap per day. More specifically, it is predicted that
memories can be held longer without interference as the child develops across this age range, making the
morning nap less essential to memory while the afternoon nap remains essential. Participants will be 100 infants,
who will complete 2 sessions, a sleep and a wake session, every three months (9, 12, and, 15 months). A
deferred imitation task will be used to assess nap-related changes in memory consolidation. Actigraphy will be
used to objectively assess nap habituality. Polysomnography will be used to understand the physiological
mechanism underlying memory benefits and it will also provide a proxy for brain development. Collectively, the
work will (1) assess memory consolidation over morning and afternoon nap intervals across the triphasic to
biphasic sleep transition in infants; (2) examine the mechanism supporting declarative memory consolidation in
infancy; and (3) establish the developmental trajectory of key sleep physiology features within naps across this
developmental age range. An exploratory aim will examine whether changes in estimated brain development
predict the triphasic to biphasic sleep transition. The outcomes have theoretical significance. These results will
be significant for the field of sleep research, providing critical insight into development of sleep regulation
processes and longitudinal changes in sleep patterns. Additionally, results will be informative to developmental
scientists, suggesting that the timing of studies will contribute to performance. The outcomes also have
translational significance. A better understanding of nap transitions will inform pediatricians and parents as they
make recommendations and decisions about infant sleep and allow for identification of infants with abnormal
sleep development trajectories."
10923939,"SUMMARY
Physical inactivity is a significant contributor to risk of chronic diseases and poor health. This relationship is
particularly salient for women of low socioeconomic position in the US, for which >60% do not reach the
recommended guidelines of at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity each week. Prior research has
documented barriers to physical activity for this population, including individual factors (e.g., limited time,
insufficient funds for gym memberships or daycare) and community-level factors (e.g., traditional gender roles,
limited access to recreation space). Prior attempts to increase physical activity have generally targeted
individuals, with only modest results. To increase physical activity among mothers living in low-resourced
communities, innovative research to identify a multilevel intervention that is easily implemented at the community
level and appropriate for mothers with little time is urgently needed. The increasing demands on mothers' time
in a new pandemic era makes freely accessible childcare an attractive option. We successfully designed and
piloted an innovative intervention to increase physical activity among mothers by combining fitness classes with
free childcare and technology to connect and support mothers at the community level. This project will evaluate
the effectiveness of our multilevel intervention, the Free Time for Wellness (FT4W) program. The conceptual
framework for the FT4W program is based on social cognitive theory and the NIMHD Minority Health and Health
Disparities Research Framework. The intervention includes: 1) free childcare at free fitness classes, and 2) peer
support activities including group play dates and group volunteer activities. No prior health intervention has
included these components that we hypothesize, separately or in combination, will increase physical activity,
based on prior theory and pilot work. We will test the FT4W program as a mixed method, cluster randomized
controlled trial conducted in community-based health centers serving racially minoritized and socioeconomically
disadvantaged populations. Participants will be randomized to one of three arms: a control arm, a childcare only
arm, or a childcare + peer support arm. The trial will evaluate: (1) the ability of FT4W to increase physical activity
within 12 weeks as confirmed by accelerometers; (2) the potential mechanisms by which the FT4W program
facilitates physical activity (e.g., environmental resources, social cohesion); and (3) potential differences in the
magnitude of effect across intersecting social stratification parameters including race/ethnicity, socioeconomic
position, and migration status. At the completion of our study, we will make the FT4W protocol freely available
and work to scale the program in low-socioeconomic areas. The proposed project thus aims to introduce an
effective multilevel intervention that is easily implemented in communities and appropriate for mothers with little
time. This scalable intervention will help reduce the barriers that prevent mothers from participating in physical
activity, preventing future high rates of chronic diseases associated with inactivity."
10894896,"The skin forms the first barrier against physical, biological and chemical insults and is essential for prevention
of dehydration. To maintain this function epidermal keratinocytes undergo differentiation. During differentiation,
the gene expression programs in keratinocytes switch from maintenance of cell proliferation to terminal
differentiation. Calcium gradient formed between the basal and upper epidermal layers is a major factor
underlying induction of terminal differentiation in keratinocytes. In addition, skin homeostasis relies on well-
orchestrated intercellular communications mediated by cytokines that are produced by keratinocytes and other
skin resident cells.
 We have identified that transcription factor FOXQ1 (a member of the Forkhead Box family of proteins) utilizes
a novel, rheostat-like mechanism of transcriptional regulation of keratinocyte differentiation. Thus, in presence
of low extracellular calcium, FOXQ1 repressed genes associated with epidermal differentiation in normal human
keratinocytes (NHKs) and immortalized human keratinocytes (HaCaT). On the contrary, in calcium-treated (i.e.
differentiation-induced) NHK and HaCaT cells, FOXQ1 activated the same set of genes. Therefore, in Specific
Aim 1, we will identify the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation by FOXQ1 of keratinocyte
differentiation.
 In addition, we demonstrated that under normal conditions, depletion of FOXQ1 in cultured keratinocytes
decreased whereas its overexpression increased cell proliferation. Moreover, Foxq1-/- mice demonstrated
decreased epidermal hyperplasia in response to treatment with imiquimod which induces psoriasis-like
phenotypes in mouse epidermis.
 Therefore, in Specific Aim 2, we will generate keratinocyte-specific Foxq1 knock-out mice and identify the
mechanisms of FOXQ1 regulation by pro-inflammatory cytokines and the role of Foxq1 in regulation of
keratinocyte hyper-proliferation."
10719612,"Project Summary
Allergic asthma results in predominantly type-2 (Th2) mucoinflammatory responses including granulocytic
inflammation and respiratory epithelial remodeling. These features are also consistently observed in the
respiratory tract of rodents exposed repetitively to ozone. Therefore, the ozone-predominated air pollution during
the resolution phase of allergic asthma may interfere with the restoration of structure and function in the allergic
nasal and pulmonary airspaces. Currently, the molecular and cellular level understanding of the pathogenesis and
resolution of either ozone- or allergens-induced Th2 mucoinflammatory respiratory responses has significant
knowledge gaps. Therefore, detailed studies addressing these knowledge gaps are essential in promoting our
understanding of the interference between ozone pollution and the resolution of allergic inflammation in asthma.
Our central hypothesis is that IL-33 regulates the pathogenesis of Th2 inflammation in a cell lineage-specific
manner and that targeting of IL-33-ST2 axis will mitigate active inflammation and promote the resolution of
mucoinflammatory respiratory disease. The overall objective of this proposal is to test the benefit of inhibition of
IL33-ST2 signaling during the pathogenesis and resolution of ozone- and allergens-induced respiratory (nasal and
lung) inflammation. In aim 1, we will employ cross-genotype bone marrow chimera approach to elucidate the
autocrine versus paracrine IL-33 signaling between hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and non-HPCs during
active ozone/allergens-induced respiratory inflammation. In aim 2, we will test our hypothesis that ozone-exposure
disrupts the resolution kinetics of allergens-induced respiratory inflammation. In aim 3, we will test the hypothesis
that the genetic and pharmacological inhibition of IL-33-ST2 axis neutralizes ozone-mediated disruption in the
resolution of allergens-induced respiratory inflammation. The findings from our studies will enhance our
mechanistic understanding of the cell lineage- and signaling direction-specific role of the upstream master
regulator of ozone/allergens-induced respiratory inflammation. Impact of ozone on the resolution kinetics of
allergic inflammation and the potential for the genetic and pharmacological expedition of ozone-disrupted
resolution of allergic airway inflammation will have translational impact. Eventually, these findings may be applied
towards the development of anti-inflammation and pro-resolution therapeutics against air-pollution induced Th2
inflammatory diseases."
10932268,"Medical imaging allows visualisation and understanding of human tissue and internal organs, thereby providing
useful information for diagnosis, treatment and patient management. There is a gross shortage of medical image
analysts and data scientists in Nigeria. This negatively affects health care delivery. DATa Science and Medical
Image Analysis Training for Improved Health CAre Delivery in Nigeria (DATICAN) is a collaborative effort among
Lagos State University (LASU), University of Ibadan, and Redeemer University in Nigeria and the University of
Chicago (UChicago) in the USA. DATICAN will leverage existing collaborative relationships between UChicago
and LASU to provide early-career Nigerian physicians and scientists with a variety of mentored training and
experiential learning opportunities. Our research education program focuses on (1) computer science and
informatics (2) statistics and mathematics and (c) medical image analysis and public health, thus building
capacity in Nigeria for data science and medical image analysis. LASU, ranked among the topmost universities
in Nigeria due to its cross-cutting research programs and quality of research output, will be the coordinating
center. UChicago, a world-class university known for its emphasis on interdisciplinary research and expertise in
translational medicine and data science, will provide access to experienced faculty mentors and training
resources. DATICAN will enroll 72 participants, comprising MSc (36), PhD (12), postdocs (12) and junior faculty
(12). These graduate students and faculty will each design, develop, and implement a data science project. The
projects will concern analysis and information extraction from medical imaging data (e.g., mammogram,
ultrasound, MRI and X-ray images) particularly with reference to non-communicable and infectious diseases that
are high-priority public health concerns in Nigeria, including cancer, stroke, brain tumor and epilepsy, chronic
lung diseases, malaria and tuberculosis. DATICAN will provide support (school fees, stipend, research funds
and grants for conference attendance) for program participants, for one to three years, depending on their needs.
Participation will center on compulsory, two week-long “hackathons” to be held three times a year, but also
include monthly webinar trainings focused on the latest technologies in data science, medical image analysis,
image processing, current research in data science and health care related topics; also, funding opportunities,
writing grant proposals and scientific articles, grants management, presentation skills, and career development.
UChicago will lead the webinar trainings, providing faculty as well as access to technologies and cloud-based
resources. We are confident that DATICAN will contribute to sustainable growth of the community of data
science experts in Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa, as the program’s participants branch out and mentor
others in their own research communities. Thus, substantial and productive benefits will accrue from our
effort, manifesting as increasing numbers of Africans with the knowledge and skills to conduct data-intensive
research that will improve the health of vulnerable populations in low resource regions around the globe."

Once glioblastoma (GB) progresses after first-line therapy, treatment options are limited, and managing recurrent
GB remains challenging. While newly diagnosed GB patients have a life expectancy of ~15 months, it is reduced
to 6 to 9 months after relapse. Recently, localized delivery of interleukin-12 (IL12) has had promising anti-tumoral
effects in patients with high-grade, recurrent GB extending the survival to ~17 months. Our preliminary data show
that intratumoral IL12, together with local expression of a costimulatory factor for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)
- 4-1BBL, can induce sustained anti-glioma responses. The objective of our studies is to develop a clinically
relevant strategy combining these factors while expanding our understanding of immune-suppressive resistance
against IL12-induced anti-glioma activity. In Aim 1, we will establish disruptive technology presenting
combinations of immuno-modulatory factors on a single nanocarrier. In essence, dendritic cell (DC)-derived EVs
will be designed to display IL12, 4-1BBL, and a neoantigen:MHC complex. In line with our findings of GB-treated
mice with IL12/4-1BBL combo- compared to IL12 monotherapy, we anticipate that immunotherapeutic EVs will
translate to ~68% improvement in the survival of GB-bearing mice. In Aim 2, the resistance mechanisms induced
by GB against IL12 treatment will be explored. We have observed that myeloid cell subsets sense antitumor
immunity activated by IL12. By combining single-cell RNA sequencing analysis with multiparametric flow
cytometry in IL12-treated GB mouse models, we will uncover the pro-oncogenic signaling resulting in a PD-L1
increase and 4-1BBL decrease. In turn, these targets will be monitored in response to intratumoral EV treatment
anticipating the attenuation of GB resistance. Aim 3 will investigate CTL:DC crosstalk driving IL12 treatment.
CTLs are responsible for IL12-induced anti-glioma activity, as shown by our CD8 depletion experiments.
However, little is known about DCs in an IL12-stimulated GB brain. Transgenic mouse models will aid us by
marking or depleting relevant DCs in the tumor and studying the anti-tumor activity of our engineered EVs.
This unique proposal addresses a crucial and timely unmet need in the field. We plan to engage the therapeutic
potential of EVs to arrest GB progression. This work will undoubtedly provide a strong foundation for the
candidate's independent leadership in brain tumor research."
10897888,"Abstract The immunometabolism of tuberculosis (TB) offers new opportunities for controlling this deadly
infectious disease. We and others have characterized the immunometabolic changes in multiple animal models
of TB and found that metabolic remodeling to the HIF-1-mediated Warburg effect is a general response to
infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of TB. Recently, using multiple approaches that
include metabolomics and transcriptomic profiling, we identified novel core metabolic pathways that are found in
both Mtb-infected M1-like macrophages and in mouse lungs. These include glutaminolysis and one-carbon
metabolism. One-carbon metabolism catabolizes the transfer of serine-derived one-carbon (1C) units to
generate methyl-tetrahydrofolate (THF) intermediates that are then utilized for nucleotide synthesis and for
methylation reactions through the methionine cycle. One-carbon metabolism is also involved in redox balancing
through the generation of NADH/NADPH and of glycine and cysteine for glutathione (GSH) synthesis. We also
found that inhibition of methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2) leads to diminished M1-like
polarization that includes dysregulated mitochondrial function and dampened mTORC1/ATF4 signaling in M1-
like macrophages. MTHFD2 is a key mitochondrial enzyme of one-carbon metabolism that is encoded by Mthfd2,
which is highly induced in Mtb infected M-like macrophages and mouse lungs. Based on these observations, we
hypothesize that mitochondrial MTHFD2-mediated, one-carbon metabolism contributes to metabolic remodeling
programs of activating immune cells by generating 1C units for nucleotide synthesis and methylation reactions,
as well as reducing equivalents and GSH for redox homeostasis. Since TB is often associated with a deficiency
of folic acid, the precursor of the 1C carrier THF, we also hypothesize that folic acid deficiency during Mtb
infection dampens one-carbon metabolism, leading to diminished activation, differentiation, and effector function
of host immune cells. Moreover, since elevated MTHFD2 in vivo is associated with inflammatory disease severity,
we further hypothesize that prolonged and elevated expression of one-carbon metabolism contributes to lung
pathology at the chronic stage of Mtb infection. To test our hypothesis, in Aim 1, we will delineate how MTHFD2-
mediated, one-carbon metabolism regulates immunometabolic properties of M1-like macrophages,
mitochondrial biology, serine metabolic pathways, and the mechanism of Mthfd2 upregulation. In Aim 2, we will
generate conditional KO mouse strains lacking Mthfd2 in myeloid cells and T cell lineage to delineate the impact
of Mthfd2 deficiency on disease progression and immunometabolic properties of immune cells and/or subsets.
With Aim 3, we will use a susceptible mouse model of TB to evaluate the effects of folic acid dietary intake on
the expression of host immunity to control Mtb infection. We will also define the therapeutic role of inhibitors
targeting one-carbon metabolism during anti-TB treatment at chronic stages of the infection. Our study is
expected to advance the development of urgently needed host-directed therapies (HDTs) to enhance the ability
of immune cells to clear Mtb infection and/or to prevent the development of pathology."
10881993,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Pulmonary vascular dysfunction resulting from chronic hypoxia (CH) leads to increased vascular resistance
and resultant pulmonary hypertension (PH) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, sleep ap-
nea, restrictive lung diseases, and in residents at high altitude. The resulting increase in afterload on the right
heart often leads to clinical manifestations of cor pulmonale, peripheral edema, morbidity and mortality. Alt-
hough it is widely considered that pulmonary arterial constriction and remodeling are central to this disease
process, the mechanisms linking CH to these responses are poorly understood.
 The overall objective of the current study is to identify oxidant signaling mechanisms responsible for spon-
taneous pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell (PASMC) tone and enhanced vasoconstrictor reactivity in CH-
induced PH. Based on preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that PASMC Cav1 dysfunction following CH
disrupts cellular cholesterol homeostasis that confers transduction of mechanical, electrical and GPCR stimuli
to mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU)-dependent mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) generation,
vasoconstriction, and pHTN. We plan to test this hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims:
 Specific Aim #1: Establish the mechanism by which CH reduces PASMC membrane cholesterol leading to
enhanced vasoconstrictor reactivity and cell proliferation.
Hypothesis: CH couples vasoconstrictor stimuli to PASMC myofilament Ca2+ sensitization and proliferation
through impaired Cav1-mediated cholesterol trafficking to the cell membrane.
 Specific Aim #2: Define the signaling mechanism by which CH increases PASMC mtROS generation, vaso-
constriction, and cell proliferation.
Hypothesis: Cav1 dysfunction following CH causes mitochondrial membrane cholesterol accumulation and
MCU-dependent mtROS generation required for augmented PASMC contractility and proliferation.
 Specific Aim #3: Determine the contribution of Cav1, MCU and mtROS to CH-induced pHTN.
Hypothesis: Cav1 dysregulation and MCU-induced mtROS production contribute to the progression and
maintenance of CH-induced pHTN.
 We anticipate this project will define an innovative paradigm of PASMC signaling involving regulation of
mtROS generation and Ca2+ sensitization by Cav1-mediated disruption of cellular cholesterol homeostasis that
is unique to the pulmonary circulation. The proposed studies are significant because they are expected to ver-
tically impact our understanding of regulation of oxidant signaling mechanisms by Cav1 and membrane cho-
lesterol, and their contribution to CH-induced pHTN. In doing so, they have potential to provide new thera-
peutic strategies to treat pHTN that target components of this signaling pathway."
10861089,"There are no effective vaccines or monoclonal antibodies available for the prevention or treatment of
herpes simplex viral infections. This application addresses this global public health priority. We developed
a novel single-cycle vaccine strain deleted in glycoprotein D (gD), designated DgD-2. DgD-2 completely
protects mice from lethal challenges with clinical isolates of both HSV-1 and HSV-2. Protection is
mediated by IgG2 antibodies that have little neutralizing activity but activate Fc gamma receptors to
promote antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). The central role for ADCC in mediating
protection is supported by the observations that immune serum from DgD-2 vaccinated mice completely
protects naïve wild-type, but not Fcg receptor IV knockout (FcgRIV-/-) mice. FcgRIV is the primary receptor
responsible for mediating ADCC in mice. We isolated a highly protective monoclonal antibody (mAb),
BMPC-23, from DgD-2 vaccinated mice that exhibits potent FcgRIV activating activity and mapped its
epitope to domain IV of viral glycoprotein B. Notably, in contrast to the response to DgD-2, the humoral
response to acute HSV infection or to vaccination with gD subunit protein vaccines in both mice and
humans is neutralizing with little or no ADCC. These observations suggest that gD may interfere with the
elicitation of ADCC antibodies. We hypothesized that this novel immune evasion mechanism may be
mediated by interactions between gD and the co-signaling molecule switch molecule herpes virus entry
mediator (HVEM), which is expressed by most immune cells. When gD binds HVEM, the interactions
between HVEM and its natural ligands (LIGHT, lymphotoxin-a, CD160 and BTLA) may be inhibited.
Supporting our hypothesis, IgG2 ADCC responses were reduced and protection against HSV was lost
when Hvem−/− (knockout) mice were vaccinated with DgD-2. This need for HVEM to elicit IgG2 ADCC
responses may be generalizable since similar results were obtained with other vaccines. Based on these
data, we propose that the enhanced ADCC response to DgD-2 compared to natural HSV infection or to
gD protein vaccines reflects differences in viral targets recognized, IgG subclasses generated and ability
to overcome gD-HVEM mediated immune evasion. We will isolate and characterize mAbs generated in
response to DgD-2, primary and recurrent HSV infection in wild-type compared to Hvem−/− mice to
determine how HVEM signaling contributes to the antigenic repertoire, subclass and antibody function.
We will test the mAbs that are generated in response to DgD-2 vaccination or infection individually and
in combination (with BMPC-23 and other combinations) for their ability to protect and treat acute or
recurrent HSV-1 and HSV-2 disease following vaginal and skin (male and female) infection as well as in
models of neonatal disease. Together, these studies will yield important new fundamental and
translational knowledge applicable to the development of vaccines and mAbs that mediate ADCC."

 The Analytical Core will serve as a central resource for the deep systems-level molecular characterization of
biological samples generated by the Projects and from the Biospecimens Core. The primary objective of this
Core is to integrate diverse single cell, bulk, and spatial analytical platforms to define the complex interactions
between brain tumor cells and the associated brain tumor microenvironment (TME). To this end, we have
developed an analytical platform encompassing transcriptional profiling at the single cell, single nuclei, and bulk
tissue scale; protein expression profiling, phosphoproteomics and immunopeptidomics with cell type-specific
resolution; and quantitative metabolomics and drug distribution profiling with high spatial resolution by mass
spectrometry imaging (MSI). These complementary analytical approaches have the requisite sensitivity to
generate ultra-deep systems-level molecular profiling of 10-20 micron thick tissues from single core biopsies;
performance of our platform has already been demonstrated on multiple image-guided core biopsies from
geographically distinct regions of a GBM tumor. Multi-omics data acquired in our Analytical Core will be managed
using a FAIR compliant metadata management tool that prioritizes connections between samples and defines
discrete sample types that can be freely connected as described in the Overall Section of our proposal. The
Analytical Core will provide expert personnel, facilitate the sharing of knowledge within the program, and maintain
the sophisticated equipment necessary to generate data for both Projects. By acting as a common resource, the
Analytical Core provides expertise for each Project."
10904942,"Project Summary
The nuclear package that comprises the eukaryotic genome not only stores genetic information but also
mediates cell-type-specific gene expression. The hierarchical genome organization is tightly regulated to
precisely control cell functions. Interphase chromosomes occupy distinct nuclear spaces, a conserved genome
architecture known as chromosome territories. Technological advances over the last two decades have revealed
many new aspects of the three-dimensional architecture of the genome. However, understanding the
mechanisms that localize and mobilize chromosomal loci and territories in the nucleus requires high-resolution
studies in real time under physiological conditions. In the past five years, we have developed CRISPR-based
high-resolution live-cell imaging techniques using multiple colors to localize and track up to seven genomic loci
simultaneously. Recently, we have replaced fluorescent proteins with small cell-permeable RNA-interacting
molecules that improve brightness and reduce the size of tags by >100-fold. Our preliminary data revealed
surprising dynamic and structural aspects of the chromatin: (1) homologous and non-homologous chromosomal
loci moved at different speeds and in different directions; (2) large-scale chromosomal domains continuously
rearranged in minutes in non-stressed conditions, termed chromosome morphological dynamics; (3)
chromosome conformations were temperature-sensitive; and (4) transformed and non-transformed cells had
distinct chromosome conformations. In mouse embryonic stem cells, the mobility of promoters and enhancers
correlates with transcriptional activity for specific genes; however, how chromatin mobility correlates with
transcriptional activity is poorly understood and controversial. Building upon our preliminary results, we propose
to investigate four key concepts: (i) how chromosomal DNA is organized in individual chromosome territories, (ii)
what factors drive chromosome morphological dynamics, (iii) how active genes are positioned relative to non-
transcribed DNA regions to craft the landscape of the genome, and (iv) how chromatin movements correlate with
transcriptional activities in the nucleus. We will perturb transcription, temperature, and microtubule
polymerization to identify factors that govern chromosome dynamics. Integration of non-invasive imaging
approaches with biophysical models and RNA-seq data will provide new information on the mechanistic and
functional foundations of real-time chromatin dynamics and gene positioning at the single chromosome level in
the nucleus."
10898893,"Genome instability, characterized by increased formation of DNA mutations and other genetic
modifications, is a causative factor in multiple human diseases including cancer, infectious
diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders. The translesion synthesis (TLS) pathway, by means
of its low fidelity polymerases, causes mutagenesis by bypassing DNA damages and filling post-
replicative DNA gaps; a process principally orchestrated by the REV1 polymerase. Thus, TLS
and REV1 are essential components of genome instability that drive the formation of new
mutations that then translate into new, and often deleterious cellular functions. Recent discoveries
from my laboratory challenge this one-dimensional model and have profound implications for
understanding human disease and may offer opportunities to develop new therapeutics. We have
discovered that the REV1 polymerase has a broader role in controlling genome instability than
originally thought. REV1 regulates autophagy, metabolic processes, mitosis fidelity, and
replication stress through rereplication. We have evidence that these additional, previously
unrecognized roles of REV1 regulate cellular metabolic choices of autophagy versus senescence
in response to different types of DNA damages and as such might control cell death mechanisms.
Furthermore, our preliminary data unexpectedly showed that REV1 directly regulates autophagy,
mitosis, and rereplication proteins. While these early results are enticing, the fundamentals of
these discoveries—how REV1 controls cellular metabolism and participates in mitosis fidelity and
rereplication are a black box. The work proposed here will systematically tease apart the
mechanistic basis of the new roles of the REV1 polymerase. The goals of this proposal are to
determine the mechanisms by which REV1 exercises these newly recognized functions by
utilizing novel and cutting-edge tools to ask basic biological questions. Successful completion of
our proposed studies will redefine the role of REV1, from an error-prone polymerase that
participates in the TLS DNA mutagenesis process to a multi-dimensional regulator that controls
disease onset or progression by not only making mutations in DNA, but also by controlling cellular
metabolism, mitotic fidelity, and rereplication, central to the genome instability process."

Early identification of cognitive impairment and dementia is associated with multiple public health benefits and
will become even more important if a disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer’s disease becomes widely
available. However, delayed or missed identification of dementia is common, particularly among racial/ethnic
minorities and those from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds. Possible explanations for this delay
may include patient beliefs about dementia such as it being part of the aging process or fear of associated
stigma; conversely, barriers at the level of provider or health-system may hinder timely diagnostic workup.
The overall goal of this mixed-methods study is to identify barriers to early identification of dementia
for older adults who receive healthcare in a safety net health system. We hypothesize that both patient
and health-system level factors are associated with delay in dementia diagnosis within this patient population.
We will first determine if the decision to seek evaluation for memory symptoms, assessed through hypothetical
clinical scenarios, is associated with a person’s dementia-specific health literacy after adjusting for
demographic factors and health status. We will then evaluate if patient self-report of memory symptoms on a
state-mandated preventive care visit is associated with a higher likelihood of undergoing diagnostic evaluation
for dementia, assessed using a unique electronic health record-derived dataset. We will complement the
analytic aims with semi-structured interviews with patients and caregivers to identify barriers to care for
memory disorders as well as unmet needs.This study will help identify specific barriers that can be targeted for
future interventions to improve early identification of dementia in the safety net population."
10906964,"ABSTRACT: RESEARCH AND EDUCATION CORE
The overarching goal of the Research and Education Core (REC) of the Michigan Center on Contextual
Factors in Alzheimer’s Disease (MCCFAD) is to diversify and educate the professional research workforce
addressing the brain and cognitive health of older adults. REC is central to MCCFAD because it directly
educates, mentors, and supports junior and mid-career investigators from underrepresented groups. Enhanced
diversity in the professional research workforce who study the brain and cognitive health of older adults is
critical to advancing knowledge about and improving the care of older adults in the U.S. REC synergy with the
Leadership and Administrative, Analytic, and Community Liaison and Recruitment Cores will be instrumental in
achieving these aims, as will collaborations with rich resources available at the University of Michigan (UM),
including NIA Centers, Inter-Consortium for Political and Social Research, the Health and Retirement Study
(HRS), and partner institutions (Michigan State University, Wayne State University, Oakland University, UM-
Dearborn). REC specific aims are to: (1) Support pilot studies for MCCFAD Research Scientists (RS) in ADRD
epidemiology, health economics, and culturally-sensitive care; (2) Provide sustainable mentoring activity for
MCCFAD RS to achieve independent investigator status; (3) Offer professional development and education in
ADRD disparities; and (4): Evaluate REC activities. Expert mentorship in health disparities and minority aging
research will primarily be provided to RS through an individualized, integrative and often trans-institutional
mentoring team, a monthly seminar series, professional development sessions, and a yearly Summer Data
Immersion (SDI) program to catalyze new and enduring research collaborations. Moreover, RS mentoring
activities will continue beyond their funded year. We have designed a unique and exceptional educational
experience that will increase the workforce interested in and knowledgeable about contextual factors related to
ADRD. A team of expert faculty will guide these activities, which exemplify the overarching REC core value of
team science. The impact of the REC is expected to be broad because we have designed activities to target
and benefit not only funded RS (e.g., integrative mentoring team; monthly seminar series), but also national
researchers (e.g., SDI) and the larger scientific community as a whole (e.g., peer-reviewed publications and
presentations at professional meetings generated through RS pilot projects and SDI activities, workshops on
the responsible conduct of research with Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) and Latino populations)."
10906968,"ABSTRACT: COMMUNITY LIAISON AND RECRUITMENT CORE
The Community Liaison and Recruitment Core (CLRC) serves as a liaison between the Michigan Center for
Contextual Factors in Alzheimer’s Disease (MCCFAD) and key stakeholders in the metro-Detroit Middle
Eastern and North African (MENA) community and the Grand Rapids Latino community. We propose three
major ways to extend MCCFAD’s work in recruitment, retention science, and community translation. First, we
will expand our engagement efforts by linking our recruitment and community research activities with key NIA
funded Michigan Aging Centers. Second, we will actively solicit community engagement in scientific
dissemination. Third, we will expand our liaison activities to partner with community clinics, health providers
and public health workers to enhance participation in research. To support MCCFAD goals of advancing
research and practice in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, the CLRC leads the development,
implementation and evaluation of an adapted innovative Community Based Participation Research approach to
health education and community outreach activities, with an overarching goal of enhancing research in
recruitment and retention. These efforts will be closely coordinated with the activities of the Leadership and
Administrative, Research and Education and Analytic Cores in addition to the Michigan Center for Urban
African American Aging Research (MCUAAAR) and the Michigan Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center
(MADRC). Both MCUAAAR and MADRC have established community cores comprised of African Americans.
MCCFAD will focus efforts on further building their Research Volunteer Directory (RVD) in the MENA and
Latino communities. The RVD will support research that aims to: 1) reduce risk of developing ADRD, 2)
promote culturally sensitive care, and 3) address the health economics of ADRD. Community partnerships in
metro Detroit and Grand Rapids enhance the reach and depth of CLRC activities. CLRC specific aims address
the following: Aim 1: Enhance outreach, recruitment and retention of Middle Eastern and North African (MENA)
and Latino communities to foster inclusion and active participation in ADRD research; Aim 2: Disseminate
scientific knowledge of techniques for recruiting and retaining diverse and population-representative research
participants; Aim 3: Develop culturally tailored educational materials to provide the MENA and Latino
communities with feedback on research advances and to inform their engagement with the healthcare system.
The CLRC will continue to advance knowledge about factors affecting research participation of underserved
and underrepresented communities in ADRD research. By engaging each community in an equitable
partnership and incorporating links with health professionals, we aim to advance scholarship on ADRD among
hard-to-reach populations to promote sustained change around relevant to ADRDs disparities."
10875563,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Type 1 diabetes is characterized by the loss of β-cell mass and decreased insulin production capacity. Thus,
developing a pharmacologic method for stimulating the expansion of β-cell mass has substantial potential
therapeutic value. Recently, our group and others have successfully developed highly potent small-molecule
inducers of human β-cell proliferation; however, the growth-promoting activity of these molecules is non-
selective. Consequently, the potential for inducing off-target cellular proliferation is a primary barrier to the safe
use of these regenerative compounds in humans. Herein, a novel, generalizable prodrug strategy for the
selective delivery of regerative therapeutics to the β-cell will be developed. The strategy leverages a unique
biologic activity of the β-cell to convert latent prodrugs into bioactive daughter compounds. Building on prior
success, progress will be furthered by incorporating relevant advances made in the broader field of targeted drug
delivery into this new prodrug strategy; including the incorporation of molecular linkers used in antibody- and
small molecule-drug conjugates that ensure compounds are fully latent prior to bioactivation and are unscarred
following bioactivation. Additionally, the cellular mechanisms of prodrug activation will be elucidated. This work
will deliver a robust, milestone-based data package for β-cell targeted drug delivery that includes a deep
understanding of prodrug bioactivation, structure-activity relationship data, pharmacokinetic characterization,
cell-type-specific activity and in vivo efficacy with a human islet-based preclinical model. The replicative activity
of target (β-cells) and off-target tissues will be assessed following short-term and long-term compound exposure;
studies critical to demonstrating the sustained specificity and efficacy of this β-cell targeted therapeutic delivery
strategy. These studies have the potential to deliver safe, potentially transformative, first-in-class lead
compounds for regenerative treatment of diabetes. Critically, the developed technology may be used for β-cell-
targeted delivery of nearly any therapeutic."

The major goal of this K99/R00 proposal is to determine mechanisms by which SIRT6 regulates and extends
lifespan. Therapeutic modulation of SIRT6 activity in humans may be an effective way to treat many age-
related diseases and disorders and extend healthy lifespan. The ability of SIRT6 to regulate lifespan in mice has
been demonstrated, and our preliminary data show substantial lifespan extension by overexpressing the SIRT6
Drosophila melanogaster ortholog, dSirt6, in flies, but the extent of this ability and mechanisms by which
SIRT6 operates are poorly understood. This proposal will utilize Drosophila melanogaster to clarify these
issues through three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine which tissues dSirt6 acts through to extend lifespan,
and the relative contributions of dSirt6 deactylase (associated with chromatin silencing) and ADP-ribosylase
(associated with DNA repair) functions towards regulating lifespan. The results from these experiments should
provide better confirmation of the ability of SIRT6 to extend lifespan, and mechanisms by which it operates to
do so. Aim 2 will measure global gene expression changes (RNA-seq) and epigenomic alterations (ChIP-seq
for dSirt6 substrates H3K9ac and H3K56ac, and ATAC-seq to look at overall chromatin accessibility) during
aging, with and without dSirt6 overexpression. These results will provide information about the impact of
dSirt6 overexpression on chromatin during aging and the relative impact on gene expression and lifespan, and
also general insight into the relationship between aging, chromatin state, and lifespan. Aim 3 will use both
targeted and unbiased screens to identify other genes that regulate dSirt6 function. The results of these
experiments will provide better mechanistic insight into how dSirt6 extends lifespan, and potentially allow us
to extend it even further than with dSirt6 overexpression alone. In addition, this aim is designed to provide the
applicant with a wide array of data and directions to serve as the basis for future grant proposals. The proposed
research complements the training goal of this proposal: to provide the applicant with advanced skills
transgenic fly construction and transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses, with guidance from expert mentors.
Transgenic organisms and genome-wide analyses are at the forefront of aging research, and can be applied
together to gain deep insight into the molecular causes and consequences of aging. The training activities of
this proposal include individualized hands-on training, attendance of training workshops, didactic coursework,
and individual and team mentoring in professional development. The proposed research will advance our
understanding and ability to treat age-related disease and - together with the proposed training activities - will
provide me with the resources and tools to transition into an independent career dedicated to understanding
and treating age-related diseases and disorders at the molecular level."

Injury-related death accounts for 9% of all global mortality. That is more than 1.7 times all HIV, malaria, and
TB-related deaths combined. Put another way, every 6 seconds, someone in the world dies as a result of
injury. More than 90% of this burden of injury comes to bear on low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)
where the capacity for preventing, mitigating, and treating injuries is considerably limited. Moreover, injury data
that captured in most LMICs are commonly incomplete, difficult to access, and not regularly analyzed making it
difficult to produce evidence-based policies for trauma and injury. In the Eastern Mediterranean Region
(EMR) injury mortality rates are 3x higher in LMICs than in high-income countries. The combined effects of
regional armed conflicts, humanitarian crises, large numbers of youth, highly urbanized and motorized
populations, and limited public safety infrastructure make this region highly vulnerable to injury disability and
death. Further compounding the disparity is the fact that LMICs, in general, and EMR LMICs in particularl
have woefully insufficient numbers of trained injury scientists to meet these challenges. Meeting the health and
policy challenges posed by the large injury burden in the EMR will require a new approach to training injury
researchers in the region. The Yale University – American University of Beirut Program for Advanced Injury
Research (YALE-AUB PAIR) is a five-year program that will use a mix of short-, medium-, and long-term
training, coupled with structured mentoring from faculty at both institutions to strengthen multiple levels of the
trauma and injury research ecosystem in Lebanon and the region. YALE-AUB PAIR will identify and recruit
outstanding applicants; train them to think critically about trauma and injury in Lebanon and the EMR; and
provide them with the skills and mentorship to prepare them for careers as independent trauma and
injury researchers. YALE-AUB PAIR combines MS and PhD degree training, focused research certificate
training for professionals and clinicians, workshops for governmental and nongovernmental staff and long-term
mentorship to: [AIM 1] Develop career injury science researchers with knowledge, skills, and experience to
become independent investigators able to generate novel, and context-specific research into the causes, risk
factors and impacts of trauma and injury in Lebanon and the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR);
[AIM 2] Develop future leaders in injury science in Lebanon and EMR who can generate and sustain programs
of trauma and injury research; [AIM 3] Strengthen the injury science ecosystem in Lebanon and the EMR to
enhance the capacity for injury surveillance to ensure the availability and completeness of data for future injury
research. YALE-AUB PAIR will train 2 PhD, 6 MS, 20 Certificate level, and 200 government and non-
governmental personnel over five years."
10854827,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Abstinence from alcohol use induces a negative affective state that can lead to maladaptive responses
to stress and relapse. Preclinical studies have begun to identify neurocircuits and peptide targets that regulate
negative affect during abstinence. As the field has begun to develop a deeper understanding of the circuitries
participating in addiction and negative affect, the next step is to understand how communication within these
circuits is modulated particularly at the neuropeptide and microcircuit level. The bed nucleus of the stria
terminalis (BNST) is a fundamental component of abstinence-relevant neurocircuitry as it modulates stress and
alcohol-related behavior in a neuropeptide-dependent manner. To investigate peptide-specific BNST circuitry
modulating negative-affect during abstinence, we will focus on afferents from the parabrachial nucleus (PBN),
a brainstem region that functions as a danger signal. PBN projections to the BNST release calcitonin gene-
related peptide (CGRP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP), peptides that
modulate pain and fear circuits, respectively. Our studies implicate heterogenous and sexually dimorphic
control within the PBNàBNST circuit as PBN projections induce heterogeneous ex vivo activity in BNST cells
and female-specific anxiety-like behavior with BNSTPBN activation. Furthermore, our preliminary studies
suggest a role for the PBN in alcohol-withdrawal, as inactivation is anxiolytic following alcohol exposure. This
proposal will significantly build on this foundational evidence by investigating how CGRP and PACAP
contribute to PBNàBNST circuit induced abstinence-induced behavior, in vivo and ex vivo activity.
Accordingly, the mentored K99 phase will build on my in vivo fiber photometry recordings and provide training
in ex vivo recordings to determine the role of CGRP on BNSTàPBN activity, abstinence-induced behavior
(AIM1), and the contribution of PACAP on the CGRP-neuromodulation (AIM2). The independent R00 phase
will investigate the role of PACAP on BNSTàPBN at the microcircuit level and alcohol-related states, with the
goal to further delineate the intricacies of peptide crosstalk (AIM3). The proposed studies and related career
development training plan in this MOSAIC Pathway to Independence Award collectively provide the ideal
mechanism to transition the applicant to a career as an independent addiction neuroscientist. The results will
significantly advance our understanding of neurocircuit mechanisms at the peptide and microcircuit level in
protracted abstinence while informing the use of peptidergic pharmacotherapies in alcohol use disorders."
10930169,"Summary – Moffitt CSBC Proposal Overview
 The Moffitt CSBC proposal is focused on the essential and highly dynamical interplay between cancer cell
evolution and the constantly changing ecology of the lung microenvironment. Tumors are not simply collections
of mutated cells that grow in isolation. Rather, they respond to and modify both the physical microenvironment
and a variety of host cells, and these changes in ecology (“∆-Ecology”) are key to understanding tumor
progression and the response to therapy – particularly the development of resistance. Central to this proposal
is quantifying, understanding, and actioning the change that occurs during treatment to both the tumor and
non-tumor ecology in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is the most common and among the most
lethal of human cancers. We will define the ecological and evolutionary dynamics that govern NSCLC
progression and treatment success or failure through 2 projects and 2 shared resource cores. Each project will
focus on different D-Ecology dynamics in the presence of different driver mutations (RAS, EGFR, ALK) for
which targeted therapy is available. Each project demonstrates our unifying theme of tight
empirical/mathematical integration through the sequence of develop, predict, calibrate, test, optimize, and
validate. Thus, each project begins with available clinical data followed by in silico (predict and optimize), in
vitro (calibrate and test) and in vivo (validate) model systems leading to readily translatable treatment options.
The mathematical and ecological Cores incorporate the mathematical and computational methods needed for
bridging the projects. The Math Core will serve as the mechanistic model engine of the center, facilitating both
spatial and non-spatial models of eco-evolutionary processes to generate and test hypotheses regarding ∆-
Ecology. The Ecology Core serves as data repository and ecological analysis engine working in lockstep with
the three Projects focused on different aspects of NSCLC ∆-Ecology (Immune and Stromal) to develop and
apply spatial ecological models. These cores will serve our two projects:
Project 1: Delta immune Ecology of NSCLC 1.1 Quantify the ∆-Ecology of patient samples pre- and on-
treatment to predict outcomes; 1.2 Impact of KRAS inhibitor therapy with immunotherapy on lung tumor
ecology; 1.3 Use predictive modeling to generate evolutionary inspired multi-agent treatment strategies.
Project 2: Delta stromal Ecology of NSCLC 2.1 Decipher, in vivo, the ∆-Ecology of acquired resistance to
targeted therapies in NSCLC; 2.2 Define the impact of stromal sheltering on the emergence of resistance and
tumor growth relapse; 2.3 Discover optimal therapeutic strategies to suppress resistance."

Blood pressure (BP) control is an effective preventive intervention to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease,
especially heart failure (HF). However, among adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D), the effects of intensive BP
control for HF prevention are not well established. There may be high-risk individuals with T2D who are more
likely to derive greater benefits from intensive BP control. The American Diabetes Association recommends
measurement of cardiac biomarkers, specifically N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and
high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), to identify and target individuals at high risk for developing HF
with effective therapies as part of a comprehensive HF prevention strategy. In this study, we propose to
evaluate whether a cardiac biomarker-based approach can inform intensive BP control treatment decisions in
high-risk adults with T2D to prevent HF. The study will examine participants enrolled in the ACCORD-BP trial
with available biospecimens to measure cardiac biomarkers. We will measure NT-proBNP and hs-cTnT at
baseline and follow-up years 1, 2, and 4 among ACCORD-BP trial participants who have blood stored in the
NHLBI Biorepository. The prognostic implications of baseline and longitudinal changes in NT-proBNP and hs-
cTnT for HF risk will be examined in a secondary analysis of the ACCORD-BP trial. Additionally, we will
evaluate whether NT-proBNP and hs-cTnT levels modify the treatment effects of intensive BP control. Finally,
we will test the hypothesis that intensive BP control can attenuate the expected rise in NT-proBNP and hs-
cTnT over follow-up. The proposed study will further our understanding of the clinical utility of cardiac
biomarker testing as part of a HF prevention strategy and provide preliminary data for designing a cardiac
biomarker-guided intensive BP control trial in T2D for HF prevention."

Asian and Pacific Americans (APAs) have undergone the greatest growth among all racial/ethnic groups in the
U.S. between 2000 and 2020. In the New York City/New Jersey (NYC/NJ) area, older (65+) Asian Indian and
Chinese American populations have increased by 73% and 74% over the past ten years. While claims-based
studies in the U.S. have previously suggested lower prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related
dementias (ADRD) in older APAs, this finding may have resulted from underdiagnosis associated with not
having culturally and linguistically appropriate tools, clinicians, or systems. Older APAs with AD/ADRD
in the U.S. thus face both the problem of under-diagnosis and under-provision of care as a whole, even as
great disparities exist within and between APA subgroups. What’s more, the COVID-19 pandemic and the
associated anti-Asian discrimination brought greater social isolation to older Chinese and non-Chinese APA
adults over the past three years than other groups. These factors together formed the foundation of the
Resource Center for Alzheimer’s and Dementia Research in Asian and Pacific Americans (RCASIA) with
missions of 1) increasing scientists underrepresented in AD/ADRD-related Behavioral, Social, and Economic
Research biomedical research through innovative models of mentoring and community interaction; 2)
advancing the rigor and impact of AD/ADRD pilot studies in older APAs through Common Data Elements and
data-sharing; 3) serving as a national resource for linguistically/culturally tested and validated tools to assess
cognition, function, and AD/ADRD care in APA populations. Focusing on the theme of People, Culture,
Place, Time, RCASIA will leverage strong institutional support and relationships to solicit pilot applications
from Early Stage Investigators (ESIs). We will actively engage and encourage applications from ESIs at
NYC/NJ-based Minority Serving Institutions through pre-application RCASIA internships and partnership
commitments from large funded studies prospectively recruiting disaggregated older APAs. Scientist
mentoring will occur in the Research Education Component (co-led by a returning REC Core Lead and a newly
recruited yet established AD/ADRD Education/Psychosocial Core Lead) involving mentoring/method-based
Pods and ethnicity-based Teams. REC will be supported by the Leadership & Administrative Core, the
Measurement & Analytical Core, and Community Liaison & Recruitment Core in selecting each year’s class of
RCASIA Scientists, enhancing multi-generational method and career development in Pods, conducting
transdisciplinary engagement with Community & Lived Advisors in Teams, and evaluating the outcomes of
Scientists, effectiveness of the Pod/Team model, impact of Common Data Elements and data sharing, and
long-term relationships between RCASIA and funded Scientists. Returning and new faculty’s commitment to
diversity, equity, inclusion, and access and APA brain health will contribute to RCASIA’s goal of becoming the
epicenter for AD/ADRD-related Behavioral, Social, and Economic Research in older APA populations."

Metabolic diseases include obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are associated with exacerbated health risks that
can be life threatening such as heart complications, viral infections, or cancer. Current therapies to treat obesity
are based on exercise, diet, and/or bariatric surgery that not always are possible or succeed due to genetic
components, non-compliance, or excessive cost. There is a need to understand the mechanisms that sustain
energy balance to provide more efficient and cost-effective therapies. Activation of adaptive thermogenesis is
an attractive approach to combat obesity/T2D. Increased thermogenic and metabolic function in response to
lower temperatures or high calorie diets occurs, at least in part, in specialized fat cells, brown and beige
adipocytes. Adult humans possess mitochondria-enriched beige-like adipocytes that display molecular
signatures resembling murine beige fat and can be reactivated by cold or b3 agonists causing metabolic benefits.
Thermogenic activity in specialized adipose cells depends on the fitness of mitochondrial organelles carrying
uncoupling respiration or futile reactions that dissipate energy as heat. Mitochondrial respiration occurs in
organized structures called cristae, tubular invaginations of the inner mitochondrial membrane that function as
battery-like devices generating and dissipating energy. We have identified a new cold stress inducible
mechanism that controls mitochondrial cristae assembly and thermogenic activity in brown/beige adipose cells.
Components of this thermogenic regulatory mechanism include the cold- and adrenergic-activated ER resident
kinase PERK that signals to mitochondrial protein import machinery facilitating assembly of MICOS complexes
that organize and promote cristae biogenesis. In vitro and in vivo studies show that adipose PERK deficiency
results in defective cristae formation and impaired thermogenic responses. The premise of this application is
that the ER signals to the mitochondrial protein import to control cristae biogenesis and form competent
thermogenic adipocytes protecting against lower temperatures and obesity/T2D. We have three aims: 1)
determine the regulatory mechanisms of cristae biogenesis and thermogenic function through PERK activation,
focusing on how PERK controls cristae formation including activation of OGT-dependent glycosylation; 2)
determine the mechanisms of cold-dependent mitochondrial protein import coupled to thermogenic function,
investigating co-chaperones and TOM70-assisted MIC19 protein import that causes cristae biogenesis and
thermogenic function, and 3) analysis of mitochondrial cristae formation and metabolic/energetic function during
cold- and diet-induced thermogenesis using genetic mouse models, focusing on how different this signaling ER-
mitochondria axis impacts energy balance and metabolism during cold adaptation and high fat diet feeding. The
outcomes of this application will determine the regulatory mechanisms that control thermogenic mitochondrial
cristae biogenesis in response to lower temperatures and excess calorie intake. These regulatory mechanisms
have important implications in metabolic diseases including obesity and T2D and related clinical complications."
10916460,"Project Summary
The brain is a critical mediator of energy homeostasis, and neurocircuit dysfunction is thought to underlie obesity
pathogenesis. Within the brain, the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) exerts control over feeding behavior and
body weight. Because of its considerable molecular and functional complexity, the role of LHA neurons in the
development of diet-induced obesity (DIO) is still poorly understood. Addressing the LHA mechanisms governing
feeding behavior and how they are remodeled during DIO will help to develop more targeted therapeutic
interventions for obesity. Our overarching goal is to gain a mechanistic understanding of LHA neuronal
dysfunction in DIO. Our previous work has demonstrated that the two most abundant cell types in the LHA—
glutamatergic (LHAGlut) and GABAergic (LHAGABA) neurons—are transcriptionally remodeled by DIO. LHAGlut and
LHAGABA neurons functionally oppose one another: LHAGlut neurons suppress feeding and reduce body weight,
whereas LHAGABA neurons promote feeding and increase body weight. Our preliminary data confirm that LHAGlut
and LHAGABA neurons show opposing changes in activity during acute manipulations of energy state and exhibit
opponent transcriptional changes during DIO. These results highlight a potential role for LHA neuron dysfunction
as a cause for overeating and DIO. However, the mechanisms underlying LHAGlut and LHAGABA neuron
dysfunction in DIO are unknown. One factor that influences energy homeostasis, feeding behavior, and LHA
activity is glucose. We therefore hypothesize that alterations in responsivity to glucose contribute to LHAGlut and
LHAGABA neuron dysfunction in acute and chronic overnutrition and that restoration of LHA neuron activity can
reverse the metabolic and behavioral impairments observed in DIO. To test this, we will determine the temporal
dynamics of LHAGlut and LHAGABA neuron remodeling in DIO using longitudinal multiphoton in vivo imaging and
electrophysiology. We will then test the hypothesis that glucose changes the activity of LHAGlut and LHAGABA
neurons in vivo after acute and chronic overfeeding. Finally, we will test the hypothesis that restoration of LHAGlut
and LHAGABA neuron activity can reverse the adverse consequences of chronic overnutrition. The results of this
project will advance our conceptual understanding of the brain's involvement in DIO and identify novel
therapeutic targets for the treatment of eating disorders and obesity."

The dynamic tumor microenvironment (TME) where cells continuously communicate, migrate, and react to
each other and the signals that are secreted, is critical for inducing tumor progression and aggressiveness of
most forms of cancer. We have special interest in glioblastoma (GBM) that displays a dynamic and complex
TME for which we have developed the necessary tools to dissect it, understand it, and have a positive impact
on its treatment. As such, it is necessary to understand the underlying biology in a dynamic and relevant
environment. With various degrees of limitation pertaining to currently available in vitro and in vivo models, in
this proposal, we aim to leverage our expertise to optimize a unique three-dimensional (3D) human mini-GBM
model through the utilization of a light-based bioprinting technology and taking advantage of primary neuronal,
vascular, and GBM cells, to more precisely replicate the brain TME in human patients. It is anticipated that,
construction of an in vitro 3D human mini-GBM model mimicking not only the cellular compositions but also the
extracellular matrix (ECM) properties and importantly, tissue architecture of its in vivo counterpart, will allow us
to precisely assess proliferation, migration, and transformation of GBM cells, similar to those already proven in
ex vivo GBM organotypic cultures but at much higher availability and throughput for potential drug screening in
the future."

The primary objective of this proposal is to continue our longstanding (45yr) cardiopulmonary research training
efforts at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (CUAMC). This program trains individuals with
doctoral degrees in either biological or medical sciences for successful careers in research. A multidisciplinary
team-oriented approach to both mentoring and training emphasizing the integration of studies at the molecular,
cellular, tissue organ, and physiological (whole organism) levels permits rapid bench-to-bedside-to-bench
translation of the work performed. Our program is continually evolving. We expanded the focus to include access
to genomics and transcriptomics expertise through the Genomic Shared Resource Center and to advanced
computational skills through a new Center for Health Artificial Intelligence. These additions complement our
focus in Bioengineering, Biomaterials, Regenerative Medicine, Genomics, Metabolomics and Redox Biology.
Collectively, this expanded focus enables us to involve outstanding programs and investigators whose work
directly intersects with cardiopulmonary biology. Of the many training grants at CUAMC, this is the only one
specifically dedicated to pulmonary vascular biology and one of only 2 in the country focusing on this area. Our
continuing and long-term goal is that after 3 years of training the program’s fellows will have acquired the
professional skills to be competitive for research and/or teaching positions and obtain their own extramural funds.
Toward this end, we have added outstanding new scientific and educational mentors. Further, Dr. Flores has
been appointed multiple PI and brings great strength to our program as Vice Chair of Diversity and Justice for
the Department of Medicine. Our specific objectives are: 1)To attract and select talented and highly motivated
fellows who have a demonstrated interest in cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. 2)To provide trainees with
an intensive research experience by pairing them with mentors who are rigorously selected based on their
qualifications. 3)To enhance the scientific knowledge and critical thinking abilities by requiring a series of formal
workshops/lectures. 4)To enhance multidisciplinary, collaborative approaches to research by requiring co-
mentors and a Team-oriented T-shaped Development for T-32 Trainees (T4) approach. 5)Train fellows in
responsible and ethical conduct of research. 6)To help the trainees/scientists develop proficiency with a wide
array of non-bench professional skills necessary for biomedical research careers such as communication,
leadership development, and project management and professionalism. 7)To introduce our fellows to a suite of
social science theories and provide instruction on how to navigate biases and microaggressions in academia.
The increasing national and international interest in pulmonary vascular biology, the expanded nature of our
program, and the excellent track record of training individuals from all backgrounds, including underrepresented
minorities, support our request for 6 postdoctoral trainees each year."

The goal of this project is to investigate the structure and function of a poorly understood family of ion channels
known as TMEM63s. There are three members of the family in animals, known as TMEM63A, B and C.
TMEM63s form mechanosensitive ion channels and are thought to be the animal orthologues of the plant OSCA
channels. TMEM63A mutations have been identified in young patients with hypo-myelinating
leukodystrophies characterized by myelin deficits suggesting a functional role of TMEM63A in myelination and
neuronal development. TMEM63B deficiency in mice leads to deafness and it is hypothesized to act as an
osmosensor in auditory hair cells. TMEM63B mutations in humans lead to a range of disorders including severe
neurodevelopmental disorders, epileptic encephalopathy, hematological abnormalities, and hearing loss. A
genomic analysis in hypertensive rats implied a role for TMEM63C in kidney damage. When expressed in
heterologous cells, TMEM63A and TMEM63B can be activated by mechanical stimulation, revealing small
currents of 10s to 100s of pA. These data, while intriguing, raise fundamental questions regarding the structure
and function TMEM63 mechanosensitive ion channels and whether TMEM63 channels share common
molecular, structural, and gating mechanisms with other mechanosensitive ion channels.
 The project is organized around three specific aims. For aim one, we will determine the structures of
human p.V44M variant of TMEM63B using single-particle cryo-EM. We hypothesize this variant biases the
channel toward the open state. For aim two, we will investigate the function of TMEM63B in proteoliposomes
and in heterologous cell lines. We will evoke mechanically activated currents using pressure steps and perfusion
of hypoosmotic bath solutions. We will investigate structural and functional aspects of WT TMEM63B and will
use site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the function of various structural features, including the putative
pore region, the intracellular loop, IL2, and the hypothesized gating helices. We will also investigate the
functional consequences of human TMEM63B mutations including the p.V44M variant. For the third aim, we
will investigate the physiological contributions of TMEM63B expressed in inner ear hair cells. We hypothesize
that intense auditory stimulation promotes massive influx of potassium and calcium in hair cells, raising
intracellular osmolarity and causing ionic imbalance. With the inside of the cell being hypertonic relative to
external hypotonic bath solution, cell swelling may ensue which may, in turn, activate TMEM63B channels.
Calcium influx via TMEM63B is postulated to activate neighboring calcium-activated potassium channels
promoting potassium efflux and ionic equilibration. Disruption of this pathway is thought to lead to hair cell
death and hearing loss. The experiments proposed herein will shed light on the role of TMEM63B in hair cells
and hearing and will illuminate structural and functional features of this newly discovered, poorly understood
family of mechanosensitive ion channels."

10889271,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The global epidemic of obesity poses formidable challenges to human health associated with risks of chronic
diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Obesity is driven by systemic energy surplus
with excessive fat deposition in white adipocytes (WAs). Brown adipocytes (BAs) that are specialized in
dissipating energy through non-shivering thermogenesis and increasing energy expenditure represent a
potential therapeutic target in obesity treatments. However, there is a critical knowledge gap in fully
understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying BA function. Our long-term goal is therefore to explore
the novel molecular regulation of BAs in order to facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies to combat
obesity. By performing quantitative mitochondrial proteomics, we recently identified Family With Sequence
Similarity 210, Member A (FAM210A), an uncharacterized protein, as a critical regulator of thermogenesis in
brown adipose tissue (BAT). Emerging studies reported a potential role of FAM210A in regulating skeletal
muscle growth and pathological cardiac remodeling, however the function of FAM210A in thermogenic BAs is
completely unknown. Using newly developed Fam210a floxed mice, we provided strong preliminary data
supporting an essential physiological role of FAM210A in BAT thermogenesis. We showed that 1) FAM210A is
highly induced by cold and coupled with cold-induced mitochondrial cristae remodeling; 2) Adipocyte-specific
knockout (KO) of Fam210a in mice leads to the whitening of BAT and cold intolerance; 3) Loss of Fam210a
causes metabolic dysfunction of BAT; 4) Fam210a KO induces the depletion of mitochondria and disruption of
cristae architecture. Based on this exciting discovery, the overall goal of this proposed study is to elucidate the
cellular and molecular mechanisms by which FAM210A functions in BAs to regulate thermogenesis, and
investigate the physiological role of adipose FAM210A in systemic metabolism. To achieve this goal, we
propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, using mice and cells with inducible deletion of Fam210a in adipocytes,
we will evaluate the regulatory role of FAM210A in mitochondrial metabolism, synthesis, and degradation in
BAs in vivo and in vitro. Employing high-resolution three-dimensional imaging systems, we will dissect the
function of FAM210A in controlling cold-induced cristae membrane remodeling. In Aim 2, we will define the
molecular mechanisms through which FAM210A regulates mitochondrial homeostasis and cristae remodeling
in BAs via the identification and characterization of interacting protein partners that enable FAM210A’s
regulation of cristae-shaping protein. In Aim 3, we will utilize our unique loss- and gain-of-function mouse
models to test whether FAM210A is required and sufficient to increase energy expenditure and systemic
metabolism so as to ameliorate diet-induced obesity and metabolic dysfunction. Upon completion of the
proposed studies, we expect to establish the functional role of FAM210A as a novel regulator of mitochondrial
dynamics and BA thermogenesis, thus identifying a new potential therapeutic target for the obesity epidemic."
10908720,"Project Summary:
A large body of experimental and clinical evidence has demonstrated that dysregulation of the
renin angiotensin system (RAS), resulting in elevated concentrations of Angiotensin II (Ang II),
contributes to increased inflammation, oxidative stress, and development of metabolic syndrome,
obesity, diabetes and its complications including DR. In addition to circulating RAS, components
of RAS are also expressed in different tissues including the eye. Local RAS dysfunction
contributes to tissue pathophysiology and end-organ damage in diabetes. However, the exact
mechanisms by which ocular RAS contribute to retinal pathophysiology in diabetes are still not
well-understood. Prorenin, a precursor of the active renin, the rate-limiting enzyme in RAS
cascade, is highly elevated plasma of diabetic patients and ocular fluid of DR patients. The
discovery of its receptor, pro/renin receptor (PRR), provided a mechanistic link of elevated
prorenin in pathogenesis of DR. Activation of this pathway has been shown to increase Ang II
production at tissue level, as well as direct activation of downstream signaling independent of Ang
II action, both of which contribute to end-organ damage. In addition to function as a crucial
component of RAS, PRR is an integral component of vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), which
plays central roles in the acidification of intracellular compartments and cellular pH homeostasis.
PRR also acts an adaptor protein between the Wnt signaling complex and V-ATPase. Moreover,
a soluble form of PRR (sPRR) is produced by protease-mediated cleavage and is elevated under
various pathological conditions including DR. Increasing evidence implicates a pathological role
of elevated sPRR; however, the mechanisms by which sPRR contribute to pathogenesis of these
conditions are still not fully understood. We hypothesize that elevated prorenin, PRR and its
soluble form (sPRR) contribute to pathogenesis of DR by multiple pathways, leading to local RAS
activation, as well as signaling events independent of Ang II action. The goal of this proposal is
to (1) determine the mechanisms of prorenin-induced, PRR-mediated signaling pathways in
pathogenesis of DR; (2) determine whether elevated sPRR mediate prorenin-stimulated effects
and activates Ang II-dependent pathways in the retina; and (3) determine the effects and
mechanisms of prorenin and sPRR on V-ATPase function and associated cellular processes.
Collectively, the proposed studies will determine the mechanism(s) and signaling pathways by
which prorenin, pro/renin receptor, and its soluble form contribute to retinal neurovascular
dysfunction in diabetes. Knowledge of the mechanisms and relationship between these pathways
will drive the development of more effective therapies for diabetic retinopathy."
10861049,"Cardiac hypertrophy can lead to heart failure, with few treatment options. Hypertrophic growth inevitably
requires mechanisms of protein distribution, as studies show the involvement of both increased mRNA
translation and mRNA trafficking along microtubules. Yet, how the distribution of membrane proteins occurs and
responds to hypertrophic growth is unknown. While sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca handling is key to
hypertrophy, we do not know how trafficking of SR proteins occurs using cardiomyocyte specific mechanisms,
nor its regulation and response to hypertrophy, which precludes discovery of key targets for therapeutics. To
probe this mechanism and identify sites of regulation, we have focused on a common portion of the biosynthetic
membrane pathway where the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) organizes and sorts proteins for transit into
SR tubules. Using a species-specific expression and immunological analysis to study the early steps of SR
protein trafficking in adult cardiomyocytes, we show that newly synthesized proteins first accumulate into
organized perinuclear ER puncta aligned with z-lines, and then transit to transverse SR z-tubules that aligned
with T-tubules. Such morphology is observed for all newly made proteins examined, except for phospholamban,
suggesting commonality of these protein sorting sites in ER. Afterward, motors can power transport of proteins
both radially and axially via microtubules to their steady state distributions. These data lead to our hypotheses
that newly synthesized SR proteins are sorted in a specific set of perinuclear ER subdomains, which are
organized by the alignment with z-lines and in proximity to nuclear pores and translocons, contain critical ER
trafficking proteins, and allow newly made SR proteins to develop their initial functional interactions for transit to
SR. Such cellular sorting and trafficking steps adapt to the physiological demands, but maladapt to hypertrophic
heart failure, which are likely amenable to develop new therapeutics regulating membrane protein trafficking. To
dissect biochemical features of these sorting sites and trafficking steps, we have developed key experimental
systems to determine progressive protein distribution 12-48 h after translation of three small single
transmembrane domain proteins that are destined to different subcellular locations. Included is phospholamban
(in the nuclear envelope and in longitudinal SR for Ca uptake), junctin (in junctional SR for Ca release), and
phospholemman (in sarcolemma and intercalated discs to regulate the Na, K-pump). Aim 1 will determine: if a
single perinuclear ER subdomain can effectively accumulate and co-localize newly made SR proteins (junctin
and phospholamban), but separate phospholemman, for their diverse and distinct steady state distributions; if
sites are aligned with nuclear pores, translocons; and if known ER trafficking proteins, newly identified in our
SERCA-activated SR proteome, will modulate these trafficking steps. Aim 2 will determine whether a
hypertrophic response modulates the accumulations of protein into any of the ER sorting sites, their common
biosynthesis pathways, or the novel sets of cardiac ER trafficking proteins, in animal models of hypertrophy."
10849898,"Innate immunity is an absolutely essential host defense mechanism that, if perturbed, can itself
cause a large number of human diseases. Among innate immune defense mechanisms,
inflammasomes are cytosolic supramolecular complexes that recruit and activate inflammatory
caspases, in particular caspase-1, to mediate proteolytic maturation of proinflammatory cytokines
in the IL-1 family, and induce the rapid inflammatory form of cell death known as pyroptosis.
Cytokine release and pyroptosis both signal danger to the rest of the immune system and
pyroptosis kills infected or damaged cells to curtail the spread of the disease.
 NLRP3 is the inflammasome sensor that has caught the attention of the field and is emerging
to be a general sensor of membrane damage and cellular stress, induced by pathogens and
endogenous danger signals such as bacterial toxin nigericin, extracellular ATP, uric acid crystals,
cholesterol crystals, hyaluronan and amyloid-β fibrils. Uric acid crystal-induced inflammasome
activation is causal to severe joint inflammation in gout, and other stimuli could contribute to
cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. NLRP3 has a tripartite organization with an N-
terminal effector domain known as PYD, a central nucleotide-binding ATPase domain (NBD, also
known as NACHT) and a C-terminal LRR domain. Upon activation, NLRP3 recruits the adaptor
ASC through PYD-PYD interactions and ASC further recruits caspase-1 through CARD-CARD
interactions to induce proximity-promoted caspase dimerization and activation.
 Despite the great academic and clinical interest on NLRP3, the molecular pathway and
mechanism for NLRP3 activation remain unclear, likely due to the complicated conformational
transitions and intracellular trafficking that are just beginning to be elucidated. In this application,
we propose to elucidate the functional mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome activation by
investigating the conformational transitions and intracellular trafficking."
10894109,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of this R01 proposal is to investigate how complement component C3 derived from the lung epithelium
can improve host resilience during acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). C3
is a central component of the complement system and one of the most abundant circulatory proteins. It is an
early responder to injury and operates by killing pathogens and clearing debris. However, we have shown that it
takes time for circulating C3 to reach the alveolar space in ALI, thereby increasing the dependence on C3 present
in the lung. We have also shown that not only is lung epithelial cell-derived C3 secreted, but also its intracellular
stores are central to the protection against ALI and cell death. These findings are a shift from the conventional
thinking that liver-derived C3 is the main operational form of complement in the lung and increases the emphasis
on epithelial cells as a source. Additionally, we have shown that many immune cell types—including
macrophages—derive C3 stores via uptake from the extracellular space, and this uptake improves their effector
response. Hence, this proposal focuses on an emerging role for lung epithelial cell-derived C3 in promoting the
survival and function of epithelial cells and macrophages, each one vital in ALI. A major hurdle for investigating
tissue-specific roles of complement has been the limited availability of models and assays. We have developed
new transgenic mouse models and functional assays that distinguish the roles of liver- and lung-derived
complement and show that epithelial cell-derived C3 is central to protection in ALI. We have supplemented these
models and assays with data from ex vivo human models to show key roles for C3 in the cellular response to
injury. These results support our central hypothesis that lung epithelial cell-derived C3 modulates the
bronchoalveolar epithelial and immune cell niche to reduce ALI. This proposal will test our hypothesis by
achieving two Specific Aims. Aim 1 compares targeted liver derived C3-deficient mice with lung epithelial cell-
derived C3-deficient mice to assess if the cytoprotection offered by lung epithelial cell-derived C3 is cell-type
intrinsic or also regional. It will also address how to optimally augment C3 to protect the injured lung. Aim 2 uses
a combination of conditional knockout mice and deceased human donor lungs to assess how lung epithelial cell-
derived C3 influences the pulmonary myeloid cell compartment, especially alveolar macrophage survival and
function. It also addresses how to modulate C3 uptake in these cells to optimize their function. The proposal brings
together a principal investigator with expertise in complement biology and acute lung injury, and co-investigators
with expertise in gene delivery, CRISPR screens and bioinformatics to determine the immunobiological role of
lung epithelial cell-derived C3 in facilitating host defense at the site of injury and promoting tissue resilience. The
proposed work is important because understanding how the early host immune response modulates tissue
damage is essential for designing and implementing new therapies for ALI. The knowledge will form the basis of
locally delivered, host-focused therapies for ARDS, thus aligning with a priority research area for the NHLBI."
10894110,"SUMMARY
Social interactions impact everyday decisions, even decisions lacking explicit social content. How mammals
process social information is intensively investigated. Still, how prior social experiences influence later decision
making is not well-understood, likely due in part to a dearth of assays for use in malleable model organisms.
 My team developed a task referred to as social incentivization of future choice (SIFC). Mice are trained
to respond in operant conditioning chambers for two equally preferred foods, then one food is paired with the
opportunity to interact with a novel conspecific. The other food is paired with a novel object. We find that mice
will later respond more for the conspecific-associated food, even in the absence of that conspecific. Thus, prior
social experience appears to confer value to familiar rewards and incentivize choosing that reward over another
– akin to one repeatedly favoring a particular restaurant because it’s where one had a first date.
 The medial orbitofrontal cortex (MO) is necessary for generating reward-seeking actions when the motivating
features of possible rewards are not available and must be envisioned – as in SIFC, when mice must recall social
interactions. Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is integral to MO development, and we recently found
that neuronal Bdnf depletion in the MO early in life obstructs SIFC. Many unanswered questions remain. We will:
 Aim 1: Determine whether BDNF in the developing MO impacts social value processing via MO-BLA
connections. We will test the hypothesis that MO-BLA connections require neuronally-derived BDNF for
maturation, such that Bdnf silencing in developing MO neurons, but not other cell types, will: 1) diminish MO
terminal densities in the BLA and 2) occlude learning-dependent dendritic spine plasticity on excitatory BLA
neurons. 3) We will test the hypothesis that dendritic spine plasticity in the BLA is necessary for SIFC to occur.
 Aim 2: Dissociate the roles of pre- vs. post-synaptic trkB in SIFC. BDNF is subject to anterograde
transport; thus, where BDNF must bind to its ubiquitously expressed high-affinity receptor, tropomyosin receptor
kinase B (trkB), to control SIFC remains unclear. We will test the hypothesis that BDNF-trkB in the MO and
not BLA is necessary for mice to integrate social information into decision-making behavior. We will then replace
trkB activity during specific developmental epochs to identify critical periods of action. In a sub-aim, we will
compare any effects in the SIFC task to those in a traditional Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (PIT) task to
reveal dissociable effects of neurotrophin signaling on social vs. non-social PIT behavior, if they exist.
 Aim 3: Recover SIFC following social isolation. Early-life adversity can profoundly impact cognitive and
social function later in life. We find that adolescent social isolation causes the premature up-regulation of trkB
full-length isoforms and stress-related co-factors and obstructs SIFC. We will test the hypothesis that select
factors in the BLA causally influence SIFC, with overexpression obstructing SIFC and inhibition normalizing
social decision-making."
10922816,"Project Summary: The goal of the proposal is to develop a Bayesian statistical framework for mortality estimation
from disparate data sources. Using this framework we will produce a suite of principled methods to be used in
those situations in which vital registration data are lacking. We will emphasize efﬁcient implementations that
can be used by researchers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), who may have limited computing
resources. In Aim 1, we will develop guidelines on a general statistical framework for mortality estimation. Aim 2
will focus on subnational child mortality with particular emphasis on the under-5 mortality rate (U5MR), which is
a key indicator of the health of a population, and the neonatal mortality rate (NMR). Excess mortality estimation
during the Covid-19 pandemic, by month, at the country level, will be the subject of Aim 3. We will disseminate
results widely and provide software and training in the developed methods.
 We will produce yearly estimates of U5MR and NMR at the geographical level at which health decisions are
made. To achieve this goal, household survey, VR and census data must be combined in a coherent way. Census
data on child mortality typically provide summary birth history (SBH) data, which consist of mother's age along
with the number of children born and the number who died, but without the times at which those events occurred.
We will develop a framework for combining the different data sources, which will entail dealing with the design
issues in the household survey, accounting for unknown birth and death times in the SBH data, and estimating the
completeness of the VR data (births and deaths). We will also incorporate demographic information via a form
of Bayesian benchmarking. Effective and appropriate use of the models will require rigorous model assessment,
careful interpretation of results and meaningful and informative graphical summaries.
 We will develop robust models to evaluate the excess mortality, i.e., the difference between the deaths ob-
served in the pandemic and those expected if the pandemic had not occurred. We will model the expected deaths,
and incorporate the uncertainty in this endeavor in the excess mortality calculation. Completeness of mortality
counts, that is, under-reporting and delays in reporting, will also be considered. For countries who do not report
deaths in the pandemic, we must predict the mortality count using available country-level covariate data, and we
will adopt ﬂexible yet interpretable regression forms, and acknowledge uncertainty in the covariate data.
 We will produce user-friendly software for the methods, along with vignettes and training materials, including
short courses. The endpoint is to have software that can be used by researchers in LMICs. All aims will be
informed by the collaborative team's close links with the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality
Estimation (for the subnational child mortality aim) and the World Health Organization Division of Data, Analytics
and Delivery for Impact (for the excess mortality aim). Together we will develop methods to highlight disparities
and inform interventions."
10927443,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The prevalence of symptom-based diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), its empiric treatment,
and practice variation in high-risk hospitalized infants remain high. Prior clinical trials data lack physiological-
based, objective diagnostic evidence and treatment. GERD is frequently diagnosed by inadequate criteria, and
the relative risks, benefits, and indications of GERD therapies are unclear. Thus, gaps in knowledge persist, and
a GERD diagnosis can cost an extra $70k and 30 days of hospitalization per infant. Objective, effective,
evidence-based therapies are critically needed. As nearly all infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)
are symptomatic, twenty-four-hour pH-Impedance (pH-Imp) testing can diagnose objectively and detect
mechanisms of pathophysiologic GERD. Therefore, this study’s overall objective is to conduct a single-center
randomized control trial (RCT) to test the central hypothesis that the effects of common therapies [natural
maturation, acid suppression-proton pump inhibitor (PPI), or thickened feeds using added rice (AR) formula] are
distinct in high-risk infants, under six months corrected maturational age with pH-Imp defined criteria for GERD.
The rationale is to refine novel diagnostic criteria and rigorously investigate the impact of randomized therapies
to achieve the long-term goal of creating effective, simplified, evidence-based, and scalable treatment
algorithms.
We will test this hypothesis in the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Conduct the RCT to evaluate and compare the
efficacy and safety of interventions on the primary clinical endpoint (oral feeding improvement and absence of
troublesome symptoms) to test the working hypothesis that AR is superior to natural maturation and PPI. Aim 2:
Evaluate pH-Imp characteristics and test the working hypotheses that pH-Imp mechanisms are distinct between
a) assigned therapies, and b) clinical success and failure. This project challenges current empiric approaches to
diagnosing and managing GERD in NICU infants by using both a novel combination of pH-Imp metrics and
randomized allocations with targeted stratification (GERD severity and feeding skills) to determine true
therapeutic effects on clinical and mechanistic characteristics. The anticipated outcomes will identify diagnostic
algorithms for determining GERD and effective treatment approaches. In addition, the proposed research is
significant because the knowledge gained will provide the diagnostic basis, framework, and scientific and
economic rationale for future studies to further refine therapies across the pediatric age spectrum. We expect
new benchmarks to develop preventative and therapeutic strategies for GERD, which will positively impact the
quality of life for infants and parents by improving digestive health, overall nutrition, and growth, all relevant to
the mission of NIH (NIDDK)."
10901981,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In this proposal we want to understand the metabolic factors that are essential to tissue-resident
macrophage (TRM) development and function. New advances in metabolomics technology have
helped to decode how cellular metabolism helps to shape immune cell form and function, but
these developments have so far generally stopped short of meaningfully probing the metabolism
of immune cells within the tissues themselves. For cells like TRMs, that exclusively reside within
the tissues, a full understanding the biology of these cells is missing until we can identify how they
utilize cellular metabolism to support their tissue-specific identity and function. Given the important
roles TRMs play in maintaining tissue homeostasis and shaping pathogenic environments, it is
essential we begin to probe the biochemistry of these cells. We present an approach for exploring
TRM metabolism in vivo. Through the use of metabolic tracers in vivo and rapid isolation of TRMs
from the tissue, we detail how this approach will be used to identify metabolic programs essential
to TRM development and function within the tissues. We show how proof of principle testing of
this framework reveals the polyamine-hypusine axis as a novel metabolic node active in
differentiating monocytes and TRMs. We implement in vitro and in vivo validation studies laid out
in our framework, which include bone marrow chimera, parabiosis and novel mouse model
creation, to show that this pathway is essential for the development and maintenance of TRMs
across a multitude of organs. We also propose a highly novel approach to studying TRM
metabolism in humans. Using normathemic perfusion machines, we will perfuse human organs
with metabolic tracers to gain an understanding of human TRM biology in situ. Crucially, we will
employ this approach to experimentally test the pathways identified as important in mouse TRMs
in a human setting. Finally, a major focus of this proposal is to explore TRM metabolism within
tumors. Using similar approaches outlined above for TRMs during homeostasis, we will evaluate
the metabolic activity of TAMs using well defined murine tumor models. We will use our innovative
human system that allows us to experimentally manipulate human organs to probe the
metabolism of human hepatocellular carcinoma lesions and of the TRMs that reside inside them.
Through these orthogonal approaches across species, we expect to build up a detailed picture of
tumor macrophage metabolic activity that can be used to identify novel pathways that can be
targeted to modulate these cells within tumors for therapeutic benefit."
10904943,"Abstract
Chronic pain is one of the leading health problems worldwide. Opioids have served as gold standard for
treating moderate to severe pain. However, opioids possess serious adverse effects that limit their use in
clinics. Therefore there is an unmet need for alternative effective and non-addictive pain treatments.
Neuropeptide B/W Receptor 1 (NPBWR1) has emerged as a novel pain target which upon activation can
produced analgesic effects on its own or in synergy with opioids. To date, all reported NPBWR1 agonists
are peptides or peptidomimetics that do not cross the blood brain barrier, requiring central administration.
To facilitate research on this promising target, we propose to perform a high throughput screen of our
diverse small molecule library to identify small molecule agonists (Aim 1). We have developed a battery of
in vitro functional assays to characterize NPBWR1 ligands including a cAMP, calcium mobilization and
TruPath assays. The 384-well cAMP assay has been demonstrated to have good robustness Z'>0.5, S/B >
20. Hits will be validated using counter screen and orthogonal assays. Validated hits will be assessed for
ADME profiling and selectivity against other targets (Aim 2). Completion of this proposal will yield small
molecule NPBWR1 that serve as starting points for subsequent medicinal chemistry optimization to develop
into therapeutics for chronic pain and other NPBWR1-mediated conditions."
10908643,"SUMMARY
 Membranous nephropathy (MN) is a glomerular disease due to the deposition of anti-podocyte antibodies
in the subepithelial space of the glomerular basement membrane. This leadis to complement-mediated podocyte
injury and, in ~30% of patients, to the development of end stage kidney disease within 10 years from diagnosis.
Most of the research in MN has focused on the autoantibody specificities and has led to the identification of
phospholipase 2A receptor (PLA2R) as the main target antigen in 70%-80% of the patients. Conversely, little is
known on autoreactive T cells, despite the evidence from other antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases clearly
showing a critical pathogenic role of autoreactive T cells, efficacy of T cell targeting treatments, and our
preliminary data documenting that autoreactive T cells are present in the circulation of MN patients.
 Aim 1 of the present project will develop a new strategy to capture the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of
PLA2R-reactive T cells in MN patients. We will apply high-throughput paired T cell receptor alpha and beta chain
DNA sequence capture for renewable TCR gene library generation and functional screening from patient T cells.
We will physically link TCR gene sequences for cloning into cellular display libraries, enabling repeated in vitro
functional analyses of TCRs in ways that are impossible with alternative available techniques. Aim 2 will apply
these technologies for the study of the single-cell transcriptional profile of CD4+ T cells. These data will reveal
the characteristics of autoreactive TCRs in a previously collected samples from MN patients with remission
versus active disease, setting the stage for expanded clinical studies.
 Overall, this project will collect and analyze immune response data from MN patients with unprecedented
molecular scope and scale. Our approach is innovative because it couples carefully designed clinical sample
sets with new high-throughput approaches in TCR analysis to comprehensively interrogate the molecular
mechanisms of T cell responses in MN patients. The proposed research is significant because it will provide
important tools for mechanistic studies aimed at identifying new biomarkers and therapeutic targets for MN
patients."

scientific community-engaged approach utilized within the Project. We will develop new normative values and
conduct multi-pronged validation analyses as warranted within diverse and representative samples. This work
will be performed by the team of statisticians and psychometricians responsible for norming and validating the
NIH Toolbox®, Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System®, and International Cognitive Ability
Resource. The Data Core will ensure that any new measures can be included within the automated data
processing pipeline, including ensuring that the measures are well-defined using JSON schemas so that the data
are self-describing. This allows the data to be seamlessly integrated into the centralized data repository. Further,
this repository allows data aggregation across studies, supporting novel and innovative “big data” approaches.
The Data Core will enable learning systems to aggregate data and implement unsupervised and semi-supervised
machine learning approaches across studies."
10906994,"Technical Core Summary
 The Technical Core will provide general infrastructure and tools to address technical challenges in adopting
mobile approaches to research including: participant recruitment, retention, and support; validating and
understanding new cognitive and non-cognitive tests and other physiological and environmental data; and
securing data appropriately in the context of significant participant privacy concerns. Under the original Mobile
Toolbox (MTB1) grant, we successfully built and deployed a system that allows researchers to select from a
library of validated measures, design a virtual study protocol that delivers these measures to participants through
an app running natively on their iOS or Android smartphone, and retrieve aggregated participant data through
web or programmatic interfaces. Our goal for the MTB platform is to provide a complete end-to-end solution for
the use of remotely administered cognitive and other non-cognitive measures by researcher teams. We will
achieve our overall goal to support the continued expansion and dissemination of remote mobile measures
through two aims: Aim 1: We will continuously expand the MTB library of remote, self-administered
measures; Aim 2: We will provide continued support and maintenance of the Mobile Toolbox platform
and extend its capabilities to make it increasingly easy for researchers to manage virtual interactions
with study participants to improve recruitment and adherence.
 We will focus on expansion into non-cognitive domains including contextual factors, and psychological,
physical, and behavioral functions, as well as the inclusion of passive sensor data streams to provide deeper
context for already validated measures. We will also streamline the communication between study managers
and remote participants, include support for custom survey questions to be delivered through the MTB app, and
adopt best practices on engagement for future study design. We will keep hardware and software up to date and
ensure continued reliability, performance, and security of the platform."
10906995,"Extension and Dissemination Core Summary
 The Extension and Dissemination Core (Extension Core) will facilitate the dissemination and expansion of
all components of the Mobile Toolbox Research Platform, including the assessment library, technology
infrastructure, and the data contained in the central data repository. The Extension Core will also provide
guidance and support to researchers regarding how to 1) add measures to the MTB library; 2) select and use
MTB measures for study-specific aims; (3) perform app creation, study management, data collection, and data
repository functions; and 4) share appropriately consented and de-identified data for public use. In addition to
supporting teams that require a complete end-to-end solution, the Extension core will also support research
teams that wish to extract tests for independent use and integrate independent apps with the MTB services. We
will enlarge our support services to include additional documentation, training, and tutorials, enabling researchers
to access and use new MTB measures and data types, as well as create an MTB Help Desk providing same-
day responses to inquiries. The Extension Core will promote the MTB in presentations and exhibits at
professional conferences and meetings, manuscript submissions, and through linkages to relevant government,
non-profit, professional and consumer organizations. We will vigorously promote awareness of the MTB via
multiple modalities, including social media, so that potential users can learn how the MTB can benefit their own
research activities. We will facilitate the utilization and continued growth of the MTB system by establishing a
framework for sustainability and providing guidelines for data-driven test selection, guidelines and templates for
data sharing and new measure development, and consultation and support for users. Our Aims for MTB2 are:
 Aim 1: Extend the assessment library and research platform by implementing new non-cognitive and
cognitive measures and supporting external research teams in the development of custom extensions
and configurations. To ensure that the MTB library represents the most relevant, up-to-date assessments we
will continue to open the library for extension and improvement by external developers and investigators. The
library will accommodate and implement extensions from across the research community, including measures
approved by the Steering Committee (SC).
 Aim 2: Promote increased use of the MTB and MTB data by clinical researchers, mobile data
analysts, and external developers. We will expand both outreach and support services to maximize the
broad and extensive use of the MTB and its data across a diverse research community. The Extension
Core will take a multipronged approach to accomplish this aim by 1) supporting external researchers in the
selection and use of mobile measures; 2) supporting public use and re-use of MTB data; and 3) establishing
a framework for long-term sustainability and continued evolution of the MTB."
10870024,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Sexual minorities (i.e., individuals who do not identify as heterosexual, or who are attracted to, have romantic
relationships with, or have sexual contact with, people of the same or diverse genders) in the US are at a near
three-fold increased odds for depression and a two to seven-fold increased risk for lifetime report of suicide
attempts, compared with heterosexual individuals. Structural sexual minority stigma exposure across various
levels (e.g., macro and exo levels) has been purported as a cause underlying and driving these sexual
orientation-based disparities in mental health. While structural forms of sexual minority stigma, including
discriminatory laws, inequitable policies, and negative population attitudes, have been associated with adverse
sexual minority mental health, evidence from US-based studies, depending on single stand-alone indicators of
structural stigma, has been hampered by risks for confounding bias through common causes from other 1)
higher-level and 2) same-level structural stigma-related factors, as well as 3) often-overlooked structural factors
outside of the stigma paradigm. Large existing US public health surveys do not independently allow for analyses
that can fully account for such confounding bias. But data harmonization and integration across datasets (i.e.,
NHIS, Add Health, YRBS, and ABCD) will enable complex models with newly developed comprehensive macro-
(i.e., state) and exo-level (i.e., county) structural sexual minority stigma predictors of individual-level mental
health outcomes, sufficient clusters, and large-enough mean cluster sizes. With data collected during a
transformational period for sexual minorities in the US (from 2001 to 2021; e.g., changes in population attitudes
and the step-wise introduction of same-gender marriage), the NHIS, Add Health, YRBS, and ABCD, together,
provide a once-in-a-generation and timely opportunity to harmonize and integrate these datasets to enable
complex multilevel models that account for the risks of confounding bias and aid to further strengthen causal
inferencing. Therefore, this proposed study will 1) harmonize and pool high-quality data from up to 42,000 sexual
minority and 1.4 million heterosexual individuals, 2) comprehensively quantify the level of structural sexual
minority stigma exposure in US states and counties between 2001 and 2021, and 3) examine the cross-sectional
and longitudinal associations between cross-level (i.e., macro to exo) effects of structural sexual minority stigma
and depressive symptoms and suicidality outcomes (namely, suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviors). Findings
from the proposed study may have direct theoretical and applied implications as it addresses important
confounding issues currently distorting findings on how macro- and exo-level structural sexual minority stigma
shape sexual minorities’ mental health. Results may further contribute to health equity by facilitating targeted
advocacy and therapeutic interventions to improve structural climates for sexual minorities and combat systemic
effects, not only in the US, but similarly across the globe."
10931476,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY – Overall
Distant metastasis is the primary cause of cancer-related death. To colonize distant tissues, cancer cells must
migrate while evading elimination by the immune system. Evidence suggests that key steps in the induction
process of immune tolerance occur early in the metastatic cascade, located at the regional lymph nodes proximal
to the primary tumor site. However, the nature of the interactions between malignant, immune and stromal cells
remains poorly understood, including those that involve metastatic cells within the lymph nodes. Even though
lymph nodes are in fact commonly assessed in cancer patients to determine disease stage and treatment plan,
they are understudied in the context of metastatic progression. To fill this scientific knowledge gap, we propose
a Research Center to unravel the role of lymph nodes in metastatic progression. We have established that lymph
node metastasis constitutes an essential, first step in the metastatic cascade of cancer progression. We have
found that such metastases act locally upon the adaptive immune system within the lymph nodes to begin to
induce systemic tolerance of the tumor. We will further explore this new paradigm of metastases in two
malignancies, head and neck cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, by focusing on the kinetics and spatiotemporal
changes at the primary tumor, lymph node and distant sites, associated with the onset and progression of
metastasis. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team whose coordinated efforts will involve the application
of genomic and single-cell in-situ imaging technologies on preclinical and human samples to explore the
evidence and mechanisms of the induction of immunosuppression in the lymph nodes. We propose two
Research Projects that focus our scientific theme on lymph node metastasis by analyzing kinetics in a mouse
model (Project 1) and spatial temporal changes in samples of lymph nodes and their concurrent primary tumor
(Project 2), inter-connected through integrative computational analyses. Both projects will utilize a shared
resource core dedicated to the acquisition of patient samples and associated clinical annotation and data
management (Biospecimen Core and Data Core). These efforts will yield highly multiplexed, multi-scale datasets
which will be analyzed by novel bio-computational methods to reconstruct intracellular and intercellular molecular
interaction networks in order to identify, then functionally validate, critical mediators of metastasis. Our ultimate
objective is to advance our understanding of the systemic consequences of lymph node metastases and identify
new biomarkers and therapeutic approaches. Our Research Center is also dedicated to promoting our early
investigators as the next generation thought leaders applying principles of systems biology to the study of
metastasis. Our Outreach Core activity will ensure that our Research Center’s scientific and methodological
advances in applying the principles of cancer systems biology toward the study of tumor-immune-stromal
interactions are fully disseminated in the cancer research and broader communities."
10893593,"Abstract: Novel implantable miniaturized devices (IMDs) placed directly in patient tumors can rapidly evaluate
multi-drug responses in-situ. They can be used in any solid tumor to provide direct, comprehensive, spatial multi-
omic readouts of >20 drugs simultaneously, with potential to eclipse liquid and tissue biopsy biomarker
capabilities. However, placing and retrieving IMDs in tumors currently requires highly invasive surgery with
excessively high patient morbidity and complication risks. For most cancer patients, these risks are prohibitive,
and as a result ongoing first-in-human IMD trials have had limited enrollment.
 We have developed a fully interventional (minimally invasive) non-surgical method to place and retrieve
IMDs. We use custom needle biopsy devices and image guidance to deliver and precisely remove only the IMD
and adjacent drug-exposed tissue. This is a simple outpatient procedure similar to routine percutaneous tumor
biopsies, using a single tiny (<2mm) skin incision. It reduces the morbidity and risks of IMD use, and would
greatly increase enrollment in current and future clinical IMD trials. However, a preclinical study in an animal
model is needed to demonstrate technical feasibility and safety of this interventional method prior to first-in-
human use.
 This proposal describes a preclinical study in a rabbit hindlimb tumor model that closely simulates a
typical soft tissue sarcoma setting, with the following specific aims: 1) determine the technical feasibility of our
interventional (non-surgical) approach for IMD-placement and retrieval; and 2) determine the overall safety and
adverse event rate of this same interventional method. Interventional IMD placement and retrieval procedures
will be performed in a statistically-powered cohort of 15 rabbits. Technical feasibility and safety endpoints will be
assessed, and used to inform further method refinement and ultimately first-in-human trials.
 The proposed study is innovative as it will develop and validate new interventional tools for personalized
cancer treatment that could serve as the next generation of tumor biopsy. It is significant as it will directly enable
a first-in-human trial to evaluate IMD-based drug optimization in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcomas. It
will also enable greater enrollment in ongoing IMD clinical trials in other similar or lower risk anatomic regions
(e.g. breast). Ultimately, if the overall long-term goal of clinically validating IMD-based personalized treatment
optimization is achieved, the interventional methods developed here could be applicable to every oncology
patient with a percutaneously accessible tumor (similar to routine percutaneous tissue biopsies)."
10763032,"ABSTRACT
Unhealthful diet is a leading risk factor for diabetes and mortality worldwide. As the diabetes and obesity
epidemics continue to rise, so does the contribution of dietary risk factors to global disease burden. There is an
urgent need to identify which aspects of diet causally influence metabolic disease to guide more effective dietary
recommendations. Teasing apart correlation from causation remains a challenge, and while numerous
epidemiological studies have observationally linked diet to diabetes, there has been limited success with
translation to intervention studies. Normal human genetic variation has both direct and indirect effects on dietary
intake, with recent work establishing significant heritability and hundreds of genetic associations with numerous
different foods and dietary patterns. However, combining dietary traits across studies for genetic analysis
remains a challenge due to study differences in design, cultures, and preferences. We hypothesize shared
genetic influences on dietary intake can act as the common reference to identify comparable diets across studies.
In each of several cohorts, with both genetic and diet data, we will initiate new collaborations, derive quantitative
food traits and dietary patterns, and conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to create homologous
GWAS datasets with study-specific dietary phenotypes and a common set of genetic markers. A series of genetic
correlation analyses will be conducted to identify comparable foods and dietary patterns across diverse studies.
Once identified, GWAS meta-analysis of comparable dietary phenotypes will improve power to detect novel and
multi-ethnic genetic associations. To elucidate the direct and indirect genetic mechanisms of dietary intake at
the locus and genome-wide levels we will conduct fine-mapping and gene prioritization, enrichment and pathway
analysis, and genetic correlation and phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). To address limitations with
observational studies, Mendelian randomization (MR) causal inference will be performed using genetically
predicted dietary intake and publicly available GWAS on diabetes-related outcomes to prioritize causal
associations for intervention trials. Clustering of genetic loci by phenotypic correlations and causal effects will
pinpoint genetic mechanisms of diet that causally influence metabolic disease. We will extend MR to all UK
Biobank outcomes to map comprehensive causal bidirectional relationships with diet.
Overall we will identify novel and multi-ethnic genetic associations with comparable dietary phenotypes across
diverse studies to elucidate the mechanisms of dietary intake and uncover causal relationships between diet,
diabetes, and overall human health. To achieve my goal of becoming an independent investigator in
nutrigenomic and metabolic disease research, I have designed a detailed K99 plan with didactic coursework and
co-mentoring by Drs. Florez, Hirschhorn, and Willett in metabolism, statistical genetics, and nutritional
epidemiology. During the R00 phase, while conducting independent research and continuing to develop research
skills, I will maintain and cultivate collaborations in nutrition and genetics and grow my research program."
10930170,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE SUMMARY
The Administrative Core remains a central component of the Moffitt CSBC. It has oversight of the disbursal of
funds to the Projects and Cores. It is the clearinghouse for communication between the Moffitt CSBC and the
NCI and other members of the network. The core prepares the yearly reports to the NCI and will host the
External Scientific Advisory Board as well as the annual Integration Symposium. The Administrative Core will
provide travel support for the Moffitt CSBC team, invited guest speakers, and external advisors. To foster
scientific collaborations with researchers interested in related research with particular focus on Cancer
Systems Biology, the admin Core will be responsible for the distribution of information materials,
communication with other institutions, and collaborations with other relevant research programs. The admin
core plays a particularly critical role in the CSBC pilot projects. The administrative core will advertise pilot
funding opportunities, collect applications, organize the review panel and oversee the conduct of the funded
research. These funds will be used to support exploratory research that aligns with the evolutionary and
ecological theme of our CSBC as well as unexpected avenues of investigation that arise through developments
in the CSBC projects and core. Applications will be prioritized according to their (a) scientific merit, i.e.
significance and feasibility; (b) centrality to the mission of the Moffitt CSBC, i.e. an eco-evolutionary view of
cancer, and (c) innovation, i.e. a new paradigm. These projects will be supported by the $50,000 annual
institutional funding for pilot awards (see intuitional letter of support). In addition, in years 1-5 the Moffitt CSBC
budget includes another $50K for pilot awards. The Moffitt Cancer Center currently funds $50K per year to the
winner of the annual IMO transdisciplinary workshop (also guaranteed for the next 5 years). Finally, our CSBC
budget also provides an annual budget of $75,000 for trans-network projects (a requirement of the RFA) that
will enrich for center-center collaborations, ensuring the CSBC network flourishes."
10930171,"Summary – Project 1
Project 1 will study the ∆-Ecology of tumor-immune interactions in NSCLC, with a focus on KRAS-mutant
cancers. Immunotherapy has demonstrated response rates of 30 to 45%. Most responses are followed by
evolution of resistance and progression. Recently we have quantified the immune ecology of these cancers
from pre-treatment biopsies and found unique ecological interactions that predetermine therapy response. A
focus of this proposal will be to use both pre- and on-treatment biopsies from a clinical trial to quantify the
immune ∆-Ecology during therapy. We will use a computational multiplexed-image analysis pipeline that takes
whole-slide images and segments the data into cells and quadrats to analyze the spatial and spatiotemporal
features representing ecological changes that drive tumor progression. We will then harness this analysis as a
spatiotemporal biomarker to alter treatment strategies via mathematical modeling. The computational
infrastructure will be grounded in mechanistic models, spatial statistics, machine learning, and deep learning.
Targeted therapies are also a key component in the treatment of this disease. In an exciting discovery,
inhibitors that target KRAS-G12C mutant cancers have been developed and have demonstrated clinical
efficacy. Furthermore, preclinical work has demonstrated that these inhibitors alter the immune ecology of
tumors, offering promise that combination targeted therapy and immunotherapy can significantly improve
responses. We will perform in vivo work with murine tumors and deep ecological analysis of human tumors to
determine the mechanisms of immune ∆-Ecology fomented by KRAS inhibitors, and probe combination
therapies that synergize the anti-tumor response. Our ultimate goal is the development of a predictive model of
∆-Ecology that delivers novel treatment strategies and improves outcomes, for use in future clinical trials."
10930174,"Summary
Central to the Moffitt-CSBC Education core is an annual innovative, unique, and intense one-week
interdisciplinary hands-on workshop to accelerate the training of the next generation of integrated cancer
researchers. Future leaders in cancer research must be well-versed at the interface of quantitative and life
sciences. The workshop uses current Center projects to teach integration of ecology, biological experiments,
and mathematical modeling to decipher tumor initiation, promotion and progression and predict response to a
variety of treatment modalities. Each team, led by CSBC investigators, will be comprised of students, postdocs,
patients, and faculty members with different expertise. During the intense 5 day workshop each team will
develop quantitative models for the specific projects, develop a set of specific aims for a pilot grant proposal
and give a short presentation that will be critically evaluated by a panel of senior scientists and patient
advocates. Moffitt Cancer Center has committed to funding the best grant applications with a $50K pilot project
award for the next 5 years in order to facilitate project continuation. Participation from Consortium centers is
encouraged to foster close collaborations between CSBC network investigators. Center students and
postdoctoral fellows will participate in young investigator exchange programs and career enhancing education
workshops. To spark interest in the application of ecology and systems biology in oncology early in life we will
implement a variety of new internship programs ranging from high-school student research experiences to
college undergraduate and graduate student internships – all with a dedicated focus in integrating minority
researchers and patient perspectives. The Moffitt Outreach core introduces novel programs to present cancer
systems biology to the general public. CSBC public evening lectures as well as participation in and support of
the annual Festival of Science festival in the Tampa Bay area will introduce cancer systems biology research in
layman terms and offers opportunities for the patient community and general public to engage in a direct
dialogue with eminent researchers. Outreach and training lectures as well as developed course materials and
science projects will be made available and archived on our professionally designed Center-dedicated website."
10930176,"Summary – Mathematical Modeling Core
Understanding the changes in tumor ecology (“∆-Ecology”) that occur during tumor initiation, progression, and
therapy requires careful study of a complex dynamical system involving multiple scales – from molecular to
cellular to tissue to systemic. An important tool in this study is the use of mathematical models, which can
bridge temporal gaps in clinical and experimental data. Ecological histology data from patients is difficult and
rare to obtain, and experimental work, while crucial for teasing apart mechanism and testing hypotheses,
cannot fully reproduce the human setting of disease. Mathematical modeling serves as a link between these
approaches, allowing ecological principles arising from mechanisms studied in vitro and in vivo to play out in
the patient setting, calibrated to available patient data. The Mathematical Modeling Core will develop these
models, using a variety of approaches. Key is the use of spatial agent-based models, which can handle the
rich diversity of cell types and molecules, as well as the multiple scales involved in tumor ecology and
evolution. We have built a platform for developing these models that is fast and flexible, including numerous
add-ons that will serve the science in the two projects of this proposal. In addition, our expertise in non-spatial
models will be applied in parallel, as these approaches can capture the broad dynamics of tumor growth and
the response to treatment in ways that have significant translatable potential, as evidenced by ongoing trials in
Evolutionary Therapy at Moffitt. In addition to constructing these models, we will develop tools for initializing,
calibrating, and analyzing models based on clinical and pre-clinical data collected in each project. This will
involve the use of virtual “Phase i” trials, where virtual patients/mice are generated from a model, taking
parameter uncertainty into account. In summary, the Core models will provide insight into the ecological
processes that occur during tumor growth and treatment."
10913564,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal requests UH2/UH3 funding to build a collaborative research program to study Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) and AD related dementias (ADRD) in diverse populations through the UCLA Health System in Los Angeles
County. This program is led by a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in AD/ADRD clinical and neurobiological
(PI Vossel, Co-I Chang); social and environmental (PI Mayeda); sociocultural (Co-I Díaz-Santos, Adrissi); and
genomic (Co-I Chang, Deters) research. The program is based in the Mary S. Easton Center for Alzheimer’s
Research and Care (Director Vossel), which has robust ties with greater L.A. communities and ongoing
education and outreach activities. AD and ADRD comprise syndromes with a spectrum of environmental, social,
genomic, and clinical mechanisms. To improve our understanding of the heterogeneity of AD/ADRD, individuals
from all groups, including traditionally understudied groups, must be studied. The UCLA Health System serves
one of the largest Hispanic/Latinx (HL), Black, and Asian American/Pacific Islander (AAPI) populations in the
United States. Traditional AD/ADRD recruitment of these understudied populations has been challenging.
Leveraging electronic health records (EHR) tools to recruit understudied populations and analyzing routinely
collected EHR data would lower the barrier to entry. Our objective is to recruit HL, Black, and AAPI AD/ADRD
cohorts via EHR tools and partnerships with primary care clinics and communities. Next, we will evaluate
recruitment efficiency of EHR tools and partnerships, followed by augmentation of EHR with social determinants
of health (SDOH), genetic, blood biomarker, neuroimaging, and neurophysiology data to study mechanisms of
AD/ADRD in these understudied populations. Our long-term goal is to develop and scale an EHR-linked
AD/ADRD research infrastructure in L.A. County through UCLA Health’s network sites, allowing integration of
SDOH, neurobiological and genomic data. We will improve recruitment and retention of understudied ADRD
populations in research by enrolling 160 HL, 160 Black, and 100 AAPI AD/ADRD individuals and controls. In
preliminary work, our team has integrated dementia screening in the EHR to improve AD and ADRD diagnosis
in primary care and studied genomic, social, and environmental risk factors of AD and ADRD from the EHR.
During the UH2 phase we will 1) utilize EHR tools in HL, Black, and AAPI AD/ADRD participant recruitment, 2)
engage HL, Black, and AAPI community partners to improve study recruitment and design, and 3) share clinical,
social, and genomic data on NIA-supported infrastructures. During the UH3 phase we will 4) evaluate dementia
screening and EHR tools on AD and ADRD recruitment in HL, Black, and AAPI individuals, 5) identify AD
endophenotypes from social determinants of health, blood biomarker, neurophysiologic, and comorbidity factors
in HL, Black and AAPI individuals, and 6) predict AD among HL, Black, and AAPI individuals using polygenic
risk, SDOH, and comorbidities. This innovative program will support our goal is to discover personalized risk
factors that will yield early behavioral interventions and precise therapies."
10929512,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The older Asian American population has been rising, with the risk of Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s
Disease-Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) also increasing. However, most of the disparities in health outcomes
are masked because older Asian Americans are significantly underrepresented in clinical research. Social
determinants of health (SDOH) are an individual’s personal circumstances that influence their health and well-
being. SDOH contribute to wide health disparities and inequities. Research linking AD/ADRD to SDOH is
expanding rapidly, yet much evidence is still needed in older Asian Americans. Additionally, there are relatively
few studies incorporating health related risks, such as vascular conditions, and biomarkers to understand the
link between SDOH and AD/ADRD; it remains unclear if vascular risk factors and/or biomarkers mediate such a
relationship. Using validated cognitive tests in English/Chinese and culturally relevant measures of
sociodemographic factors, the study MPI (Li) successfully enrolled over 200 older Asian Americans in clinical
research at the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) at Mount Sinai. Here, the study team will grow to
include multidisciplinary members, proposing a 5-year study to develop a research infrastructure for studying
AD/ADRD in older Asian Americans. The SDOH assessment will be available in English, Mandarin, and
Cantonese – the most common spoken languages among Asian American older adults. This study will answer
the following questions: (1) Do Chinese translation and cultural adaptation of SDOH measures effectively recruit
new and existing older Asian Americans in AD/ADRD research? (2) Can we identify behavior, environmental,
social, genetic, and neurobiological factors associated with AD/ADRD? (3) How neurobiological processes
intersect with environmental, sociocultural, behavioral, and other demographic factors to affect AD/ADRD
outcomes? The study team will establish a scientific advisory board to provide scientific perspectives for the
proposed study, particularly in the areas of (1) Social science; (2) Clinical phenotypes of AD/ADRD; (3) Dementia
research in Asian Americans; and (4) Risk factors and biomarkers for AD/ADRD. The team will also collaborate
with key community stakeholders to ensure that the SDOH assessment is culturally and linguistically appropriate.
Recruitment goal is set to be 300 older Asian Americans to complete a comprehensive dementia evaluation that
includes SDOH measurement. Novel, theory based SDOH indices will be developed to characterize older Asian
Americans in the normal, MCI, and AD/ADRD groups. Of the 300 enrollees, the study team aims to re-evaluate
100 participants for a 1-year follow-up and collect 200 biomarker samples for molecular profiling, including whole
genome sequencing, RNA-sequencing and proteomics. An integrative network biology and machine learning
based approach will be employed to develop highly predictive diagnostic and prognostic molecular biomarkers
of AD/ADRD. The UH2 phase will be used to develop the research infrastructure and assessment tools
necessary to apply for a larger RO1 project at the end of the UH3 phase."
10930172,"Project 2 abstract
Project 2 will investigate the changes in neoplastic and stromal compartments during the acquisition of
resistance to ALK and KRAS targeting therapies, with specific emphasis on the therapy-sheltering impact of
the stromal niche, observed in multiple experimental models. Despite the growing appreciation of the potential
contribution of stromal on the sensitivity of tumor cells to targeted therapies, there are no established
conceptual frameworks and experimental pipelines to account for this effect on evolving resistance.
Confounding the challenge, acquired resistance cannot be understood just with before-after snapshot
analyses, as the sensitivity of tumor cells to therapies, stroma-tumor ratio, and stromal composition and effect
are dynamically changing over the course of treatment. To understand the Decology of acquired resistance we
will perform system-level characterization of temporal and spatial phenotypic changes within the tumor and
stromal compartments, including changes in proliferation/death and clonal dynamics. These changes will be
captured in the formalism of in silico models through careful integration of experimental and modeling tools.
The quality and utility of the models will be assessed by making experimentally testable predictions. Following
calibration, the models will be used to find novel strategies for combination therapies that optimize long-term
remission. Initial model development and calibration will be performed in a xenograft model of ALK+ NSCLC
that has been the focus of our recent interdisciplinary studies. Subsequently, we will use the pipelines to gain
an understanding of the eco-evolutionary dynamics of other xenograft and syngeneic models of ALK+ and
KRASG12C NSCLC. These studies will help develop the robust knowledge base required for the development
of novel and impactful translational strategies."
10929557,"Project Summary
The older Chinese American population has been rising for the last few decades, with the risk of Alzheimer’s
Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) also increasing. Despite the pressing need to
increase racial/ethnic diversity in clinical trial participation in the US, older Chinese Americans remain historically
underrepresented and understudied in AD/ADRD research due to a lack of culturally and linguistically
appropriate study materials and assessment tools. Using Chinese language translations of clinical measures
and cognitive tests, the study PI (Li) successfully enrolled over 200 older Chinese Americans in clinical research
at the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) at Mount Sinai. The sample, with over 80% non-demented
older adults, provides a window of opportunity for early intervention and treatment of AD/ADRD. Since a majority
of older Chinese Americans are foreign born with limited to no English proficiency, they are frequently excluded
from clinical trial participation as English language proficiency is one of the inclusionary criteria. The Memory
Support System (MSS) from the Healthy Action to Benefit Independence & Thinking® (HABIT) Program is a
promising non-pharmacological intervention for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Prior data suggest the
effectiveness of MSS on self-efficacy for memory, adapted functioning, quality of life, depression, and anxiety in
the participants and their study partners, with an excellent retention rate. However, the MSS was primarily
developed and used on non-Hispanic White, English-speaking adults. Additionally, little is known regarding the
effectiveness of MSS on cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with early AD/ADRD. Here, the
study team proposes a 2-year study to translate and adapt the MSS materials and assessment tools from English
into Mandarin and Cantonese - the most common spoken languages in the US after English and Spanish. This
study will leverage Dr. Li’s expertise in research recruitment and enrollment of Chinese American older adults to
answer the following questions: 1) Does Chinese language translation and cultural adaptation of MSS effectively
engage and recruit Chinese Americans in clinical trials for AD/ADRD? (2) Can Chinese Americans with MCI and
their study partners learn and use the MSS? (3) Is the MSS effective in mitigating early symptoms of AD/ADRD
in older Chinese Americans? The team will collaborate with key community stakeholders to ensure that the
materials and tests are culturally and linguistically appropriate for this population. Capitalizing on the older
Chinese American cohort at the ADRC at Mount Sinai, the overarching goal is to extend the MSS to older
Chinese Americans with MCI by developing a linguistically and culturally appropriate adaption. Using 30
Mandarin- and 30 Cantonese-speaking older adults with MCI and their study partners, the primary outcomes are
recruitment, retention, and completion rates to assess feasibility. The team will also examine the efficacy and
utility of MSS in this sample. Findings from this study will provide pilot data to support a large-scale clinical trial
with longer follow-up periods."
10925362,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Older adults with multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) are often hospitalized and are at risk for adverse events
(AE) during acute episodes of care. Fragmented care across different healthcare providers is common for
these patients and increases risk of AEs, especially in elderly patients with unrecognized geriatric conditions.
Patient safety research that attempts to address these risks are limited by available data and often lack of
access to electronic health records (EHR) from providers external to the health system conducting the
research. We propose leveraging emerging interoperability standards, and public policies that require their
adoption, to empower patients to locate, retrieve, and share their EHRs with our research team. We will partner
with two studies that will enroll older adults and aim to reduce AEs during acute care episodes. Both studies
have timelines suitable to consenting participants for this demonstration study. To accomplish our aims, we will
leverage and enhance our existing digital infrastructure (a web-based application and secure backend cloud
technology) that we have developed and implemented in past and ongoing work. Leadership of both partner
studies will play major roles in this work, ensuring strong coordination. In Aim 1, we will enhance our existing
digital infrastructure using two open-source projects. We will leverage infrastructure from the Sync-for-Science
(S4S) Procure project (used in the All Of Us Research Program) enabling patients to use HL7 FHIR Services
to find and share their EHRs with research teams. The MCC e-Care Plan project will supply clinical information
models and value sets, ensuring that data collected can be used for both research and clinical care. User
needs and requirements for identifying prior sites of care and sharing EHR data from those sites with the
research team will be elicited via a rigorous user-centered design process. In Aim 2, we will implement and
iteratively refine workflows defined in Aim 1 using mixed methods. In Aim 3 we will develop analytic methods
for harmonizing aggregated EHR data and metrics relevant to our partner studies. These metrics will reflect
care fragmentation based on EHR data aggregated using FHIR services, including unrecognized geriatric
syndromes identified by applying natural language processing to unstructured text in retrieved clinical notes. In
Aim 4, we will use these metrics as risk factors in a multivariable regression model to assess their effect on the
safety outcomes of our partner studies. This analysis will demonstrate how novel assessments of care
fragmentation and conditions common in geriatric populations contribute to AEs during acute care episodes.
Our expert advisors, consultants, and software developers will assist with all clinical and technology aspects of
this work. Our demonstration study will produce foundational knowledge regarding how to empower patients to
collect and share their data with research teams, best practices for collecting data in this manner, and the
value of using such data in studies of patient safety that are relevant to older adults. Finally, our contributions
to two open-source projects will be made available for broad adoption to benefit other studies."

The goal of this project is to develop new understanding and predictive models for the formation, reactivity, and
selectivity of organic radical and diradical intermediates. Triplet diradicals can undergo a variety of
transformations that are not accessible in the singlet ground state. However, developing efficient photocatalytic
triplet energy transfer processes, particularly in an enantioselective fashion, remains an enduring goal. We will
show that computational approaches can be leveraged to develop general principles for substrate and sensitizer
design to harness triplet-state reactivity. We will use computation to target the mechanism-guided discovery of
unexplored reactivity in the triplet state, such as homolytic aromatic substitution, and the design of chiral Lewis
acids to promote asymmetric photocatalytic cyclizations. We will also develop a qualitative and quantitative
understanding of the factors controlling the reaction rates and site selectivities of radical homolytic substitution,
such as hydrogen and halogen atom transfer reactions. These conceptual insights will be used to rationalize
experimental observations and underpin the development of new radical reagents for site-selective C(sp3)-H
chlorination. The development of quantitative models, aided by new physical-organic parameters, can be used
to accelerate this process. Machine learning models grounded in mechanistic understanding will provide new
tools to parametrize substrates and reagents to accelerate reaction discovery and optimization. We will employ
this strategy to predict the site-selectivity of P450 oxidation small molecules and to establish general workflows
to predict the metabolic degradation pathways."

The goal of this mentored career development award is to provide a robust course of training in the biology of
neurodegeneration and aging for Dr. Eteleeb, Ph.D., a candidate with extensive experience in genomics, omics,
and machine learning, to enable his transition to research independence. Washington University School of
Medicine is a nationally recognized leader in medical research and provides an outstanding environment for the
candidate’s training with world-renowned figures in the fields of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and aging. This
proposal will be conducted under the mentorship of an excellent interdisciplinary team of leaders with extensive
and complementary sets of expertise in AD, aging, neuroscience, genetics, and cross-omics who are dedicated
to support Dr. Eteleeb in completing his research and training goals proposed in this award. With the guidance
of this team, Dr. Eteleeb will pursue a rigorous training program to address gaps in his knowledge and allow him
to accomplish the aims of this K25 award. The training objectives will focus on Dr. Eteleeb’s transition into the
field of AD and aging and include 1) acquire a strong foundation in neurology, clinical, and neuropathology
aspects of AD and related dementias, 2) learn and employ novel ways to identify molecular subtypes of AD and
specific biomarkers associated with cognitive function, followed by validation techniques in humans and model
organisms, 3) gain in-depth understanding of the genetic and epigenetic factors affecting AD molecular
subtypes, and 4) develop leadership and professional skills for leading an independent lab focused on
transitional research in AD and aging. These objectives will be accomplished through courses, workshops,
seminars, journal clubs, conferences, and feedback from the advisory committee. The primary objective of the
proposed research is to identify and characterize molecular subtypes of AD associated with cognitive function
by employing an innovative approach that combines cross-omics and machine learning. AD is a heterogeneous
neurodegenerative disorder affecting over 50 million individuals worldwide. One critical and often overlooked
factor impeding development of effective treatment for AD is the clinical and molecular heterogeneity among AD
patients. Cross-omics approaches integrate heterogeneous molecular profiles to study not only how these
profiles change in AD, but also uncover relationships and correlations between biological molecules. The specific
proposed research aims are 1) identify and characterize cross-omics AD molecular subtypes associated with
cognitive function conserved across cohorts and brain regions, 2) Determine whether molecular subtypes are
specific to AD or present in other neurodegenerative disorders, and 3) identify CSF/blood-based biomarkers
from AD molecular subtypes. The results will reveal insights into AD subpopulations and identify AD molecular
subtypes, pathways, and biomarkers, which could lead to new pathways for implementing precision medicine
and developing novel therapeutics for AD. Successful completion of this award will facilitate future independent
funding to leverage cross-omics to deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of AD progression."

Dicer is a multi-domain ribonuclease III (RNase III) enzyme that produces small interfering
RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) from dsRNA precursors. RNA silencing mediated
by these small RNAs is an important defense system against viral infection. Loss of Dicer
causes loss of anti-viral immunity.
Previous study in C. elegans showed that cleavage of the C. elegans RNase Dicer by pro-
apoptotic caspase-3 produces a stable C-terminal fragment of Dicer that now functions as a
deoxyribonuclease (DNase) in the developmental apoptosis pathway. However, even more
than a decade after this study, whether the RNase-to-DNase conversion of Dicer by specific
proteolysis occurs in any other animals including human remains unknown. Whether Dicer
DNase has any role in anti-viral immunity also remains unknown.
When cells are infected by viruses despite their anti-viral system, many of them undergo
programmed cell death (PCD or apoptosis), which helps to abort the production and release of
progeny viruses from the cells. Growing evidence indicates that some proteins have both ‘day-
jobs’ in healthy cells and ‘death-jobs’ in cells undergoing PCD. Thus, evolution may have
linked day-jobs and death-jobs in the same molecule to ensure that cell death is appropriately
linked to and regulated by multiple normal cellular processes.
In this proposal, we hypothesize that human Dicer has day-jobs as an RNase in RNA silencing
pathway and death-jobs as a DNase in PCD pathway. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis
that cleavage of the human Dicer by pro-apoptotic caspase-3 produces a stable C-terminal
fragment of Dicer (Dcr-C) that functions as a DNase (DNA nickase) in the PCD pathway in
human cells. We will also test the hypothesis that the conversion of Dicer to Dcr-C and its DNA
nickase activity are crucial for anti-viral immunity. Our exciting preliminary studies showed that
Dcr-C exhibits DNA nickase activity in test tube and in cells, supporting our hypotheses. If
successful, the proposed studies employing biochemical and cellular approaches will form
foundations for future animal studies of Dicer RNase-to-DNase conversion in PCD and anti-viral
immunity in mammals. Understanding the physiological roles and molecular mechanisms of Dcr-
C DNA nickase will reveal new regulatory mechanisms in the PCD pathway and anti-viral system
including a novel link between RNA silencing and PCD via Dicer, both of which are crucial for
anti-viral defense."
10917329,"A major driver for immunogenicity is the presence of T-cell epitopes within a protein sequence that can activate
helper T cells, resulting in neutralization of the therapeutic effect. For DMD gene therapy, the possibility of T-cell
responses to pre-existing (from revertant fibers) &/or post-treatment dystrophin epitopes has recently emerged
as a serious treatment issue. In the past year 5 DMD patients treated with AAV-microdystrophin (µDys) have
developed T cell mediated immune responses against dystrophin. Based on immunological data, in all cases the
antigenic region was highly suggested to be encoded by exons 8-11.1 Additionally, to being observed in patients
deleted for this region (updates provided at MDA and ASGCT 2022 scientific conferences). A key component of
our approach takes advantage of the fact that a single amino acid can anchor a novel peptide for a preferred
binding state for antigen presenting cells’ via its major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and subsequent T cell
receptor (TCR). It is the TCR recognition which leads to downstream signaling cascades and immune sequelae.
Alternatively, conservatively modified residue(s), can disfavor antigen presentation, preventing dystrophin-
specific immunity. Thus, avoidance of a specific immune response can be achieved if key epitope anchor
residue(s) necessary for antigen presentation are modified to disrupt MHC recognition. Here, our proposal
addresses the fundamental role of immunogenicity against dystrophin that has been found in DMD patients. This
proposal integrates deimmunization protocols and structure-based protein redesign via Rosetta-software, with
streamlined functional testing via our magnetic tissue array (Mantarray) platform-allowing for daily 3D DMD
contractile performance assessment in-a-dish. In turn, dystrophin epitopes can be predicted & ranked according
to their antigenicity by correlating their amino acid sequence content with immunological databases. Known and
predicted epitopes will be targeted for redesign to reduce or eliminate putative MHC-binding peptides and
subsequent T cell activation. Our deimmunization approach will build on previous efforts while focusing on exons
8-11 of dystrophin, & integrating data as it becomes available through any DMD clinical trial alliance that unfolds.
The exon 8-11 region, now part of Pfizers’ updated patient exclusion criteria, encodes a portion of the actin-
binding domain, extending through spectrin-like repeat 1 (note: we have already deimmunized much of exons 6-
8). Importantly, restricting deimmunization efforts to exons 8-11 of dystrophin would be beneficial for all µDys
designs currently in clinical trials. In summary, we propose to deliver deimmunized µDys vectors to human DMD
3D engineered muscle tissues and measure contractile force(s) via our Mantarray system in an effort to screen
for highly functional leading candidates with reduced immunogenicity. To fully validate our 3D muscle system as
a predictive model we will test optimized candidates(s) via rAAV vectors driven by highly muscle specific
regulatory cassettes for their capacity to ameliorate disease progression in the DMDmdx rat model of DMD. These
results will provide necessary preclinical outcome metrics required to advance towards Phase 1 clinical trials."

We propose to contribute a Bay Area, population-based prospective cohort to a nationwide cohort study of
Asian American (AsA) men and women to address major gaps in evidence on the correlates and determinants
of disease risk and health. We will recruit, characterize, and follow Chinese, Filipino, and Vietnamese
Americans, three understudied AsA ethnic groups whose populations are rapidly expanding in the United
States. Specifically, we will recruit 2,100 Chinese, Filipino, and Vietnamese Americans (700 of each ethnic
group) in the San Francisco Bay Area to characterize cardiometabolic profiles and psychosocial and other
health factors through extensive surveys, clinical assessments and assays, imaging studies, multi-omics, and
digital technology. Although disease patterns and risk factors appear to vary among different AsA groups,
previous research suggests that AsAs are highly affected by cardiometabolic disorders such as diabetes,
hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, stroke, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and obesity, as
well as underdiagnosed mental health conditions and psychosocial issues related to immigration trauma,
discrimination, and marginalization. However, epidemiological data on individual AsA groups are sparse, and
most clinical guidelines and treatments are based on data derived from Caucasians. Our UG3/UH3 study site
will collaborate with the Coordinating Center (U24), other study sites, and NHLBI to develop a large cohort of
10,000 members to characterize risk factors and disease patterns in individual AsA ethnic groups. The specific
aims of the proposed study are to 1) contribute to the development of a Common Protocol for the study in
collaboration with NHLBI, U24, and other UG3/UH3 investigators and establish a state-of-the-art populomics
cohort; 2) measure the prevalence or distribution of baseline self-reported health and risk factors and clinical
markers in each ethnic group and compare across ethnic groups; and 3) determine relationships among
baseline risk factors in each AsA ethnic group, including self-reported stress and sleep as well as heart rate
variability-derived sleep quality and stress from wearable biosensing data, with subsequent (incident) health
outcomes during follow-up. This proposed study is innovative in its in-depth exposome phenotyping through
comprehensive surveys that will include assessments of well-being and anxiety in addition to traditional risk
factors, baseline clinical assessments, advanced digital technology, and integrative omics to understand the
intersections of epidemiology, biology, psychology, and technology in physical and mental health. We will
leverage these innovations alongside Stanford’s world-class resources in population health sciences to
uncover critical cardiometabolic and psychosocial factors underlying health and disease in AsAs. This study
will advance health and disease prevention and treatment and will lead to improved health and well-being
outcomes for AsAs.

10725607,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Each year, ~1 million Americans survive a critical illness only to suffer with new-onset frailty. This accelerated,
catastrophic, critical illness-associated form of frailty is an emerging, costly, and age-related public health
problem that is driven by the growing number of survivors of critical illness, the aging U.S. population, and the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Little is known about critical illness-associated frailty. The lack of systematic
knowledge of critical illness-associated frailty makes it difficult to propose and test potential interventions. We
propose to validate questionnaire-based frailty assessment methods needed to identify those with baseline
(i.e., pre-critical illness) frailty, leading directly to a new generation of interventions to manage and mitigate
critical illness-associated frailty, ultimately improving the long-term health for older adults surviving critical
illness. We hypothesize that questionnaire-based frailty assessments will demonstrate strong reliability and
validity as compared to performance-based methods. Upon completion of this study, we will have validated
questionnaire-based frailty assessments that can be used when performance-based frailty assessments are
not possible—an important next step in our work to understand and intervene upon critical illness-associated
frailty. Aim 1: Determine the validity and reliability of patient responses on questionnaire-based frailty
assessments with performance-based frailty assessments. Aim 2: Determine the validity and reliability of
surrogate responses on questionnaire-based frailty assessments with performance-based frailty assessments.
The study of critical illness-associated frailty is in its infancy; our project is therefore intrinsically innovative.
Additional innovation arises from our systematic and rigorous frailty measurements using performance-based
assessments and questionnaire responses from both patients and their carefully selected surrogates. This is
the first study to conduct systematic measurement of questionnaire-based frailty assessments in relation to
performance-based frailty assessments in those with critical illness. We will address key barriers needed to
guide our approach to intervention, giving this project broad significance. To date, pre-critical illness frailty has
been measured by judgement-based tools. Rigorous and objective measurements of frailty are needed to
understand etiologies, risk factors, and to guide interventions. Regardless of outcome, results will improve the
health of millions of older adult survivors of critical illness by identifying the extent to frailty is present at ICU
admission facilitating the study of trajectories, risk factors, and mechanisms of a common, costly, and
preventable condition—critical illness-associated frailty."
10837813,"Poxviruses are a large family of viruses including species that are highly pathogenic for humans and animals, including smallpox and monkeypox viruses. Some poxviruses are developed as vaccine vectors and oncolytic virotherapies to fight other infectious diseases and cancers. Vaccinia virus, the prototype poxvirus, has previously been annotated to encode over 200 open reading frames in its 200kbp genome. Our genome-wide analysis of vaccinia virus gene expression using RNA-sequencing uncovered that numerous unexpected mRNAs are transcribed. Furthermore, our previous study discovered a large number of (>500) novel translation initiation sites associated with previously unrecognized non-canonical open reading frames (ORFs) using ribosome profiling. Much remains unknown about the biological relevance of these non-canonical ORFs. The objective of this proposal is to characterize the peptides encoded by the non-canonical vaccinia virus ORFs and explore the biological relevance and functions. The central hypothesis is that peptides/proteins are produced from the non-canonical ORFs, which may play important roles in VACV replication. In Specific Aim 1, peptides/proteins encoded by vaccinia virus non-canonical ORFs will be identified. In Specific Aim 2, the roles of representative non-canonical ORFs in vaccinia virus replication will be determined. Completion of the project is expected to provide knowledge of the expression and functions of the non-canonical poxvirus ORFs that are previously unrecognized. It has profound implications in interpreting poxvirus genetic studies since the past studies have been focusing on previously annotated large ORFs. The outcomes may transform the understanding of poxvirus gene expression and break ground toward new directions in the field. Better understanding these newly identified ORFs may ultimately lead to novel intervening strategies and improving poxviruses as vaccine vectors and cancer therapeutics agents. Therefore, the outcomes are also expected to have a broad impact beyond the poxviruses, as the genomes of various organisms, including humans, also encoded many previously unrecognized ORFs."
10886809,"This grant will develop high-performance naturalistic optical functional imaging instrumentation, paradigms, and
computational tools for mapping typical and atypical brain development. An exemplar neurodevelopmental
disorder, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), affects 1/54 children in the general population. Because early
interventions in toddlers with ASD have been proven to result in improved outcomes, innovative methods for
early detection of the alterations in brain function underlying ASD prior to manifestation of behavioral symptoms
are necessary to advance treatment strategies and improve prognoses. Current brain mapping methods such
as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offer promising sensitivity to healthy development progression
and to atypical ASD brain development, yet pose significant methodological challenges in studies of awake,
interacting children due to the loud, claustrophobic environment and the requirement for children to stay still.
Further, many imaging paradigms developed for adults are not naturalistic and do not translate well to children
Optical neuroimaging, a promising potential surrogate to fMRI, can provide a much more naturalistic imaging
experience than MRI. While traditional functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) systems had poor image
quality due to sparse imaging arrays, newer high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT) systems have
improved image quality. However, the large opto-electronic consoles and bulky fiber optics typically used with
HD-DOT restrict head motion and require participants to remain stationary to avoid motion induced noise. This
grant will develop a unique lightweight HD-DOT system the size of a bike helmet that leverages silicon
photomultiplier (SiPM) detection to dramatically improve low light level performance.
Naturalistic imaging paradigms aim to recapitulate real-life conditions more closely than traditional reductive
protocols (e.g., flashing checkerboard patterns). Ideally, naturalistic paradigms use highly engaging multi-modal
content and are particularly well suited for populations (e.g., young children) unable to make overt behavioral
responses or perform a repetitive or predictable task. Naturalistic viewing paradigms employing movies or
television shows enable repeatability and control over stimulus presentation while preserving greater ecological
validity. While feasibility of rudimentary movie regressors have been shown with HD-DOT, the full complexity of
movie viewing analyses that has been developed with fMRI has not yet been translated to HD-DOT.
To complement movie viewing, we will also advance spontaneous brain activity mapping methods. Functional
connectivity analysis of the brain at rest has become a dominant approach to human brain mapping. However,
traditional FC analysis rests on bivariate correlation measures that are often susceptible to confounding
physiological processes. In contrast, a multi-variate FC (MFC) analysis, developed in this grant for HD-DOT, has
the potential to improve the spatial specificity, repeatability, and reliability of the network measures. The movie
mapping will complement MFC by providing task localizers, a common feature of modern FC Studies."

The overall goal of this project is to conduct a well-powered confirmatory efficacy trial comparing a gamified,
attention bias modification (ABM) mobile application and traditional ABM to sham ABM among adults with
elevated symptoms of depression. The proposed R01 efficacy trial follows the NIMH intervention development
sequence as it builds upon prior NIMH-funded experimental therapeutics work, specifically R21MH092430
“Attention training for Major Depressive Disorder” and R33MH109600 “Development of attention bias
modification for depression”. This prior work demonstrates that active ABM engages and alters negative
attention bias and there is a preliminary efficacy signal that ABM reduces depression. Although traditional ABM
is efficacious for the treatment of depression, “gamified” forms of ABM have the potential to be more accessible
and engaging than traditional ABM. Pilot work suggests that a gamified ABM can reduce negative affect;
however, its effectiveness for depression has not yet been established. Thus, we are proposing to conduct a
well-powered, confirmatory efficacy trial to determine ABM’s potential for the treatment of depression. In Aim 1,
we will examine the efficacy of ABM in a large sample of adults (N = 600) with elevated symptoms of
depression. We hypothesize that gamified and traditional ABM will lead to significantly greater reductions in
self-reported and interviewer-rated depression symptoms than sham ABM. We further hypothesize that
traditional ABM will be non-inferior to gamified ABM (we will also test for treatment superiority between the
ABM conditions). In Aim 2, we will examine putative moderators and mediators of ABM. Based on ABM
research with anxious populations, we predict that people with a strong initial attentional bias for sad stimuli will
experience greater reductions in depression in response to either gamified or traditional ABM than sham ABM.
In terms of mediation, compared to sham ABM, we hypothesize that gamified and traditional ABM will: (1)
decrease negative attentional bias measured behaviorally with reliable eye tracking methods; (2) significantly
reduce depression; and (3) improve depression symptoms via their influence on negative attentional bias.
Selection of the putative mediators is informed by our prior R33 ABM trial, where we found gaze bias away
from sad stimuli mediated the effect of traditional ABM on depression symptom change. In Aim 3, an
exploratory aim, we will estimate the durability of ABM by collecting post-treatment symptom data 1-, 2-, 3-,
and 6-months after ABM completion. Symptom change and reliable recovery across a six-month follow-up
period will be estimated. Currently, the durability of ABM effects for depression is unknown, as few
well-powered ABM studies for depression have obtained follow-up data. This trial would provide the most
definitive data to date regarding whether ABM for depression is a promising treatment for depression."

Glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive primary brain cancer, is amongst the most heterogeneous of cancers,
both intra- and inter-tumorally. GBMs are an admixture of neoplastic glioma cells and non-neoplastic / reactive
brain parenchyma that contribute to the overall imageable tumor mass. As such, cellular content, including both
cellular density and cellular composition, is critically important for understanding the status and evolution of a
given tumor. Although MRI provides excellent soft tissue contrast and can noninvasively characterize anatomy,
no methods exist to integrate a spatial and temporal understanding of the cellular components of the tumor
inferred from imaging in vivo.
It has become increasingly clear that precision oncology strategies rely on a quantitative and predictive
understanding of the state of the cancer complex system evolving within each patient. Recent findings from our
group have revealed two key opportunities we seek to leverage in our proposed Mathematical Oncology Systems
Analysis Imaging Center (MOSAIC). First, molecular analysis of a cohort of our image-localized biopsies of GBM
have inspired the concept of Glioma Tissue States as a composite classification of tissue samples. Our findings
from single nucleus RNAseq reveal that specific subpopulations and cellular phenotypes of neoplastic and non-
neoplastic cells show distinct patterns of co-habitation constraining potential cross-talk signaling. Second, we
have found mathematical modeling and machine learning analyses of clinical MRI features of GBM biopsies are
able to predict loco-regional features of GBM biology in vivo. These image-based models provide the promise to
track aspects of intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity previously unattainable during patient care.
Our overall center vision is to build a conceptual framework to understand tissue state-associated cellular
composition transitions that happen in glioma and the ways to interpret MRI relative to those changes for these
key cellular phenotypes. Specifically, in Project 1 we will explore strategies to target unfavorable (unresponsive)
tissue states to navigate transitions of the cancer complex system towards more favorable (responsive) tissue
states. In Project 2 we will leverage mathematical modeling and machine learning approaches to fuse MRI and
image-localized biopsy quantified tissue states to enable tracking tissue state changes in patient receiving

10891745,"Abstract
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by mutations of the X-linked DMD gene, with the majority of
mutations now occurring as de novo events due to the high mutation rate. The DMD gene is also one of the
largest in the human genome, with 79 exons covering 2.3Mb of Xp21. Carrier screening is problematic due to
high mutation rate and large gene size, and the incidence of DMD has not declined significantly over the last
decade, remaining at about 1/5,000 live born males. The disease is progressive, with onset of skeletal muscle
pathology (inflammation, degeneration/regeneration) present from birth, but clinical symptoms of proximal
muscle weakness typically not recognized until early school age (~4 to 6 years). DMD boys typically lose
ambulation in the second decade and succumb to respiratory or cardiac failure in 3rd decade unless ventilated.
Clinical trials in DMD have expanded dramatically over the last decade, and 5 drugs have been approved.
However, 4 of these approvals were based on accelerated approval with dystrophin expression in skeletal
muscle as the primary outcome (surrogate biomarker) and clinical efficacy has not yet been demonstrated.
Indeed, the approvals of exon skipping drugs have been highly controversial within FDA and clinical research
community. The only drug approved on clinical outcomes is deflazacort, with approval based on an academic
trial done decades earlier, and this approval was also controversial. Thus, there are no drugs approved based
on clinical outcomes in contemporary trials, with many more recent clinical trials using clinical outcomes
measures failing to show efficacy based on motor outcomes. A challenge with DMD clinical trials is the
progressive nature of the disease with appropriate motor outcomes changing as function of patient age, and
the lack of blood biomarkers able to monitor drug effect on muscle inflammation or fibrosis, and/or predict later
changes in motor outcomes. In this application for clinical trial readiness in DMD, we propose the study of two
serum biomarkers of inflammation, MDC and CD23, that we have previously shown to be responsive to
corticosteroid anti-inflammatory treatment in 4 disease states (pediatric DMD, pediatric inflammatory bowel
disease, juvenile dermatomyositis, and adult vasculitis). These biomarkers were also shown to be dose-
responsive to vamorolone, a novel dissociative steroidal drug under development in DMD, within 2-weeks of
treatment, and aided in dose-selection for the recently completed confirmatory, pivotal trial (VBP15-004) in 121
DMD boys. The proposed aims are to determine the extent to which drug-related reductions in MDC and/or
CD23 at 3 months treatment anticipate clinical improvement of motor outcomes at 6 months and 12 months
treatment. The double-blind VBP15-004 trial randomized DMD boys into 4 arms (placebo, vamorolone 2.0
mg/kg/day, vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day, prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day), and included a cross-over of placebo and
prednisone to vamorolone at study midpoint. The VBP15-004 demonstrated efficacy of both 2.0 and 6.0
mg/kg/day vamorolone groups vs. placebo (met primary and 4 sequential secondary outcomes) and showed
improved safety vs. prednisone (no stunting of growth, no deleterious changes in bone biomarkers). The
anticipated result is that MDC and/or CD23 predict later motor outcomes and can then be routinely integrated
into DMD clinical trial designs to monitor systemic and/or muscle inflammatory state."
10912035,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Adults aged 65 and older represent ~23 million (18%) annual Emergency Department (ED) visits. Delirium,
an acute, fluctuating change in cognition with numerous modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors, is prevalent
in up to 35% of older adults in the ED. However, the incidence and time course of ED delirium is currently
unknown. Prevention is the only effective treatment, yet only 40% of delirium cases in hospitalized older adults
can be prevented, making prediction and early recognition of patients at-risk of incident delirium – such as in the
ED – vital. Unfortunately, ED providers fail to recognize up to 83% of delirium cases, which can lead to significant
downstream consequences, such as ED revisits, falls, and hospitalizations. Thus, there is a critical need to
identify older adults at highest-risk of delirium in the ED to facilitate early interventions.
 The overall objective of this proposal is to establish the incidence, time course, and risk factors of delirium
during the ED stay, which is a critical prerequisite for implementing effective delirium prevention and
management interventions. We will achieve this objective with the following three aims: (1) Determine the
incidence and time course of ED delirium with validated detection tools, (2) Identify modifiable and nonmodifiable
risk factors of incident ED delirium, and (3) Examine existing risk stratification screening instruments for incident
ED delirium. We propose a prospective cohort study of older adults ≥65yo in a Level 1 accredited Geriatric ED.
We will collect delirium and other cognitive impairment screenings on all patients ≥65yo at ED admission to
establish baseline cognitive status. During the ED stay, patients will be screened for delirium at regular intervals
to determine the incidence and time course of ED delirium. For admitted patients, delirium will continue to be
assessed once per nursing shift during inpatient hospitalization. Using electronic health record data, we will
examine modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors for delirium in the ED and within 24- and 48- hrs of admission.
Further, we will assess if recommended geriatric risk stratification instruments can predict incident ED delirium.
 Consistent with the goals of the “National Institute on Aging: Strategic Directions for Research, 2020-2025”,
findings from this proposal will improve our understanding of the aging brain and its impact on the prevention,
progression, and prognosis of ED delirium. Specifically, this work will have a positive impact on Geriatric ED care
by identifying a subset of older adults at-risk for delirium. We will also establish the rate and risk factors for
incident ED delirium, which will be the first steps in preventive strategies. During the award period, the candidate

geriatrics clinician-investigators. This study will serve as the basis for a K-award application by providing the
groundwork and infrastructure for evaluating future delirium prevention and management strategies."

The autonomic nervous system is activated during the fight-or-flight response and functions to restore
homeostasis. Autonomic activity can alter the function of every major organ system and regulates every
significant physiological variable including blood pressure, body temperature, respiration rate and blood
glucose levels. Dysregulation of autonomic function can have widespread consequences and is causally
involved in the etiology of type I diabetes, hypertension, cancer and many dysautonomias. Thus
understanding the control of autonomic output has implications for treating many common disease states.
Most studies emphasize the role of the CNS and descending activity in determining autonomic function.
However, recent work has shown that the autonomic and immune systems are functionally closely
connected with bidirectional signaling pathways that regulate the output of both systems. One aspect of
this interaction that is not well understood is the time scale over which this crosstalk can take place.
The objective of the proposed study is to test the hypothesis that the release of the hormone epinephrine
from sympathetic neurons (chromaffin cells) in the adrenal gland is regulated by a signaling pathway that
involves a population of innate immune cells in the adrenal medulla. This idea is unconventional because
epinephrine release is thought to be exclusively controlled by the strength of the neuronal preganglionic →
chromaffin cell synapse.
To test this idea we have two specific aims that we will address in mice using electrophysiological and
chemogenetic approaches. In the first set of experiments we will test the hypothesis that changing the
activity of adrenal macrophages is sufficient to rapidly change the strength of the preganglionic →
chromaffin cell synapse by acting at a presynaptic locus. Our second specific aim is to test the hypothesis
that adrenal macrophages are involved in regulating the ability of the chromaffin cells to secrete
epinephrine. Because reliable epinephrine secretion requires an increase in the adrenal expression of
tyrosine hydroxylase, we will also determine whether the chemogenetic stimulation of macrophages is
sufficient to elevate the levels of this enzyme. Finally, we will test whether macrophages are involved in
the fight-or-flight response in vivo and control the release of epinephrine into the systemic circulation.
The current treatments for many forms of autonomic dysfunction are limited. If adrenal macrophages play
a role in regulating sympatho-adrenal activity this would substantially widen the number of cellular and
molecular targets that could be exploited to treat these clinically significant disorders."

KAND (KIF1A-associated neurological disorder) is caused by mutations in the KIF1A gene - a microtubule-
dependent motor protein that is responsible to transport cellular cargos in neurons. The majority of mutations
are dominant missense mutations that cluster in the conserved motor domain of the protein and lead to a
spectrum of neurological phenotypes beginning in childhood, including muscle weakness, microcephaly,
peripheral neuropathy, intellectual disability, autism, optic nerve and cerebellar atrophy. Without treatment,
children and adults affected by KAND suffer from the progressive loss of their mobility, vision and even early
death due to intractable epilepsy and complications of respiratory illness. Mouse models are a critical component
to both understanding disease mechanisms and to serve as a key platform for preclinical testing of novel
therapeutics. Unfortunately, mouse models to advance our understanding of KAND biology and therapeutics are
severely lacking, although very much in reach.
This proposal aims to build on our current knowledge of KAND to design mouse models that will not only provide
patient avatars for KAND disease pathophysiology but will also serve to address important questions around the
timing of therapeutic rescue, effects of overexpression, what cell types are required for effective treatment and
how much genetic correction is required for disease modulation. Importantly, the models will be valuable for pre-
clinical testing of therapeutics. The work described in this proposal leverages recently published Natural History
Studies by our clinical collaborator, Dr. Wendy Chung, which provides ongoing insight into the clinical features,
prevalence and biomarkers associated with this patient community. Our overall goals are to provide the scientific
community with well designed, rigorously tested mouse models that recapitulate key aspects of KAND disease
manifestations to be used, without restriction, throughout academia and industry for research and therapeutic
discovery."
10881781,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
SCCOHT is rare and often fatal ovarian cancer, with the average age of diagnosis being around 24 years
old. The molecular pathogenesis of SCCOHT is overwhelmingly linked to mutations in the SMARCA4 gene,
which encodes the BRG1 subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Numerous studies have
shown that loss of BRG1 impacts normal SWI/SNF function in several ways, which together most likely
conspire to drive the SCCOHT phenotype. SCCOHT cancers fall into a group of about 20% of all cancers
that have loss-of-function SWI/SNF subunit mutations. Across these cancers mechanisms are emerging
that can explain the maintenance of the cancer state following loss of particular SWI/SNF subunits. One
common finding is that in many SWI/SNF-altered cancers “residual” SWI/SNF complexes are retained that
function to promote a pro-tumorigenic gene expression program. A second and more new finding that is
emerging is that some underlying mechanisms of tumorigenesis may involve interactions between SWI/SNF
and oncoprotein transcription factors, such as MYC. Recently, activation of oncogenic MYC target gene
expression was reported in SCCOHT, a phenomenon that may be due to interactions between MYC and
SWI/SNF subunits. This project is built on the hypothesis that loss of critical SWI/SNF subunits can 1) allow
residual SWI/SNF complexes to alter gene expression patterns that overall promote cancer processes and
2) activate the functionality of MYC and may do so through changes in MYC-SWI/SNF interactions. Support
for this hypothesis comes from published data showing that in multiple SWI/SNF-altered cancer cell lines,
including SCCOHT, core residual SWI/SNF subunits are bound to chromatin at essential MYC target genes.
In addition, blocking residual SWI/SNF complex function in certain SWI/SNF-altered cancer cells decreases
expression of genes bound by MYC, suggesting that residual SWI/SNF complexes can facilitate MYC-target
gene expression. Together these data provide the rationale for examining the role of residual SWI/SNF
subunits and MYC in supporting oncogenic gene expression programs in SCCOHT, and point to the
possibility there there are broad, significant mechanisms at work across various SWI/SNF-altered cancers.
Specific Aim 1 will use genomic and genetic approaches to assess what residual SWI/SNF subunits are
doing in SCCOHT cells and how they influence pro-tumorigenic gene expression. Specific Aim 2 will define
the action of MYC in SCCOHT cells and expose the impact that both residual SWI/SNF subunits and BRG1
reintroduction has on MYC activities. At the completion of these studies we will know the gene networks
regulated by MYC and residual SWI/SNF subunits in SCCOHT cells and directly challenged the significance
of each in driving multiple facets of SCCOHT function."
10888380,"TITLE: The role of lipids in obesity-mediated protection in sepsis
ABSTRACT
Sepsis is an important clinical problem for which no specific therapies are currently available. Clinical studies
indicate that obesity is paradoxically associated with improved survival in sepsis; however, as obesity is a risk
factor for a wide variety of pathologies, it cannot be recommended as an option to protect against sepsis. It is,
therefore, important to understand the underlying mechanisms that lead to obesity-mediated protection in sepsis
as a step towards the development of novel therapeutic approaches. In this study, we will utilize existing clinical
data and biospecimens derived from sepsis patients to explore a connection between metabolic adaptation and
obesity-mediated protection in sepsis. In Specific Aim 1, we will evaluate the association between obesity status
and plasma lipid levels during sepsis using existing clinical data and plasma samples from the ARDSNet-SAILS
clinical trial. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine whether plasma lipid levels influence sepsis outcomes by first
correlating plasma lipid levels with major sepsis outcomes such as mortality, length of hospital stay, organ
dysfunction, and related biological/physiological variables. Additionally, we will investigate whether the protective
effect of obesity in improving sepsis survival is abolished with the lipid-lowering drug rosuvastatin. The long-term
goal of this work is to identify parameters related to obesity-mediated protection in sepsis, which can be further
mechanistically investigated and lead to the development of potential therapeutic interventions for sepsis."

BACKGROUND: There are currently more than 4 million breast cancer survivors in the U.S., and an additional
287,000 will be diagnosed in 2022. Although the growing number of breast cancer survivors reflect advances in
detection and treatment, the transition to post-treatment survivorship remains challenging. Patients are left with
sequelae due to their cancer diagnosis and treatment resulting in impairments in quality of life (QOL) and an
ongoing burden from cancer. Few safe and effective approaches currently exist to address this gap in care. We
have developed and piloted integrative medicine interventions for cancer survivors including a personalized
and patient-centered Mind and Body intervention based on Ayurvedic Medicine, which includes nutrition and
lifestyle approaches, and an engaging and comprehensive health education intervention based on national
survivorship guidelines. The two interventions are matched to each other for time and attention. Our prior
research, conducted at a single site, has demonstrated that these two interventions are feasible and
acceptable for cancer survivors and that randomization, retention, and adherence to these interventions was
feasible. In these prior studies, we found that the Ayurvedic intervention showed promise of clinical benefit with
patients showing moderate to large improvements in global health, sleep, fatigue, and mood. METHODS:
Given the results of our research to date, we propose in this application to conduct key next steps in multi-site
(sites at UCSF, Kaiser Permanente Northwest, and Vanderbilt University) intervention optimization, and
feasibility and acceptability testing. This proposal will conduct two interlinked steps in a population of breast
cancer patients, with the following specific aims: (1) To adapt and optimize the Ayurveda and Health Education
interventions (1a) for implementation in a multi-site setting and (1b) improving recruitment and retention of
underrepresented patients. (2) To determine the feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity of the integrative medicine
survivorship interventions and study design in a multi-site setting. In Aim 2, we will conduct a three-arm pilot
randomized controlled trial in which breast cancer survivors will be randomized (N=35 per arm) to one of the
integrative medicine interventions along with usual care or usual care alone. This R01 study will help us to
determine acceptability and feasibility of randomization, retention, adherence, and fidelity across the multi-site
setting. SIGNIFICANCE: In the long-term, if this approach is shown to be effective, it has the potential to shift
the paradigm in favor of emphasizing the importance of addressing symptoms, quality of life and wellbeing; the
development of non-toxic and natural approaches for health; and a more patient-centered focus in healthcare."

Visual stimuli drive activity across a range of brain areas, including primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual
areas (HVAs). These HVAs vary in their downstream connectivity to support a range of visually guided behaviors.
Similarly, these HVAs can vary in how they represent visual stimuli. Our recent results have revealed how a
subset of HVAs in the mouse can vary in representations of motion and texture. However, we do not yet have
a complete picture of how HVAs vary in their representations of visual stimuli during visually guided behavior.
Moreover, it remains unclear how neural circuitry can support HVA-speciﬁc representations of components of
visual stimuli. In this project, we will provide a deﬁnitive account of how components of complex visual stimuli
are represented across cortical areas in behaving mice. Moreover, we will use novel measurements of statistical
dependencies of neuronal activity across cortical areas to infer principles of population activity coding and circuit
organization. This work will take advantage of several technologies our lab has helped to develop: large ﬁeld-
of-view two-photon calcium imaging, open-world naturalistic virtual reality for mice, and advanced analysis tools
based on both classic approaches and modern statistical analysis. The results from this work will reveal insights
into how HVAs parse complex visual stimuli into representations that can guide adaptive behavior."

Among those with AUD, cannabis is the most commonly used psychoactive substance. Although initial
evidence suggests an overall detrimental impact of cannabis use (CU) on longitudinal AUD treatment
outcomes, there is significant divergence about how CU impacts alcohol consumption and craving. Competing
theories about the association between CU and alcohol focus on whether CU acts as a substitute (i.e.,
replacing the effects of alcohol, resulting in decreased craving, use, and harms) or complement (i.e.,
enhancing the effects of alcohol, resulting in increased craving, use, and harms). Preliminary work in non-
treatment engaged samples suggests important mechanisms (e.g., craving) and moderators (e.g., frequency of
CU, history of simultaneous use, trait impulsivity) may elucidate these competing theories. An important gap in
the literature is in the examination of prospective and momentary effects of naturalistic CU on alcohol craving
and consumption among individuals in alcohol treatment. The proposed study aims to address this gap using
an intensive longitudinal design to comprehensively examine within- and between-person patterns of CU on
alcohol outcomes over the critical first year after treatment initiation. Key outcomes among those early in
treatment are alcohol craving and risky alcohol consumption patterns (rate of consumption and volume
consumed). Use of alcohol biosensors allow for the objective measurement of these alcohol consumption
patterns as they naturally occur. The proposed project will be the most comprehensive examination to date of
the impact of CU on alcohol treatment outcomes and the first to examine these associations in the natural
environment using the BACtrack Skyn to passively mesure transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC). Alcohol
craving will be measured as an important outcome of CU in the moment, as well as a mechanism by which CU
leads to alcohol consumption. A longitudinal ecological momentary assessment (EMA) burst design (four 10-
day bursts at baseline, 1, 2, and 3 months) will be used to isolate the momentary impact of CU on alcohol
craving and consumption (measured via TAC) in a stratified sample of recent cannabis users. Following this
EMA phase, participants will engage in 6, 9, and 12 month follow-ups to fully capture CU and alcohol
patterns/AUD remission over the first year after treatment initiation. This research will directly inform: a) clinical
decision-making about the risks of CU during alcohol treatment, b) future intervention development for AUD,
and c) policy in the wake of expanding cannabis legalization; and is well-aligned with the objectives of the
Collaborative Research on Addiction at NIH."

Obesity is a risk factor for the development of insulin resistance (IR), a hallmark of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Weight
loss improves obesity-evoked IR; however, the majority of individuals who lose weight, regain the weight within
1-5 years. This ‘weight cycling’ further increases risk of metabolic disease compared to weight maintenance. Our
group developed a mouse model of weight cycling to uncover mechanisms by which weight regain poses
additional risk of metabolic disease. We show that weight cycled diet-induced obese (WC-DIO) animals have
worsened glucose tolerance than equally obese mice that have not weight cycled. A unique finding is that glucose
intolerance in WC-DIO mice is linked to impaired insulin secretion (in vivo during a hyperglycemic clamp and ex
vivo in perifused islets). This key finding indicates that β-cell compensation fails to completely adapt to the
physiological IR evoked by weight regain in the same way it does during the first bout of weight gain. At the
cellular level, WC-DIO mice manifest with atypical β-cell mitochondrial morphology and decreases in gene
signatures linked with mitophagy, redox metabolism, and TCA cycle regulation. Mitochondrial metabolism is
fundamental for normal nutrient stimulated insulin secretion. Thus, the mitochondrial alterations evoked by
weight cycling support a mechanism for impaired insulin secretion. Poor functioning mitochondria are also linked
with disruptions to redox control, which can increase oxidative stress and impair β-cell function. We find that a
major regulator of pro-oxidant status in β-cells, thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), is increased in WC-DIO
islets and inversely associates with insulin secretion. Together, these preliminary studies support that in
response to repeated nutrient overload, β-cells are less efficient at coupling metabolic processes to insulin
secretion. The central hypothesis is that repeated nutrient overload decreases mitochondrial function and evokes
oxidative impairment in β-cells. This loss of β-cell adaptation to nutrient overload impairs insulin secretion and in
vivo glucose regulation. This proposal will: i) determine whether impaired mitochondrial function evoked by
repeated nutrient excess is central to loss of pancreatic function and ii) examine whether TXNIP is responsible
for driving oxidative stress and loss of pancreatic function with weight cycling. Stable isotopes will be used to
measure metabolic flux rates in isolated islets. 13C-labeled metabolites will be administered in vivo and
incorporation in β-cells quantified using imaging mass spectrometry. Pharmacological inhibition and β-cell
specific deletion of TXNIP will be used to determine whether attenuation of oxidative stress restores insulin
production and secretion. In vivo insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity will be determined using the frequently-
sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test coupled with glucose tracers to quantify glucose fluxes. Ex vivo islet
function will be determined in static culture and in perifusion assays. The experiments proposed herein will define
the means by which weight cycling uncouples peripheral IR from pancreatic insulin demand, which will lead to a
better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of pancreatic adaptability to excess nutrients."

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) is a hallmark in patients with chronic HBV infection (CHB).
Given its close association with clinical outcomes in CHB patients, HBsAg seroclearance is required in
achieving an HBV functional or complete cure. Toward this direction, a major barrier is relevant to its biological
sources. Besides a nuclear reservoir of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), HBsAg could also be
produced from cellular integration. Currently, the contribution of HBV integration to HBsAg remains elusive
due to the lack of a method for quantitative measurement. Transcription from integrated HBV DNA has several
characteristics, such as the retention of human sequences, an early termination, and the interruption of HBV
Core antigen. These features have been used to infer the relative abundance of integration-derived HBsAg
transcripts by qRT-PCR, digital droplet PCR (ddPCR), and next-generation sequencing (NGS). However,
these approaches require liver tissue and have limited use with blood samples from which ~50% of HBeAg-
negative patients have total HBV RNA below the lower limit of quantification of qRT-PCR. Bait-based target
enrichment in NGS could enhance the sensitivity but extensive microhomology between HBV and human
genomes lowers the efficiency. To address these issues, we have developed a novel method through multiple
technical advances from our lab, including template-dependent multiple displacement amplification (tdMDA)
(BioTechniques 2017), a novel target enrichment strategy via 7‑deaza‑dGTP‑resistant enzymatic digestion
(TEED) (BMC Res Notes 2020, patented), and a read simulation to evaluate relative abundance among
reference genomes (J Virol Methods 2022). The combination of tdMDA, TEED, and the read simulation,
termed MATESim, was applied to five CHB patient serum samples. Integration-derived transcripts accounted
for variable portions of total HBsAg transcripts, ranging from 1.8% to 94.3%. These results support the
hypothesis that MATESim would be a noninvasive method to quantitate HBsAg from integration at the level of
transcription. This hypothesis will be evaluated using patient specimens from the Hepatitis B Research
Network (HBRN). First, we will validate MATESim by studying paired serum/liver samples. HBsAg transcripts
from cccDNA and integrated HBV DNA may have different mechanisms for release to circulation. It is
unknown whether their relative abundance determined by MATESim in circulation is a recapitulation, an
underestimation, or an overestimation of liver data. This knowledge will help to interpret data from circulation
by MATESim. Second, we will study serum samples from 59 patients with defined HBV phenotypes in the
HBRN cohort. The experiment will allow us to gain insights into the magnitude and between-patient variance
of integration-derived HBsAg in this patient cohort at a 95% confidence interval. Taken together, as a non-
invasive method to quantitate integration-derived HBsAg, MATESim would be a turning point in translational
research, clinical trials, and patient management for the globally 257 million people infected with HBV."

Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a leading in-vivo imaging methodology for investigating subtle microstructural changes
in the brain’s white matter, which often requires multi-site collaborations for data collection. Decentralized
processing approaches are becoming the preferred approach for multi-site data collection because they support
improved personal data protection and are scalable. Using a decentralized approach, The Enhancing Neuro
Imaging Genetics through Meta Analysis (ENIGMA) studies produced seminal findings across different
disorders. However, the dMRI pipeline established for decentralized ENIGMA dMRI studies is not automatic, not
user friendly, and requires each site to have strong programming and dMRI expertise, which is not the case in
many clinical sites. The goal of this project is to help alleviate the site-level technical burdens, which would
promote decentralized studies by enabling the addition of more sites.
Decentralized multi-site studies are needed for rigorous and statistically robust identification of subtle
neurological changes, but the technical difficulties which make decentralized dMRI analysis highly resource-
intensive, are impeding research sites from participating. The technical difficulties include the installation of
multiple software tools and their software dependencies, analysis instructions that include multiple scripting steps
that are hard to follow for novice users, and quality control (QC) steps that require expertise in dMRI.
The central goal of this application is to develop a user-friendly dMRI analysis platform for decentralized studies
which will facilitate the processing and QC by pursuing two specific aims: 1) develop an automated dMRI
processing pipeline with extensive data QC steps; and 2) provide dashboard function and containerize the
pipeline. Under the first aim, various neuroimaging and image processing utilities will be linked together to
automatize the dMRI processing pipeline while estimating extensive QC measures, which will be curated for
non-dMRI experts to help intuitively understand the data quality. For the second aim, a web-server will be
developed to provide a dashboard that is used to interact with the pipeline and visualize the outputs. Also, all the
components will be containerized as a single package for easier dissemination and deployment using docker.
The innovative approaches proposed in this application will simplify the dMRI analysis, enable optimal user
experience requiring minimal manual user-interventions in the installation and operation of the containerized
pipeline, and will facilitate a dashboard for intuitive user interaction. Our new and substantively different approach
is significant because it is expected to resolve much of the technical burden impeding the collaborative
investigation of brain changes in a decentralized approach, encouraging more sites to participate in multi-site
dMRI studies."

Minimally invasive transcatheter embolization is a common nonsurgical procedure in interventional radiology
used for the deliberate occlusion of blood vessels for the treatment of diseased or injured vasculature. One of
the most commonly used embolic agents for clinical practice are microspheres. They come with different
materials (i.e., PVA and trisacryl gelatin) in a variety of sizes (50 - 1200 µm), which can be strategically selected
to treat various conditions ranging from arteriovenous malformations to hypervascular tumors, Accurate particle
size is crucial for localized targeted embolization since the delivery of microspheres is driven by blood flow and
their movement and accumulation in vivo is size-dependent. Limitations of marketed microspheres include
danger of being washed away, no intrinsic radiopacity for visualization on X-ray, and lack of therapeutics. Despite
the similar morphologies microspherical embolic agents, their physical and mechanical properties vary due to
differences in their chemical composition and manufacturing processes, which in turn influence microsphere and
tissue interactions and clinical outcomes. No systemic platform has been developed to investigate the correlation
between these properties and embolic outcomes. More importantly, clinicians have no technology for estimating
the trajectory of emboli and as such significant uncertainty exists in embolization treatment. Microsphere
transportation to undesired vessels will cause off-target embolization and damage to healthy tissue. The precise
prediction of particle-flow behavior and the particle-vessel distribution is difficult even for experienced physicians
because this is essentially a fluid-driven transport problem that has not been systemically investigated and
validated. In this proposal, we will develop, for the first time, a two-way interactive biomaterial-computational
platform that will 1) offer rational design of multifunctional microspheres, 2) accurately guide the transcatheter
location for microsphere deployment, and 3) predict microsphere in vivo trajectory and their aggregation in the
vasculature to maximize embolic success for personalized therapies. In Aim 1, we will develop microspheres
with controllable sizes and tunable properties for effective embolization. In Aim 2, we will develop computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) models integrated with biomaterial design to maximize emboli transport to desired
locations. Lastly in Aim 3, we will demonstrate predictive capability using in-vitro vasculature and adaptive
framework using patient specific physical models. Successful completion of this study shows that the versatile
biomaterial-computational platform can maximize the delivery of embolic microspheres under random injection
of emboli within the luminal cross-section (current practice) or complete delivery under informed injection with
tracking the catheter. This pilot study will set the stage for further guided in vivo testing in large animal studies
using clinically relevant models (porcine liver models). We envision that this innovative technology can be applied
to liquid embolic agents, and also be widely disseminated to the treatment of diverse vascular conditions, such
as prostate hyperplasia, liver tumor, and fibroids, for translation to patient-specific therapy."

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinical cardiac arrhythmia, with a strong component of heritability.
Patients with AF are at significant risk for debilitating complications, such as stroke, heart failure and sudden
death. Emerging evidence suggests that both common and rare genetic variants in cardiac transcription factors
contribute to AF susceptibility. This link between transcription factors and AF offers exciting opportunities to
investigate previously unrecognized pathways to identify novel “upstream” therapeutic targets. We recently
identified the cardiac transcription factor NFATC1 as a novel AF susceptibility gene in a family with autosomal
dominant young-onset AF. The overall goal of this proposal is to explore the molecular and electrophysiological
role of NFATC1 in cardiac excitability. Our central hypothesis is that NFATC1 directly regulates genes involved
in maintaining calcium homeostasis in the atrium. We proposed three specific aims to test this hypothesis: (1)
identify NFATC1 transcriptional effectors linked to calcium homeostasis in atria; (2) establish the
electrophysiological consequences of NFATC1 disruption in atrial cells; and (3) define NFATC1 modulation of
adrenergic signaling in the heart. The output of this project will be a comprehensive understanding of the
transcriptional networks mediated by NFATC1 that impact calcium homeostasis and promote arrhythmogenesis,
laying the foundation for potential future therapies.
The research activities proposed in this career mentored award will provide experiential learning in support of
my career development objectives. These include (1) expanding my skills into genomics research, optical
mapping and new animal models that are more suitable for the study of arrhythmias, (2) strengthen my research
leadership and management skills, and (3) enhance my grantsmanship to secure independent funding.
Achieving these goals will allow me to develop a research career as an independent principal investigator of a
multidisciplinary cardiovascular research lab that makes substantial contributions to understanding the
development of heart disease."

program with an additional 3 cohorts. The aims will be completed through the use of four training modules. In
Module I, students will complete self-assessments and be assigned to a small peer-mentoring team of 5
students. Module II will consist of a 5-day workshop that encompasses instruction on the transferrable skills.
Module III will be composed of monthly interactive discussions over a 6-month period involving case study

each small group to provide career information, advice, and support. Further mentoring will be included
through the use of peer mentoring to provide a continual sustained support system to overcome current and
future challenges. To influence a wide range of students, outreach activities will focus on institutions with large
populations of students underrepresented in biomedical science. Combined, these activities will allow
participants to train, practice, and refresh their skills, empowering them to navigate career transitions and
obtain success in the career of their choice."

The overall goal of this research program is to determine how the Quaking-5 isoform (QKI5) of the QKI family of
RNA binding proteins regulates gene expression. To achieve this goal, we will determine how QKI5 is regulated,
how it executes regulatory functions, and what the consequences of these activities are on the overall gene
expression program. Pursuing this goal is the primary mission of my laboratory, and will be an engaging topic
upon which I will develop my lab and train post-docs and graduate students. QKI is a conserved regulator of
development and tissue-specific gene expression, yet the molecular mechanisms through which its functions are
executed remain understudied, particularly for the QKI5 isoform. Its importance is underscored by multiple
observations implicating dysregulated QKI function in heart disease, cancer, schizophrenia, and other serious
conditions, and our recent discovery that it regulates lineage-specific gene expression. Therefore, this RBP may
represent a therapeutic vulnerability for rational, RNA-based drug design, and inform us as to how the earliest
cell fate decisions are made. Despite this possibility, there are significant gaps in understanding that must be
filled prior to this becoming a reality. This requires us to illuminate the precise molecular mechanisms through
which individual target RNAs and the entire transcriptome are regulated. Hence, a major knowledge gap exists
in understanding the fundamental mechanisms used by QKI5 to execute its pre-mRNA splicing, transcript
localization, and stability/decay functions in RNA processing. This research program will leverage our molecular
genetics, biochemical, and genomics expertise to address key gaps in knowledge pertaining to this topic: 1) how
upstream regulation of QKI5 impacts its ability to regulate pre-mRNA splicing, and 2) how QKI5 directly and
indirectly regulates RNA splicing. Addressing these key gaps will tackle the upstream, intermediate, and
downstream impacts on, of, and by QKI regulation. We will use human and mouse cells, and cell extracts to
conduct these studies. We propose that QKI5 binding (and thus splicing activity) is influenced by a) competition
between pre-mRNA substrates and lncRNAs, and b) protein-protein interactions. Moreover, we propose that
regulated splicing by QKI5 is coupled to transcript localization and stability, and that QKI5 influences the core
spliceosome machinery. These studies will yield fundamental data that will inform the broader scientific
community as to how RBPs can be regulated and regulate gene expression. Overall, these findings will show
how complex, multi-step RNA processing is integrated into the overall flow of molecular information in order to
maintain cellular homeostasis."

Bone marrow inflammation induced by the dysregulated innate immune system and inflammasome activation is
increasingly indicated to be critical in the pathogenesis and progression of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).
Despite the significant progress in this field in the past few years, one of the key unresolved questions is: what
are the major regulators that mediate the development of bone marrow inflammation. Resolving this question
will be critical for the development of novel immunotherapies to treat MDS and prevent its progression, which
remains to be a critical unmet medical need. Using a mouse model of double knockout (DKO) of Diap1 and
miR146a, both are involved in the innate immune signaling and significantly downregulated in patients with MDS,
we revealed that the old DKO mice developed MDS due to the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the
bone marrow. One of the unique features of the DKO model is that these mice are phenotypically normal at
younger age but develop MDS that eventually progress to leukemia with aging, which closely phenocopies the
development and progression of MDS in patients. More recently, we showed that genetic depletion of IL-6 in the
DKO mice significantly delayed MDS progression. However, IL-6 is one of the highly upregulated cytokines in
DKO mice and MDS patients. Loss of IL-6 failed to revert the inflammatory bone marrow microenvironment and
many MDS phenotypes in the DKO model. It is essential to reveal the common upstream regulator(s) that
mediate the release of inflammatory cytokines. In this respect, IL-6 is a well-known downstream target of IL-1,
which is released by inflammation induced pyroptotic cells. Pyroptosis is activated upon inflammasome assembly
including NLRP3, which is a downstream target of NF-b and upregulated by the activation of the innate immune
signaling. Activation of NLRP3 is a hall mark of MDS independent of mutation status. Upregulated and activated
NLRP3 inflammasome activates caspase 1, which in turn cleaves gasdermin D. The cleaved gasdermin D results
in increased cell permeability, pyroptosis, and the release of cytokines including IL-1 family. Given its central role
in pyroptosis, gasdermin D could also be involved in the pathogenesis and progression of MDS. We therefore
crossed DKO mice with gasdermin D knockout mice. Indeed, loss of gasdermin D markedly reverted MDS
phenotypes in the DKO mice. Gasdermin D is also highly upregulated in patients with MDS. Our preliminary
studies indicate that gasdermin D also mediates inflammation in bone marrow stromal cells. Based on these
data, we hypothesize that gasdermin D mediated inflammatory cues and dysregulation of innate immune
signaling in hematopoietic cells and bone marrow stromal cells are pivotal in facilitating MDS development and
progression. To test this hypothesis, we will perform experiments in the following three aims. In aim 1, we will
investigate the hematopoietic cell intrinsic mechanisms of gasdermin D in MDS development and progression.
In aim 2, the role of gasdermin D in mediating the inflammatory bone marrow microenvironment will be analyzed.
Aim 3 will focus on the translational respect through targeting gasdermin D to treat MDS. Successful completion
of this project will have an important impact in understanding the pathogenesis of aging associated bone marrow
inflammation in MDS and developing novel immunotherapies to treat MDS."
10873935,"Project Summary/Abstract
 More than 19 million colonoscopies are performed in the US each year, with 60% of adults between 55-75
years having at least one within the last decade (1-3). These procedures provide physicians with minimally
invasive access to diagnose and treat diseases such as colon cancer. While routine, colonoscopies are the most
expensive screening test routinely performed on healthy Americans, with a mean cost of $2,125 (4). Furthering
the cost is the wide variation in successful completion rates that occur based on the physician skill– While the
acceptable physician success rate is only 90%, this modest target today is only achieved after physicians complete
hundreds of patient cases (5-7).
 In light of this, the investigators have developed the Manikin Advanced Feedback Trainer (MAFT) to improve
patient health and reduce healthcare costs through efficient and effective colonoscopy training. Efficient learning
is produced using a high fidelity sensorized manikin trainer and a virtual “coach” that uses optimization-based
feedback developed through optimization modeling. MAFT is rigorously developed through 3 Aims below:
 Specific Aim 1: Develop and validate an extensive colon geometry dataset and a refined
sensorization system for the MAFT. Colon geometry of 959 patient virtual colonoscopies from The Cancer
Imaging Archive (TCIA) will be computationally measured with a user-friendly automated organ geometry
centerline program. In addition, this aim will advance MAFT through the refinement of sensor processing.
 Specific Aim 2: Develop, validate, and execute a 3D optimization model to solve for optimal
endoscope steering control. For each specific colon geometry there exists an optimal set of endoscope
steering controls to successfully insert an endoscope to reach the cecum in optimal time and with minimal
trauma. An Optimization model will be developed to solve for this optimum, and then this program will be
executed across the large colon dataset.
 Specific Aim 3: Develop and experimentally assess virtual coach to provide personalized and
progressive learning for the Manikin Advanced Feedback Trainer. Hypothesis (H1): MAFT system of
interactive feedback provided by a virtual coach will improve a physician’s cecal intubation rate (CIR),
Adenoma Detection Rate (ADR) through improved visualizations, and reduce endoscope forces that can cause
colon damage. The virtual coach will be developed and validated through Human Study 1 and 2 that utilizes
both attending physicians and residents. In Human Study 3 MAFT will be implemented into the surgical
residency program at Hershey Medical Center in Years 4 and 5, and residents’ skills at performing colonoscopy
will be assessed based on the well-established metrics of CIR, ADR, and GAGES assessment to validate H1."

The major goal of this grant application is to determine the molecular mechanisms by which YAP/TAZ regulate age-related
skin dermal extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis.
In human skin, dermal fibroblasts are responsible for the production, organization, and homeostasis of the collagen-rich
dermal ECM, which comprises the bulk of the skin. In young skin, direct attachment to intact collagen fibrils allows
fibroblasts to achieve a spread architecture, through mechanical forces generated by the assembly of the cytoskeleton.
In this state, the YAP/TAZ pathway is active, which maintains a youthful anabolic phenotype with net ECM production. In
aged skin, fragmented collagen fibrils do not support fibroblast attachment, resulting in reduced mechanical force/stretching
and a decline in YAP/TAZ function. In this state, fibroblasts display an aged catabolic phenotype, with net ECM degradation,
which is self-perpetuating and creates a dermal microenvironment milieu that promotes the pathogenesis of many age-
related skin diseases.
We propose to investigate the hypothesis that the YAP/TAZ mechano-sensing signaling pathway in dermal fibroblasts is a
critical regulator of age-related dermal ECM homeostasis. This data-driven hypothesis encompasses the key concept that
dermal ECM homeostasis is governed by the adaptation of fibroblasts to the surrounding ECM microenvironment, rather
than cell‐autonomous factors. Thus, we view dermal ECM homeostasis as involving “outside‐in adaptation” of dermal
fibroblasts to the age‐related state of the dermal ECM, in which fibroblasts are embedded, and that this adaptation is
critically regulated by YAP/TAZ.
To test the above hypothesis, we have recently generated two complementary genetically modified mouse models: 1)
conditional knockout of Yap/Taz in dermal fibroblasts, which results in striking impairment of both neonatal dermal ECM
maturation and signiﬁcantly accelerated chronological dermal ECM aging; 2) humanized mouse model of dermal aging
driven by expression of collage-degrading matrix metalloproteinase-1 in dermal fibroblasts. Importantly, this model
displays physiological inactivation of YAP/TAZ in response to ECM degradation.
Following Specific aims are proposed to test the stated hypothesis:
AIM 1: DETERMINE THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS BY WHICH YAP/TAZ MEDIATES DERMAL ECM HOMEOSTASIS
DURING EARLY POSTNATAL LIFE AND CHRONOLOGICAL AGING
AIM 2: DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF RESTORATION OF YAP/TAZ FUNCTION ON DERMAL ECM HOMEOSTASIS
AIM 3: INVESTIGATE MECHANISMS BY WHICH AGE-RELATED FUNCTIONAL DECLINE OF YAP/TAZ IS MEDIATED BY
FIBROBLASTS “OUTSIDE-IN ADAPTION”"
10912048,"Project Summary
More than one million Americans present with foot drop after stroke and often develop compensatory strategies
to avoid scuffing the foot. Current treatment for foot drop addresses the hazard of tripping by applying non-
volitional torques to the ankle to prevent the foot from plantarflexing. The two most common such devices are
the Ankle Foot Orthosis (AFO) and Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES), which both provide well-documented
orthotic effects to help users walk while the device is worn. However, therapeutic effects are limited, and users
rarely improve enough to cease needing their device.
Accordingly, here we propose an alternative strategy that addresses the hazard of tripping even while allowing
full volitional control of the ankle: an inexpensive Variable Friction (VF) shoe. Its outsole is high-friction during
the stance phase of gait and low friction during swing; further, it produces a “click” when a scuff occurs. Evidence
suggests that such feedback can enhance therapeutic outcomes. Our preliminary data suggests that the VF shoe
is effective at increasing gait speed immediately (orthotic effect) and after long term use, even when the shoe is
removed (therapeutic effect).
Our central hypothesis is that allowing volitional motion of the ankle while mitigating the hazard of tripping coupled
with gait-phased auditory biofeedback will result in improved gait for subjects with drop foot. Specifically, we
hypothesize that the VF shoe will show significantly greater therapeutic effects than an AFO, yet maintain the
desirable orthotic effect of the AFO. We arrange our work in two Aims.
Specific Aim 1: Characterize the scuff-force reduction of the VF shoe over the lifetime of use. Critical to
understanding the effects of the VF shoe is a characterization of the level of scuff-force reduction.
Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the effects of the VF shoe on gait in individuals with chronic stroke and drop
foot. During each 12-week phase of an AB-BA clinical trial, participants will walk for at least 30-45 minutes per
day for at least 5 days per week at home.
We expect that this work will validate our VF shoe as a tool for improving gait after stroke and will introduce a
new paradigm for drop foot therapy: fully volitional ankle control while mitigating tripping. The results will lay the
foundation for a future pivotal device trial on the VF shoe to assess clinical efficacy. Importantly, the VF shoe is
simple, low-cost and easy-to-use, making wide-ranging home-based adoption feasible."
10886091,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Gene expression, the flow of genetic information from DNA to messenger RNA (mRNA) to protein,
involves delicate regulation by a group of small RNAs named microRNAs. MicroRNAs can inhibit gene
expression by binding to mRNAs and prevent them from being translated into proteins. MicroRNA
levels in cancer cells are usually different from the microRNA levels in healthy cells, leading to
differential expression of certain cancer-related genes. Controlling microRNA levels therefore offers a
promising target for cancer treatment.
Recently, we found that when T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells are treated with
dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid steroid commonly used in leukemia chemotherapy, two highly related
and pro-cancer microRNAs (miR-221/222) are degraded by their target mRNA (BIM). This is surprising
because microRNAs usually control the levels of their targets, but not the other way around. This is also
exciting because it represents an emerging gene regulation mode carried out by the mRNAs and opens
up strategies for cancer intervention.
In this proposal, we first aim to understand how BIM mRNA triggers miR-221/222 degradation. Our
second aim is to explore how miR-221/222 degradation enhances killing of T-ALL cells during
chemotherapy. In the final aim, we will develop an innovative biochemical and computational protocol to
globally identify sequences in different target mRNAs that can induce miRNA degradation in T-ALL
patient samples.
Collectively, our efforts will examine a new mechanism of gene regulation in T-ALL, in which mRNAs
counteract microRNAs. Because resistance to glucocorticoid is a serious limitation for T-ALL
chemotherapy, elucidating the underlying mechanism of resistance may provide the basis for improving
current therapeutic interventions. Given that we have discovered a potentially widespread occurrence
of the mRNA-induced microRNA degradation pathway in cancer, identifying the mRNAs that can
degrade miRNAs and the proteins involved in this process would help develop new therapies to combat
T-ALL."
10906181,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mosquitoes transmit numerous pathogens to humans by virtue of their ability to locate and bite vertebrates.
Current strategies to prevent these diseases face various limitations and new approaches are needed. One
possibility would be to inhibit the neurons in the mosquito brain that direct the behavior of attraction to humans
and feeding on blood, but such neurons have not been identified because the tools and knowledge to do so do
not exist. This proposal describes my plan to use genetic and sequencing-based approaches to identify the
neurons that are required for blood-feeding behavior. I will take advantage of the fact that mosquitoes require
multiple human-derived cues, particularly heat and CO2, to engorge on blood. Using gene expression changes
in single cells, I will identify neurons that show altered responses specifically in the presence of both stimuli. To
enable the genetic targeting of specific cell types of interest, we will create an atlas of enhancer elements that
are specific to each cell type in the mosquito brain, using paired single cell RNA and ATAC-seq data. Finally,
we will target key neurons for blood feeding using an enhancer driver constructs and combine them with
genetic effectors to test whether the neurons are necessary and sufficient for blood feeding behavior. This
proposal combines my expertise in computational genomics, transgenic mosquitoes, and behavior to achieve
the goal of identifying neurons at a key node in the neural circuits for blood feeding. The identification of these
neurons that drive blood feeding would be useful for understanding how they are activated and thus allow the
design of more attractive mosquito traps. These neurons, if inactivated, would prevent mosquitoes from biting
humans so they also could serve as a potential target to disrupt the spread of mosquito borne illness."
10898058,"The role of B cells in infectious disease, autoimmunity, and allergy is critical. Modern sequencing
technologies, such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and spatial transcriptomics, have
emerged as powerful techniques for studying the transcriptional states of individual B cells in a variety
of biological contexts. These technologies generate massive amounts of complex data that
necessitate use of powerful, sophisticated computational methods. The analysis of such data is
hampered by numerous technical and biological biases embedded in the data. In scRNAseq, for
example, the non-uniform capture of cells along some developmental trajectory, as well as the
expression of multiple concurrent transcriptional programs, pose a challenge to current single cell
clustering and trajectory inference methods. These biases are exacerbated when studying B cell
compartments with complex dynamics, such as those found in lymphoid tissues. To address these
issues, we propose a novel toolbox of algorithms for modeling B cell activity that combines prior,
validated biological knowledge with computational algorithm design. In Aim 1, we develop tools to
elucidate temporal B cell developmental processes. And in Aim 2, we develop tools to elucidate B cell
spatial transcriptional programs. In Aim 3, apply our tools to a variety of important clinical scenarios,
such as mapping the immune correlates of higher affinity antibodies and characterizing the
heterogeneity observed in IBD. Overall, our research will create much-needed computational tools for
analyzing immune signals in scRNAseq and spatial transcriptomics data, as well as show that
incorporating prior knowledge greatly improves the ability of computational algorithms to reveal the
full spectrum of immune system changes that occur in response to vaccination, infection, and
immune-mediated diseases."
10909289,"HNN U24 DISSEMINATION PROJECT SUMMARY
The Human Neocortical Neurosolver (HNN) neural modeling tool was developed with BRAIN Initiative funding
(R01EB022889: 09/2016–06/2020) to meet the Initiative’s goal to “develop innovative technologies to understand
brain circuits and ensembles of circuits that inform understanding of the human brain and mechanisms for
treating its disorder”. HNN is a biophysically principled neocortical circuit model with appropriate physics that
allow bridging from macroscale human magneto- and electro-encephalography (M/EEG) signals to their cellular
and circuit level generators. HNN is a hypothesis development and testing tool whose design and capabilities
are unique compared to other M/EEG neural modeling software. A key value of HNN is to connect functionally-
relevant human signals to circuit level dynamics studied in animal models, including data from revolutionary
genetic and imaging tools used in mice and monkeys (e.g., Neuropixel recordings, calcium, and voltage imaging).
These links are essential to discovering new principles of brain information processing and to developing
treatments when this processing is disrupted by neuropathology. There is widespread use of M/EEG, and myriad
inferences drawn from these signals about human brain function and health: HNN provides a highly accessible
tool for researchers to make principled connections to the detailed neurons and circuits underlying these signals,
to test new ideas and ground conclusions in circuit-level reality.
The neuroscience community is actively engaged in the use of HNN for basic and clinical research, including
studies of Alzheimer’s disease, autism spectrum disorder, pain, depression, and healthy development. While
HNN was successfully developed, there remain several challenges for growth and long-term sustainability. The
goal of this proposal is to support dissemination of HNN for broadly accessibly use and community-driven
development. Identified challenges in maintenance of HNN’s code and documentation that ensure Findability,
Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability will be addressed (Aim I), and key enhancements necessary to
support end-user needs and experimental validation of model-derived predictions will be developed (Aim II).
Interpreting the complex multiscale origin of M/EEG signals with HNN’s large-scale neural often requires domain
expertise in computational neural modeling, human M/EEG, and neural dynamics. To support this need, we will
continue to work with the community to integrate HNN into their projects through workshops, direct collaboration,
and consultation with end-user groups, and by enabling HNN simulation on freely accessible supercomputers
(Aim III). End-user feedback and documented support needs will be used to develop a Plan for Sustainability. A
world-class Steering Committee includes developers of widely-adopted neuroscience software who will share
their expertise to help HNN reach its maximal potential as translational neuroscience tool."

 Under the renewal of the Mobile Toolbox (MTB2), the Project and Cores will work collaboratively to enhance
the Mobile Toolbox (MTB) platform so that it may become a form of “common currency” for remote assessments
with the flexibility to meet the needs of researchers across a vast array of diverse study designs and populations.
To accomplish this, the Project will develop, integrate, and psychometrically evaluate new measures and
retention strategies that will benefit future research utilizing remote assessment tools. The primary aims of the
Project include: Aim 1: Identify, develop, and integrate non-cognitive measures and passive sensor
technology for the Mobile Toolbox (MTB) to enable the collection of lifespan contextual, psychological,
physical, and behavioral experiences to enhance the assessment of cognitive trajectories; Aim 2:
Evaluate the psychometric properties of the MTB2 measures through a series of data collection
protocols aimed at calibration, norming, validation, and measurement sensitivity; and Aim 3: Leverage
longitudinal studies included in MTB2 to develop, integrate, and evaluate retention strategies to improve
participant adherence and compliance. The measures introduced by MTB2 will be designed around the
technical specifications of an open software iOS and Android platform that enables external researchers to
customize a mobile app to fit their study needs. Researchers will be able to choose from a diverse selection of
measures, including several change-sensitive cognitive tasks, measures of contextual and exposure variables,
as well as physical, behavioral, and psychological functions. We will then calibrate new measures using Item
Response Theory by administering them to a large general population sample. All newly developed measures
will be validated against existing gold standards in a sample of healthy adults ages 20-85 with a 7- to 21-day
retest; MTB measures will be completed in an un-proctored setting. We will also conduct a clinical validation
study and identify normative values for the new MTB measures using a large, nationally representative sample.
Finally, a series of hypothesis-driven studies prioritized by the NIH, Steering Committee, and External Scientific
Panel will be used to explore the relationship between non-cognitive and cognitive functions across the adult
lifespan. By leveraging the MTB2 longitudinal studies, we will identify dynamic motivational strategies that help
sustain participant engagement, promote re-engagement, and maintain long-term study adherence. MTB2's
range of evidence-based incentive strategies at both the group and person-centered level will be integrated into
the researcher study portal to allow studies with diverse cross-study designs and assessment schedules to
maximize engagement and retention. Special attention will be paid to retaining participants from minority health
and NIH-designated populations that experience health disparities."

10931491,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: PROJECT 1
Lymph node (LN) metastasis precedes further dissemination for most solid malignancies and confers a stage III
diagnosis. Nonetheless, the mechanistic role of LN metastasis in further disease progression is poorly
understood. We discovered in mice that in colonizing LNs, tumor cells activate transcriptional programs that
enable their induction of tumor-specific immune tolerance through interactions with LN leukocytes. These
leukocytes subsequently recirculate throughout the host, resulting in systemic immune tolerance facilitating
metastatic seeding of distant sites. Importantly, we found the same conserved transcriptional signature in LN
metastases in humans, suggesting that the mechanisms driving LN metastasis and immune tolerance in our
mouse model are pertinent to human cancers. We hypothesize that local interactions between tumor cells,
leukocytes, and stroma within LNs before, during, and following LN colonization alter distant tissues to promote
disease progression. We expect these interactions to involve homotypic and heterotypic cell-cell interactions,
orchestration of architectural changes within LNs, tumors, and distant sites, and trafficking of various populations
throughout the host. We will use syngeneic mouse models to identify the mechanisms by which these interactions
facilitate disease progression through the following approaches. 1: Determine the kinetics by which tumors
generate systemic immune tolerance. Using a high-dimensional imaging platform (CODEX), we will uncover
longitudinal changes in local microenvironments across the host. 2: Interrogate the nature of heterotypic cell-cell
interactions within LNs and the mechanisms by which these interactions facilitate immune evasion and induction
of immune tolerance. We will use scRNA-seq to identify transcriptional changes in immune and stromal
populations interacting with malignant cells within LNs. Using spatial transcriptomics, we will determine how the
gene expression patterns of cells interacting with malignant cells differ from those at a distance. To confirm the
functional significance of these targets identified and those identified in Project 2, we will combine CRISPR-
mediated gene editing of LN metastatic tumors, along with cell depletion studies and knockout mice or inducible
mouse models. 3: Determine how trafficking of immune cells from tumor-involved LNs establish a pro-metastatic
microenvironment at distant sites. We will employ a novel cell labeling platform to evaluate trafficking of
leukocytes and stromal cells from tumor-involved LNs to distant sites and back to the primary tumor. These
studies will reveal the mechanisms whereby LN metastases promote tumor spread to distant sites and identify
novel targets for the prevention and treatment of metastatic disease."

Calcium (Ca2+) is a major signaling mechanism in eukaryotic cells, but although Ca2+ signaling has ancient
origins, it is not well understood in bacteria. Several bacteria have been shown to maintain a low intracellular
Ca2+ concentration, which is the basis for Ca2+ signaling in eukaryotes. In addition, some bacterial Ca2+-
binding proteins and putative transporters have been identified, suggesting the presence of a bacterial Ca2+
signaling system analogous to that in eukaryotes. However, many fundamental questions about bacterial Ca2+
signaling remain, from maintenance of Ca2+ gradients to Ca2+ triggers, Ca2+ binding proteins, Ca2+ storage,
and finally the effects of changing Ca2+ concentrations on bacterial physiology and pathogenesis. Using a
FRET-based Ca2+ reporter system in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) that allows for precise, real time
measuring of intracellular Ca2+ levels, we will explore these fundamental questions about Ca2+ signaling in
Mtb. We will use a novel proteomic approach, thermal protein profiling, to globally detect Ca2+ binding proteins
in Mtb. We also identified a novel Ca2+ porin and will use a porin knockout strain to test for the role of Ca2+ in
Mtb pathogenesis. Together, we will leverage these new tools to test the hypothesis that Mtb maintains a Ca2+
signaling system analogous to that in many eukaryotes and will begin to dissect the physiologic and
pathogenic implications of Ca2+ homeostasis in Mtb."
10884428,"ABSTRACT
The rapid rise of extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing (ESBL) Enterobacteriaceae is severely
threatening the way we treat common infectious diseases. Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli (E.
coli) are a major cause of infections such as bacteremia, meningitis, and urinary tract infections in neonates.
Gut colonization with ESBL E. coli is a risk factor for these invasive infections. Additionally, infants who are
asymptomatically colonized with ESBL E. coli also contribute to the community reservoir of these strains.
Several recent studies have shown that acquisition and persistence of gut colonization with ESBL E. coli can
occur even in the absence of antibiotic exposure, traditionally considered a key risk factor. At birth the neonatal
gut is only sparsely populated with microbes, and therefore provides a unique environment for acquisition of
ESBL E. coli due to the limited competition from other microbes. A significant proportion of infants who acquire
ESBL E. coli early in life remain persistently colonized with them. However, the impact of early life acquisition
on the rapidly developing infant gut microbiome is not well studied, especially in the setting of varying age of
acquisition and nutritional intake.
Previous work in the Arshad laboratory using a murine model of early life E. coli acquisition has shown that
several ESBL E. coli persistently colonize the mouse gut through adulthood with a significantly higher burden
of colonization compared to commensal non-ESBL E. coli. In vitro studies show that some of the strains adept
in gut colonization are also able to out compete non-ESBL E. coli in a limited nutrient growth media as well as
in vivo in the animal model. Perinatal transmission of at least one ESBL E. coli in our murine model results in
an overabundance of E. coli in the infant gut microbiome and a displacement of usual commensal microbes.
This proposal aims to utilize clinically relevant ESBL E. coli, genomic sequencing, and animal models to 1)
determine the gut microbiome characteristics associated with ESBL E. coli colonization during the early life
period, and 2) assess gut colonization with ESBL E. coli and impact on microbiome according to age and
nutritional status. These objectives will be achieved by building on existing collaborations between the Arshad
lab (expertise in bacterial pathogenesis and animal models) and DePlaen lab (expertise in mouse gut nutrition)
at Lurie Children’s Hospital, and Hartmann lab at Northwestern University (expertise in bacterial genomics,
next-generation sequencing), and Grobe lab at University of Wisconsin (expertise in caloric assessment of
stool).
We anticipate that the results from the proposed experiments will provide in vivo evidence of the long-term
impact of gut colonization with ESBL E. coli on the infant gut microbiome. Further, the results of the proposed
study will aid in developing nutritional interventions and/or identification of commensal microbes that may be
used as probiotics, to prevent long-term colonization with ESBL E. coli."

funded since its inception in 1998. We will continue this RCMAR’s mission to increase the diversity of
investigators conducting research with US Native populations, defined here as American Indian, Alaska
Native, and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander people. Our program has evolved to an intensive 18-month
program comprising a 12-month pilot study, a 3-day workshop, and a 6-month grant writing program. The
Research Education Component will be led by Clemma Muller, PhD, MS, at Washington State University. She
has been affiliated with RCMARs since 2002 and currently leads the Analysis Cores for 2 RCMARs. We feature
subcontract affiliations with Mentors: Valarie Jernigan, PhD (Choctaw), a former NERC Faculty and Scientist,
at Oklahoma State University; Scott Okamoto, PhD, a current RCMAR mentor, at University of Hawai’i at
Mānoa; and Mandy Fretts, PhD (Eel Ground First Nation), at University of Washington. These faculty
represent universities that employ many Native and other underrepresented minority (URM) early-stage
investigators whose participation as CHANGE Scientists will advance their careers and accelerate Native-
focused aging research at their institutions. CHANGE is highly responsive to the RFA’s requirements of recruiting
Scientists and providing Mentors from the parent or affiliated institutions, while concurrently accommodating the
real-world limitations presented by the highly-dispersed and relatively-small community of early-stage
investigators and senior faculty conducting Native-focused aging health research. Our Specific Aims are to: 1)
Provide intensive mentoring for 9 CHANGE Scientists, with customized support for career advancement and a
capacity-building “mentor pipeline;” 2) Facilitate professional development activities to build capacity for
leadership, Community Integration, community-based participatory research, networking, and collaboration; and
to foster an environment conducive to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, and inclusive excellence; and
3) Champion CHANGE Scientists’ efforts to obtain K- or R-series extramural funding, and provide services and
resources for research excellence that will accelerate progress toward tenure and promotion. A diverse scientific
workforce improves engagement, establishes trust with research participants from URM groups, ensures that
research is locally appropriate, promotes innovation, helps to avoid biased outcomes, and generates higher-
quality scientific publications. Personalized, culturally-informed training and access to URM role models are key
for successful URM training programs. Our approach reflects new literature on barriers and promotors of URM

mechanisms of ADRD inequalities, including risk and resilience factors, biomarkers, and caregiving. It is critical
to identify pathways between structural and social systems of exposure and ADRD outcomes in order to design
interventions to narrow disparities and reduce the population burden of cognitive impairment and dementia. Over
the past 4.5 years, CIRAD has built an extensive network that includes Core Leaders, Scientists, mentors, and
collaborators from the four schools of the Columbia University Irving Medical Center, the Columbia University
Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC), the Columbia Butler Aging Center, the CTSA Community
Engagement Core, and the New York State Psychiatric Institute. We have engaged Scientists and mentors from
New York City based institutions such as the City University of New York and the State University of New York,
NYU, Weill Cornell Medical Center, Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, as well
as other institutions around the country. The CIRAD Core leadership team includes former RCMAR Scientists
who are well known for community-engaged research on ADRD inequalities. The goal of CIRAD is to provide
sustained mentoring and career development, support for pilot studies, training in health disparities, and
interdisciplinary collaboration to CIRAD Scientists and to support and accelerate research on the mechanisms
of ADRD disparities so that they can be narrowed or eliminated. We will achieve our goals through: Aim 1. To
establish and support a Leadership and Administrative Core, Aim 2. To establish a Research Education Core
that will support a program that engages and supports early-stage investigators from historically excluded

Coordinate and support the integration of CIRAD Cores and leveraged resources in order to meet the training,
research, and community engagement goals of the center. Aim 3. Support communication and dissemination
of CIRAD activities within CUIMC, partner institutions in New York City, NIA, other RCMAR programs, and
nationally. Aim 4. Evaluate CIRAD activities."
10909376,"ANALYSIS CORE SUMMARY
There is extensive need for development of a skilled workforce for the study of disparities in Alzheimer's
Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Due to the aging of the US population, the numbers of persons with
ADRD are increasing. The exponential rise of numbers of people with ADRD is greater among ethnic
minorities, particularly Hispanics and non-Hispanic Blacks, compared with Non-Hispanic Whites. The study of
health disparities related to ADRD requires a transdisciplinary approach that includes research in social
determinants of health (SDOH), behavioral science, mental health, epidemiology, ADRD biomarkers,
neuropsychology, measurement, biostatistics, bioinformatics, clinical trials, and caregiving. The Columbia
Center for Interdisciplinary Research on Alzheimer's Disease Disparities” (CIRAD) Analysis Core (AnC) has
three main goals: 1) assist in the production and application of new measures and methods for studying health,
social and environmental factors, and behavior across the life course among ethnically diverse populations; 2)
provide technical assistance to RCMAR Scientists; and 3) support a mentoring method for pilot investigators
through study grids to be used in the Work-in-Progress (WIP) mentoring seminars, methods internships and
training workshops. CIRAD will work with the other RCMAR AnCs and the Coordinating Center (CC) in: a)
collaborative research projects, b) publications, and c) a website resource that contains measurement reviews
and recommendations for appropriate measures and methods for use in studying ADRD in diverse
populations. The AnC will leverage collaborations with the Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRC) at
Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC), the Pepper Center at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine and the Weill
Cornell Roybal Center to provide cross-site research and mentoring opportunities for RCMAR Scientists. The
AnC will assist Research Education Component (REC) leaders (Drs. Aiello and Byrd) with applications from
RCMAR Scientists. A focus of methodological development will be related to the primary theme of the CIRAD:
interdisciplinary research on biological, behavioral, sociocultural, and environmental mechanisms of disparities
in ADRD, including risk and resilience factors, biomarkers, and caregiving. The proposed AnC is focused on
measurement but is also examining analytic methods for secondary data analyses involving biomarkers. The
AnC will achieve its goals through the following specific aims: Specific Aims 1 & 2: Methodological and
statistical mentoring of junior investigators; Specific Aims 3 & 4: Measurement: Identifying, cataloging, and
distributing culturally informed measures; Specific Aims 5 & 6: Development of methods and analyses related
to the CIRAD theme of mechanisms of ADRD disparities; Specific Aims 7 & 8: Development of further
collaborative relationships with other RCMAR and NIA Centers."
10884910,"The goal of this proposal is to explore how to target PIK3CA signaling for treatment of pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This deadly cancer is highly resistant to current treatment regimens, including
immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors. More than 90% of PDAC have oncogenic mutations in KRAS, and
PIK3CA is a direct effector of KRAS. Our group first reported that genetic ablation of PIK3CA in the pancreas
completely protected mice against oncogenic KRAS-induced tumor formation, and subsequently reported that
PIK3CA plays a critical role in sustaining pancreatic tumors by shielding them from the immune system.
Orthotopic implantation of KrasG12D;Trp53R172H;Pdx1-Cre (KPC) pancreatic tumor cells in immunocompetent
mice caused 100% lethality, whereas mice implanted with Pik3ca-/- KPC (PIK3CA-KO) KPC cells exhibited
tumor regression with 100% animal survival. A genome-wide gene deletion screen to search for molecules that
can reverse the elimination of PIK3CA-KO cells by the immune system identified PCCB, which catalyzes the
carboxylation of propionyl-CoA to produce methylmalonyl-CoA. PCCB-null PIK3CA-KO KPC cells were
generated, and when implanted in mice, these tumors were not cleared by the host immune system. Two
hypotheses will be tested: 1) Oncogenic KRAS activation of PIK3CA modulates a PCCB-regulated metabolic
environment that favors evasion of pancreatic cancer from immune elimination; and 2) Alpelisib inhibition of
PIK3CA enhances the activity of anti-PD1 plus anti-PCSK9 therapy against pancreatic tumors. Aim 1
investigates mechanisms by which KRAS activation of PIK3CA modulates a PCCB-regulated metabolic
environment that favors immune evasion of pancreatic cancer, including upregulation of immune checkpoints
and T cell exhaustion. Tumor infiltrating T cells will be isolated and analyzed by single-cell RNA and T cell
receptor (TCR) V(D)J sequencing, flow cytometry and IHC. Adoptive T cell transfer experiments will be
performed to determine if T cells previously exposed to PCCB-null PIK3CA-KO tumors will eliminate PIK3CA-
KO tumors implanted in SCID mice. Cell metabolism and immunological profile of PCCB-null PIK3CA-KO vs.
PIK3CA-KO and parental KPC cell lines will be measured to better understand the metabolic alterations
controlled by PIK3CA and PCCB and how these changes may lead to immune suppression. Aim 2 is a
therapeutic study that tests the efficacy of alpelisib, a PIK3CA inhibitor, in combination with neutralizing
antibodies against PD-1 and PCSK9 for treatment of pancreatic cancer using the orthotopically implanted KPC
mouse model. Tumor infiltrating T cells will also be isolated and analyzed by single-cell sequencing. In
summary, this proposal will investigate how PIK3CA signaling regulates the metabolic and immunological
profile of pancreatic cancer. Alpelisib, anti-PD1 antibodies and anti-PCSK9 antibodies are all FDA-approved for
clinical use. Successful completion of our studies may lead to clinical trials with these approved drugs for
treatment of pancreatic cancer."
10880367,"Project Summary
Aggressive chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains incurable despite with improved chemotherapy
regimens and targeted therapies. Better understanding of the biology underlying aggressive CLL is expected to
design novel therapies.
We recently discovered that high spliceosome complex protein expression results in aberrant RNA splicing, is
associated with aggressive disease and serves as an independent predictive marker for poor prognosis in CLL,
highlighting RNA splicing dysregulation underlies aggressive CLL. Through an integrated transcriptome and
proteome analysis on normal and primary CLL B cells, we discovered that METTL3, an RNA methyltransferase
that deposits N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification on mRNA, is strongly implicated as a key regulator for RNA
splicing in CLL. METTL3 is a highly expressed protein in CLL, associated with poor clinical outcome, and
significantly correlated with splicing factor protein expression. Moreover, efficacious small molecule inhibitors of
METTL3 have been developed and have shown promising results in hematological malignancy. Treatment with
METTL3 inhibitor results in growth defect in CLL cell lines and decreases RNA splicing factor protein expression.
Moreover, we have obtained evidence that METTL3 overexpression is oncogenic by rending IL-3 independency
in Ba/F3 cell line model. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that METTL3 potentially acts as an
oncogene and drives the onset and progression of CLL through the regulation of RNA splicing network, making
it a potential target for treating aggressive CLL. To address this hypothesis, we propose to investigate METTL3
is required for both development and maintenance of CLL using murine models (Aim 1). We will dissect the
molecular mechanism underlying the targets of RNA splicing network in CLL and understand how they are
regulated by METTL3 (Aim 2). Moreover, we will determine whether METTL3 is a viable therapeutic target in
treating aggressive CLL and if targeting both METTL3 and RNA splicing regulatory network has a synergistic
effect in CLL (Aim 3).
Collectively, the results of the experiments proposed in this application will establish METTL3 as an CLL
oncogene, elucidate the m6A-modification on target transcripts that modulated by METTL3 to promote and
maintain CLL, and evaluate a new therapeutic approach for aggressive CLL."
10890150,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cellular protein homeostasis (proteostasis) is essential to maintain the health of an entire organism throughout
life. Proteostasis collapse in aging organisms is a massive clinical problem as it underlies the development of
age-associated degenerative protein misfolding diseases in multiple organs, such as sarcopenia, metabolic
disorders or dementia. Centrally regulated signals produced by the nervous system such as hormones and
neuropeptides have been best characterized for their role in maintaining cell nonautonomous health. However,
the role of enteroendocrine cells, i.e. the gut, in producing secreted signals that have system-wide effects to
extend the health span of an animal is less well studied. Identifying intercellular signaling networks initiated by
the gut to prolong healthy tissue function throughout aging is therefore essential if we are to begin utilize such
signals for therapeutic strategies. The long-term goal of my lab is to develop molecular interventions that lever-
age intercellular signals initiated by the gut to promote healthy aging and long-term tissue health. We use C.
elegans for our work, as it is a tremendously useful system to identify and visualize the molecular mechanism
of intercellular signaling networks in the living organism. My lab discovered that mild gut stress, triggered by
knockdown of the molecular chaperone Hsp90 in the intestine, initiates the upregulation of protective protein
quality control responses in other tissues such as muscle. This results in lifespan extension and promotes
stress resilience throughout aging. We identified the cell membrane associated guanylate cyclase TXT-1 and
the homeodomain transcription factor CEH-58 as crucial mediators of gut-to-muscle signaling. Both compo-
nents function in the muscle to transduce extracellular signals received from the gut to activate protective re-
sponses. The overall objective is to determine how TXT-1 and CEH-58 initiate adaptive regulatory responses
in the muscle that promote health span. The central hypothesis is that intestine-specific reduction of Hsp90 ex-
pression activates a new intercellular signaling pathway that induces protective protein quality control re-
sponses in muscle cells (“gut-to-muscle signaling”). Our rationale is that by determining the molecular mecha-
nism of core components required for gut-to-muscle signaling we will have defined this new pathway and can
therapeutically target it to prolong health span. To test our central hypothesis, we will use genetic approaches
that allow for the visualization of intercellular and tissue-specific signals, as well as tissue-specific proteomic
and genomic methodologies in the following specific aims; Aim 1: Determine the molecular mechanism of core
components involved in gut-to-muscle signaling that promote proteostasis; Aim 2: Determine the gut stress-
induced antagonistic regulation of HSF-1 and CEH-58 at the transcriptional and molecular level; Aim 3: Define
the effects of constitutive and transient TCS activation on proteostasis and long-term health. In determining the
molecular mechanism of gut-to-muscle signaling, we expect to reveal fundamental new insights into the role of
the gut as a central organ that promotes organismal health span and counteracts age-associated illnesses."
10917321,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Influenza virus infection triggers lung inflammation and pathology and is a leading cause of acute respiratory
distress syndrome. Following viral clearance, lung inflammation and pathology can persist preventing recovery
from severe cases of infection. Such persistent lung inflammation and pathology, also referred to as Post-viral
Lung Disease (PVLD), is an underappreciated aspect of influenza virus infections, even though many patients
suffer extended hospital stays, and 25 – 50% of patients continue to experience respiratory symptoms for at
least 2 months after hospital discharge. Severe influenza virus infections also exacerbate other chronic
respiratory diseases, including COPD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Currently, there are no approved
pharmacologic interventions to improve recovery after viral clearance and to prevent or reverse PVLD and its
long-term effects. PVLD is characterized by the persistence of inflammatory immune cells in the lung tissue
and the failure of effective alveolar epithelial repair capable of restoring tissue function. The cellular and/or
molecular mechanisms driving the persistence of inflammatory immune cells and preventing effective alveolar
repair in the absence of ongoing viral replication are not known. We recently identified lung fibroblasts as
drivers of inflammation and influenza disease severity. We showed that a lineage of lung fibroblasts, which we
term inflammatory fibroblasts (iFibs), are especially important for driving pathogenesis, and not only promote
hyperinflammation, but also prevent restoration of normal alveolar function during acute infections. Our
preliminary data now demonstrate that these iFibs do not die during the acute phase of the infection, but
instead persist into post-viral stages of influenza disease. Together, these data allow us to hypothesize that a
subset of lung fibroblasts survives regulated cell death during acute IAV infection, differentiate into activated
iFibs, persist in damaged lung tissue well after viral clearance, and drive PVLD by continued production of
inflammatory mediators. We will test this hypothesis by addressing the following three key questions: (1) From
which cells, and when, do PVLD-driving inflammatory fibroblasts arise? (2) Do inflammatory fibroblasts persist
because they do not undergo regulated cell death, and (3) What is the therapeutic potential of inhibiting
persistent inflammatory fibroblast activity in PVLD? Successful completion of this project will identify a distinct
lineage of inflammatory lung fibroblasts as the cell type that initiates and drives PVLD and the mechanism of
their persistence following infection. This research will identify novel therapeutic entry points to prevent or
reduce PVLD before it develops to the point that it becomes irreversible."
10904837,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common heritable cardiac disease. Individuals with HCM have
adverse clinical outcomes, including heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death (SCD) It is estimated
.
that, in the U.S., 6 out of 7 individuals with HCM are unaware of their diagnosis. There are recognized racial
disparities in the diagnosis of HCM. While Black individuals have been observed to have more clinical and ECG
signs that should promote consideration of the diagnosis of HCM, HCM is underdiagnosed in Black patients.
Furthermore, even once diagnosed, there are well-recognized disparities between Black and White patients with
HCM; Black patients have lower rates of referral to HCM Centers, referral for genetic testing, referral for SCD
risk stratification, and referral for interventions such as septal reduction therapy and implantable cardioverter-
defibrillator (ICD) placement. The lower rates of referral are in direct opposition to the data that shows that,
compared to Whites, Black individuals with HCM have approximately 2-fold the risk of SCD and development of
class III or IV (moderate or severe) heart failure. There are several potential contributors to these racial
disparities. HCM is typically diagnosed using routine echocardiography and clinical genetic testing is used to
help diagnose ambiguous cases. Black individuals with HCM are more likely to have ambiguous presentations
and clinical testing is less useful as, compared to Whites, Black patients with HCM are ~40% less likely to have
a pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) sarcomeric variant identified and more than 40% more likely to have
variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Furthermore, hypertension (HTN) is more prevalent in Black individuals
and physicians may attribute the patient’s left ventricular hypertrophy to HTN and not consider HCM.
In addition,
recent evidence suggests that HTN may be an environmental modifier /”trigger” of worse disease in patients with
HCM. Dr. Huebsch, Co-investigator on this proposal, created an in vitro micro-heart (μHM) model system from
cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) harboring single sarcomere mutations
and has used this model system to help tease apart the contributions of afterload and genetics in HCM. We
hypothesize that the presence of (1) multiple sarcomeric variants and (2) HTN contribute to the worse outcomes
observed in Black HCM patients. AIM 1. To assess adverse outcomes in Black HCM patients with (vs without)
(A) more than one variant (i.e. 2 P/LP variants or 1 P/LP variant + 1 or more VUS) and (B) HTN, in 2 real-world
U.S. cohorts of HCM patients. An exploratory analysis using Somascan assays to identify novel plasma
proteomic biomarkers of adverse outcomes will also be performed. AIM 2. To characterize the effects of multiple
variants on cardiac physiology and fibrosis in our novel in vitro μHM model subjected to increased afterload.
Combining patient clinical data with powerful in vitro tools of iPSC technology, genome editing and tissue
engineering, will allow us to gain important insights and understanding of potential triggers and mechanisms
contributing to worse outcomes in Black HCM patients."

The now established Affordable Care Act (ACA) afforded an opportunity to increase mental health
coverage and treatment for African Americans and whites and to reduce disparities. By extending
Medicaid coverage to adults with incomes at or below 138% of the Federal Poverty Line (FPL), providing
purchase subsidies for adults with incomes between 100% and 400% FPL, and by increasing the supply
of Federally Qualified Health Centers which provide considerable mental health care nationwide, the
ACA can benefit uninsured African Americans with mental health problems especially. We know little
about how much ACA policies increased coverage and treatment for mentally ill Blacks and whites.
Using data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), the Health Resources and Services
Administration and from various Medicaid and marketplace data sources this study asks, for the first time, the
following: For persons aged 18-64 with Mild and Moderate Mental Illness (MMMI), Serious Mental illness
(SMI), and Serious Psychological Distress (SPD), and after controlling for individual socio-demographic
variables related to insurance uptake and/or receipt of mental health treatment and key state-level differences
we ask: (1) How much did the ACA Medicaid expansion increase Medicaid coverage and reduce coverage
disparities? How was disparity reduction limited by some states’ supplemental Medicaid requirements? (2)
How much did increases in 1) ACA Medicaid coverage (2) greater FQHC availability increase but lack of other
provider availability decrease mental health treatment for African Americans and reduce African American-
white disparities? How much did ACA marketplaces for subsidized purchase increase private coverage and
reduce disparities? How much did increases in 1) marketplace coverage (2) and greater FQHC availability
increase, but lack of other provider availability decrease mental health treatment for African Americans and
reduce African American-white disparities? The ACA is status quo, and it is important to provide evidence
concerning African American-white mental health coverage and treatment disparity reduction to monitor
progress and guide future disparity reduction policy and administrative actions."
10886801,"Recent advances in screening and treatment have increased the number of lung cancer (LC) survivors (~571,340
LC survivors as of 2019). However, studies have shown that these survivors have a high risk for developing
second primary lung cancer (SPLC), with the median 10-year SPLC risk of 8.36% after surviving 5 years from
the initial diagnosis. Further, survivors with SPLC have significantly higher mortality vs. those who remain with
single primary LC. Many unaddressed challenges exist: (1) While prior studies identified several risk factors for
SPLC, these are mostly measured and fixed at the time of initial diagnosis, with findings focused on survivors
who have ever smoked. However, SPLC risk is likely to be influenced by dynamic changes of various factors
(e.g., smoking cessation), and our preliminary data show that SPLC risk remains just as high among survivors
who never smoked. (2) Nevertheless, current epidemiologic data mainly used for SPLC do not offer detailed data
measured after initial diagnosis, (3) nor have risk factors or predictions been evaluated for never-smoking
survivors. (4) Further, limited trial evidence exists to address the important clinical question of whether and how
to continue CT screening after IPLC diagnosis among LC survivors, which requires a long-term follow-up that is
often not feasible in clinical trials. (5) Importantly, data on detailed screening for LC survivors are typically lacking
in most population-based data. We plan to address these multiple challenges by leveraging electronic health
records (EHRs) and novel analytical approaches to generate evidence to inform clinical decisions. Our long-term
goal is to improve LC outcomes by focusing on SPLC utilizing large EHR data combined with novel statistical
methods that integrate patient data measured after initial diagnosis. Our Specific Aims are: (AIM 1) to use a
novel 3-way linkage to establish an integrated shared database for LC (i.e., Oncoshare-Lung) using EHRs from
community-based and academic healthcare systems (with an ethnically diverse population with a high proportion
of Asian never smokers) linked to the California Cancer Registry (CCR) ; (AIM 2) to provide a set of clinical
decision tools for efficiently managing LC survivors by developing a novel statistical framework for predicting
dynamic SPLC risks by capturing data measured after IPLC diagnosis; and (AIM 3) to evaluate the feasibility
and utility of a novel causal inference method to assess efficient screening strategies for SPLC in LC survivors
using EHRs. We will apply a new causal inference method that explicitly emulates the target trials (hypothetical
randomized trials to answer the question of interest) in estimating the effects of continuing CT screening in long-
term LC survivors under varying eligibility criteria. We expect that the completion of this research will fill the
critical gaps in SPLC by providing: (1) clinical decision tools to assess individuals’ dynamic SPLC risks to identify
high-risk survivors for tailored surveillance, (2) new analytic pipelines to evaluate efficient screening criteria for
SPLC, and (3) a well-curated database for high-impact translational research for LC outcomes and surveillance
in an ethnically diverse population that provides a unique opportunity to examine critical questions in SPLC."

Dialysis, the mainstay of treatment for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), afflicts more than 800,000 in the US and has a 60% five-year mortality rate, more than that of many cancers and other chronic illnesses. ESKD is one of the starkest examples of racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare. Over 50% of individuals on dialysis are Black or Latino. And once on dialysis, Black and Latino patients are more likely to receive low quality care. While researchers have described these disparities in ESKD, there are notable gaps in the literature. First, most of the literature has not examined specific mechanisms contributing to these disparities or quantified their effects. For instance, although researchers have identified neighborhood-, provider-, and individual-level contributors to disparities, research examining their joint effect is limited. Second, researchers have not extensively examined these mechanisms at a regional level. Third, researchers have not attempted to project the impact of future policies or interventions aimed at ameliorating disparities in dialysis.
The proposed project will address these knowledge gaps. Using a national registry of all patients receiving dialysis in the US linked to Medicare claims, we will examine mechanisms that contribute to disparities in dialysis care. Aim 1 will assess the extent to which disparities occur at the neighborhood- and individual-level. A key innovation from this Aim is the evaluation of these mechanisms both within and between regional areas. Aim 2 will study an example of financial incentives that could potentially alleviate disparities: bonus payments to safety-net providers. We will use quasi-experimental methods to assess the effect of facilities losing or gaining these bonus payments.
This work is significant because it will inform researchers, healthcare providers, and policymakers about mechanisms that drive disparities in dialysis, which has disproportionately poor outcomes and which uniquely burdens racial and ethnic minorities. Additionally, we will examine whether financial incentives could alleviate these burdens. When completed, these Aims will guide researchers, healthcare providers, and policymakers to design future interventions and research studies with the goal of eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in dialysis."

Bacterial pathogens membrane proteins are important, and sometimes critical, to pathogenesis and, thus,
human health. Despite the importance of these proteins in regulating host interactions, they are less
understood than channels, transporters and GPCRs. The study of these proteins can, therefore, provide new
knowledge about membrane protein structure, function, and dynamics, as well as have impact on combatting
bacterial infections. These studies are particularly important because bacterial membrane proteins are frequent
targets of antibiotics for which resistance is a growing threat. This MIRA application outlines our recent
endeavors in understanding two bacterial membrane proteins: Opa and LspA, each of which is independently
important for bacterial proliferation in humans. The overall goal of this proposal is to determine how these
proteins look (beyond static structure), how they work, and how we can use this structure/function knowledge
to advance our understanding of bacterial pathogenesis and human health. The outer membrane Opa proteins
from Neisseria gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis bind various host receptors and induce bacterial engulfment
into human host cells. We have previously determined the monomeric structure of Opa60 and established that
Opa-reconstituted liposomes engage in receptor-mediated phagocytosis. Future directions focus on a
multidisciplinary approach to understanding the oligomeric structure of Opa60 and the Opa60-receptor complex.
In another avenue of research, we focus on LspA, a membrane-embedded signal peptidase that processes
essential lipoproteins in nearly all bacteria. Despite the relevance of LspA as a target for antibiotics, inhibitors
of LspA are currently unavailable in the clinic. Interactions between LspA and its substrate differ among
bacterial species, and we aim to investigate the structure and conformational changes of LspA with substrate
and investigate the molecular determinants for substrate selectivity. Finally, this proposal outlines an emerging
project that investigates bacterial membrane protein – lipid interactions. Bacterial inner membrane lipid
composition varies significantly between bacterial species and the hypothesis that membrane proteins evolve
and adapt to these lipid composition is tested.Results of the proposed aims will provide the molecular
determinants of (i) neisserial Opa – Opa and Opa – host receptor interactions, (ii) substrate binding and
recognition of LspA and (iii) membrane protein – lipid interactions. This knowledge will enhance our
understanding of host-pathogen interactions and aid in combatting infections associated with bacterial
pathogens."
10841821,"While American Indian (AI) persons have historically used wild or homegrown tobacco for spiritual purposes,
the use of commercially produced tobacco has risen dramatically. Today, smoking-related cancers are as much
as three fold higher among AI persons than White persons. Our preliminary data show that the odds of quitting
smoking among AI persons are 40% lower than White persons. Low engagement with smoking cessation
interventions is considered a major contributor to the disparity in cessation. NCI’s Smokefree program provides a
suite of evidence-based digital resources for smoking cessation, including a website (Smokefree.gov), text
program (Smokefree TXT), smartphone app (QuitGuide), and social media (Smokefree Facebook). These
resources facilitate interaction with one another, have wide reach, and have been shown to increase cessation
in the general population. However, we posit that Smokefree does not meet the needs and cultures of AI
persons and is unlikely to engage and maximize cessation in AI persons. For this reason, through engagement
with tribes and AI-serving clinics and nationally drawn community advisory boards, our team has conducted
preliminary studies to develop Smokefree TXT for Natives and QuitGuide for Natives. Our team also maintains
a social media page, Quit Connections, to provide a community for AI persons during their quit journey. These
culturally aligned resources incorporate Indigenous worldviews and strengths, respect tobacco for spiritual
purposes, integrate smoking triggers such as grief that are common to AI persons, and promote healing
through culture and community connectedness as part of the quit journey. Our next step is to determine to
what extent these culturally aligned resources, when packaged as Smokefree for Natives and supplemented
with a culturally aligned Smokefree.gov, increase smoking cessation among AI persons. Our central
hypothesis is that in AI persons who smoke (PWS) Smokefree for Natives will yield greater smoking
abstinence versus the non-tailored Smokefree. This proposal builds on longstanding collaborations and
employs mixed methodologies including Indigenous practices in engagement, a rigorous clinical trial, and
qualitative interviews. The aims are: Aim 1: To co-create a website, Smokefree.gov for Natives, which will
serve as the landing page for AI-aligned online cessation treatment content and facilitate access to a suite of
culturally aligned digital cessation resources for AI persons; Aim 2: To test the efficacy of Smokefree for
Natives via a remotely conducted randomized controlled trial among American Indian PWS (n=416); Aim 3: To
qualitatively assess perceptions of Smokefree for Natives among AI PWS (n=40) and thematic differences in
response based on demographics and geography. This proposal represents the braiding together of
Indigenous and Western research approaches and represents a logical progression of our engagement efforts
to date. Given that AI persons experience one of the most extreme smoking disparities, a scalable and
culturally aligned smoking cessation intervention for AI persons could have considerable public health impact."

Metabolites are central to orchestrating all cellular processes, yet functions of many metabolites remain
unknown. The predominant mode of metabolite action is regulating protein activities. Hence, one way to
understand a metabolite's role is to identify its protein targets.
 My research program investigates how organisms exploit metabolites to regulate protein activities and,
consequently, cellular processes by untargeted identification of protein-metabolite complexes. We are especially
interested in identifying enzyme-ligand pairings contributing to metabolic adaptations. I address this question
from the perspective of a biochemist and an expert in mass-spectrometry. To obtain a snapshot of the protein-
metabolite interactome in a single experiment, my group developed PROMIS; an original biochemical approach
that relies on the co-fractionation of proteins and associated small-molecule ligands. The protein-metabolite
interaction (PMI) networks are queried for novel regulatory interactions followed by in-detail functional analysis.
One of the key findings coming from our work is uncovering the role of proteinogenic dipeptides in the regulation
of central carbon metabolism in yeast and plants; specific dipeptides act at different points of flux control. These
findings represent just the tip of the iceberg considering the hundreds of metabolites present in PMI datasets
generated by my group and spanning four model organisms including gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli,
budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans.
 Over the next five years, the focus of my research program is to build on the experimental toolbox and
wealth of PMI data to uncover the evolutionary conservation of these PMI networks and to functionally
characterize previously unknown metabolite-protein pairings associated with processes essential to organismal
health. To address these goals, I will lead projects under three broad themes (1) assembly and validation of the
organism-specific and pan-organismal protein-metabolite interactome, (2) extending the analysis to the unknown
compounds present in the protein-complexes and introducing computational methods to predict PMIs and (3)
further functional characterization of the roles of dipeptides in regulating central carbon metabolism in
Arabidopsis.
 The knowledge gained over the next five years in the proposed projects will expand our understanding
of the regulatory roles of metabolites. The envisaged organism-specific and pan-organismal protein-metabolite
interactomes will provide a solid foundation for us and others to uncover novel small-molecule regulators and
their modes of action. Functional dissection of the dipeptide-enzyme interaction networks will contribute to the
mechanistic understanding of the central question in biology of how organisms remodel their metabolism to
changing environments. The outcome of my research may lead to innovation in the form of small molecule-based
strategies aimed at improving plant and animal health."

Abstract
 This project addresses a critical technology/software gap — the accessibility of ab initio quantum mechan-
ical molecular mechanical (QM/MM) multiscale modeling tools in the enzymology and bioimaging ﬁelds — by
developing machine-learning-based and physics-based electronic structure and molecular simulation methods.
In our R01 funding period, we made several methodological advances, especially (a) the ﬁrst !-learning poten-
tial for simulating the enzyme reaction free energy (as demonstrated with the modeling of chorismate mutase
catalysis), (b) an advance to the multiple time-step free energy simulation methodology, and (c) an analysis tool
for interpreting/predicting the substitution effect on chromophore emission wavelength based on chromophore-
substituent orbital interactions.
 Building on these method developments, we will further develop robust active-learning protocols for training
!-learning potentials for ground and excited electronic states for systems in the macromolecular or solvent en-
vironments. These !-learning potentials, when validated against advanced physics-based models, will enable
routine (a) enzyme reaction simulations and (b) optoacoustic and other bioimaging probe modeling in our lab and
the larger community.
 CRISPR-Cas proteins will be used as our primary test enzyme systems. We will employ the !-learning
potentials in molecular dynamics simulations and seek an atomistic understanding of (a) the effect of SpyCas9
conformational changes on HNH- and RuvC-domain catalyzed DNA cleavage activity, and (b) the mechanism of
AsCas12a and FnCas12a RuvC-domain catalyzed non-target strand DNA cleavage.
 For bioimaging probes, we will seek general guiding principles for designing optoacoustic imaging probes.
It will be achieved by performing ab initio-QM/MM-quality multiscale modeling to explore the impact of struc-
tural modiﬁcations (especially the attachment of halogen atoms and ﬂexible alkane chains) on the molecular
absorbance and nonradiative decay rate, both key factors in the optoacoustic signal generation."

the tibiotalar joint imposes new demands at the subtalar joint, which may exceed the limit of cartilage and result
in secondary OA. Most patients undergoing ankle fusion surgery have preoperative deformities in the alignment
of the tibiotalar and subtalar joints. Notably, 60% of all patients with ankle OA have varus malalignment of the
tibiotalar joint. Recently, it was discovered that the ipsilateral subtalar joint adopts ‘compensatory’ valgus
alignment in approximately half of those patients with varus-type ankle OA. Opposing varus-valgus deformities
tend to neutralize the overall alignment of the leg and hindfoot, making it appear normal on gross clinical
inspection. Unfortunately, while current surgical recommendations for ankle fusion provide clear guidance for
how to correct varus malalignment of the tibiotalar joint, they make no stipulation for compensatory valgus
alignment of subtalar joint. Results from our recently completed R21 project illustrate the potential for surgeons
to strategically align the ankle fusion to control for postoperative motion, joint space distance, and congruency
of the subtalar joint, which could in turn mediate secondary OA. Still, the specific effects of ankle fusion surgery
on the form and function of the subtalar joint have not been evaluated longitudinally in-vivo. Our broad goal is to
identify mechanical and structural factors that lead to inferior patient outcomes after ankle fusion. The R01
proposed herein addresses this goal through quantitative, longitudinal characterization of the effects of ankle
fusion surgery on the form and function of the subtalar joint in-vivo. Here, we take a focused, mechanistic look
at patients with varus ankle OA that are subdivided into two equal groups (with and without compensatory valgus
alignment of the subtalar joint; n = 24 per group). Guided by our preliminary data, we hypothesize that patients
with preoperative compensatory alignment of the subtalar joint are at greater risk of experiencing altered form-
function relationships and inferior outcomes at 24 months post ankle fusion surgery. Aim 1 will quantify how
ankle fusion changes the alignment and morphology of the subtalar joint from longitudinal statistical shape
models constructed from weight-bearing computed tomography scans. Aim 2 will quantify how ankle fusion
changes the in vivo kinematics of the subtalar joint during walking, stair ascent, and stair descent using dual
fluoroscopy. Aim 3 will synthesize these data to identify and isolate the role preoperative alignment of the subtalar
joint has on subtalar joint morphology, in vivo motion, and patient outcomes. If successful, this project will provide
the first and only mechanistic understanding of the effects of ankle fusion. We anticipate that completion of these
aims will also provide prerequisite information for us to pursue a future interventional study, where we would
evaluate whether accounting for valgus compensation at the time of surgery yields better outcomes."

The evidence to guide risk-benefit decisions for patients living with multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) is
limited. For example, patients with chronic kidney disease can benefit from tight blood pressure control but are
also at risk of adverse events – hypotension, falls, acute kidney injury (AKI) – making treatment difficult. Trials
exploring how best to treat patients with MCC including high blood pressure are being performed: A
collaborative approach to managing hypertension (HTN): COACH Collaboration-Oriented Approach to
Controlling High blood pressure (Dorr and Koopman) and Electronic Tools to Increase Recognition and
Improve Primary Care Management for Hypertension in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD; Samal and Dykes).
In this proposal, we will aggregate EHR data from multiple institutions into the eCarePlan, an application
intended to bring multiple data sources together for care planning using Fast Healthcare Interoperable
Resources (FHIR). These enhanced data sets will help us to quantify the ways that aggregating fragmented
data can improve clinical trial results and personalized decision making for older adults. We will then use this
dataset to better understand the risk of adverse events in these studies, like falls and AKI, as well as poor
clinical outcomes, like strokes and worsening cognitive function. We will proceed in accordance with
established steps of data harmonization. First, we will adapt and implement the eCarePlan tool to automatically
extract data needed for the two partner studies on HTN and CKD. We will focus on unrecognized chronic
conditions, partner study variables, partner study outcomes, health behaviors, social determinants of health,
and adverse event outcomes. We will use optical character recognition (OCR) and natural language
processing (NLP) to extract and harmonize data from electronic free text notes and scanned
documents.Second, we will harmonize data and refine the integration process using
Findability/Accessibility/Interoperability/Reusability (FAIR) and data readiness frameworks and engage patients
and providers to understand how these integrated studies can be matched to patient prognosis and needs.
Third, we will replicate measurement of study criteria and outcomes for both studies. We will provide the
resulting interoperable infrastructure openly for all."
10931495,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: PROJECT 2
Metastasis is the primary cause of cancer-related death. Our recent evidence establishes a new paradigm,
“lymph node tolerization,” in which the lymph node (LN) tissue environment creates a conditioned, systemic
metastatic state across tissues and organs. This proposal aims to identify and characterize unidentified
changes that create tolerize LNs, leading to the discovery of new biomarkers, drug targets, and treatment
strategies. Using a spatial systems biology approach that combines multiplexed in situ imaging with single-cell
RNA sequencing technologies, we will characterize tumor microenvironments across the host metastatic
ecosystem, in HNSCC and LUAD. We hypothesize that spatially resolved stromal-immune interactions in LNs
together with stromal-malignant properties in a primary tumor set the stage for metastasis. We will explore
mechanistic properties of these processes using organoid models of human-derived cells and mouse models.
In Aim 1, we will use using single-cell spatial proteomics to identify a pro-metastatic microenvironment in
uninvolved LNs of HNSCC and LUAD cancer patients by reconstructing and comparing spatially resolved
tumor-stroma-immune colocalization patterns of patient-derived uninvolved LNs, involved LNs, and primary
tumors. These analyses will compare cell types and cell-cell co-localization patterns in the tissue environments
of N0 and N+ patients. In addition, we will probe cell composition and colocalization patterns together with
extracellular matrix architecture to ascertain the role of ECM in establishing and maintaining the pro-metastatic
microenvironment in uninvolved LNs. In Aim 2, we will discover cell-cell interactions in uninvolved LNs that
predispose them to colonization by malignant cells by reconstructing and comparing cell-cell interactions
uninvolved LNs, involved LNs, and primary tumors inferred through integrative analysis of spatial information
with single-cell RNA-sequencing. We will develop novel biocomputational approaches to integrate spatial
features from CODEX with single cell RNA sequencing data to identify proximal cell-cell interactions among
tumor-stromal and stromal-immune cell types associated with LN metastases. We will then evaluate selected
cell-cell interactions in organoid models of human-derived cells, including perturbation with CRISPR-facilitated
gene editing to reveal mechanistic insights. In Aim 3, we will predict spatiotemporal progression in tumor-
stromal and stromal-immune colocalization patterns through spatially-aware Markov modeling and relate these
patterns to changes in human-derived LNs and primary tumors associated with metastatic progression. We will
build a spatially aware Markov model using spatially resolved time series data generated using tumor-stromal
and immune-stromal organoids generated from human-derived cells, to identify spatial motifs of tumor-stromal
and immune-stromal spatial patterning. This approach will illuminate spatiotemporal features of human LN
metastasis, toward defining mechanistic features of the metastatic cascade."

The Stanford CCSB is committed to advancing and promoting systems biology approaches to cancer research.
The Outreach Core will coordinate scientific outreach activities to disseminate to the cancer research and
broader communities our Center’s scientific and methodological advances in applying the principles of cancer
systems biology to the study of tumor-immune-stromal interactions in metastatic progression. We will work to
recruit involvement of diverse investigators, cancer biologists, and clinicians. We will also develop and implement
an evaluation process to assess the effectiveness of our proposed outreach activities. The specific aims of our
Outreach Core are: (1) disseminate advances in cancer systems biology to the cancer research and broader
communities, (2) promote the involvement of diverse and underrepresented cancer systems biology
investigators, cancer biologists, and clinicians enriching our environment with opportunities for exposure and
training and (3) develop and implement an evaluation strategy to assess our outreach activities. We will
disseminate our work through avenues including scientific publications, conferences, annual symposia, monthly
seminar series, workshops, think tank program, and an up-to-date website. We will continue to foster a fertile
environment for investigators from diverse and underrepresented groups. Opportunities will include monthly
seminars, enabling cross-training at participating consortia institutions, and encouraging attendance and abstract
submission to national conferences. We will partner with local and national efforts to promote diversity in
mentorship and participation in our outreach activities. We will expand our efforts to involve trainees at all points
within their career progression from high school onwards. Our pilot projects will also seek to advance
opportunities for less represented groups. Furthermore, we will develop and implement an evaluation strategy
to assess our outreach activities by soliciting responses from, CCSB members and non-members, and the

10931501,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY: BIOSPECIMEN AND DATA CORE
Our CCSB will dissect how interactions between malignant, stromal and immune cells in the primary tumor and
lymph nodes (LN) influence systemic immunity and facilitate distant metastasis, across multiple cancer types.
Accordingly, the goal of our Biospecimen and Data Core is to provide expertise and facilities for fresh and
archived specimen acquisition, genomic and image data processing, and sharing. This will ensure the provision
of high-quality, richly annotated datasets that serve the needs of our Research Projects in mouse and human;
to make them widely available to the CSBC and broader community; and to integrate them with external data
sources. We will perform the following aims to fulfill our Center goals: (1) We will develop a fresh tissue
biospecimen repository of human head and neck cancer (HNSCC) and lung cancer, as well as mouse models
of metastasis for single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and CODEX analysis. Human specimens including
matched primary tumor, LN and distant metastases (when available) from multiple tumor regions will be assigned
unique identifiers connecting them to human clinical annotations to develop and populate a HIPAA-compliant
REDcap database, while mouse specimens will be linked to detailed experimental information for cross-species
phenotypic validation and mechanism study. (2) We will construct TMAs of fixed primary, LN and distant
metastases with detailed clinical annotations in order to validate findings from our Research Projects on large
independent cohorts. Our TMAs will be constructed from treatment-naïve archived FFPE specimens for head
and neck cancer and lung cancer. The TMAs will consist of cores from primary tumors and uninvolved LNs from
LN-negative (N0) patients; primary tumors, involved and uninvolved LNs from LN-positive (N+) patients; and
distant metastases for a subset of LN-positive patients. Individuals’ tissues will be sampled at multiple locations.
The clinical follow-up (survival, occurrence of metastasis) will enable us to infer prognostic significance of our
work. (3) we will perform QC, processing, and basic analyses using existing robust pre-processing and analysis
pipelines for scRNA-seq, CODEX and IHC data. (4) we will leverage Center-generated data in the context of
larger publicly available cohorts. We will identify, curate, pre-process, and analyze public data relevant to the
Center’s aims, performing baseline meta-analysis of the relationship between gene expression data and
LN/distant metastasis which we can link to insights from our internally generated datasets. We will coordinate
with the broader CSBC to make data and analyses available, contribute to standardizing reporting of assay data,
and make computational tools widely available. Taken together, the centralization of the acquisition of single-cell
proteomic expression (CODEX), scRNA-seq, and spatial transcriptomic data for the two research projects in this
proposed BDC will allow studies that employ human and mouse specimens and mouse models to be carried out
in a reproducible, efficient, and consistent manner."

10862832,"Abstract
We aim to develop tools for ground-truth phantoms for quantitative and structural MRI (qMRI). qMRI aims to
acquire maps of physical or chemical variables that can be measured in physical units and compared between
tissue regions and among subjects. In contrast, most clinical MRI acquisitions are only qualitative, i.e. “weighted
images”, and not quantitative. While qMRI has the potential to improve precision diagnostics and medicine, it
has been traditionally hampered by significant barriers such as imaging speed, computational practicalities, and
reproducibility and repeatability of MR measurements. The variability between scanners and human subjects
and the lack of ground truth in biological tissues fundamentally challenge the development, testing and
standardization of qMRI techniques. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) hosted
workshops working towards standardizing qMRI. The resulting recommendation paper highlighted a list of
outstanding needs. The proposed project aims to address these unmet needs by developing materials,
technology, tools and processes for manufacturing quantitative anthropomorphic MRI phantoms. Current state-
of-the-art solutions for manufacturing MRI phantoms often use discrete compartments or geometrical shapes
filled with chemical solutions representing a single physical parameter. In contrast, our proposed novel approach
will enable fabrication of phantoms that truly mimic the contrast heterogeneity of tissue in 3D. These will include
proton density, T1, T2, T2* relaxation times, magnetic susceptibility, diffusion, fat fraction, air-tissue field-
inhomogeneity, relative conductivity, electric permittivity and magnetic permeability. If successful, this will be the
first time that such a comprehensive set of MRI parameters is accomplished in a tissue-mimicking phantom.
Based on our preliminary work on quantitative anatomy mimicking slice phantoms, we propose two approaches:
(a) Quantitative 3D stack of thin slices. This approach is inexpensive, easy to reproduce by labs with moderate
equipment and skills. (b) An advanced approach of boundaryless fully 3D phantoms that will be fabricated via
inkjet 3D printing of hydrogels and plastics and would enable true high resolution 3D structures with
heterogeneity that mimics human anatomy. In collaboration with leading industrial partners, we will validate and
disseminate our technology. Our proposal is motivated by a rising need for quantitative measurements in MRI
driven by precision medicine and the use of data science tools for biomarker discovery. With the rise of methods
such as fingerprinting, and accelerated reconstruction, quantitative MRI (qMRI) is closer to the clinics than ever.
The proposed quantitative MRI phantom will mimic the complexity of tissue structure and contrast mechanism
that are necessary to ensure the accuracy of qMRI. If successful, the project will greatly facilitate the development
and clinical translation of qMRI, making MRI accurate, precise, and quantitative – thus enabling precision
diagnostic and discoveries that will directly improve healthcare."
10729325,"Project Summary: Prenatal stress is pervasive and negatively impacts both the mother and the developing
fetus; exposed offspring bear an increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders including autism spectrum
disorder (ASD), anxiety, and depression. There is a converging line of evidence from our lab, and others, that
prenatal stress alters maternal commensal microbes in a manner that is essential in shaping neurodevelopment.
Indeed, there is a critical window in utero where neurodevelopment is both vulnerable to stress-induced
alterations in the intrauterine environment and able to benefit from intervention. However, how alterations in the
maternal intestinal microbiome are transmitted to the developing brain, contributing to behavioral alterations,
requires elucidation. We have exciting supporting and preliminary data suggesting that Tryptophan (Trp)
metabolism and transport is dysregulated in our model of prenatal stress. This is critical because bacterial
metabolism of tryptophan results in the production of key neuromodulatory metabolites. For example, higher
levels of 3-hydroxykynurinene has been implicated in aberrant brain development and inflammation, and indole
containing compounds, such as indole-3-acetic acid are beneficial. We have further identified that Parasutterella
excrementihominis (Pe), a Trp metabolizer, is significantly reduced in repeated experiments using our mouse
model of prenatal stress. We have exciting preliminary data demonstrating that replenishing Pe can restore key
aspects of neurodevelopment in offspring disrupted by prenatal stress, including social behavior and fetal
inflammation. Therefore, to further our understanding of the transduction of peripheral microbial signaling to the
developing brain, we will pursue our novel finding of dysregulated tryptophan metabolism following prenatal
stress by establishing the extent to which Pe treatment modulates fetal microglia and the behavioral effects of
prenatal stress. Next, we will delineate the interplay between Pe and Trp by determining how Trp availability
affects Pe ability to influence offspring neuroinflammation and social behavior. Finally, we will determine whether
Trp metabolites are sufficient to both cause and prevent the deleterious sequelae of prenatal stress using
intraamniotic injection (IAI). Thus, this R01 will test the highly novel, and integrative overarching hypothesis that
treatment with Pe restores the abundance of Trp metabolites, preventing the neuroinflammatory and behavioral
sequelae of prenatal stress and that the metabolites are sufficient to modulate neurodevelopment. This proposal
will address the following questions: 1) Does replenishing Parasutterella excrementihominis prevent stress-
induced increases in Trp, fetal neuroinflammation, and social behavior? 2) What is the interplay between
Parasutterella excrementihominis anti-inflammatory effects and Trp abundance? 3) Are prenatal stress effects
on neurodevelopment mediated through Trp metabolites?"

Malaria disease remains a serious public health problem. Progress in Malaria control has slowed
in recent years while resistance to frontline antimalarials is emerging in the most afflicted regions,
underscoring a pressing need for deciphering fundamental parasite biology to provide novel
therapeutic strategies. This obligate intracellular parasite exports a battery of effector proteins out
of a vacuolar niche to drastically remodel its host cell, a process that depends on the Plasmodium
Translocon of EXported proteins (PTEX). PTEX is built on a vacuole nutrient pore formed by
EXP2 which is further functionalized by the adaptor PTEX150 and AAA+ chaperone HSP101 to
form the effector translocon. PTEX has emerged as a novel drug target owing to its essential role
in blood stage parasite survival and disease pathogenesis but it is unknown how translocon cargo
is identified or how the complex is assembled and regulated to perform its function. Recent results
suggest HSP101 identifies export-destine cargo in the parasite ER and then brings it to the
vacuole where assembly into the PTEX complex stimulates HSP101’s unfolding activity to drive
membrane translocation into the erythrocyte. Importantly, while a similar export process is
expected to occur in the initial liver infection that establishes the blood stage, only EXP2 and
PTEX150 are present in the intrahepatic vacuole but not HSP101. This implies that PTEX
components mediate protein export into both erythrocytes and hepatocytes but that mechanistic
distinctions have evolved to meet the demands of subverting these remarkably different host cells.
In support of this, we recently determined that EXP2 is critical to intrahepatic parasite
development, clearly showing for the first time that PTEX components are also functional in the
liver stage vacuole. We hypothesize that EXP2/PTEX150 constitutes a minimal effector
translocon for vertebrate host cell subversion that is further adapted by HSP101 to meet
the unique demands on protein export to remodel the erythrocyte. This proposal will answer
key questions about the PTEX export mechanism to determine the basis for host cell subversion
and provide new targets to combat this devastating pathogen. Aim 1 will determine the basis for
PTEX cargo selection in the blood stage by dissecting the ER-localized function of HSP101 along
with the role of a newly discovered HSP101-interacting ER protein. Aim 2 will define features
required to form PTEX and identify the interaction that stimulates HSP101 unfolding activity in the
assembled translocon complex using a photoreactive unnatural amino acid crosslinking system.
Finally, Aim 3 will uncover the HSP101-independent function of EXP2/PTEX150 in the liver and
identify novel exported effectors that enable hepatocyte subversion to establish the blood stage."
10908645,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
More than 3.8 million women living in the United States have a history of invasive breast cancer, a majority of
whom are over age 65. With 15-year survival rates exceeding 80%, older breast cancer survivors are a
growing population with distinct health considerations relative to patterns of usual aging. Cancer survivors are
at an increased risk of age-related conditions, but little is known about the trajectories of aging that underlie
this elevated risk, or factors affecting the severity of decline. Evidence from preclinical models suggest cancer
treatment contributes to molecular and cellular changes consistent with aging that may underlie the later
emergence of functional decline. Frailty is highly prevalent in breast cancer patients and is associated with a
greater hazard of long-term morbidity and mortality. Epigenetic age acceleration is an indicator of biologic
aging that is influenced by cancer and its treatment, and also a strong predictor of healthspan and lifespan. We
hypothesize that cancer and its treatment will contribute to accelerated trajectories of functional and epigenetic
aging relative to women without a history of cancer, that these changes will be sustained long-term, and vary
by treatment type and intensity. To test these hypotheses, we will combine three decades of pre- and post-
diagnosis clinical, self-reported, and physiological data from post-menopausal women in the Women’s Health
Initiative (WHI), including annual assessments of functional status in over 9,000 breast cancer survivors
matched by age to cancer-free controls. We will estimate epigenetic age from blood samples collected at
multiple pre- and post-treatment time points in a subset of breast cancer survivors and ‘usual aging’ controls.
With this unique data and multidisciplinary team of relevant experts, we will conduct the first large study with
long-term, longitudinal measures of epigenetic and functional aging before and after breast cancer diagnosis
and treatment, addressing the following specific aims: 1) Characterize long-term trajectories of physical
function in breast cancer survivors (v. usual aging in controls) and test whether they are modified by the type
and intensity of cancer treatments; 2) Examine whether breast cancer and its treatment increase the rate of
epigenetic aging and whether this aging continues to accelerate after treatment; and 3) Test the relationship
between the rate of epigenetic aging and functional decline and how it may differ between breast cancer
survivors and usual aging controls. This work is a critical first step to characterize predictors of aging
trajectories among cancer survivors and identify those who could benefit from supportive interventions to
maximize healthspan in this rapidly growing population."

 Bone lesions from solid tumors such as breast, prostate, or kidney cancers, tumors originating in the bone
marrow such as multiple myeloma (MM), or other non-malignant musculoskeletal pathologies can occur
anywhere in the skeleton. These bone lesions cause pain and spinal cord compressions, leading to pathologic
fractures and paralysis, thereby diminishing the patient's quality of life. Current therapies rely on diagnosing
these bone lesions by whole-body X-ray or bone scans, which only identify them at advanced stages. While
whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WBMRI) is recommended for pretreatment assessment (e.g., in
MM), MRI is often limited to spine and pelvic regions in practice to minimize patient discomfort, compromised
image quality from geometric distortion, and high costs due to prolonged acquisition times. To address this
unmet clinical need, we developed a novel WBMRI technique: `Dual-Echo T2-weighted acquisition for
Enhanced Conspicuity of Tumors' (DETECT), for improved lesion visualization by simultaneously separating
the confounding signals of fat and fluid. Compared to WBMRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), single-
shot DETECT increased lesion detection (>40%) in considerably shorter scan times (<10 min) and without
image distortions. This method also improved robustness to motion in the thoracic and abdomen regions,
however, it suffers from image blurring due to T2-decay particularly in spine and extremities, limiting the
diagnostic performance. In the current proposal, we will address these limitations by developing the next-
generation WBMRI-DETECT using an efficient combination of single-shot and multi-shot acquisitions. DETECT
also generates fat signal for quantitative fat fraction (FF) maps that can be used as a prognostic biomarker in
MM, since tumor cells replace fat, a major constituent of bone marrow. This method also led us to develop a
DETECT-based DWI technique for accurate measurement of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). The specific
aims are: 1) To develop an integrated WBMRI using single-shot and multi-shot DETECT, along with
quantitative FF maps; 2) To develop a DETECT-based DWI with accurate ADC measurements; and 3) To
evaluate the integrated WBMRI, including DETECT-DWI and contrast-enhanced perfusion, for efficient bone
lesion detection and therapy response assessment. We will use bone lesions in MM as the proof-of-concept
disease to achieve these project goals. The successful outcome of this project will be an efficient WBMRI
protocol with accurate FF and ADC measures as imaging biomarkers, validated in detection and measuring
therapy response in MM patients. This WBMRI in combination with contrast-enhanced MRI including perfusion,
will be an excellent cost-effective and practical approach (<45 minutes of table time) for widespread use in
clinical practices across the world. This will benefit MM patients and patients suffering from other bone lesions,
including pediatric patients during long follow-ups, without the drawbacks of PET/CT. This will provide relevant
clinical information for treatment decisions to positively impact patients' quality of life and overall survival."

Severe social impairment is a shared symptom of many neuropsychiatric illnesses. In particular, deficits in the
ability to recognize and remember previously encountered individuals—often called social memory—can
significantly compromise an individual’s ability to form and maintain social relationships, dramatically reducing
quality of life. Among the brain regions associated with social impairment, the hippocampus is notable due to its
essential role in social memory and its exceptional structural plasticity, including the continuous generation of
new neurons in the dentate gyrus throughout adulthood. Harnessing naturally occurring structural plasticity in
the hippocampus may be a valuable approach for stimulating neural circuits and restoring social memory
function. Thus, the goal of this R01 proposal is to uncover the contribution of hippocampal structural plasticity to
social memory circuits. Our published work demonstrated that adult-born neurons in the dentate gyrus are
necessary for consolidating and/recalling social memories for conspecifics. Yet, the extent to which adult-born
neurons are recruited to social memory traces and contribute selectively to social memory processes is
undetermined. Adult-born neurons form multiple cellular connections within the hippocampus, including with CA2
neurons. While largely understudied, the CA2 region of the hippocampus has emerged as a critical hub for social
memory function. We do not know whether adult-born neurons influence social memory circuits and function via
their connections with CA2. In our preliminary studies using a mouse model of social dysfunction, the Shank3B
KO mouse, we found impaired social memory along with hippocampal aberrations, including fewer adult-born
neurons and diminished afferents from adult-born neurons to CA2 compared to wild-type littermates. We then
used chemogenetics to activate CA2 neurons and the CA2-to-ventral CA1 pathway and were able to rescue
social memory dysfunction in Shank3B KO mice, suggesting this circuitry as a pivotal intervention point for
improving function. Here, we propose to use transgenic, chemogenetic, and pharmacologic manipulations
combined with behavioral, histological, and in vivo electrophysiological analyses to test the hypothesis that
afferent innervation of CA2 by adult-born neurons is critical in regulating social memory function, and
that targeting this circuitry can alleviate social memory dysfunction. Specifically, we will elucidate the
preferential recruitment of adult-born neurons to social memory engrams and their selective contribution to social
memory function (Aim 1), identify the influence of adult-born neuron afferents to CA2 on CA2 oscillatory activity
and social memory function (Aim 2), and explore enhancing hippocampal adult-born neuron circuitry to improve
social memory deficits in Shank3B KO mouse (Aim 3). These studies will provide a mechanistic understanding
of how adult-born neurons impact social memory circuits and function with the long-term goal of transforming
how we approach alleviating social symptoms in patients with neuropsychiatric illnesses."

Myotonic dystrophy is the second most common cause of muscular dystrophy and the most common cause
of adult onset muscular dystrophy. The primary cause of disease mortality is progressive skeletal muscle
weakness and wasting. The long term goal of this project is to determine the mechanisms that cause skeletal
muscle pathogenesis in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). DM1 is an autosomal dominant disease caused by
a CTG repeat expansion in the 3’ untranslated region of the DMPK gene. The molecular basis for the disease
is a toxic gain of function of the RNA containing expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp RNA) that is transcribed
from the mutant allele. CUGexp RNA accumulates in nuclear RNA foci and causes loss of function of
Muscleblind like (MBNL) RNA binding proteins that are sequestered on CUGexp RNA within the nuclear foci.
CUGexp RNA also induces upregulation of CELF1 protein that has been shown to be toxic to skeletal
muscle. MBNL and CELF1 proteins regulate alternative splicing transitions of a large number of genes during
skeletal muscle postnatal development. Their altered functions in DM1 skeletal muscle causes misregulated
alternative splicing and inappropriate expression of fetal protein isoforms in adult skeletal muscle that leads to
disease features. While the basis for MBNL loss of function has been established, the mechanisms causing
CELF1 upregulation in skeletal muscle are unknown. We find that Mbnl1/Mbnl2 double knockout in adult
mouse skeletal muscle results in CELF1 protein upregulation, indicating a mechanistic link between MBNL
loss of function and increased CELF1 activity. We also established a transgenic mouse model for DM1 in
which skeletal muscle specific expression of a human DMPK mRNA containing expanded CUG repeats
reproduces DM1 features including CELF1 upregulation. The goals of this proposal are to determine the
molecular mechanisms of CELF1 upregulation in response to Mbnl1/Mbnl2 double knockout and expression
of the toxic CUGexp RNA and to determine the contributions of CELF1 upregulation to skeletal muscle
pathogenesis caused by MBNL loss of function and CUGexp RNA."
10907740,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A significant number of individuals struggle to maintain sobriety as a result of withdrawal symptoms that emerge
during early abstinence from alcohol. Despite this, pharmacotherapeutics for the treatment of withdrawal are
lacking, at least in part, due to poor understanding of the mechanisms underlying symptoms of withdrawal. The
rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) is a GABAergic region that exerts inhibitory control over midbrain
bioaminergic and cholinergic nuclei. Recently, work from our lab revealed significantly enhanced cFos
expression, a marker of recent neuronal activity, in the RMTg of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposed rats
12 hours into acute withdrawal. In addition, we showed that pharmacological inhibition of the RMTg attenuates
withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behavior. However, the precise neural circuits that drive this putative RMTg
hyperactivity is unknown. The lateral habenula (LHb) provides dense glutamatergic input to the RMTg and
exhibits significant functional overlap with the RMTg. In addition, our preliminary data reveals a significant
increase in cFos expression in RMTg-projecting lateral habenula (LHb) neurons during acute withdrawal.
Together, these data lead us to hypothesize that LHb inputs to the RMTg play a mechanistic role in regulating
symptoms of withdrawal from chronic ethanol exposure. Experiments in the current proposal are designed to
test this hypothesis by using in vivo chemogenetics to bidirectionally and selectively manipulate LHb-RMTg
activity during behavioral tests of withdrawal symptoms including anxiety-like behavior, mechanical pain
sensitivity, and impulsive choice. Additional work will use ex vivo slice electrophysiology to explore the
physiological neuroadaptations that occur in this circuitry during withdrawal from chronic ethanol exposure.
Findings from these experiments will shed new light onto the role of this neural circuit in regulating symptoms of
withdrawal and by extension have the potential to uncover new neurobiological targets for the treatment of
alcohol use disorder."

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an incurable non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and despite intensive therapeutic
approaches, the median progression-free survival after first-line treatment is four years. The emergence of
chemoresistance is rapid, durable responses to second and third-line therapies are rare, and relapse is virtually
universal in MCL. Cell cycle dysregulation, primarily by upregulation of E2F1 target genes, is a hallmark of MCL.
We identified a novel role of Fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1) in MCL survival and regulating cell
cycle-dependent processes primarily by inhibiting E2F1 mediated transactivation. We show that FGFR1 and not
other homologs are overexpressed in MCL patients, and its expression is associated with a poor prognosis.
Functionally, genetic ablation of FGFR1 or pharmacological targeting with erdafitinib, a selective small molecule
targeting FGFRs, induced cell cycle arrest, cell death in-vitro, reduced tumor formation, and improved overall
survival in-vivo. Mechanistically, we show that FGFR1 positively regulates E2F1-mediated transactivation of its
target gene through cMYC/EZH2/CDKN1C axis, contributing to cell survival. Hence, we hypothesize that the
FGFR1 signaling pathway is a critical modulator of cell survival and represents a novel and attractive candidate
for targeted therapy for patients with relapsed MCL. In this proposal, we will dissect the mechanisms by which
FGFR1 impacts MCL survival and perform preclinical studies using erdafitinib as a therapy to prevent and treat
MCL through the following specific aims: SA1: To characterize the role of FGFR1 in MCL survival in-vitro and in-
vivo mouse models of MCL. In this aim, we will investigate a) FGFR1's role in regulating E2F1 mediated
transactivation of target genes and survival in-vivo, b) the role of CDKN1C in regulating E2F1 dependent
transactivation program, c) the role of E2F1 target gene CDK1, to positively regulates cMYC stability and
constitute a feedback loop and d) identify mechanism-based combination strategies to maximize the therapeutic
potential of FGFR1 inhibition. SA2:To conduct a preclinical investigation of inhibition of FGFR1 using patient-
derived xenograft (PDX) murine models and a primary genetic murine model of MCL. We will conduct a
preclinical trial of erdafitinib using PDX and murine models of MCL to identify a) the doses of erdafitinib that
induce efficient inhibtion of FGFR1 signaling and downstream target gene expression without unacceptable
toxicity and b) the best dose and schedule of erdafitinib resulting in maximum clinical efficacy alone and c) in
combination with an ibrutinib. SA3: We will perform a retrospective analysis on tissue biopsies from relapsed
MCL patients to a) analyze the effects of FGFR1 protein and its associated clinical outcomes and b) analyze the
correlation between FGFR1 protein and, its activation, downstream effectors in patients with relapsed/refractory
MCL. Impact: Our proposal will establish the role of FGFR1 in regulating E2F1 dependent transactivation
program in MCL and provide a robust preclinical assessment by evaluating the toxicity, exposure, and efficacy
of erdafitnib in preclinical models of MCL to translate FGFR1 inhibitor erdafitinib to treat MCL in clinics."

During chromosome segregation, each daughter cell receives a complete complement of the genome, and this
is repeated for every cell division. Therefore, chromosome segregation must be extraordinarily accurate and
robust to ensure the health of an adult human; otherwise, disasters like cancers can occur. Cancer cells exploit
and rewire their chromosome segregation machinery to meet their insatiable need of uncontrolled cell division.
Successful chemotherapeutic drugs kill cancer cells through disrupting this obligate need. Thus, understanding
mechanisms of chromosome segregation has far-reaching implications to human health.
Kinetochores execute chromosome segregation by connecting chromosomal centromeres to spindle
microtubules. This connection must be flexible to accommodate the fleeting passage of the DNA polymerases
that replicate centromeres during the S phase; it must also be strong to withstand the pulling force of spindle
microtubules during mitosis. Cells coordinate these opposing attributes of kinetochores temporally and regulate
the transition between them. Because kinetochores and their associated regulators are highly conserved among
the eukaryotic kingdoms of life, we will use the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a primary research organism
to study how kinetochores are assembled. The central hypothesis is that kinetochore assembly is a highly
cooperative process that involves multiple protein-protein and protein-DNA contacts, which are controlled by cell
cycle signals. To understand how kinetochores are assembled, Specific Aim 1 will apply a quantitative
proteomics platform to define the steps of kinetochore assembly; making use of stable isotope based mass
spectrometry (MS) to analyze native kinetochores as well as reconstituted kinetochores assembled from
concentrated cell extracts. Two key interfaces govern kinetochore assembly: the first one is between
centromeres and inner kinetochores, while the second one is between inner and outer kinetochores. Specific
Aim 2 will probe the centromere-inner kinetochore interface and focus on how phosphorylation of specific inner
kinetochore components may regulate it. Specific Aim 3 will dissect the inner-outer kinetochore interface and
study its cell cycle control with an ultimate goal of reconstituting the kinetochore that retains its physiological
properties. All together, these studies are aimed at understanding how kinetochores are assembled.
Understanding kinetochore assembly has broad relevance, because the rules and methods of study apply to all
systems in which signals are integrated to control macromolecular assemblies. Our collaborative team, equipped
with interdisciplinary expertise and shared interest in kinetochore biology, is uniquely qualified to carry out the
proposed projects and to make impactful advance in this area of considerable biomedical significance."

 The development of cancer immunotherapy including immune checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive cell transfer
(ACT)-based therapies revolutionized cancer treatment. The success, however, is limited to a relatively small
subset of patients and cancer types. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a central role in maintaining immune system
homeostasis and negatively regulate immune-mediated inflammation such as autoimmune diseases, asthma
and allergy. However, tumor infiltrating Tregs also suppress effective anti-tumor immunity. FOXP3 is a master
regulator of Treg development and function. Human FOXP3 gene encodes two major isoforms through mRNA
alternative splicing – a long full-length isoform (FOXP3L) and a shorter isoform lacking exon 2 region (FOXP3S).
To study the function of FOXP3S in Tregs, we generated a Foxp3S mouse line expressing only the Foxp3S
isoform. Our preliminary studies with orthotopic mouse breast tumor models demonstrate that the Foxp3S mice
are completely resistant to tumor development, while the littermate wildtype mice expressing Foxp3L exhibit
significant tumor growth. Intratumoral injection of Foxp3S-promoting morpholino drug (MO) into the breast
tumors in wildtype mice markedly increases IFN-γ+ CD4 and CD8 T cells in the tumors and thus suppresses
tumor growth. Interestingly, bioinformatics analysis of transcriptomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) reveals that FOXP3S mRNA expression in human breast cancer is positively correlated with clinical
outcomes. Given that over 60% of tumor-infiltrating CD4 T cells are Tregs and the most dominant TCRs from
intratumoral Tregs were tumor-reactive and recognize specific tumor neoantigens, we hypothesize that
promoting FOXP3S isoform expression will reprogram tumor-reactive Tregs and convert these immune
suppressive Tregs to tumor-specific T helpers thus promoting antitumor immunity. We propose to use unique
mouse lines, FOXP3S-promoting morpholinos and patient-derived organoids to test our hypothesis. We will
determine the mechanisms for FOXP3S-mediated antitumor immunity and further define the efficacy of FOXP3S-
promoting morpholinos in breast cancer treatment. Successful completion of this study will identify a novel
therapeutic strategy for breast cancer immunotherapy."
10889251,"Summary of Work
 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are one of the largest group of therapeutic targets in
cardiovascular disease. Ligands for GPCRs are characterized as agonists: those that stabilize
a receptor conformation that promote activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins to generate
second-messenger signaling; or antagonists such as β-blockers that block such activation.
While β-blockers are standard of therapy in heart failure, there is evidence for a positive
relationship between higher β-blocker dose and improved clinical outcomes. However,
achieving a maximal dose is often difficult due to the development of intolerable adverse effects.
Thus developing novel ligands that have improved efficacy and reduced untoward effects is a
huge unmet need.
 Studies over the past 2 decades, in a large part from investigators on this proposal, have
shown that orthosteric ligands, i.e. the binding site of the endogenous ligand, stabilize distinct
active receptor conformations to selectively engage either G-protein or β-arrestin, to induce
distinct signaling pathways. This concept of orthosteric ligand-dependent transducer selectivity
is known as biased signaling and has been shown to activate cardioprotective pathways. While
the majority of GPCR ligands target orthosteric binding sites, an emerging area of receptor
biology and drug development is the identification of ligands that bind to allosteric, or
topographically distinct, sites on receptors. Allosteric ligands that potentiate activity of
orthosteric agonists are termed positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), while those that
noncompetitively decrease the activity of orthosteric agonists are termed negative allosteric
modulators (NAMs). It is now apparent that allosteric ligands may offer great benefit as
therapeutics because of enhanced receptor specificity and efficacy.
 The objective of this R01 renewal is to identify, characterize, and translate newly identified
allosteric modulators on the β1 adrenergic receptor (β1AR) from our recently performed DNA-
encoded library (DEL) screen of 1 billion unique chemical entities with the ultimate goal of
identifying β-arrestin biased PAMs. To accomplish this ambitious goal, I have assembled a
team of experts in GPCR biology and organic chemistry that are known for innovative,
paradigm-shifting research. I propose the following specific aims."
10876342,"Summary: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disease that affects millions of people worldwide, with
significant morbidity and a median life expectancy in the mid-forties. Although SCD can be cured by allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT), this treatment strategy has substantial limitations and is
only available to ~15% of patients. CRISPR/Cas9 based genome-editing strategies for treating SCD have been
developed by either correcting the sickle mutation in β-globin (HBB) gene or disrupting the BCL11A erythroid
enhancer in patients’ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Multiple clinical trials using gene
editing strategies have received FDA approval, and the Phase 1 clinical trial (NCT03745287) by Vertex
Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics has shown promise. We have discovered recently that
CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing can induce unintended large gene modifications, such as large deletions,
insertions and complex local rearrangements, at the Cas9 on-target cut-site. Our results show that large
deletions of up to several thousand bases occurred with high frequencies at/near the Cas9 on-target cut-sites
on the HBB (11.7-35.4%), HBG (14.3%), and BCL11A (13.2%) genes respectively in HSPCs from patients with
SCD. However, the persistence and biological consequences of these large gene modifications are largely
unknown, the mechanisms of generating large deletions and insertions remain elusive, and no method is
available to reduce the unwanted large gene modifications. There is an unmet need to determine the clinical
implications of the unintended large gene modifications in gene-edited SCD HSPCs. The central hypothesis of
the proposed research is that a good understanding of the persistence and functional consequences of
unintended large gene modifications and the ability to control them will increase the efficacy and safety of
gene-editing based treatment of SCD. In Aim 1 studies we will determine the ineffective maturation and HbF
induction due to large gene modification in gene edited SCD HSPCs by performing SMRT-seq and single-cell
RNA analysis. In Aim 2 we will determine the persistence of large gene modifications in HBB and BCL11A
alleles after engraftment of gene-edited SCD HSPCs into mice and patients undergoing CRISPR/Cas9 gene-
editing based SCD clinical trials. In Aim 3 we will develop strategies to minimize the detrimental large deletions
by establishing a better understanding of the competition between different DNA damage repair pathways and
designing and optimizing ssODN templates and short gRNAs as blockers. These studies will address an unmet
need in the therapeutic genome editing field and facilitate the translation of genome editing based SCD
treatment into clinical practice."

Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) surgeries are among the most common elective surgeries in the US and projected
to increase in frequency. Recent TJA clinical practices have effectively reduced post-operative hospital length of
stay, yet despite improvements in the efficiency of TJA care, the effects of TJA surgical procedures on pulmonary
and respiratory muscle function are less widely appreciated. Even during surgeries as short as TJA, the
administration of anesthesia, neuromuscular inactivity, and mechanical ventilation acutely deteriorate pulmonary
function and trigger rapid, significant proteolysis of the primary inspiratory muscle, the diaphragm. However,
conventional TJA preoperative care does not conventionally address these issues. Older adults, smokers, and
those with significant pre-existing lung disease, multiple medical comorbidities, or socioeconomic disadvantage
face the greatest risk for declines in post-operative pulmonary and respiratory neuromuscular function. Most
patients who utilize our urban safety-net academic medical center have at least one of these risk factors, which
can interfere with acute rehabilitation, increase the risk for post-operative pulmonary complications, and extend
hospital length of stay. Thus, we propose a clinical study of preoperative inspiratory muscle training (IMT) among
individuals with increased risk for pulmonary post-operative complications. Preoperative IMT has been shown to
counteract post-operative inspiratory weakness and reduce postoperative pulmonary complications following
prolonged cardiac surgeries, but its potential benefits have not been investigated in shorter surgeries such as
TJA, with expected brief post-operative hospitalizations.
The central hypothesis of this project is that preoperative IMT is feasible and will improve respiratory
strength, hasten the early postoperative respiratory recovery, and optimize functional mobility for
hospital discharge. Adults scheduled for TJA with pre-existing respiratory muscle or lung impairment will be
randomized to complete either: daily IMT in advance of surgery (dIMT), a single acute IMT session immediately
before surgery (aIMT), or usual surgical standard of care (SOC). Follow-up testing on the day of surgery and
during the acute post-operative hospitalization will identify the feasibility of IMT (Aim 1), distinguish IMT effects
on inspiratory and cough strength, (Aim 2), and evaluate patient readiness for discharge (Aim 3). This high risk,
proof-of-principle proposal will provide the first controlled evidence concerning disturbances in the regulatory
functions of breathing following TJA. Our plan is that data generated from this study will form the basis for future
mechanistic studies of IMT to restore breathing strength and further optimize early rehabilitation following TJA."

According to the American Cancer Society, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in men
and women. Outside of the sex-specific cancers, lung cancer and melanoma have the greatest sex disparity,
though the exact mechanisms behind these differences are not well understood. In the United States, men have
a higher lifetime risk of developing lung cancer and are more likely to develop severe disease than women.
Additionally, there are sex disparities in responses to treatment, such as men having better responses to
immunotherapies over women. There are multiple factors contributing to this sex disparity including lifestyle
choices, sex hormones, and differences in immune response. Our preliminary data shows that two mouse tumors
models of lung cancer, CMT-167 and Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC), two models of non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC), grow slower in female than in male mice. This sex difference is dependent on the ovary as tumors in
ovariectomized female mice grow equivalent to those in male mice. Innate immune cells (macrophages and NK
cells) and more specifically NKG2D receptor activity are required for reduced tumor growth in females. Multi-
parameter flow cytometry analysis shows significant sex differences in NSCLC tumor resident innate immune
cells. We show that these sex-disparities extend to several chemotherapy and anti-PDL1 immunotherapy
treatments. In preliminary in vivo data we show that the sex-disparity in NSCLC tumor growth and the response
to chemotherapy requires NK cells. Ex vivo NK cell killing assays show that preincubation of NSCLC cells with
female serum, but not male serum or serum from ovariectomized females, stimulates enhanced NK cell activity
utilizing the secreted pro-apoptotic factor TRAIL. This ex vivo NK cell assay provides a means to identify bioactive
molecules. Based upon this preliminary data, we propose two Aims for our future studies. Aim 1 we will
fractionate serum from female mice to identify a biological molecule from female serum required for LLC and
CMT-167 sensitization to NK cell killing via TRAIL. The sensitization of LLC and CMT-167 tumor cells in female
mice to the effects of TRAIL are proposed to contribute to the observed sex–differences in tumor growth and
sensitivity to therapies (both chemotherapy and immunotherapy). For Aim 2, we will determine if the response
to standard of care chemotherapies or anti-PD1 immunotherapy using orthotopic CMT-167 and LLC tumor
models is dependent on sex. If a sex difference in response is observed, we will characterize the immune
responses of male and female mice to lung tumors in the context of these drugs. In summary, this project aims
to gain an understanding of the biological mechanisms behind the sex disparities in NSCLC progression and
response to treatment, with the hopes of gaining knowledge to inform clinic decisions and treatment of the human
disease."

Millions of women in the United States have a criminal record. Women with criminal records have high rates of
behavioral health concerns, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depressive symptoms, substance
use problems, and suicidal ideation and attempts. They also experience some of the highest rates of
interpersonal violence, including intimate partner violence and sexual assault, which are associated with and
exacerbate women’s behavioral health concerns. In addition, they have low rates of receipt of needed behavioral
health treatment and supportive services, such as victimization services. These gaps in care may be driven by
dynamics of collateral consequences, i.e., forms of exclusion from resources, services, and opportunities due to
the presence of a criminal record. Research is critically needed to address the growing behavioral health
inequities for women with criminal records and to improve women’s help-seeking and help-attainment for needed
behavioral health care and services. This proposed mixed-methods study builds upon existing empirical work
and a theoretically driven framework of help-attainment. We will examine how behavioral health, interpersonal
victimization, and collateral consequences shape help-seeking and help-attainment processes for treatment and
services among adult women with criminal records. Our proposed study will utilize an exploratory sequential
mixed-methods design in which findings from the first, quantitative phase will inform the design of a second,
qualitative phase, with both phases informing the third qualitative phase. In Phase I, N=500 women ages 25 to
54 with criminal records will be recruited to complete a web-based survey. Our survey will include measures of
behavioral health concerns, victimization experiences, and theory-guided measures regarding dynamics of
collateral consequences and help-seeking and help-attainment for behavioral health needs. These data will be
used to identify patterns in domains influencing women’s help-seeking and help-attainment. In Phase II, we will
conduct individual interviews using the life history calendar with N=40 women with criminal records, a stratified
purposeful sub-sample of women who completed the Phase 1 survey. We will explore women’s trajectories of
help-seeking and help-attainment, including dynamics of collateral consequences. Our findings from Phase I and
II will inform our interviews with service providers in Phase III. We will conduct semi-structured interviews with
N=30 service providers who work in treatment and service settings with women with criminal records. We will
elucidate their perspectives of organizational and provider-based barriers and facilitators that impact women’s
help-seeking and help-attainment processes. The collective findings will identify novel facilitators to help-
attainment and intervention directions to improve the behavioral health and wellbeing of women with criminal
records."

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the primary cause of premature death worldwide, and risk factors such as
insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes are increasing in prevalence. Therefore, more effective preventive
interventions to improve cardiometabolic health are urgently needed. Circulating branched-chain amino acids
(BCAA) are strong predictors of type 2 diabetes and CVD. Furthermore, experimental and genetic studies
indicate that BCAA overload has adverse cardiometabolic effects. Thus, BCAA levels may be novel targets for
preventive interventions. In addition, BCAA levels of individuals may inform personalized interventions.
Evidence is accumulating that diet composition, physical activity, and weight loss can reduce plasma BCAA
levels by affecting the dietary supply, gut microbiota production, or catabolism of BCAA. However, evidence on
the impact of lifestyle factors on BCAA levels is mainly based on small experimental studies and cross-
sectional studies. Larger trials and longitudinal studies are crucial to determine whether lifestyle
exposures can substantially affect BCAA levels. Furthermore, research on the health consequences of
BCAA levels has focused chiefly on the impact of BCAA levels on glucose metabolism, but adverse effects on
other CVD risk factors such as inflammation, blood pressure, and dyslipidemia are plausible. The PREMIER
study is a randomized trial of the impact of behavioral lifestyle interventions on CVD risk factors with detailed
information on diet and physical activity based on interviews and biological measurements. We will measure
serum BCAA and other metabolites using targeted quantitative NMR metabolomics in serum samples of 729
participants at baseline and after six months of lifestyle interventions. Our specific aims are as follows: 1). To
assess the impact of the randomized lifestyle interventions on circulating BCAA levels over six
months. We will evaluate the effect of the ‘established lifestyle intervention,’ including weight loss and
increases in physical activity, and the effect of the intervention with added counseling to improve dietary
patterns as compared with the control arm. 2). To evaluate specific dietary factors, physical activity, and
changes in adiposity in relation to BCAA changes. We will examine changes in physical activity, fitness,
protein and BCAA intakes, and healthy plant-based dietary patterns. 3). To evaluate whether changes in
BCAA levels affect cardio-metabolic risk factors, including blood lipid profiles, blood pressure, and
markers of inflammation and insulin sensitivity. We will also estimate the proportion of the effects of
lifestyle changes on cardiovascular risk factors explained by reductions in BCAA levels. Our findings may
inform dietary and lifestyle recommendations that consider the impact on BCAA levels."

With our expected lifespans increasing, the rapidly expanding aging population is bringing an increased
prevalence of dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). However,
there are still no neuroprotective medicines for treating patients with these conditions. AD and VCI are the most
common types of dementia and impose a huge socioeconomic burden as well as devastating impacts on the
lives of patients and their caregivers. Both of these forms of dementia are characterized by deterioration of the
neurovascular unit that forms the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which in many cases even precedes the onset of
cognitive deficits. Unfortunately, however, the mechanisms of BBB deterioration in AD and VCI are unclear. As
a result, there are no therapies to protect the BBB. In my thesis work, I have established that the prostaglandin
degrading enzyme 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) is pathologically elevated in both
human AD and VCI in human patients. I have also shown that the enzymatic activity of 15-PGDH in the brain is
increased in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD, as well as normal aging. Importantly, I have established that
pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of 15-PGDH in 5xFAD mice shows robust protection against BBB
deterioration and other AD-related pathology, including cognitive deficits, impaired neurogenesis, and axon
degeneration, independently of amyloid β pathology. I have also found that of the prostaglandins, prostaglandin
D2 (PGD2) is most prominently elevated in the brain by 15-PGDH inhibition in 5xFAD mice. Therefore, I
hypothesize that PGD2 is responsible for 15-PGDH inhibition-mediated protection of the BBB, and that this is
related to improved endothelial cell barrier function. During the F99 portion of my proposal, I will evaluate whether
15-PGDH inhibition also protects from BBB deterioration in the high fat diet mouse model of VCI. I will utilize
innovative 2-photon microscopy in vivo imaging and electron microscopy to determine the trajectory of BBB
deterioration, as well as test the protective efficacy of 15-PGDH inhibition. I will also determine whether PGD2
mediates the protective effect both in vivo and in vitro, as previous literature suggests a role of PGD2 in
increasing endothelial cell barrier function. During the K00 phase, I will expand my BBB research by investigating
the interaction between perivascular macrophages (PVMs) and endothelial cells in the brain in Dr. Chenghua
Gu’s laboratory. I will utilize an innovative cre-recombinase system to specifically target PVMs in the brain and
investigate altered glucose metabolism in PVMs and transcriptomic profiling in both PVMs and endothelial cells,
as a function of AD-related risk factors. Then, I will test how this altered metabolism in PVMs interacts with
endothelial cells to initiate BBB deterioration. Successful completion of this study will provide new perspectives
of how the BBB deteriorates with aging and dementia-related pathology, which will enable the discovery and
development of new neuroprotective approaches for patients suffering from AD and VCI."

10890183,"Project Summary/Abstract
PRMT5 is an arginine methyltransferase with key roles in cancer. The gene has pleiotropic functions ranging
from gene regulation and development to modulation of DNA double strand break (DSBs) repair. In S-phase and
mitosis, DSBs are repaired primarily by homologous recombination (HR) a process in which missing genetic
information is copied from another undamaged chromosomal region. In humans, error-free HR is mediated by
BRCA1, BRCA2 and RAD51. RAD52, an accessory gene, facilitates an error-prone HR sub-pathway that can
produce intrachromosomal deletions (ICDs). PRMT5 appears to modulate chromatin remodeling at the DSB
through the error-free BRCA1/2-RAD51 pathway.
In fission yeast (S. pombe), we identified physical and genetic interactions between PRMT5 and RAD52. Deletion
of PRMT5 increases the frequency of ICDs while deletion of RAD52 decreases ICDs suggesting that they have
opposite functions. In cancer cells PRMT5 mutations increases the size of ICDs. Using artificial intelligence
algorithms, we discovered multiple likely pathogenic mutations including three driver mutations in the active
site of PRMT5 that are likely to destabilize the function of the enzyme.
 We hypothesize that PRMT5 inhibits ICDs by biasing repair of DNA double strand breaks
 toward conservative pathways.
We developed innovative in vivo assays to probe HR repair mechanisms that produce ICDs. The repair
mechanisms and factors involved are conserved from yeast to humans making the S. pombe model system highly
tractable. A homology analysis reveals that all identified human mutated residues are present in yeast.
In Aim1 we will place PRMT5 in the DNA damage repair epistatic pathway using mutational analysis and
sensitivity to various DNA damage drugs. Additionally, we will employ in vivo repair assays to understand the
HR pathways by which ICDs are produced in the absence of the PRMT5 function. In Aim 2 we will analyze
PRMT5 mutations identified in cancer cells using the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC). We
will employ modeling techniques and enzymatic assays to test how these mutations affect the enzymatic function
of PRMT5 and DSB repair. Most of these mutations are conserved in yeast making this analysis tractable. The
findings will be further validated in human cells."
10861918,"Immunoglobulin superfamily member 10 (IGSF10) is a large, secreted protein implicated in multiple biological
and pathological processes: IGSF10 mutations are associated with hereditary delayed puberty. Low IGSF10
expression is linked to more aggressive lung and breast cancers. A frameshift mutation in IGSF10 was found in
a case of a hereditary skeletal disorder, Cleidocranial Dysplasia. IGSF10 A1672T variant was found in combined
pituitary hormone deficiency. However, the mechanism of action of IGSF10 is unknown.
 The applicant’s group identified the cell surface receptor for IGSF10 and the downstream signaling pathway
regulated by IGSF10. They also identified a putative co-receptor and a secreted co-factor for IGSF10. This
project is directed towards understanding the roles of the receptor complex and the cofactors in IGSF10
signaling. The successful completion of the project will uncover the molecular mechanisms and the biological
roles of the novel signaling pathway mediated by IGSF10. The knowledge gained from this project will lay the
foundation for understanding the physiological roles of this novel signaling pathway as well as the pathological
conditions associated with the dysregulation of this pathway."

Nearly 90% of patients with low-risk papillary thyroid cancer undergo total thyroidectomy, the treatment option
with the greatest morbidity, even though less invasive options offer equivalent recurrence and survival.
Overtreatment of these patients results in significant patient harm and substantial costs. Currently, patients
have unmet informational needs that contribute to the uptake of total thyroidectomy. Patients with low-risk
papillary thyroid cancer would benefit from an intervention that meets their informational needs and increases
their ability to participate in the decision-making process. This proposal is a key step to support our longer-term
goal of reducing overtreatment of low-risk thyroid cancer by intervening on surgical decision making.
Our research team developed a novel intervention called CQUPLE, which includes (1) a Chart of side-by-side,
evidence-based information comparing all three management options for low-risk thyroid cancer, including
expected outcomes and (2) a Question Prompt List that contains key questions to consider asking the
surgeon. The intervention is grounded in social cognitive theory and aims to increase patient awareness of
treatment options and their outcomes, patient activation, and self-efficacy for decision making. This proposal
will pilot CQUPLE at three clinic sites in a single health system. We propose a pilot feasibility randomized
controlled trial in 50 patients with low-risk papillary thyroid cancer to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of
CQUPLE (Aim 1) and characterize the distribution of outcomes (Aim 2).
The results of the proposed research will provide the preliminary data necessary to prepare for a future, large-
scale pragmatic efficacy trial to test the effect of CQUPLE on patients’ choice for total thyroidectomy. CQUPLE
is a low-cost, scalable, patient-directed intervention that is innovative because it combines two complimentary
components that work to meet patients’ informational and decisional needs through different mechanisms. The
research is significant because reducing rates of total thyroidectomy for patients with low-risk thyroid cancer
has the potential to decrease patient harm and improve long-term outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team’s
history of successful collaboration and experience in behavioral intervention design and testing with
randomizes controlled trials make us well positioned to achieve the aims of this award."
10894116,"ABSTRACT
 A leading cause of microbial infections in hospitalized patients is Gram-negative bacteria, which release the
cell wall component lipopolysaccharide (LPS) capable of activating innate immune pathways. The aconitate
decarboxylase 1 (ACOD1) is an LPS-inducible mitochondrial enzyme that was previously implicated as a
negative innate immune regulator through catalyzing the production of anti-inflammatory itaconate. However, we
recently demonstrated that the LPS-induced ACOD1 up-regulation also confers a robust pro-inflammation
response in monocytes and macrophages in an itaconate-independent manner. Genetic deletion of ACOD1 or
its upstream signaling CDK2 in myeloid cells or pharmacological inhibition of CDK2 (with dinaciclib) uniformly
attenuated infection-induced cytokine storm and animal lethality in pre-clinical setting. Clinically, the CDK2-
ACOD1 axis was similarly up-regulated and positively correlated with the severity of bacterial infections in a
cohort of 40 patients. Thus, our findings have suggested a novel role for ACOD1 in promoting dysregulated
innate immune responses to lethal infections. Our central hypothesis is that ACOD1 exerts pro-inflammatory
action through interacting with other effectors such as GIMAP7. To test this hypothesis, we will exploit a
multifaceted strategy to pursue the following integrated aims. Aim 1: Define the adaptor proteins responsible for
CDK2-mediated ACOD1 upregulation in monocytes and macrophages. Aim 2: Identify the effectors responsible
for ACOD1-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokine production in monocytes and macrophages. Aim 3: Evaluate
the efficacy of anticancer drugs in disrupting ACOD1/GIMAP7 interaction and fighting against lethal infections in
preclinical settings. The completion of these studies will provide new insights into the intricate mechanism
underlying infection-induced innate immune dysfunction and shed light on the development of novel therapeutic
strategy for the management of lethal infections."
10919825,"Black and Hispanic adults experience higher rates of diabetes-related morbidity and mortality than non-Hispanic
whites. One primary reason for this disparity is their poor adherence to diabetes medicines. Not only do Black
and Hispanic adults suffer more from complications related to uncontrolled diabetes than non-Hispanic whites,
but their medication adherence rates are lower as well. Also, these diabetes disparities are strongly driven by
social determinants of health (SDOH) barriers such as food insecurity, and health misperceptions - negative
beliefs about diabetes/medicines, that negatively impact Blacks and Hispanics ability to manage diabetes
including taking medicines. There is an immense need for effective diabetes self-management interventions that
improve health outcomes for Black and Hispanic adults and reduce disparities. Our interdisciplinary team of
experts in diabetes management interventions, medication adherence, health disparities, multiphase
optimization strategy trials, mixed methods, and cost-effectiveness analysis will partner with an established
pharmacy chain, and community partners to conduct a randomized factorial mixed methods trial to optimize
diabetes management in Black and Hispanic adults with uncontrolled diabetes. This partnership will lead to the
identification of an effective and cost-effective diabetes management intervention that reduces medication
nonadherence and improves glycemic control (HbA1c) for Black and Hispanic adults by testing theory-driven
intervention components/combination. This 6-month intervention will identify the intervention
components/combination of components, i.e., (1) medication therapy management optimizing medication
therapy, (2) community health workers addressing SDOH barriers to diabetes self-management and addressing
diabetes and medicine misperceptions, added to usual care, that are effective in improving diabetes outcomes
(effectiveness optimization) and are cost-effective (cost-effectiveness optimization). The expanded Chronic Care
Model and Leventhal’s Extended Common Sense Model will be used to explain the contextual factors that put
Black and Hispanic adults at a greater risk for diabetes disparities, and psychosocial and behavioral mechanisms
to be tested. A randomized factorial mixed methods trial will evaluate the main effect of each intervention
component and the interactions between intervention components to determine the optimal combination of
components, that will have a long-term effect on (1) HbA1c, (2) medication adherence (assessed using self-
report and pharmacy refills), and (3) psychosocial/sociocultural mediators of these outcomes. Finally, using
qualitative interviews, we will explore the acceptability of each intervention component/combination as well as
the effective/cost-effective components through understanding participant experiences. This project addresses
an unmet critical need to optimize effective and cost-effective diabetes self-management interventions for Black
and Hispanic adults historically beset by diabetes-related harms. Broader implementation of the most effective
and cost-effective diabetes management intervention has a high potential to lower morbidity and mortality."

 Component A: Core Surveillance
Nevada Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS):
RFA-DP-21-001
Abstract
Existing data suggest numerous Nevada maternal and infant health outcomes are
unfavorable compared to national rates and HRSA Maternal and Child Health Bureau
indicators. Nevada falls below the US national average for critical outcomes such as
prenatal care and preventive medical visits, and has higher rates of cesarean deliveries,
early term births, low birth weight deliveries, postneonatal mortality, and neonatal
abstinence syndrome. For many indicators racial disparities exist like those experienced
nationally; in particular, Black mothers and infants in Nevada experience disproportionally
increased rates of sudden unexpected infant death, postneonatal mortality, and cesarean
deliveries. Data sets such as vital records provide limited data to explore the risk factors
associated with these outcomes. This award will expand Nevada’s ability to examine
these outcomes. Nevada does not have any other comprehensive system available to
monitor perinatal trends to guide program activities, health policy, and resource allocation.
PRAMS will enable Nevada to implement surveillance activities of high scientific quality
on selected maternal attitudes, behaviors, and experiences that occur before, during, and
after pregnancy. Nevada PRAMS data will help elucidate the reasons for maternal
behaviors, such as choosing not to breastfeed or not seeking prenatal care and will help
determine the prevalence of domestic/intimate partner violence, postpartum depression,
and contraceptive use. PRAMS data will be used to make data-driven programmatic
decisions to tailor activities to improve birth outcomes and systems of care for Nevada
mothers and children and enhance the State’s capacity to evaluate the impact of program
activities."
10976409,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hispanic adolescents in the United States are disproportionately affected by obesity compared to their non-
Hispanic White adolescent counterparts. A recommended means of addressing adolescent obesity is through
participation in family-based multicomponent behavioral interventions (targeting improvements in family
functioning as a mechanism of change). Although family-based interventions (FBIs) exist, effects on
adolescent obesity-related outcomes, especially among Hispanic adolescents, are small or insignificant.
Limited effects may be due to gaps in the existing research: 1) few FBIs have incorporated obesity-related
socioecological factors at multiple levels as tailoring variables to improve intervention effects, 2) FBIs often
overlook fathers and other household members (such as grandparents in multi-generational households) that
may also play a role on adolescents’ obesity risk behaviors, and 3) FBIs often assess family functioning
retrospectively without consideration of day-to-day family dynamics, which may also influence obesity risk
behaviors. Thus, I propose the following aims to address existing gaps: 1) conduct secondary data analysis
using five waves of data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study and the Hispanic adolescent
subsample (n=2411, Mage=9.5 at baseline) to examine the direct and moderating effects of factors at each level
of the socioecological model on the longitudinal trajectories of obesity risk behaviors/obesity status, 2) pilot an
EMA protocol with Hispanic adolescents (9-to-17 years) and household caregivers (n=20 family units) across 7
days to assess feasibility and acceptability, identify barriers and facilitators to completion of daily assessments
by family units, and make needed modifications to the EMA protocol, and 3) implement a finalized EMA
protocol over a 6-month period, using measurement burst design, and assess the effects of momentary
changes in family functioning behaviors and associations with daily physical activity, sleep, and nutrition
behaviors (n=50 family units, adolescents 9-to-17 years). The purpose of this training application is to gain
mentoring and training in the following four areas: 1) intensive longitudinal data analysis, 2) recruitment,
retention, and implementation, 3) innovative assessment design, and 4) professional development. Under the
mentorship of a team of interdisciplinary researchers, experts in either obesity prevention, longitudinal data
analysis, ecological momentary assessment, and/or minority health, Dr. Fernandez will successfully complete
the plan of research at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, School of Public Health and
attain preliminary data to inform the development of a NIH-R01 proposal."

Since mid-2003, this OAIC Biostatistics Core (RC1) has dedicated critically needed resources toward the
quantitative challenges of research on frailty. Partnering in OAIC leadership, and working closely with other
OAIC resource cores, it has helped develop the careers of an interdisciplinary cohort of junior faculty
supported by the Research Education Component (REC)—and beyond—and ensured expert design and
analysis of pilot, external, and de novo studies needed to advance science on frailty. It now proposes to
continue in these efforts, by providing: (1) mentorship for junior faculty supported by our REC, and our
broader OAIC, in developing careers focused on frailty and aging; (2) new data and computing infrastructure
and software, including web-based data housing and acquisition tools; (3) expertise for science on frailty,
through support for the design, statistical analysis, and data management of research projects, and through
making available new data analytic methodologies that are essential to studying the complex syndrome of
frailty; and (4) leadership and visibility for frailty-related scientific and health promotion endeavors at Johns
Hopkins, throughout the OAIC network, and in the broader gerontological community. Our support and
leadership in these areas have been significant and wide-reaching, and could not be provided without the
resources of this Core. The leadership is experienced, expert, deeply immersed in scholarship on aging, and
visible in both gerontology and statistics. The Core will continue to support every REC and pilot-supported

10894145,"Abstract
Recent advances in human connectome research have led to the development of models that reveal the brain
circuits associated with behaviors or symptoms. The networks that define these circuits yield functional
phenotypes that can be measured in individuals and are unique to each individual. Such work holds
tremendous promise for providing a biological basis for understanding brain function and brain disorders, it
allows us to characterize trajectories of growth, development, and aging, to categorize patients according to
their functional phenotype, ultimately aiding treatment decisions, and predicting outcomes.
Building such connectome based predictive models, involves 3 distinct steps: 1) construction of the
connectivity matrix summarizing the connections across the defined nodes/parcellation; 2) a subsequent
association step linking edge strength to the behavior or clinical symptom of interest; 3) and finally a predictive
model step for validation and to ensure the models generalize and the associations are not spurious. While
many atlases are available, there has been no consensus on which atlas to use to define the nodes in building
the connectome, making the sharing of models and validation across sites difficult. A second, often overlooked
problem, is that the node configuration supporting one behavior may not be the same for a different behavior
due to the functional flexibility in brain organization. Thus, while the parcellation and brain modeling steps
have historically been treated separately, they are not independent and should not be treated as such.
In this work we will develop a joint parcellation/brain-phenotype modeling approach that provides statistically
powerful, analytically robust, and biologically interpretable Bayesian models that are not dependent upon the
choice of the initial atlas. We will validate the models through measures of predictive power, reliability, and
generalizability, and compare to existing state-of-the-art methods. Data for validation will include the healthy
adult data from the human connectome project and a transdiagnostic sample of 450 individuals (after adding
150 subjects in this study) collected at Yale, spanning a range from healthy control subjects to those with
psychiatric illnesses. Normative models for 16 behavioral measures and 6 clinical scores will be developed
and shared with the neuroscience community.
A key aspect of validation and reproducibility in research is the sharing of data and models. The use of
approximately a dozen or so arbitrary atlases in the field inhibits the sharing of models. This work will move
the field forward by improving the methodology of brain-phenotype predictive modeling, identifying the circuits
supporting behavior, without a priori imposition of an arbitrary atlas. The results could advance our
understanding of the brain networks supporting behavior and impact a wide range of psychiatric illnesses.
Facilitating the release of generalized models to the research community will aid in understanding how to use
these methods for assigning treatments and monitoring the response to treatment."
10892282,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite decades of intensive research, there are currently no disease-modifying therapies to treat spinal cord
injury (SCI). One major reason for this dire unmet need is the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the cells that
comprise the injury site. Therapeutic molecules (e.g., small molecules, RNAs, proteins) that target one cell type
may be contraindicated for another cell type, thereby masking any potential beneficial effects. In this proposal,
we will address this issue by utilizing single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics data of the spinal cord injury site
to bioinformatically identify compounds that are predicted to reverse the disease phenotype in a cell-type and
cell-state-specific manner. Our research team has recently developed a novel drug discovery platform that
integrates single-cell gene expression data with perturbation-response data derived from the NIH Library of
Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) L1000 dataset to identify compounds that target specific
cell-types in tissues with diverse cellular heterogeneity. Another challenge that will be addressed in this proposal
is that of cell-type specific drug delivery. We will develop an advanced drug delivery system capable of highly
efficient cell-type targeted delivery with stimuli-responsive drug release at the spinal cord injury site. These novel
technologies will be used to target macrophages and fibroblasts that comprise the fibrotic scar at the spinal cord
injury site, which is a major barrier to the regeneration of axons and oligodendrocytes."
10849770,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Approximately 1 million autistics will turn 18 in the next decade, many without the skills they need to achieve the
quality-of-life that they and their families’ desire. Without effective supports, autistic youth struggle with daily
living skills, regardless of their intellectual abilities. Daily living skills are fundamental to independence, paid
employment, and better quality-of-life for autistic adults. Existing daily living skill interventions for this age group
have only modest effects or show poor generalization to real world settings. Current treatments rely on explicit
instruction of specific daily living skills (e.g., the steps for taking a shower), and they lack inclusion of mutable
psychological factors that support the development and generalization of daily living skills. Treatments are further
limited by inadequate knowledge of how social determinants of health (e.g., family income, community
resources) contribute to daily living skills. Identification of mutable psychological factors and social determinants
of health driving change in daily living skills for transition-age autistic youth is a vital to improving public health
and social justice. This knowledge will identify pivotal intervention and service delivery targets for improving daily
living skills. Better executive function and self-determination skills are associated with more advanced daily living
skills, and both factors improve with treatment in autism. Our central scientific premise is that interventions for
daily living skills, and the service delivery systems that promote them, will be enhanced with greater knowledge
of psychological and systemic factors that directly impact these skills. Further, enhanced daily living skills will
result in downstream improvements in quality-of-life and productivity. This project will address gaps in our
knowledge with a prospective longitudinal study that evaluates psychological factors that drive change in daily
living skills during the time when autistic youth exit high school (AIM 1), as well as the impact of daily living skills
on quality-of-life (AIM 2). We will also explore the influence of both individual- (e.g., family income) and
neighborhood-level (childhood opportunity index) factors on daily living skills (AIM 3). Finally, there is a general
need for large representative samples (i.e., IQ range, speaking/nonspeaking, sex-assigned-at-birth, gender,
race, ethnicity). The proposed longitudinal study will contain 3 visits (T1: baseline, T2: +1 yr., T3: +2 yrs.; final
N=170). Our recruitment strategy will ensure all participants have at least one timepoint pre- and post-high school
exit. We predict: AIM 1, H1) executive function and self-determination will explain significant variance in
concurrent daily living skills above covariates; AIM 1, H2a,b) executive functioning and self-determination at
baseline will predict daily living skills at T3 and change in daily living skills over time above covariates; AIM 2,
H3a,b) larger increases in daily living skills will predict better objective and subjective quality-of-life and better
change in quality-of-life over time. In AIM 3, we explore both direct and indirect effects of social determinants of
health. This project will generate critical knowledge for enhancing daily living skills interventions and delivery
systems that will improve long-term outcomes for autistic adults and increase equitable access to services."
10877986,"Project Summary
Memory systems evolved to inform the continual learning and decision making of organisms as they explore
and engage with an enormously complicated world. Humans in particular have a remarkable ability to recount
complex sequences of events: we can easily reconstruct a narrative about the past hour or day purely from
memory. In such real-world remembering, semantic and causal associations become exceedingly important,
defining a web of relational connections across time to guide recall. For example, your day might contain two
""hub"" events: a dinner party that requires visiting several shops to pick up supplies, and a morning phone call
saying that your child has a fever and needs to go home; each spawns a multitude of events that make up your
day. Rich associations among these moments form an “event network” whose local and global properties
shape recall; your decisions guide how each event will unfold. While studies show that relations between
simple items are important for memory organization and its accompanying neural computations, no existing
models consider the higher-order structure of networks composed from inter-related naturalistic events. Even
among naturalistic studies, most use passively-viewed movies or stories; participants have no choices to make
or goals to pursue. This lack of attention to the higher-order network properties and volitional aspects of real-
world experiences has hindered efforts to identify the cortical dynamics that underlie ecologically meaningful
memory processes.
We seek to understand how memory encoding and retrieval of realistic events is implemented, in terms of
cortical representations and interactions between brain systems. Doing so requires paradigms with two critical
attributes. First, the stimuli must be sufficiently complex. Memory researchers have long focused on reductive
scenarios with isolated stimuli that intentionally destroy semantic and causal connections. In contrast, our
experiments use realistic events that are richly associated with each other and will naturally generate a
diversity of event network structures. Second, participants must take an active role in creating their memories.
Organisms in the real world can volitionally interact with their input stream: at a crowded party, you can choose
to explore the kitchen or the living room, talk to the biologist or the musician, leave early or stay until dawn. We
will test how participants' volitional behaviors, as they interact with and actively seek information about their
environment, shape event networks and neural representations of events. Altogether, these experiments will
provide novel frameworks and tools to examine how emergent higher-order structure in natural experiences
governs the neural mechanisms underlying encoding and recall. By advancing the level of ecological validity
and stimulus complexity in human memory research, we expect to help uncover brain-behavior relationships
not apparent in simpler paradigms, and increase the translatability of laboratory findings to real-world
applications."
10893475,"A powerful technology for characterizing subcellular proteomes is “proximity labeling” (PL), in which a catalyst is
localized to a specific cellular location, followed by promiscuous tagging of endogenous proteins in the vicinity.
The tagged proteins are then isolated and identified by mass spectrometry. Although PL catalysts are powerful,
new PL catalysts are needed to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of spatially resolved proteomic mapping.
Genetically encoded enzymes can be conveniently targeted to cellular locations of interest, but they are limited
in their mechanisms of tagging, which hampers control over the labeling radius (limiting specificity) and restricts
which amino acids can be tagged (limiting sensitivity). Synthetic PL catalysts have recently introduced a greater
diversity of chemical labeling mechanisms, but new approaches are needed for selective activation of these
catalysts in highly specific subcellular regions of interest. We propose that hybrid biological-abiotic PL catalysts
can achieve improved sensitivity as well as specificity in spatially-resolved proteomic mapping. We are pursuing
this hypotheses through the development of three classes of hybrid PL catalysts, which offer complementary
advantages. In Aim 1, we have used directed evolution to discover heme peroxidase enzymes capable of
generating highly reactive radicals, which exhibit a shorter diffusion radius and label chemically diverse amino
acids, in contrast to the APEX approach that almost exclusively labels tyrosines. This ability to react with more
amino acids will enhance sensitivity for detecting proximal proteins. In Aim 2, we have developed hybrid DNA-
synthetic PL catalysts that become activated only in highly specific subcellular locations. We are applying these
switchable catalysts for activation of PL selectively at protein–protein interactions (PPIs) on the surface of cancer
cells, and we will extend this approach for activation at intercellular PPIs in neuronal synapses. In Aim 3, we
have developed hybrid DNA-synthetic catalysts that tag proteins through contact-dependent mechanisms,
instead of generating diffusible reactive species. We will attach these contact-dependent catalysts to DNA nano-
rod structures with tunable lengths and rigidities, enabling precise control over the labeling radius in the range
of ~1–50 nm. We are applying all three classes of PL catalysts for proteomic mapping in living mammalian cells,
in collaboration with Prof. Lloyd Smith, an expert in high-resolution biomolecular mass spectrometry. Additionally,
we are collaborating with Prof. Edwin Chapman to employ these PL tools in cultured neurons to benchmark their
performance against existing tools. Throughout the next five years, my laboratory will continue to develop new
mechanisms for PL using hybrid abiotic-biological catalysts. I envision that these technologies will be employed
not only in my laboratory, but also in the broader community, to elucidate novel protein functions in a variety of
biological contexts."

Based on its theme, integrating pathways affecting physical function for new approaches
to disability treatment and prevention, the WF OAIC will pursue four programmatic aims:
1. Discover new pathways contributing to age-related declines in physical function and
 disability risk;
2. Develop, evaluate and refine strategies for disability treatment and prevention;
3. Translate proven strategies beyond the traditional research environment; and
4. Train the next generation of research leaders focused on disability treatment and
prevention.
This renewal builds on the substantial achievements of the 2018-2023 cycle in which the WF
OAIC made significant scientific progress supporting 62 externally-funded projects, 12 early-
career faculty, and developing new mHealth and image processing tools. The WF OAIC will
advance its aims in the first year of the next cycle by supporting four pilot studies, two research
development projects, four early-career faculty and 23 externally-funded projects.
The aims will be pursued by integrating the efforts of four highly productive research support
cores: the Clinical Research Core; Integrative Biology Core; Biostatistics and Research
Information Systems Core; and Bioimaging Resource Core. Under the continuing and
dedicated leadership of Drs. Stephen Kritchevsky and Dalane Kitzman, the Leadership and
Administrative Core will coordinate these research core activities with those of the Research
Education Component and the Pilot and Exploratory Studies Core."
10739793,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We have developed a novel gene therapeutic approach to achieve an HIV functional cure, wherein broadly
neutralizing antibody (bnAb) genes are targeted to the endogenous heavy chain locus in B cells for expression
as functional antigen-receptors (BCRs). This takes advantage of the precision of gene editing conferred by
CRISPR-Cas9 reagents and homology-directed gene editing. We have shown that these broadly neutralizing
BCRs respond to HIV Env immunogens by signaling clonal expansion and germinal center maturation of the
engineered cells and thereby generate durable, isotype-switched memory bnAb responses that could be
deployed for long-term control of HIV. Given these features of B cell biology, which are preserved by our gene
editing approach, we hypothesize that sufficient neutralizing antibody titers in serum could be generated from
very few engineered B cells, including the levels achieved by in vivo delivery of genome-editing reagents directly
to the target cells. In support of this approach, we have now shown that high-titer bnAb responses can be elicited
in mice by vaccination with HIV-Env immunogens when the animals are injected with a transcriptionally-targeted
dual-AAV vector system carrying the bnAb editing reagents. Unlike injection of recombinant bnAbs, or AAV-
vectored delivery of bnAb-IgG expression cassettes to liver or muscle for long-term secretion from viral
episomes, bnAbs generated from in vivo gene-edited B cells in response to vaccination are expected to have
the following advantages: 1) be boostable, as needed, in response to viral antigen, 2) express bnAbs as all
effector isotypes to expand antiviral immunity, 3) affinity-mature or evolve the bnAb response to keep-pace with
a rapidly evolving virus, and 4) be better tolerated by the immune system. To further develop this approach, we
have assembled a team that brings together expertise in B cell engineering, vector development, HIV vaccine
design, and animal models to further develop this in vivo delivery approach to specifically and efficiently engineer
B cells in vivo and to evaluate this approach as an in vivo HIV cure."

Heart failure (HF) affects 6 million people in the US, costs over $30 billion per year, and results in 1 million
hospitalizations per year. Readmission within 30 days occurs in 25% of Medicare beneficiaries admitted for
HF, but previous interventions to reduce readmissions have had mixed results. An untapped potential resource
for such interventions may be to engage home health aides (HHAs); after a HF hospitalization, 25% of patients
are discharged home with support from HHAs. Unlike physicians or visiting nurses, HHAs are with patients on
a near-daily basis, sometimes up to 24 hours per day. However, the candidate’s prior work suggests that HHAs
do not receive HF-specific education and lack confidence caring for HF patients. Indeed, HHAs acknowledge
that they often call 911 when they are unsure of what to do, or if they cannot reach their agency nurse for
advice. While some emergency department visits may be clinically appropriate, many may be avoidable.
The objective of this proposal is to design and test a novel intervention that will educate HHAs about HF and
provide them with a tablet-based messaging tool that connects them with their supervising nurses. The overall
hypothesis is that educated and integrated HHAs can improve outcomes in HF. Building on established
community-based collaborations, the project will be conducted with the 1199SEIU-Home Care Industry
Education Fund (an organization that trains 75,000 HHAs from 55 licensed home care agencies in New York,
NY) and the Visiting Nurse Service of New York (the largest non-profit licensed home care agency in the U.S.).
The project will include a survey of HHAs to measure the prevalence of HF training gaps and preferences for
an intervention (Aim 1); a stakeholder-engaged process to design an educational and communication-based
intervention (Aim 2); and a pilot randomized controlled trial to test the feasibility and acceptability of the
intervention (Aim 3), laying the groundwork for a future R01 which will test its effectiveness on a larger scale.
The candidate for this career development award, Madeline Sterling, MD, MPH, MS, is a general internist with
expertise in clinical medicine, epidemiology, and health services research. This award will enable her to gain
skills in the development and conduct of clinical trials in real-world settings designed to improve healthcare
delivery and outcomes for HF patients. Dr. Sterling will be mentored by two NHBLI-funded clinician-
investigators, Monika Safford, MD (primary mentor; expert in real-world clinical trials) and Lisa Kern, MD, MPH
(co-mentor; expert in the evaluation of interventions designed to improve ambulatory care). Other advisors with
expertise in HF, home care, technology, and implementation science will also guide her. The combination of
mentorship, formal coursework, and the proposed experiential learning will position Dr. Sterling to become an
independent investigator while advancing the field of home care and healthcare delivery for HF patients."
10739797,"Abstract
Acute allograft rejection is a T cell mediated immune response that continues to undermine the success of
transplantation to treat end-stage organ disease. Two factors contributing to acute and chronic allograft injury
and graft loss are ischemia-reperfusion injury and heterologous immunity by endogenous memory T cells with
reactivity to graft alloantigens. Reperfusion of ischemic tissues is an inherent component of transplantation and
quickly induces an acute inflammatory response that directs the infiltration and activation of many types of
leukocytes in the tissue. Clinically, the presence of donor-reactive memory T cells in the peripheral blood of
kidney transplant patients prior to transplant is associated with increased delayed graft function and poorer graft
survival. However, the mechanisms activating donor-reactive endogenous memory T cells within allografts to
mediate graft injury remain poorly understood. Studies performed during the last funding period indicated that
endogenous memory CD8 T cells rapidly infiltrate cardiac allografts and are activated by graft allogeneic class
I MHC molecules to proliferate and produce IFN- and other factors mediating graft tissue injury. The infiltration
and activities of endogenous memory CD8 T cells are markedly increased in allografts subjected to longer
duration of cold ischemic storage (CIS) prior to transplant that promotes costimulatory blockade resistant
memory CD8 T cell rejection of the allografts. These and our preliminary results have led us to propose the
hypothesis that the increased inflammation generated following reperfusion of allografts subjected to
prolonged, but not to minimal, CIS initiates a cycle of interdependent innate immune interactions with
pre-existing donor-reactive memory CD4 and CD8 T cells required to sustain activation of the memory
CD8 T cells to mediate acute graft injury and CTLA-4Ig-resistant rejection. The hypothesis will be tested
in two specific aims: first, we will test the mechanisms promoting activation of the donor-reactive endogenous
memory CD8 T cells within the highly ischemic allografts; and, second, we will test the role of TLR9 signaling
in sustaining the inflammatory cycle leading to activation of the memory CD8 T cells to reject the allografts and
the ability of new strategies to inhibit TLR9-mediated inflammation to improve outcomes of these higher risk
allografts. Experiments in this renewal application will connect ischemia-reperfusion injury with pre-existing
donor-reactive memory T cell activation in grafts and provide novel insights into mechanisms underlying an
important and poorly understood clinical problem. We anticipate these studies will identify new targets for
therapeutic strategies to inhibit innate immune enhancement of pre-existing donor-reactive memory T cells in
grafts and acute T cell mediated graft injury and improve graft outcomes."

 Obesity and other weight-related problems, including poor dietary intake, inadequate physical activity, body
dissatisfaction, and disordered eating behaviors, are of major public health concern, given their high
prevalence and serious health consequences. The high prevalence of these problems in young people from
low-income and ethnic/racial minority groups is of particular concern. This program of research aims to identify
multi-level factors influencing a broad range of weight-related problems throughout key stages of the life
course to guide the development of highly innovative, culturally acceptable, and effective interventions for
populations in greatest need. The focus will be on the transition from adolescence to adulthood, an
understudied, but important, period of life for the development of weight problems. This program of research is
aimed at achieving the Principal Investigator's vision whereby young people from all backgrounds will have
positive weight-related health, with support from their family, friends, schools, worksites, and neighborhoods.
 This Outstanding Investigator Award (R35-OIA) will support a highly productive and effective researcher
and her team in a manner that will promote creativity, allow strategic risk-taking, and have a great impact on
weight-related problems. The program of research combines a longstanding and well-defined cohort study with
a flexible plan to address emerging topics of interest. The research program builds and expands upon the
Project EAT (Eating and Activity in Teens and Young Adults) studies, the largest and most comprehensive
longitudinal body of research examining multi-level predictors of a broad range of weight-related problems in
young people. The research program will include the following: 1) 12-year longitudinal, multi-level follow-up
data collection on weight-related problems from a diverse sample of young people (N=2,793) and their family,
friend, school, worksite, and neighborhood environments; 2) intermediate and rapid response survey
mechanisms to capture short-term changes and assess the impact of societal changes and emerging policies
of potential relevance to weight-related outcomes; 3) innovative substudies using multiple methods for in-depth
explorations of multi-level etiological processes to guide intervention development; and 4) a mentored training
program for new investigators who will shape the future of the field of young adult weight-related health.
 This OIA comprehensive program of research will lead to the development of multi-level explanatory
models for weight-related problems in young people and interventions for populations at greatest risk.
Integration of a strong training program will ensure that the next generation of public health professionals has
the tools to prevent marginalized populations from continuing to carry the burden of weight-related problems.
Thus, this program of research builds on the NHLBI Strategic Vision, particularly regarding the objectives: 1) to
investigate factors that account for differences in health among populations; and 2) to develop, diversify, and
sustain a scientific workforce capable of accomplishing NHLBI's mission."

Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which represents 30% to 40% of newly diagnosed lymphomas,
comprises two main molecular subtypes: activated B cell-like (ABC) and germinal center B cell-like (GCB). ABC
DLBCL is more aggressive and less curable. More than 50% of patients with ABC DLBCL are refractory to or
relapse from current frontline immunochemotherapy. Clinical use of ibrutinib, a selective inhibitor for Bruton
tyrosine kinase (BTK) in the B cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway, has achieved an initial response rate of
30%-40% in refractory/relapsed ABC DLBCL. Primary and acquired drug resistance, however, are still significant
and impact the long-term survival of more than 60% of these patients. Therefore, understanding and targeting
ibrutinib resistance mechanisms is an unmet clinical need. The BCR and JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathways are
essential for the survival and proliferation of ABC DLBCL cells. We discovered that EGR1 is a converged
downstream target of both pathways in ABC DLBCL and the level of EGR1 expression is elevated in ABC DLBCL
compared with normal human tonsils and lymph nodes. We revealed novel mechanisms of EGR1 in
transcriptional activation and repression of target genes with strong translational impact in treating aggressive
lymphoma. EGR1 mediates transcriptional activation through the p300/H3K27ac/BRD4 axis to induce MYC
expression and activate MYC target genes. Synergistic inhibition of cell growth was observed between EGR1
shRNA and AZD5153, a novel BRD4 inhibitor that is currently under clinical investigation. On the other hand,
EGR1 mediates transcriptional repression of the type I interferon pathway genes, expression of which otherwise
causes cancer cell death. Consistently, EGR1 knockdown by shRNA synergizes with the type I interferon inducer
lenalidomide in growth inhibition of ABC DLBCL cells in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model. Using newly
derived, ibrutinib-resistant ABC DLBCL cell lines, we demonstrated that EGR1 is among the most highly
expressed genes relative to ibrutinib-sensitive parental cells, and co-targeting of BRD4 and interferon signaling
inhibits growth of ibrutinib-resistant cells in vitro and in vivo. Based on these discoveries, the central hypothesis
is that EGR1 is a unique oncogenic driver orchestrating multiple important signaling pathways and represents
therapeutic vulnerability in patients with ABC DLBCL, especially for those with ibrutinib resistance. To test our
hypothesis, we will pursue the following specific aims: (1) Elucidate effects of EGR1 on oncogenesis; (2)
Establish the role of EGR1 in ibrutinib resistance; and (3) Co-target EGR1 downstream BRD4 and type I
interferon signaling to overcome drug resistance in DLBCL. Dissecting the transcriptional activation and
repression modules of EGR1 in DLBCL tumorigenesis and ibrutinib resistance is essential because the novel
mechanistic insights will provide a molecular basis for developing the most effective therapeutic strategy for
treatment of DLBCL patients, including those with ibrutinib resistance."

The Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB) is multidisciplinary conference covering current
research in the theory and practice of computational methods as applied to significant biological
problems. PSB 2020 – 2024 will be the 25th to 29th meeting of this series.
Each February, participants propose sessions and workshops for the PSB meeting to be held the
following January. In the face of stiff competition, 5 to 6 sessions and 2 to 4 workshops are
chosen. These sessions and workshops are often organized by young scientists who are
developing new research areas. Thus, PSB provides early opportunities for serious examination
of emerging research areas. PSB also provides young scientists the opportunity to gain a
significant career boost by this activity. Our goals are for sessions to cover emerging areas and
for workshops to bring attention to very newest developments. This bottom-up, crowdsourcing
approach has worked well to reveal the newest developments in this field.
A chosen representative of the session organizers gives a short introduction to the session
followed by a high-profile speaker, typically a biologist, provides an overview highlighting the
importance of the research area. Next, 4 to 8 talks based on accepted papers are delivered.
These papers are published in PSB proceedings, are open access, and are indexed by PubMed.
Submitted papers are rigorously reviewed, with typically ≤ 30% being accepted. The newest-
developments workshops lay the groundwork for the future. In addition, the meeting has 2 keynote
speakers and a continuously running poster session. The research parasite and symbiont awards
are a new addition to PSB activities. PSB has continually improved from participant feedback;
specific examples of this improvement will be given.
The PSB meeting is highly regarded. The PSB Proceedings is ranked 17th among bioinformatics
journals by Google Scholar Citation Statistics; it is the only computational biology/bioinformatics
meeting with a conference proceedings that ranks among the top 20 journals in the field. The high
regard for the meeting and its proceedings attests to PSB's very significant impact. PSB continues
to foster the development of computational biology and bioinformatics by providing important,
critical exposure to emerging areas and thus deserves support."
10739801,"Project Summary
Self and non-self RNA must be distinguished by the cell in order to avoid triggering the innate immune
response when not needed. In humans, self RNAs are edited by adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA
(ADAR1), which modifies adenosines to inosines. The vast majority of A-to-I editing events occur in primate-
specific Alu elements, which are the most prolific retrotransposon found within the human genome. Alu
elements have been shown to be the primary drivers of RIG-I, MDA-5, and TLR3 signaling suggesting that the
primary function of ADAR1-dependent editing of Alu elements is to suppress the immune response. Editing is
augmented upon infection by viruses primarily through the activity of the longer, interferon-induced, isoform of
ADAR1 (ADAR1p150), which is unique from the short isoform in that it has a N-terminal Z-RNA binding domain
(Zα) and that it is pro-viral. This suggests that the Z-RNA binding function of Zα plays a critical role in targeting
ADAR1p150 to Z-RNA-forming regions within Alu elements along with a nearby structurally homologous Zβ
domain, however, the RNA binding mechanisms and specificities of ADAR1p150 are poorly characterized. My
hypothesis is that the N-terminal Zα domain and the closely related Zβ domain augment A-to-I editing
by targeting ADAR1p150 to Z-RNA-forming regions within Alu elements during the interferon response.
This increased editing in-turn “blunts” the interferon response and allows many types of viruses to proliferate
unchallenged. In this proposal, I present a strategy which integrates structural biology, RNA-sequencing, and
biochemistry techniques to uncover specific Z-RNA-forming sequences within Alu elements and during
infection and answer basic questions about A-to-Z RNA transitions in Alu elements by the Zα and Zβ domains
of ADAR1p150. My specific aims are (Aim 1) to characterize the transition from A- to Z-RNA in Alu RNAs
through biochemical and structural techniques. I also plan (Aim 2) to investigate how the Z-RNA recognizing
ability of Zα and Zβ contributes to recognition and editing of Alu elements in vivo and how it correlates to West
Nile infection of HEK293T cells by RNA-sequencing techniques. Due to our lack of knowledge about the Z-
DNA/RNA binding domain of ADAR1, we have likely vastly overlooked the repertoire of RNA segments able to
adopt Z-conformations within the transcriptome. The results of my proposal will help to fill this gap in
knowledge, laying the foundations for further research on the importance of Z-RNA in biological processes and
help guide studies attempting to manipulate A-to-I editing as a tool for treating many types of diseases or
inhibit the pro-viral characteristics of ADAR1p150."

 The discovery of functional brain connectivity (FC) and functional networks (FNs) have propelled the
neuroimaging field, particularly in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which has experienced an
exponential growth in recent years. FNs have allowed us to better understand extrinsic and intrinsic brain
properties in various disease and healthy states, leading to better characterization of neuropsychiatric
disorders. However, current fMRI analyses are constrained to the gray matter (GM) region of the brain and
fMRI data from the white matter (WM) region are often discarded, which makes up approximately 50% of the
brain by volume. Many brain disorders have been associated with WM deficiencies, since WM is critical for the
transmission of information to the GM cortical areas. Despite findings of blood-oxygen-level-dependent
(BOLD) signals in the WM, WM-FNs are yet to be fully characterized, and neither the mechanism by which
WM-FNs may affect GM-FNs, nor how WM-FNs are associated with phenotypic traits are known.
The long-term goal of this project is to better understand the effect of WM-FNs on normal cognitive
functions of the human brain and apply fMRI data from various healthy and diseased populations for more
reliable diagnostics and monitoring. The rationale for this study is based on our preliminary studies which
investigated WM-FNs using the Human Connectome Project dataset. We found that WM-FNs are correlated
with subregions of the corpus callosum, a critical WM region relaying information between the two cortical
hemispheres. Furthermore, we determined an overlap between the WM-FNs and tracts from diffusion tensor
imaging (DTI). In this study we will examine WM-FNs of the whole brain using resting fMRI data from two large
independent cohorts. We hypothesize that the FN measures derived from WM will be similar to that of GM and
the metrics can be used to reliably predict phenotypic traits. The hypothesis will be tested with the following
specific aims: Aim1: To develop and evaluate the time-series, FC and FN characteristics of WM of the whole -
brain; Aim 2: To investigate WM-phenotype associations and the predictability of phenotypes using WM-FNs;
and Aim 3: To develop and disseminate a WM-FN toolbox. To the best of our knowledge, this study will be the
first to examine the reliability and validity of WM-FNs in resting fMRI data, and its relation to brain function. The
proposed work holds significant contribution since it will facilitate the use of WM-FN methods for the
neuroimaging community, which currently lacks the necessary analytic tools to reliably characterize WM
function. This study will provide a strong foundation f or future clinical use of both WM-FNs and GM-FNs, to
understand brain function more comprehensively, in addition to facilitating the use of reliable and reproducible
WM-FC methods."
10739808,"All-trans-retinoic acid (RA) is the bioactive derivative of vitamin A and β-carotene that is essential for differentiation and development of embryonic tissues as well as the maintenance and robust performance of adult organs and tissues. In the nucleus, RA acts by binding to RXR/RAR heterodimeric transcription factors to regulate the expression of over 530 genes. RA is also known to have regulatory functions in the cytoplasm. During embryogenesis the levels of RA change in a strictly defined spatiotemporal pattern. Similarly, during adulthood the concentration of RA in various tissues and cells is maintained within narrow margins that are optimal for each type of cell. Disruption of RA homeostasis results in embryonic malformations, whereas in adult tissues aberrations in RA homeostasis can lead to pathophysiological changes that result in disease. Thus, it is critical to understand: (1) the molecular mechanisms whereby the cells maintain RA homeostasis; (2) how the cells adjust RA levels in response to varied physiological requirements; and (3) why these mechanisms fail in disease. Since the oxidation of retinol to retinaldehyde is the rate-limiting step in the
pathway of RA biosynthesis that controls the overall rate of RA biosynthesis, it is important to identify and characterize the enzymes that catalyze this step and to understand the contribution of each enzyme to overall RA homeostasis. During the previous funding cycle, it was established that the baseline levels of RA in cells are maintained by a heterooligomeric retinoid oxidoreductase complex (ROC) formed by retinol dehydrogenase 10 (RDH10) and dehydrogenase/reductase 3 (DHRS3). Data from this and other laboratories indicate that RDH10 is also the primary enzyme responsible for the oxidation of retinol to retinaldehyde during early stages of embryogenesis. However, other yet unidentified retinol dehydrogenases appear to be more important in adult tissues. Preliminary data from this laboratory indicate that mice with a double knockout of genes encoding retinol dehydrogenase epidermal 2 (RDHE2) and RDHE2-similar (RDHE2S), display a phenotype consistent with reduced RA signaling in skin pilosebaceous unit and meibomian glands of eyelids. The data also suggest that the expression of RDHE2 and RDHE2S oscillates in a diurnal pattern and during various stages of hair follicle regeneration. We hypothesize that these inducible and RA-sensitive enzymes are responsible for the fluctuations of RA during the cycle of hair follicle regeneration, and for fine-tuning of the baseline RA levels, established by the ROC, in response to varied physiological requirements or
pathophysiological conditions. To test this hypothesis, we will use the novel mouse models and custom-made antibodies generated during the previous cycle to determine the contribution of RDHE2/E2S to RA biosynthesis in skin and meibomian glands of the eyelid. The proposed studies will provide a comprehensive background to better understand the molecular mechanisms that maintain and/or disrupt RA homeostasis and will inform future strategies to develop targeted and more effective therapeutic interventions."

 Despite the legalization of retail cannabis (i.e., non-medical, “recreational”) in multiple states, there are still
no federal regulations for warnings on cannabis products in the U.S. This is troubling because states that legalize
cannabis report increased calls to poison control centers, and cannabis consumption has been associated with
cognitive impairment, deadly lung disease, and respiratory problems. At the same time, cannabis has therapeutic
benefits, including reduced spasticity for multiple sclerosis patients. The fact that cannabis has adverse and
therapeutic outcomes has contributed to an environment where substantial proportions of U.S. consumers both
over- and under-estimate the health risks of cannabis. This highlights the need for clear, effective labeling
regulations to ensure accurate risk perceptions. Despite evidence of the efficacy of health warning attributes
(e.g., adding pictures to text), there is limited data on how such warning attributes influence cannabis consumers
in the U.S. This proposal will inform how cannabis warning-label characteristics influence cannabis consumers’
(i.e., past 30-day use) attitudes and beliefs, intentions, and problematic cannabis use behaviors by
accomplishing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Assess consumer perceptions about draft cannabis warning
labels through focus groups with adult cannabis consumers (21+) from legal retail states; Aim 2: Determine how
attributes of updated cannabis warning labels affect cannabis consumers’ (21+ from retail states) emotions and
perceived risk using a discrete choice experiment (DCE); Aim 3: Use a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to test
enhanced warning labels against the existing product labels to determine how exposure influences cannabis
consumers’ (21+ from retail states) label reactions (emotion and reactance), attitudes and beliefs (perceived
risks and health beliefs about cannabis), and intentions for problematic use (e.g., driving after cannabis
consumption) immediately after exposure (Session 1). At 2-week follow-up (Session 2), we will measure
message recall and cannabis-use behaviors in the last 2 weeks (i.e., interpersonal conversations about
cannabis, cannabis use, money spent on cannabis, quitting attempts, and problematic use), and behavioral
intentions (motivation to quit cannabis in 6 months). This innovative proposal includes training activities to ensure
that Dr. Massey achieves the following five career goals: 1) Develop expertise in psychological and biological
mechanisms of addiction; 2) Receive hands-on training for the development of cannabis warning labels; 3) Learn
advanced research methods for warning label research with DCEs; 4) Acquire advanced training in RCTs; and
5) Create a sustainable line of research for future R01 submissions. The mentorship team includes experts in
developing and testing warning labels (Hammond, Thrasher, Popova), substance use research (Hammond,
Froeliger), cannabis policy (Hammond), mixed methods (Popova, Rodgers, Thrasher), and design of DCEs and
RCTs to test consumer warnings (entire team). The proposed mentorship, training, and research activities would
prepare Dr. Massey for an independent research career with a sustainable substance-use research program."

 Heart failure affects 6 million people in the US, resulting on 1 million hospitalizations and a cost of over $30
billion per year. Heart failure with preserved election fraction (HFpEF) accounts for half of these cases, and its
prevalence is rising by 1% annually. About 20-30% of HFpEF cases remain undiagnosed, contributing to poor
health outcomes for these patients. Preliminary data suggest that primary care providers (PCPs) are often
unaware of diagnostic and treatment guidelines for HFpEF. At the same time, primary care has an invaluable
potential to improve HFpEF health outcomes by facilitating early diagnosis, referral to cardiology, and treating
HFpEF comorbidities. The objective of this proposal is to design and test a novel intervention that will educate
PCPs about HFpEF and provide them with a clinical diagnostic decision support aide (CDDSA) that is based on
a validated diagnostic score for HFpEF. The overall hypothesis of this project is that if PCPs can detect HFpEF
earlier, and therefore, refer patients to cardiology, and manage their comorbidities, it can help improve outcomes
in HFpEF. Building on established community-academic collaborations, this project will be conducted with the
help of the Alabama Practice-Based Research Network (APBRN). This project will include identification of
provider barriers to HFpEF diagnosis among PCPs via an interview and a survey that will measure the
prevalence of HFpEF knowledge gaps and preferences for an intervention (Aim 1); a stakeholder-engaged
process to design an educational session and CDDSA to optimize HFpEF diagnosis in primary care (Aim 2); and
a pilot study to test the feasibility and acceptability of the CDDSA (Aim 3). At the completion of the pilot study in
Aim 3, the intervention will be ready to be tested at a larger scale (e.g., R-series grant) to evaluate its efficacy.
The candidate for this career development award, Yulia Khodneva, MD, PhD, is a general internist with expertise
in clinical medicine, epidemiology, and health services research. This award will enable her to gain skills
necessary for her transition to independence focusing her research on improving healthcare delivery, and
outcomes for HFpEF patients. Specifically, Dr. Khodneva will receive training in intervention development,
implementation science, and conducting of pragmatic clinical trials, designed to improve healthcare delivery and
outcomes for HFpEF patients. Dr. Khodneva will be mentored by two NHLBI-funded physician- investigators,
Andrea Cherrington, MD (primary mentor; expert in intervention development and pragmatic clinical trials),
Pankaj Arora, MD, (co-mentor; expert in HFpEF diagnosis and HFpEF echocardiography), and Larry Hearld,
PhD (co-mentor; expert in implementation science). The combination of mentorship, formal coursework, and the
proposed experiential learning during the project’s 5-year integrated training and research plan will position Dr.
Khodneva to become an independent investigator while advancing the field of primary care for HFpEF patients."

APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Clinical Center
We submit this application in response to RFA-DK-22-506. The Cleveland Clinic and the University of Michigan
form the Clinical Center 7 which is a current member of the APOLLO Consortium. This Consortium was
established in 2017 to work seamlessly with the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations (AOPO) to
enroll participants in the largest observational study to date of kidney transplant recipients and donors to evaluate
APOL1 gene mutations in kidney donor as a risk factor for graft loss. Our Clinical Center has been a leader and
top enroller for eligible recipients and living kidney donors in the Midwest. This has been achieved through a
very close collaboration between all site PIs and research coordinators. The following transplant centers are part
of CC7: Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, Cleveland Clinic in Weston, Florida, University of Michigan, Saint
John’s Hospital in Detroit Michigan, Mercy Health St. Mary’s in Michigan, University of Toledo, University of
Cincinnati, Ohio State University, University Hospitals of Cleveland, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center,
SUNY Foundation/University of Buffalo, Henry Ford Health System and University of Chicago. They are
participating as engaged sites. In Phase 1 of APOLLO, we have successfully consented 281 kidney transplant
recipients and 33 living donors, with DNA on hand in 246 recipients (91%) and 33 donors (100%), across these
centers. Our site has overseen the careful collection of clinical data from the electronic medical record at our
own site and subsites to complete the APOLLO Consortium Data Forms accurately and entirely. In Phase 2, we
will continue to obtain critical follow-up data on all participants and ensure completion of data abstraction from
electronic medical records, to provide patient-level detail not available in databases maintained by United
Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) and the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR). We will ensure
a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio is measured in all participants, at all sites, at a longitudinal follow-up time point
of at least two years from original enrollment in APOLLO Phase 1. The University of Michigan and The Cleveland
Clinic will continue to collect additional biospecimens for contribution to the biorepository as well as unstained
biopsy slides as we have been doing through Phase 1. We will work with the Scientific Data and Research Center
to ensure return of genotype results to all participants who desire this information. We will also continue to recruit
living donors at our sites. Continuation of the APOLLO Consortium will lead to important advances in our
understanding of APOL1 high-risk status and its influence on graft function as well as the biology of APOL1 gene
effects."

Hypertension is a disease defined as blood pressure that is greater than 130/80mmHg. Hypertension
contributes significantly to cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. While the importance of blood
pressure control has become abundantly clear, we are still far from understanding the true etiology of
hypertension. In recent years, inflammation was determined to play a causal role in hypertension. Specifically,
immune cells invade target organs during the course of the disease and release cytokines that cause end-
organ damage. Several studies have determined antigen presentation by dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes
is important for initiation of hypertension. In addition, pro-inflammatory T cells perpetuate the disease. Anti-
inflammatory T regulatory cells (Treg) can control the hypertensive response. Interestingly, evidence suggests
that long-lasting use of cyclooxygenase inhibitors, which prevent metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA) to
prostaglandins and thromboxane, increases blood pressure. Prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) is an AA metabolite that
our laboratory has determined has immunomodulatory effects. Our group has demonstrated that PGI2 acts to
directly inhibit the functionality of pro-inflammatory DCs and CD4+ Th1 and Th2 cells, while promoting the
function of tolerogenic DCs. However, the impact of PGI2 on the functionality of immune cells in hypertension is
unknown. A previous study has demonstrated that mice deficient in the receptor for PGI2, IP, develop elevated
blood pressure in response to high salt diet, suggesting that PGI2 signaling is important for controlling blood
pressure elevation in response to stimuli. Further, I have preliminary data which suggests that PGI2 controls
the inflammatory response to hypertensive stimuli. Specifically, mice deficient in IP have increased infiltration
of T cells into their aortas compared to wild-type (WT) mice in response to angiotensin II (Ang II). In addition,
infusion of the PGI2 analog treprostinil during the course of Ang II infusion prevents the infiltration of T cells,
monocytes/macrophages and DCs into the aorta of WT mice compared to WT mice that received Ang II and
the vehicle for treprostinil. Thus, these recent studies and my preliminary data lead me to hypothesize
that PGI2 promotes anti-inflammatory responses during hypertension. To test this hypothesis we will use
mouse models of hypertension and primary cells from normotensive and hypertensive mice and humans to:
Aim 1 (K99): Test the hypothesis that PGI2 promotes Treg function and stability during hypertension,
thereby counteracting pro-inflammatory subsets of T cells; and Aim 2 (R00): Test the hypothesis that
PGI2 restrains pro-inflammatory DC and promotes tolerogenic DC function during hypertension.
Determining the mechanisms by which PGI2 controls the immune response to hypertension will greatly
advance the field and result in new therapeutic directions for the treatment of hypertension. These proposed
studies, along with my proposed career development plan, will provide a foundation for my career as an
independent investigator in an outstanding environment."

Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotypic modulation is central to the etiologies of multiple vascular wall 
diseases.  In  post-­angioplasty  restenosis  and  atherosclerosis,  VSMCs  acquire  a  proliferative/migratory 
phenotype  leading  to  neointima  formation.  In  contrast,  hypertension  is largely  caused  by  increased  vascular 
resistance that is attributed to exaggerated VSMC contraction and vascular remodeling. Identification of the key 
players  that  regulate  VSMC  proliferation  and  contraction  is  critical  for  further  understanding  of  the  underlying 
mechanisms of VSMC-­driven vascular wall diseases and also for developing novel therapeutic approaches. We 
have previously demonstrated that the transcription co-­factor yes-­associated protein 1 (YAP1) promotes VSMC 
proliferation.  Yet,  the  role  and  underlying  mechanisms  of  YAP1  in  neointima  formation  in  vivo  remain  unclear. 
Furthermore,  recent  genome-­wide  association  studies  (GWAS)  have  identified  a  loss-­of-­function  single 
nucleotide  polymorphism  (SNP)  in  YAP1  gene  locus  that  was  unexpectedly  associated  with  lower  blood 
pressure, suggesting a novel role of YAP1 in blood pressure regulation. The overarching goal of this proposal is 
to  determine  the  role  of  YAP1  in  regulating  both  VSMC  proliferation  and  contraction/hypertension.  Novel 
preliminary  data  in  this  proposal  include  1)  YAP1  expression  is  upregulated  after  arterial  injury  and  correlates 
with VSMC proliferation in vivo,  2) YAP1, in association with TEA domain transcription factor 1 (TEAD1), induces 
platelet-­derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRb), a putative novel YAP1 target gene that regulates VSMC 
phenotype, 3) SM-­specific Yap1 knockout mice exhibit a hypotensive phenotype and an attenuated response to 
vasoconstrictors in isolated vessels, and 4) silencing YAP1 in VSMCs inhibited protein kinase C alpha (PRKCa) 
signaling  and  impaired  actin  polymerization,  which  are  key  for  VSMC  contraction.  Three  specific  aims  are 
proposed to test the central hypothesis that YAP1 induces VSMC proliferation and contraction to drive neointima 
formation  and  hypertension,  respectively.  K99  Aim  1.   Test  the  hypothesis  that  YAP1  induces  PDGFRb  to 
promote  VSMC  proliferation  and  enhance  injury-­induced  neointima  formation  in  vivo.  R00  Aim  2.  Test  the

In addition to traditional antimicrobials, targeting host defense pathways is an attractive strategy to limit the
adverse effect of bacterial infection. One such pathway that has received considerable attention is autophagy, a
process where cellular constituents are sequestered in a double-membrane vesicle that is subsequently targeted
to the lysosome for degradation and recycling. Autophagy is suggested to be critical for cell autonomous defense
because many bacterial pathogens are detected within double-membrane vesicles upon internalization, a
process referred to as xenophagy. Therefore, it is possible that drugs that target autophagy will be useful in a
wide range of diseases downstream of bacterial infections. In this program, we are studying the contribution of
ATG16L1, an autophagy protein that plays a central role in autophagosome formation, in the host response to
two model pathogens –Salmonella enterica Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. By studying autophagy
in the setting of S. aureus we have discovered that ATG16L1 enable mammalian cells to respond to bacterial
infections by producing exosomes, small secreted vesicles that protect the host from infection by neutralizing
potent toxins produced by this bacterium. Our studies with Salmonella have discovered that the commonly found
ATG16L1 T300A allele impacts the susceptibility of the host towards this pathogen in a non-cell autonomous
manner. Thus, the goals of this competitive renewal application are to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which
mammalian cells coopt autophagy and pathogen sensing to control exosome biogenesis (Aim 1) and to unravel
the molecular details of how ATG16L1 T300A contributes to host-mediated protection from infection by bacterial
pathogens. A better understanding of how ATGs participate in non-xenophagy functions can help bridge the gap
between cell autonomous defense and complex extracellular mechanisms involved in host-microbe interactions."
10738736,"SUMMARY
Conventional wisdom says that antioxidants should lower cancer risk by neutralizing cell-
damaging, cancer-causing oxidative stress. However, despite the compelling biochemical evidence that ties
oxidative damage to carcinogenesis for in vitro systems, almost all large randomized clinical trials have shown
that antioxidant supplementation provides no clear benefit and even increases cancer risk. These
disappointing and seemingly contradictory results have puzzled the public and researchers for decades. Even
more controversial is whether antioxidant supplementation is safe and effective for cancer survivors. An
estimated 15.5 million Americans in 2016 were cancer survivors, and up to 81% of them used antioxidant
supplements to promote healing. However, we do not understand whether and to what extent post-treatment
oxidative stress is associated with cancer prognosis. We recently conducted a molecular epidemiological study
of colorectal cancer (CRC). We found the first piece of evidence in humans that the association between
oxidative stress and CRC risk was bidirectional, with both beneficial and deleterious effects. Moreover, these
bidirectional effects were time-dependent. Specifically, in earlier phases of cancer development, high oxidative
stress was associated with increased risk of CRC, whereas in later phases, it was associated with decreased
risk. Correspondingly, we found that the association between antioxidant intake and CRC risk was also time-
dependent and varied by baseline oxidative stress. In the pilot study, we found that among patients with more
advanced cancer, their systemic levels of oxidative stress were actually lower. Furthermore, cancer patients
with higher post-treatment levels of oxidative stress had odds of living longer, after comprehensively adjusting
for clinical parameters. In this proposed study, we will conduct a large case-cohort study, building upon three
Asian and European cohorts to determine whether our novel findings—the time-dependent and bidirectional
effects of oxidative stress and antioxidants on CRC, first observed in Chinese women (discovery phase)—can
be replicated in both sexes and in different ethnic populations (replication phase). Comprehensive
assessments of oxidative stress in pre-diagnostic urine samples will be performed. We will also conduct a
follow-up study of CRC cases from whom both pre-diagnostic and post-treatment urine samples have been
collected. We will examine whether higher levels of systemic post-treatment oxidative stress are associated
with better CRC survival, while comprehensively accounting for pre-diagnostic oxidative stress and other
clinical parameters. We expect that this study, with its focus on the time-dependent and bidirectional
association between oxidative stress and CRC, will provide novel insights into the role of oxidative stress in
carcinogenesis, the first evidence linking oxidative stress and clinical outcomes of CRC, and much needed
information for identification of population subsets for chemoprevention. Thus, this study will have high
translational potential to lead to tailored strategies for CRC prevention and patient care."
10738741,"During the first 30 years of this grant, using X-ray crystallography, we have been able to describe the detailed
molecular architecture of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) in complex with dsDNA, RNA/DNA, and dsRNA.
These include structures poised for nucleotide incorporation, catalytic complexes, and post-incorporation
structures prior to translocation. All of them represent key states for understanding the comprehensive nature
of reverse transcription during HIV infection, and the mechanisms of action of and resistance to nucleoside RT
inhibitor (NRTI) drugs. In a collaborative effort, our crystallographic structures enabled the discovery of two
non-nucleoside RT (NNRTI) drugs (rilpivirine and etravirine), leading to five licensed anti-AIDS medications.
During the previous grant period, major highlights included solving RT structures in complex with a dsRNA
initiation complex prior to nucleotide incorporation, RT/DNA with an NNRTI, RT with NRTI drugs, and RT with
nucleotide-competing RT inhibitors (NcRTIs) including INDOPY-1. We propose to follow up by determining a
series of RT/DNA-RNA/RNA structures to map molecular details of how first-strand DNA synthesis is initiated,
with a focus on conformational changes in RT and nucleic acid that accompany the transition from initiation
(slow) to processive (fast) DNA synthesis. Similarly, details of second-strand initiation will be probed beginning
with a structure of RT with the polypurine-tract RNA primer across from a DNA template. Additional HIV-1 RT
structures with drugs and investigational inhibitors will be determined to further understand mechanisms of
inhibition and resistance, and the potential for additional sites not currently targeted by anti-AIDS drugs.
Although the HIV proteins and enzymes are produced initially as part of Gag-Pol precursor polyproteins,
relatively little is known about the detailed structure and function of the immature forms prior to maturation.
Recently, we have produced multiple-milligram amounts of the HIV-1 Gag-Pol and Pol precursor polyproteins
for the first time. Cryo-EM determination of the HIV-1 Pol polyprotein shows a dimeric structure with RT in a
p66/p51 heterodimer-like configuration at its core, suggesting that formation of the mature RT structure is
guided from early stages of its morphogenesis. Formation of the RT dimeric core also brings the protease
monomers into a dimeric arrangement, thus providing structural insight into the potential role of RT in protease
activation during virion maturation. We will pursue further cryo-EM, crystallographic, and biophysical studies of
the HIV-1 Pol polyprotein and its complexes with relevant binding partners to provide further structural and
biophysical insights that shed light on various aspects of virus assembly and maturation.
The proposed work relies on collaborations with Jeffrey DeStefano (Maryland), and Stephen Hughes (NCI-
Frederick), Mamuka Kvaratskhelia (Colorado-Denver), Ronald Levy (Temple), Dmitry Lyumkis (Salk), Stefan
Sarafianos (Emory), and Gilda Tachedjian (Monash)."
10738746,"Abstract
Is an HIV vaccine possible? Vaccines are one of the most successful public health interventions over the past
century. Nearly all vaccines work by induction of protective antibodies. However, our understanding of the cellular
dynamics of immune responses to vaccines, particularly the biology surrounding B cell competition within
germinal centers (GC) to complex vaccine antigens is limited. This lack of understanding of fundamental B cell
biology has contributed to the inability to develop an effective HIV vaccine. Promisingly, a small population of
HIV+ individuals have developed broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), giving renewed hope that an HIV
vaccine is possible. Recent work has found that many HIV negative healthy human donors have VRC01-class
bnAb precursor B cells. However, work from these studies revealed that these potential bnAb precursor B cells
are found at an unusually rare frequency. This suggested that following immunization these B cells may be
outcompeted by more frequent non-neutralizing B cells. To answer immunological questions surrounding this
problem, I developed a model system utilizing mice containing human genes for the germline-reverted VRC01
bnAb (VRC01gHL). Through this B cell transfer model, we found that antigen affinity, avidity, and precursor
frequency all played interdependent roles in competitive success of rare VRC01gHL B cells in GCs. Critically, we
found that rare VRC01gHL B cells with physiological affinities could be primed to successfully compete within
GCs. However, these responses were limited to specific “GC” islands suggesting B cell competition to seed
individual GCs is critical in addition to competition within the GC. Taken together, these observations suggest
that B cell immunodominance in the GC microenvironment (GCME) is a major obstacle to overcome in
developing a successful HIV vaccine. However, there are significant knowledge gaps pertaining to the
physiological conditions in which B cells compete to enter GCs, and compete within the GCME. To start, what
do we know about the biophysical and metabolic characteristics of the GCME? We hypothesized and found that
GCs form a hypoxic microenvironment. I hypothesize that other biophysical constraints may be acting to control
GC selection events as many pathways have been shown to be both active in hypoxic tumor microenvironments
(TMEs) and in the hypoxic GCME. I hypothesize that in further correlation with TMEs, the GCME may contain
high lactate levels, induce multiple metabolic GPCRs, reduced pH, increased temperature, and cellular pressure.
I posit that these biophysical parameters of the GC can and do influence B cell selection events to complex
antigens. In this DP2 proposal I will investigate the nature of the extracellular milieu of the GCME through multi-
photon targeted direct measurements and define the biophysical constraints that limit the success of VRC01-
class B cell responses. We will then apply what we learn from studying the GCME to manipulate B cell
immunodominance in the GCME to favor competitive selection of VRC01-class B cells."
10889250,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Our laboratory has, for many years, studied the essential process of mRNA decay in
the model Gram-positive bacterium, Bacillus subtilis. We have identified several ribonuclease (RNase) enzymes
of B. subtilis and have elucidated the role they play in mRNA turnover. The viability of a B. subtilis strain lacking
all of the known 3’-to-5’ exoribonucleases prompted us to pursue identification of additional RNase activities.
Using classic protein biochemistry, we recently identified a novel RNase, named YloC. YloC is an
endoribonuclease with a hexameric structure, an unusual characteristic that is shared with only one other RNase:
the Nsp15 protein of the SARS-CoV family. Initial experiments suggest that, although YloC has ribonuclease
activity in vitro, it may function as an adapter for RNA interactions in vivo. Although proteins with significant
homology to YloC are widespread in bacterial species, there is no published information on the structure of any
member of this protein family. The current proposal seeks to elucidate the structure and function of YloC, as
follows:
 • Mutagenize highly conserved residues of YloC to determine the effect on several properties – including
 ribonuclease activity, RNA binding, and structure – and to clarify functional domains of the protein.
 • Identify high-affinity RNA ligands of YloC via SELEX procedures with random-sequence
 oligonucleotides and with genomic RNA sequences.
 • Characterize how the strong interaction of YloC with E. coli polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase)
 acts in small RNA (sRNA) regulation in E. coli and possibly in B. subtilis.
 • Determine the three-dimensional structure of the highly homologous E. coli YicC protein bound to an
 RNA substrate, as well as the structure of YloC and/or its homologs from thermophilic bacterial species.
 This work will build on an initial determination of the structure of YicC.
RELEVANCE: Ribonucleases play essential roles in RNA turnover and processing. A thorough understanding
of the proteins that bind to and act enzymatically on RNA molecules will enable design of antimicrobial agents
that disrupt such proteins and thereby interfere with bacterial cell growth."

Human embryonic (hESC) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) offer great promise for basic
research and for applications in disease modeling. The initial challenge for exploiting this potential was to direct
stem cell differentiation towards specific nerve cell or glial fates relevant to disease. Over the last few years, we
have developed many such protocols that now enable researchers to generate > 50 distinct human cell types in
a dish. However, a major remaining challenge is the fetal rather than adult-like features exhibited by the
resulting cells, which limits their usefulness. The reason for their immaturity is unclear but may be linked to a
cell-intrinsic, clock-like mechanism that controls the timing of maturation. While it takes 9 months for a human
baby to develop, from conception to birth, the same process takes only 20 days in a mouse. Those dramatic
timing differences are recapitulated in a dish, where the maturation of human cells may require many months
to reach adult-like properties. Interestingly, we observe such timing differences in both 2D and 3D culture
including in neural organoids. Even after transplanting human cells into the mouse brain, cells continue to
follow a human-specific maturation trajectory, despite being surrounded by an adult host microenvironment.
 Here we will address this challenge by building assays to measure and quantify neuronal and glial
maturation and by developing strategies to override the intrinsic maturation clock. Towards these goals, we
have established a unique stem cell-based assay to produce nerve cells at very high precision and in a
temporally synchronized manner. The resulting cells then progressively mature from fetal to adult-like stages
over a period of several months allowing us to define markers that predict the neuronal maturation state. In Aim
1, we will build on these preliminary data and establish stage-specific “fingerprints” of nerve cell maturation to
determine maturation states at unprecedented precision. In addition, we will characterize the maturation of glial
cells (astrocytes and microglia) in a novel tri-culture system to test whether the presence of glia can improve
neuronal maturation. In Aim 2, we will apply maturation “fingerprints” as a readout for identifying factors that
can accelerate maturation timing. In preliminary studies, we have identified chemicals and genes that are
strong candidates for driving neuronal maturation. We will further validate those findings in the tri-culture
system to determine the combined effect of intrinsic and extrinsic maturation factors. Finally, we will perform
mechanistic studies to understand how those factors induce more adult-like features in human cells. In Aim3,
we will test our optimized maturation strategies in more complex 3D culture systems to assess whether
induced maturation strategies impact other developmental processes such as cell migration and organization.
Finally, we will assess whether “induced maturation” strategies can be adopted to achieve accelerated
timelines of neuronal maturation upon transplantation into the developing murine brain, a strategy that could
enable new human disease models for the study of neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric disorders in vivo."
10872224,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Migraine-like headaches are among the most frequent complaints following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI),
yet the mechanisms underlying these headaches are unknown. A possible clue is that sleep disruption is also
a common complaint after mTBI. Sleep disruption is a frequently-reported migraine trigger, while sleep is a
widely effective migraine abortive. Based on the clinical connections between mTBI, headache and sleep
disruption, we hypothesize that sleep disruption contributes to the development of post-traumatic headache
(PTH) following mTBI.
A mechanism that may link mTBI, sleep and PTH is the impairment of the glymphatic system, which is a
recently characterized brain-wide network of perivascular spaces that support the rapid exchange of
cerebrospinal and interstitial fluid. Glymphatic pathway function is greatest during sleep. It is suppressed
during waking by central noradrenergic tone and is reduced by mTBI. We propose that the impairment of
glymphatic function following mTBI may contribute to the development and persistence of PTH symptoms. In
support of this, our preliminary data demonstrate that treatment with the centrally-active α1-adrenergic
antagonist prazosin improves both glymphatic function and ameliorates PTH symptoms in mice. This proposal
will extend these findings by comparing the effects of repetitive impact and blast mTBI on glymphatic function,
testing whether treatment with prazosin can restore post-traumatic glymphatic function. Using well established
mouse models of mTBI and validated behavioral measures of PTH symptoms (light aversion and mechanical
facial allodynia), we will then define the role of glymphatic dysfunction in the development of PTH symptoms by
testing whether these symptoms are exacerbated in a transgenic mouse model in which glymphatic function is
constitutively impaired and whether increasing post-traumatic glymphatic function pharmacologically with
prazosin improves PTH symptoms. In a second set of experiments, we will test whether targeting sleep
provides a pathway for improving post-traumatic glymphatic impairment and ameliorating PTH symptoms. In
these studies we will define whether the effect of sleep augmentation on PTH behaviors is independent of
glymphatic function. In our final studies, we will evaluate whether peripheral or central alpha1 or beta
adrenergic signaling is a key driver of post-traumatic glymphatic impairment, and whether targeting these
processes can improve PTH-associated behaviors either through effect on glymphatic function or through
modulation of post-traumatic sleep.
The results of this study will provide a novel perspective on the mechanisms underlying development of PTH
that will potentially support targeting sleep disruption and glymphatic function as therapeutic strategies for
mTBI patients."

Health care research has extensively studied disease pathogenesis, but very little is known about the
complementary process of health restoration, or salutogenesis. Salutogenesis may involve the use of single or
multiple interventions. These may affect multiple targets to restore specific functions as well as affect whole
person health. This project aims to develop methods to study multisystem signatures of health restoration
obtained through multiple interventions both at the level of the organ and the whole organism. Currently, there
is considerable interest in identifying non-pharmaceutical interventions to improve resilience to cognitive
decline during aging. The proposed project will use a mouse model of age-related cognitive decline to study
molecular signatures and functional changes associated with restoration of healthy cognitive function. We will
evaluate two interventions that have previously been demonstrated to improve cognition in aged mice i.e.
exercise and a water extract (CAW) of the botanical Centella asiatica. Eighteen month old C57BL/6 male and
female mice will be randomized into an exercise group (voluntary access to a running wheel), a CAW group
(1000 mg/kg/day, administered in the drinking water), a group that receives both CAW and exercise, and a
control group that receives neither intervention each for a period of 35 days. Untreated male and female young
(4 month old) mice will serve as young controls. We will assess the impact of these two interventions,
separately and combined, on four health measures: cognition, global inflammatory status, global oxidative
stress and mobility using Morris Water Maze test, blood C-reactive protein, blood 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine
and DigiGait respectively. At the conclusion of treatment, hippocampal tissue from the animals will be collected
and transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis will be performed. We will initially identify genes or metabolites
(singly or in clusters) that are significantly altered by the treatments. This -omics data will then be integrated
with the behavioral and blood data to create computational models that will be used to derive the unique
molecular signatures and health data associated with improved cognition. We will also explore whether the
molecular signature changes associated with cognitive improvement are a reversal of those seen in cognitive
decline (young vs old untreated animals), or represent a new salutogenic pathway. A heterogenous multi-level
network (HMLN) model will be used to describe and evaluate the correlations between all health outcomes
described here and the molecular data. Ultimately, similar HMLN models can be used as a basis to identify the
timing and types of interventions that are optimal for restoring cognitive health. The methodology developed in
these experiments can then be expanded beyond cognition to encompass other aspects of whole organism
health.

Protein methionine residues are emerging as essential redox sites for physiological processes spanning signal
transduction, antioxidant defense, and regulation of protein function. At the same time, aberrant elevations in
methionine oxidation induced by oxidative stress and/or inactivation of methionine sulfoxide reductase
enzymes can contribute to cancer, neurodegenerative and vascular diseases, and life span. To decipher
contributions of methionine redox physiology and pathology, we are developing new chemical reagents to
selectively label reactive methionine sites from proteins to proteomes. The scientific premise is that providing
access to a modular chemical toolbox for methionine bioconjugation will help unveil new functional methionine
sites in proteins to further understanding of physiological and pathological contributions through covalent
methionine tagging. Selective methionine bioconjugation using redox-based probes that emulate the innate
oxidative chemistry of these residues offers chemical innovation, while demonstrating scientific rigor through
the combined use of diverse synthetic, modeling, proteomic, and biochemical approaches to provide general
tools for probing the reactive methionine landscape. Specifically, we seek to (1) design robust and highly
specific oxaziridine probes by establishing a predictive model for tuning selectivity and stability of methionine
adducts, (2) identify proteome-wide oxidatively-sensitive methionine sites and analyze motifs to reveal
principles of methionine hyperreactivity, and (3) biochemically characterize targets involved in reversible redox
regulation, with a particular focus on cancer-dependent targets where methionine oxidation can influence
cellular metabolism."

The long-term goal of this proposal is to understand the shared genetic bases of psychiatric disorders to
improve prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of these serious illnesses. Recent successes of large-scale
genomics studies have verified extensive sharing of common variant risk across major psychiatric disorders at
a genome-wide level. Nevertheless, little is known of which and how certain genetic loci carry risk effects
transcending traditional diagnostic boundaries. To fill in this critical gap, we propose for the first time the
systematic identification and functional characterization of genetic effects shared among eleven
neuropsychiatric disorders using genome-wide SNP data on over 1 million individuals. Our central hypothesis
is that there are pathogenic mechanisms shared amongst broad domains of psychiatric disorders, one of which
centers on the development of the nervous system and chromatin remodeling that governs brain-specific gene
expression. In support of this hypothesis, preliminary data based on eight neuropsychiatric disorders show that
more than a hundred of genetic risk loci carrying significant and robust pleiotropic effects are enriched among
brain-active genes critical to cell identity, cell differentiation, and transcriptional regulation. In this study, we will
use genome-wide genetic data of unparalleled size and scope to achieve the following three aims with
independent benefits: (1) to uncover a comprehensive spectrum of pleiotropic risk effects spanning eleven
neuropsychiatric disorders; (2) to systematically evaluate the characteristics of pleiotropic risk genes; and (3) to
identify biological mechanisms commonly altered by pleiotropic risk genes underlying psychopathology.
Through this unique and powerful study, we expect to gain new insight into how pervasive genetic pleiotropy
shapes the etiology and structure of psychopathology. This study will also produce novel analytic methods and
strategies that are applicable in any cross-disorder genetics studies, providing immediate and significant
impact to the research community."
10734055,"ABSTRACT
Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) is a major respiratory bacterial pathogen, asymptomatically carried
(colonization) in the nasopharynx, by a significant proportion of the human population (children and adults).
Colonization is a precursor to Spn disease (pneumonia, sinusitis, otitis media, sepsis, meningitis) which accounts
for a significant disease burden in humans. Despite a decline in the overall Spn disease burden caused by
currently available vaccines, Spn diseases continue to occur and remain a significant medical problem.
Nasopharyngeal colonization is a precursor for Spn diseases, and co-infection with an influenza virus is a
significant risk factor for the development of Spn disease. The influenza virus promotes damaging inflammation
in the nasopharynx, which leads to bacterial outgrowth and dissemination of Spn bacteria to sterile tissues (lungs,
blood) to establish disease. However, the mechanisms implicated in the damaging inflammation and consequent
transition of Spn colonization into the disease, remain poorly understood.
We developed an Spn-Influenza A Virus (IAV) co-infection model of Spn disease, by introducing IAV in Spn
colonized mice. Our nasopharyngeal co-infection model mimics the natural pathogenesis of Spn involving the
transition of Spn colonization to disease. Our preliminary data shows that the infection of Spn (serotype 6A)
colonized mice with IAV elicits a robust IL-17A response that promotes hyper-inflammation in the NP, which
leads to bacterial dissemination (lungs/blood) and the development of Spn disease. An antibody-mediated
neutralization of IL-17A mitigated inflammation in the nasopharynx, results in a reduced Spn burden in the NP
and blood with improved survival. Additionally, we show that innate lymphoid cells 3 (ILC3s) are a potential
source of the pathogenic IL-17 response in our co-infection model of Spn disease. This data highlights the
previously unrecognized role of the IL-17 response as a contributor to nasopharyngeal hyper-inflammation and
the promotion of Spn disease in a co-infection setting with influenza virus.
Based on our presented preliminary data, this 5-year research proposal hypothesizes that “influenza-induced IL-
17 response leads to the development of a pro-inflammatory immune phenotype, epithelial inflammation, and
compromised barrier response in the NP, resulting in the dissemination/invasion of Spn bacteria from the NP
into the lungs/bloodstream to establish Spn disease”. This hypothesis will be tested in three structured aims that
will describe the mechanisms operating at multiple levels from the generation of the pathogenic IL-17 response
and the role of IL-17 receptor signaling in epithelial inflammation and airway-barrier integrity, leading to the
development of Spn disease. The findings will be central to designing interventions for translational utility, in the
future."

Antibiotics are life-saving, but their suboptimal use can lead to antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which contribute to
approximately 2,000,000 illnesses and 23,000 deaths in the United States annually. Unfortunately, the
development of new antibiotics is currently quite limited. Thus, immediate solutions are needed to preserve
existing therapies, in particular anti-pseudomonal beta-lactams, which are the backbone of treatment protocols
in the intensive care unit (ICU). A >500-fold intra-individual variability in drug levels has been observed using
our current standard of “one size fits all” dosing extrapolated from non-critically ill patients. In 30%-50% of ICU
patients beta-lactam levels are too low; this increases treatment failure 1.5-fold and propagates antibiotic
resistance. Therefore, the overall objective of this proposal is to develop a highly predictive, user-friendly,
individualized beta-lactam dosing and monitoring tool for use in the ICU. This will be accomplished through
three specific aims: (1) Design accurate individualized up-front beta-lactam dosing models for critically ill
patients, (2) Develop and validate a dynamic prediction model for use during therapy that identifies patients at
highest risk of either treatment failure/new resistance (drug level potentially too low) or neurotoxicity (drug level
potentially too high), and (3) Identify factors that enhance implementation of these individualized dosing and
monitoring models in practice. For Aim 1, we will prospectively assay beta-lactam levels from residual blood
samples from 300 ICU patients and use population pharmacokinetics to develop a novel individualized dosing
tool. For Aim 2, we will query the electronic records of 5,000 adult ICU patients treated with anti-pseudomonal
beta-lactams to develop and validate a highly-predictive model that classifies patients as either low-risk (high
likelihood of a favorable outcome, no drug level monitoring indicated) or high-risk (high likelihood of an
unfavorable outcome, drug level testing may be beneficial). Beta-lactam use is nearly ubiquitous in critically ill
patients. To optimize the potential for future clinical translation, in Aim 3 we will use focused ethnography
informed by implementation science to identify factors that influence implementation of these new tools in trials
and real-world practice. Dosing and monitoring protocols and interfaces will be iteratively refined based on
these insights. The proposed Career Development Award supports the NIAID mission by striving to improve
the care of patients with infections while providing the research skills, training, and mentorship necessary to
develop the candidate into an independent investigator conducting patient-oriented research. The proposed
training in pharmacokinetic modeling, bioinformatics, and dissemination and implementation science coupled
with an outstanding multidisciplinary mentorship team, and the exceptional resources available at Mayo Clinic
will allow the candidate to achieve her long-term goal of becoming an independent clinical researcher focused
on improving the health of critically ill patients with infections."
10734059,"Suicide is 2nd leading cause of death in the US youth, and rates have risen 33% in 17 years. Clinical risk factors
alone have disappointing predictive power and biological predictors show promise but rarely separated into long-
term and short-term predictors due to the challenge of detecting biological profiles shortly before suicide behavior
(SB). We propose a novel pragmatic approach of examining biological risk profiles immediately after an acute
suicidal crisis and then separating them into familial and nonfamilial risk profiles. Our collaborative work indicates
a stress responsive biological phenotype associated with more lethal and familial SB where inflammation
activates the kynurenine pathway depleting brain serotonin by shunting tryptophan away from serotonin toward
kynurenine synthesis. Inflammation and neuroinflammation can potentially result from HPA axis and
mitochondrial dysregulations. We also find HPA axis dysregulation and inflammation to be more pronounced in
those with SB and family history of SB. We hypothesize familial factors to be mostly long-term and nonfamilial
factors to be mostly short-term risk factors. We propose to examine short-term or proximal biological risk profiles
for suicidal behavior (SB) in stress response and inflammatory pathways, peripherally and in the brain, and
examine familial and nonfamilial biological mechanisms for SB in young adults. We will recruit 120 young adult
psychiatric inpatients or outpatients, aged 18-30 years, 80 at high-risk for SB defined as those presenting to the
emergency department (ED) or admitted for suicidal ideation (SI) with a plan and intent or SB in the last two
weeks; and 40 at lower risk with no SB or SI with plan/intent in past 3 months. Groups will be frequency-matched
on familial risk. We will collect: 1) clinical data; 2) hair to measure hair cortisol concentrations (HCC); 3) conduct
the Trier Social Stress Task (TSST) to measure cortisol, peripheral inflammation (cytokines, kynurenine
metabolites) and circulating cell free mitochondrial DNA (ccf-mtDNA); 4) PET imaging using [11C]ER176 ligand
to measure neuroinflammation; and 5) near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to measure in PFC oxidation state of
cytochrome-c-oxidase (oxCOX), a brain marker of mitochondrial function. Patients will be followed up at 1, 3,
and 12 months. The year post-hospital/ED discharge is a high-risk period for SB and the first 3 months is the
highest risk period. We hypothesize high-risk patients will show higher [11C]ER176 PET binding and lower oxCOX
at baseline. They will also show lower HCC and higher cortisol response to stress and higher inflammation and
ccf-mtDNA prior and in response to stress at baseline. Offspring of attempters will show more severe biological
profiles due to the contribution of short and longer-term risk factors. We will also examine the relationships
between peripheral and brain measures and explore whether they predict SB. This study will improve our
understanding of familial and nonfamilial biological mechanisms for SB to better separate long-term and short-
term risk biological phenotypes, which will help guide risk detection and novel just-in-time approaches."
10726605,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Diabetes mellitus affects nearly one in four Veterans and over 463 million individuals worldwide. Inadequate
insulin secretion from the pancreatic β cell plays a primary role in diabetes pathogenesis; however, the
mechanisms responsible for β cell failure in diabetes remain poorly understood. The long-term goal of our VA-
funded research program is to identify how altered β cell calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis contributes to diabetes
pathophysiology. During the last funding cycle, we identified a previously unappreciated role for impaired store-
operated calcium entry (SOCE) in human and rodent models of type 2 diabetes. SOCE is a process that is
activated in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ depletion and is initiated when Ca2+ dissociates from
the ER Ca2+ sensor, STIM1, leading to STIM1 oligomerization and translocation to the plasma membrane. Here,
STIM1 complexes with the Ca2+ selective ion channel, Orai1, leading to Orai1 opening, Ca2+ influx from the
extracellular space, and subsequent transfer of Ca2+ into the ER. To study the in vivo role of SOCE, mice with
β cell specific loss of STIM1 (STIM1Δβ) were generated and challenged with a high fat diet to model type 2
diabetes. Our results revealed an unusual sexually dimorphic phenotype, where female (but not male) STIM1Δβ
mice displayed significantly impaired glucose tolerance as well as reduced insulin secretion and β cell mass that
was associated with reduced expression of key β cell identity markers and a reciprocal increase in α cell mass.
Unbiased as well as targeted transcriptional analysis revealed a reduction in G-protein coupled estrogen receptor
(GPER) expression that was linked with reduced estradiol and GPER-mediated signaling. This finding was
notable because loss of endogenous estradiol signaling has been linked with reduced β cell function and
increased diabetes susceptibility, while estradiol has beneficial effects in both male and female β cells. Against
this background, we hypothesize that impaired SOCE leads to reduced estradiol-mediated signaling through
GPER, resulting in β cell de-differentiation and reduced β cell function in type 2 diabetes. To test this hypothesis,
two Specific Aims are proposed in this VA Merit renewal application. In Aim 1, lineage tracing experiments will
be performed to track the fate of β cells in female STIM1Δβ mice fed a high fat diet, allowing us to define whether
there is bona fide β cell de-differentiation in this model. We will test whether mice with a β cell specific deletion
of Orai1 (Orai1Δβ) exhibit a similar sexually dimorphic phenotype and loss of β cell identity. Finally, we will
determine whether naturally occurring loss of function mutations in STIM1 and Orai1 impact directed
differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells into β cells. In Aim 2, experiments will be performed to determine
how GPER and SOCE interact to regulate β cell function. Here, an ovariectomy model will be leveraged to test
whether endogenous estradiol signaling is required for the maintenance of β cell identity in the setting of diet-
induced obesity, and we will determine how β cell specific GPER deletion impacts β cell function and
differentiation status. A specific pharmacological agonist of GPER will be used to test whether β cell de-
differentiation is reversible in STIM1Δβ, Orai1Δβ, and ovariectomized mice and in human islets from donors with
T2D. Using the diet-induced obesity model, we will determine if GPER agonists have beneficial and/or distinct
effects in the male islet, and we will complete mechanistic experiments aimed at testing the functional interaction
between SOCE and GPER signaling. Across all Aims, questions will be translated into human model systems
by utilizing human islets from donors with and without diabetes, pancreatic sections from pre- and post-
menopausal female organ donors, and iPSCs from humans with STIM1 and Orai1 loss of function mutations.
The translational impact of this work will be the identification of pathways that can be targeted clinically to improve
β cell health in diabetes with the guiding principle of personalized therapeutic approaches that consider disease
specific mechanisms that may differ and overlap between males and females."

In order to combat infections and reduce antimicrobial resistance, it is essential to detect and characterize
bacterial/fungal susceptibility to antimicrobials in the early stages of infections to reduce the inappropriate use of
antimicrobials and the rate of death. Under R01AI141439 (2018 to 2022), we have been addressing this urgent
need by developing a rapid AST through high-speed stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) imaging of single-cell
metabolism. Through SRS imaging of glucose-d7 metabolism, we determined the antimicrobial susceptibility
profile of bacteria and fungi within 1 cell cycle. More recently, through SRS imaging of D2O incorporation, we
obtained a single-cell metabolism inactivation concentration (SC-MIC) in less than 2.5 h from culturing a colony
to obtaining results. Despite this initial success, there are remaining gaps in translating this technology into clinic.
First, the single-color SRS signal depends on the bacterial size and thus is not quantitative in predicting single-
cell metabolic activity. Second, the laser used in our past studies is too bulky to be used in clinic. Third, SRS
imaging alone does not tell the identity of the pathogens. Fourth, the single-well imaging chamber does not allow
high-throughput measurement of samples separately treated by a panel of antibiotics at various concentrations.
In this competitive renewal of R01AI141439, we propose to overcome these barriers through three technical
innovations. To address the first and second gaps, we will build a fast-tuning SRS microscope based on a
compact fiber-OPO laser. We have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach in multi-window SRS imaging
of single cell metabolism. By fast tuning between C-D and C-H vibration, we will be able to use CD/(CD+CH)
SRS signal ratio to quantify the metabolic activity of a single cell. To address the third gap, we will build multi-
color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) into the compact SRS microscope to enable rapid identification
and fast AST on a single microscope platform. We have demonstrated the feasibility of FISH-SRS for imaging
metabolic activity of bacteria in a gut microbiome. To address the fourth gap, we will demonstrate high-throughput
AST through robotic handling of liquid specimens and a multi-well cartridge design. A team with complementary
expertise will carry out the proposed research. While we use urinary tract infection as a focused testbed in this
proposal, our technology is broadly applicable to rapid determination of susceptibility for other important
infections (e.g., bloodstream infections, meningitis, pneumonia), thus having a broad, positive impact on global
public health."
10815834,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Coronary artery disease causes over 360,000 annual deaths, primarily among older adults, and over $100
billion in medical expenditures. Despite improvements in outcomes, treatment remains beset by unwarranted
variation in care coupled with underuse of high-value care. To address these problems, CMS has introduced
several bundled payment reforms focused on cardiac procedures, including PCI and CABG. The most recent
program – Bundled Payment for Care Improvement Advanced (BPCI-A) – is a voluntary program that creates
incentives for hospitals to improve patient outcomes and reduce spending across a 90-day post-discharge
episode. Despite the promise of bundled payment, its effects on outcomes for common cardiac procedures are
not well understood. Incentives to improve care coordination and quality may encourage hospitals to reduce
periprocedural complications and tightly manage post-acute care referrals. At the same time, incentives to
reduce spending may encourage hospitals to avoid higher severity patients. In this context, we propose the
following aims: Aim 1. Evaluate the role of hospital and patient selection related to PCI and CABG episodes in
BPCI-A. We will link hospital participation in BPCI-A with Medicare data and data from the CathPCI and
Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery registries. We will compare hospital and patient severity
profiles with claims alone (the status quo in BPCI-A) and claims supplemented with registry data (the gold
standard). We will then test whether hospitals with 1) lower claims-based severity compared to registry-based
severity were less likely to participate in BPCI-A; and 2) patients with lower claims-based severity became less
likely to be treated at participating hospitals after BPCI-A. Aim 2. Evaluate the effects of BPCI-A on
periprocedural and post-discharge outcomes. Using Medicare claims and linked data from thousands of
hospitals participating in the registries, we will estimate econometric models to test whether BPCI-A was
associated with improvements in periprocedural complications and post-discharge outcomes. Aim 3. Evaluate
how changes in BPCI-A and delivery system disruptions from COVID-19 inform the future design of bundled
payment. We will exploit a change in the design of BPCI-A to examine whether including spending associated
with cardiac rehabilitation in the episode led to lower cardiac rehabilitation. We will also compare hospital
quality performance using claims-based and registry-based measures and test for shifts in patient severity
profiles for patients receiving inpatient and outpatient PCI. Finally, we will examine the accuracy of target
prices before and after COVID-19. This proposal is significant because it will be the first to understand the
effects of BPCI-A on selection and outcomes for cardiac procedures using high quality registry data. The
proposal is innovative in its use of novel data linkages and statistical methods to understand the impact of this
critical policy question affecting millions of older adults with coronary artery disease."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a leading cause of death nationwide with 65% of mortality due to cardiovascular
disease. The term “diabetic cardiomyopathy (T2DCM)” refers to a condition with adverse myocardial structural
changes, in the absence of hypertension and vascular pathology. Although T2D and CVD are tightly intertwined,
we lack a deeper understanding of T2DCM at the molecular and cellular levels. In recent years, sodium-glucose
cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have emerged as a promising therapeutic for T2DCM, but the precise
protective mechanisms in cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells which construct the cardiac
microenvironment remain incompletely understood. In this multi-PI R01 renewal, our team will elucidate the
mechanisms of metabolic interplay within and between cardiovascular cells which confer cardiac protection by
SGLT2 inhibition. We will harness induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology to generate diabetic models
of cardiovascular cell types for cellular and metabolic phenotyping of SGLT2 inhibition in vitro (Aim 1). We will
construct iPSC-derived engineered heart tissues for functional phenotyping and proteomic determination of the
SGLT2 inhibitor protein interactome (Aim 2). Afterward, we will validate cardioprotective mechanisms in a
diabetic mouse model at single-cell resolution (Aim 3). In summary, understanding the exact role and mechanism
of SGLT2 inhibition in T2DCM may contribute to finding new therapeutic modalities for the treatment of metabolic
heart diseases."

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects up to 1 in 44 children in the United States, and its prevalence has
increased over the past 10 years. Though early access to autism care improves outcomes, children of color
and children from low-income families access care later and have unmet care needs. Though there is a broad
understanding that contextual factors on the neighborhood, community, and state levels impact autism health
care disparities, these factors are largely unexplored. In this proposed research, we will compile the most
comprehensive and largest autism service use dataset ever, combining Medicaid claims from 16 states with
community-level data from the Child Opportunity Index, as well as state education and health care policy data.
We will use this powerful new data set to uncover modifiable determinants of child autism services use
disparities. Analyses will focus on age of diagnosis as well as medication and behavioral therapy use. Then
we will use findings to bring research to action, by engaging a consensus panel of community and research
experts to suggest data-driven, feasible interventions based on study findings. We will also use our research
to expand the diversity of the autism disparities research field, by sponsoring scholars who are under-
represented in medicine and/or who have health disparities research interests, to use the resulting dataset to
pursue additional data analyses. At the end of this project, we expect to have evidence-informed findings
regarding which children access which services, which contextual factors affect services access, and which
interventions can be deployed to address autism health inequities."
10906098,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the number one cause of lower respiratory tract viral infection in infants
and is responsible for ~60,000 in-hospital deaths annually, with most deaths occurring in infants less than
three months of age. Reinfections are common, and those who develop severe bronchiolitis are at further risk
of developing chronic lung diseases such as asthma. Past efforts to prevent RSV infection in infants through
vaccination with formalin-inactivated virus were disastrous resulting in 80% of vaccinees being hospitalized
following community-acquired RSV infection. This has hampered RSV vaccine development for nearly 50
years. We, and other researchers, have used neonatal (i.e., <7d of age) mouse models of RSV infection to
mimic the disease in human infants. Recently, we have shown that type I interferon (IFN-I) responses are
deficient in neonatal mice, which is consistent with findings in human infants. As repeated infections are
indicative of insufficient adaptive immunity, we assessed antibody responses and demonstrated that,
congruent with deficiencies in IFN-I, neonatal mice and infants fail to produce RSV-specific IgA. We identified a
mechanistic relationship between these components by demonstrating that IgA production requires IFNα in
mice. This is especially important, because RSV-specific IgA responses correlate significantly with protection
from disease and, in contrast to adults, infants and neonatal mice fail to mount such responses upon infection.
IFNα administration in neonatal mice induced RSV-specific IgA production and decreased RSV disease
severity. Importantly, neonatal B regulatory lymphocytes (nBregs) expressing IL10, but not IgA, have been
observed in RSV-infected infants and neonatal mice in a time-frame consistent with decreased IFN-I levels.
Together, these findings guide our hypothesis that failure to develop protective IgA responses in the
respiratory mucosa is responsible for RSV severity. We will explore the validity of this hypothesis using
unique sample sets from human infant RSV infection cohorts and age-relevant mouse models with three
specific aims. Aim 1 will demonstrate that the inability of infants to induce mucosal RSV-specific IgA in
response to RSV infection is responsible for enhanced disease severity. Aim 2 will determine whether failure to
induce BAFF/APRIL hinders the development of IgA responses to RSV in infants. Aim 3 will establish that
nBregs suppress RSV-specific IgA production in infants. The idea that age-dependent regulation of type I IFN
regulates the development of protective IgA responses in the respiratory mucosa following RSV infection is
novel. We will employ innovative methodologies including single-cell RNAseq (scRNASeq) on B-cell subsets in
samples from RSV-infected infants and spatial transcriptomics in samples from RSV-infected neonatal mice to
characterize Breg phenotypes, transcriptional programs, and local functions. Data derived from these studies
will have a positive paradigm-shifting impact on the understanding of severe RSV disease and yield novel
immunological targets to advance pediatric vaccine design."

Considerable research has focused on drug use disorders as motivational disorders involving inherent or drug-
induced reward pathway function. However, the focus of this application is on opposing aversive effects of
methamphetamine (MA) that may curb its use, which have been little studied. The Richards (Phillips)
laboratory identified the trace amine associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) as a critical target impacting MA-induced
aversion. TAAR1 is an intracellularly located G protein-coupled receptor. MA gains access to TAAR1 only if it
is transported into the cell. This occurs via extracellular membrane transporters, such as dopamine and
serotonin transporters, DAT and SERT, respectively. We propose that TAAR1 activation by MA in dopamine
and serotonin neurons is responsible for MA-induced aversion and that monoaminergic circuit interactions with
the lateral habenula (LHb) are of particular importance. The overarching goal of the studies proposed in this
application is to understand the monoaminergic neuron-LHb interactions responsible for the experience of MA-
induced aversion via TAAR1 that may reduce risk for MA use. Our preliminary data show that MA activates
lateral habenula (LHb) neurons, specifically in mice with functional TAAR1. The studies in Aim 1 will use slice
electrophysiology to examine the TAAR1-dependent effects of MA in ventral tegmental area dopamine and
dorsal raphe serotonin neurons, comparing slices from wildtype and CRISPRed knock-in mice, mice that have
functional vs. nonfunctional TAAR1, respectively. Aim 1 studies will also use optogenetic stimulation to
examine the effects of MA on glutamatergic synapses from the LHb. Based on our published findings,
functional behavioral studies in this aim will examine the role of a glutamate receptor subunit, GluN2B, on MA
aversion and intake. Aim 2 will perform behavioral studies focused on the LHb, which has been shown to
mediate other types of aversion, has not been studied for MA aversion. We will ablate the LHb in mice with
and without functional TAAR1 and study the impact on MA aversion and intake. Finally, Aim 3 studies will use
a retrograde tracer to identify the LHb neurons that project to either the ventral tegmentum or dorsal raphe.
Electrophysiological studies will determine whether dopamine or serotonin modulate MA activation of LHb
neurons and determine whether MA activation of TAAR1 in presynaptic terminals of ventral tegmental area
dopamine neurons or dorsal raphe serotonin neurons regulate the effects of MA using slices from mice with
and without functional TAAR1. Thus, this proposal utilizes genetic tools, circuit analysis via electrophysiology
and behavioral analysis to identify how MA engages LHb neurons in a TAAR1-dependent manner, whether
LHb circuits are necessary for MA-induced aversion behaviors, and whether they inhibit MA intake. This
strategy could be used to study effects of MA on TAAR1 signaling in other regions. The study of mechanisms
underlying sensitivity to MA-induced aversion could lead to the identification of a new class of therapeutics."

 Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for approximately 15-20% of breast cancers and is the most
aggressive subtype of breast cancer. Given little efficacy for existing therapeutic regimens against a significant
number of TNBC patients and continuously developed resistance of TNBC cells to chemotherapy, novel
treatment strategies with significantly enhanced potency and safety are still urgently required to address unmet
medical needs. Exosomes are natural membranous vesicles secreted by many types of cells and possess many
important and invaluable features for drug development. By harnessing these unique biological and
pharmacological properties of exosomes, we are aimed to develop innovative synthetic exosomes as a highly
potent form of therapeutics with excellent safety profiles for treatment of TNBC. Aim 1 will be design, generation,
and characterization of engineered exosomes that can potently activate TNBC-specific antitumor immunity. Aim
2 will be creation and evaluation of reprogrammed exosomes that can specifically induce immune responses
toward TNBC tumors. Aim 3 will be elucidation of mechanism(s) of action for identified lead immunotherapeutic
exosomes. Successful completion of this project will result in a new class of immunotherapeutics with excellent
pharmacological properties, leading to rapid translation into clinical applications and a paradigm shift in TNBC
therapy."
10893507,"HMPV is a major cause of lower respiratory infection (LRI) in children worldwide, second only to respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV). Although nearly all people are infected with HMPV during childhood, immunity to HMPV
is incomplete and re-infections occur throughout life. Hospitalization with HMPV is more likely in persons with
underlying conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, HIV, or prematurity. There are
no approved antiviral therapies or vaccines. Host or viral determinants of virulence are not known for HMPV.
One limitation of many prior studies is that most HMPV research uses one of a few lab-adapted strains that
cause minimal disease in mice. We have identified clinical isolates of HMPV that cause severe and fatal
disease in mice, providing tools to elucidate mechanisms of pathogenesis. Our preliminary data show that
virulent HMPV potently induces types I and III interferon (IFN), and that these cytokines exhibit discordant
roles. IFN is critical to initiate and shape adaptive immune responses but can contribute to disease; we aim to
define the contribution of types I and III IFN in HMPV. HMPV inhibits type I IFN responses including STAT1
and STAT2 phosphorylation by an unknown mechanism, and HMPV lacks the paramyxovirus V protein or
NS1/NS2 of RSV. Several HMPV proteins have been implicated, including G, M2-1, P, and SH. Published data
from our group and others suggest SH mediates immune inhibition but a mechanism or specific SH-host
protein interaction is unknown. The contribution of other HMPV proteins to virulence has not been defined.
We propose to use in vitro and in vivo approaches to address these knowledge gaps. In Aim 1, we will define
the contributions of type III IFN (IFN-λ) to HMPV immunity and pathogenesis using global and conditional
knockout mice. Aim 2 proposes to identify the cellular target(s) of SH, define interacting domains, and discover
the molecular mechanisms of innate immune inhibition by HMPV. We will use transient transfection of tagged
mutant SH proteins and viruses with SH mutations in cell and mouse experiments. In Aim 3, will use reverse
genetics developed in the lab to generate chimeric viruses and identify viral protein determinants of virulence
using established mouse models. Our preliminary data suggest an important role for IFN-λ in HMPV immunity,
confirm innate immune inhibition by HMPV SH, and demonstrate the strength of the avirulent and virulent
strains to identify viral determinants of virulence. The results of the proposed research will clarify mechanisms
of HMPV pathogenesis and provide a blueprint for potential therapeutic avenues and strategies for viral
attenuation for vaccines. The findings are likely to be relevant to other respiratory viruses."

The end stage renal disease (ESRD) population on dialysis is a longstanding challenge to manage. This
stems from high health care needs, and comorbidities, with mortality rates 10-fold greater than age-
matched controls and costs totaling 7% of Medicare’s budget. In contrast to peer countries, nearly 90% of
dialysis in the United States is performed in-center, at a dialysis facility. The reasons for this are often not
clinical, but related to financial investments in dialysis facilities, and the lower level of comfort by
nephrologists for home dialysis modalities. Many believe that increased use of home dialysis will
substantially improve care of the chronic dialysis population, given theoretical physiological advantages
(gentler and more continuous), and associations with better survival and lower health care costs.
However, the evidence comparing home versus in-center dialysis remains highly controversial given the
paucity of controlled clinical trials. Most observational comparisons are plagued by potential issues of
selection. Nevertheless, the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation moved forward with the ESRD
Treatment Choices (ETC) Model in January 2021, providing robust financial incentives for dialysis centers
and nephrologists in randomly selected hospital referral regions to shift dialysis care delivery from the
facility to the patient home or to transplantation. Given severe constraints on organ availability for
transplantation, this is expected to lead to rapid increases in use of home dialysis. With mandatory and
random selection of model participants, there is an unprecedented opportunity to develop less biased
assessments of the relative merits of home versus in-center dialysis. First, preservation of residual kidney
function and continuous dialysis with home modalities has been proposed to better control uremia and
volume overload, conferring a survival benefit and reduced overall healthcare utilization. Second, there are
potential trade-offs with use of in-center versus home dialysis that can affect the care of comorbidities that
commonly afflict dialysis patients. For example, home modalities may better control heart failure, yet more
frequent medical contacts with providers with in-center dialysis may allow early attention to developing
issues that can avert acute exacerbations. Third, populations at high social risk (e.g., patients of Black
race, dual Medicare-Medicaid eligibles) have lower access to home dialysis, often justified on the basis of
poor housing quality and unstable living conditions. It is therefore particularly important to understand
whether such patients will realize a net benefit from home dialysis. Leveraging the ETC model’s quasi-
experimental design we propose a study with these Aims: 1) To compare overall survival and healthcare
spending between ESRD patients on home versus in-center dialysis; 2) To compare outcomes of care for
specific comorbidities between ESRD patients on home versus in-center dialysis; 3) To compare clinical
outcomes in ESRD patients on home versus in-center dialysis among populations at high social risk."
10923948,"Abstract: Bariatric surgery, currently the most effective treatment for morbid obesity, has become increasingly
common in the US. Besides substantial and sustained weight loss, bariatric surgery leads to dramatic changes
in many aspects of human physiology, including glycemic control, bile acid metabolism, immunosurveillance,
and gut microbiota. These changes, if sustained after surgery, may affect the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC).
On one hand, reduced obesity, insulin resistance, and systemic inflammation may lower CRC risk; meanwhile,
increased exposures to some bile acids (e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid) and beneficial bacteria (e.g., Akkermansia
muciniphila & Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) may also lower CRC risk. On the other hand, increased exposures
to other bile acids (e.g., deoxycholic acid) and bacteria (e.g., aerotolerant species) may increase CRC risk after
bariatric surgery. While the interplays of gut microbiota with host metabolism & immunity have been implicated
in CRC etiology, it is unclear what sustained changes in gut microbiota are induced by bariatric surgery
and how post-surgery “gut microbiota-host interactions” may impact CRC risk. Longitudinal studies with
repeated collections of biospecimens (e.g., blood & stool) and patient data (e.g., diet & medication) are needed
to tackle these questions but currently lacking. ●Building on a longitudinal cohort of bariatric surgery patients,
we propose to investigate, in Aim 1 (targeted evaluation): pre- to 1-year and 3-years post-surgery changes in
potential CRC-related bacteria (e.g., Fusobacterium nucleatum, enterotoxigenic B. fragilis, & pks+ E. coli),
major microbial metabolites (e.g., bile acids & short-chain fatty acids), and established markers of systemic
and microbial inflammation (e.g., C-reactive protein & LPS-binding protein); in Aim 2 (omics-wide discovery):
the most significantly and consistently altered bacteria, microbial metabolites, and inflammatory & immune
response proteins at 1- and 3-years post- vs. pre-surgery, using shotgun metagenomics, global metabolomics,
and proteomics; in Aim 3 (in vivo experiments): the causality and molecular mechanisms of post- vs. pre-
surgery gut microbiota in CRC carcinogenesis. We will perform fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) on antibiotic-
treated, genetic mouse models of CRC using preserved pre- and 3-years post-surgery stools and compare
adenoma/tumor burden, colonocyte biology, and systemic & intestinal inflammation between those groups and
with mice receiving a group of bacteria with the largest and consistent post-surgery increases as identified in
Aim 2 and with control. ●Leveraging a longitudinal cohort of bariatric surgery patients and applying state-of-
the-art multi-omics and FMT in pre-clinical models, our study will fill research gaps regarding sustained post-
bariatric surgery changes in gut microbiota and microbial molecules and how they contribute to patients'
metabolic, inflammatory, and immunological profiles, and eventually CRC risk. Our results may translate into
better patient advice on post-surgery gut health and CRC risk and novel therapies targeting gut microbiota,
microbial molecules, and/or immunosurveillance to reduce CRC risk among individuals with morbid obesity."

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) belongs to a cluster of metabolic conditions
that disproportionately affects Latinos, the largest US minority group. Known NAFLD
risk factors, like obesity, diabetes, poor diet, and genetic risk alleles, are more common
in Latino populations, but we don’t fully understand how these factors contribute to
Latinos’ high risks of developing NAFLD and its sequelae of non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Moreover, prior study designs have
been largely limited to case-control comparisons focused on clinically recognized
disease. This represents only the “tip of the iceberg,” ignoring the large group with
subclinical liver disease due to their abundance of risk factors. This proposal will
examine host and bacteria produced metabolic products of diet in a large study sample
of Latinos (Hispanic Community Health Study – Study of Latinos, N=16,415 adults from
four US centers) with state-of-the-art imaging of subclinical liver fibrosis and
steatosis. Based upon our results, diet and metabolome features that predict NAFLD
may be translated into low-cost risk screening tests. By improving understanding of
specific mechanisms, the study may also help to design interventions to prevent
NAFLD, by diet modifications or pharmacologic or non-pharmacologic interventions."

Rhinoviruses (RV) have been impugned in the development of asthma and are the leading cause of acute
asthma exacerbations. RV exposure evokes inflammation of the airways, but how RV modulates human airway
smooth muscle cell (HASM) function to alter bronchomotor tone is unclear. HASM is the pivotal cell modulating
airway tone, shortening in response to contractile agonist stimulation through increases in intracellular calcium,
through activation of Rho kinase, and through modulation of actin dynamics. We previously showed that RV
exposure evokes AHR in human precision cut lung slices (hPCLS), increases [Ca2+]i in HASM, and increases
agonist-induced phosphorylation of myosin light chain in HASM from human airway epithelial cell (HAEC)/HASM
co-cultures stimulated with RV-C15. We also demonstrate that RVC exposure attenuates β2 agonist-induced
bronchodilation in hPCLS, cAMP production in HASM, and attenuates bronchodilator-induced reversal of HASM
contraction. Our preliminary data shows that TFF3, and other inflammatory mediators, are released from HAEC
and hPCLS following exposure to RVC, and that TFF3 attenuates bronchodilation of human small airways and
production cAMP in HASM in response to bronchodilators. Furthermore, our data demonstrates that inhibition of
TFF3 and putative TFF3 receptors can reverse RV-C15-induced attenuation of bronchodilation. Therefore, we
posit RV-C15 modifies signaling mechanisms modulating bronchomotor tone in HASM through a TFF3-
dependent mechanism, thereby altering responsiveness of the airways to bronchodilators. We also show that
signaling downstream of Gαs-coupled receptors is attenuated in HASM following exposure to RV-C15-
conditioned HAEC media. We propose a central hypothesis that RVC exposure of HAEC attenuates β2
agonist-induced bronchodilation via modulation of Gαs-coupled receptor function via TFF3-dependent
mechanisms. We will utilize HASM cells, air-liquid interface-differentiated HAEC, and hPCLS to examine the
aims of this proposal. In Aim 1, we will determine how RV exposure modulates Gαs-coupled receptor-induced
signaling to attenuate bronchodilator-induced airway/HASM relaxation and how asthma alters these
mechanisms. Aim 2 will examine how RV-C15-induced TFF3 release attenuates agonist-induced
bronchodilation/relaxation of HASM and how asthma alters these mechanisms. Utilizing primary HAEC/HASM
co-cultures and an ex vivo system of human small airways, we will delineate signaling pathway alterations
regulating bronchomotor tone that can be targeted in the treatment of RV-induced exacerbations of asthma to
restore bronchodilator responsiveness."
10894127,"Abstract
 We propose to study whether targeting both the transcription factor ZNF362 and cytoskeletal non-muscle
myosin IIA and IIB (NMIIA&B) will promote better axon regeneration and functional recovery after spinal cord
injury (SCI) than either approach alone. After SCI, severed axons fail to regenerate largely because of the
reduced intrinsic growth capacity of adult CNS neurons and the poor environment for axon extension. Treatments
to recover paralysis and other lost functions are not available and patients with SCI are often permanently
disabled. Many genes have been determined to control the regrowth failure of mature neurons, but none have
been translated to clinical use. There is a persistent need to identify better gene targets and therapeutic
strategies. ZNF362 is highly expressed in the CNS, but its major function in mammals remains largely unknown.
The PI’s group generated ZNF362 conditional knockout (cKO) mice and designed novel small peptides to block
ZNF362 function selectively. Our pilot studies suggest that ZNF362 strongly suppresses the growth capacity of
CNS neurons in adult rodents. After CNS injury, various inhibitory molecules around the lesion activate neuronal
RhoA, which, in turn, activates cytoskeletal NMIIA&B to condense actin filaments and restricts microtubule
protrusion and axon elongation. Because neuronal cytoskeleton is the major machinery to drive axon growth and
the converging targets of multiple signaling pathways that control axon growth, manipulating neuronal
cytoskeleton is also very attractive to promote significant CNS axon regeneration. We hypothesize that inhibiting
both ZNF362 and NMIIA&B represents a dual approach for enhancing neuronal growth capacity and reducing
environmental inhibition around the lesion. We propose to dissect potential critical roles of ZNF362 and NMIIA&B
for controlling regrowth of mature CNS neurons and to develop novel and effective strategies for promoting CNS
axon regeneration. We aim to stimulate robust axon regrowth and functional recovery in SCI rodents by
suppressing these genes using cKO mice and new selective antagonist peptides designed in our lab. In Aim 1,
we will study whether transgenically deleting ZNF362 and NMIIA&B acts synergistically to promote axon
regeneration and recovery in adult mice with SCI. Aim 2 proposes to determine whether blocking individual
ZNF362 and NMIIA&B signals pharmacologically with novel selective antagonists promotes axon regeneration
and recovery in adult rodents with SCI. In Aim 3, we plan to develop combination therapies that block both
ZNF362 and NMIIA&B signals, aiming to yield robust axon regrowth and functional recovery in adult rodents with
SCI. Based on the promising results of our pilot studies, we anticipate that our novel regenerative strategies will
significantly advance our ability to treat SCI. If our peptides are successful with rodent SCI models, we plan to
move this work to peptide safety assessments and further translational studies (e.g., cervical/chronic SCI and
clinical trials). Therefore, this project may facilitate identifying novel molecular targets for CNS repair and
highly effective strategies for treating CNS lesions."

10840954,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a deeply debilitating disorder with severe public health burden. Yet,
current pharmacological treatments are glaringly suboptimal. The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is
a salient molecular target for PTSD therapeutics. Acetylcholine regulates fear learning and memory processes
that are impaired in people with PTSD, and α7 nAChR density is reduced by chronic stress in preclinical models.
Despite this compelling evidence, the role of α7 nAChRs in the pathophysiology of PTSD in humans is not fully
understood. To address this gap, this proposal will characterize α7 nAChR contributions to behavioral and neural
markers of fear learning in trauma-exposed participants representing the full spectrum of PTSD severity. Using
[18F]ASEM, a positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand specific to α7 nAChRs, we obtained exciting
preliminary data indicating lower α7 nAChR availability in people with PTSD that is associated with the severity
of PTSD symptom clusters. Further, lower α7 nAChR availability in amygdala corresponded to weakened
functional connectivity of the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which is a key circuit that underpins
fear learning processes. Motivated by these exciting data, the primary objective of this project is to characterize
α7 nAChR contributions to fear extinction learning and circuitry in PTSD. To achieve this goal, we will recruit 80
participants with trauma exposure sampled across the full dimensional spectrum of PTSD symptoms. All
participants will be scanned with [18F]ASEM PET and participate in an established fear reversal task with
concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The acquired data will be used to address three
Specific Aims. AIM 1 will determine if people with PTSD have lower α7 nAChR availability than trauma exposed
controls, and which PTSD symptom cluster severities correspond to lower α7 nAChR availability. AIM 2 will
determine if lower α7 nAChR availability in amygdala predicts impaired learning rates during fear extinction. AIM
3 will determine if lower α7 nAChR availability in amygdala predicts weaker vmPFC-amygdala connectivity during
fear extinction. A final analysis will determine if amygdala α7 nAChR availability mediates the relationship of
amygdala-vmPFC connectivity with fear extinction learning rates, assessing these receptors a mechanism
underlying disrupted fear extinction circuits in PTSD. The findings will determine α7 nAChR roles in the
pathophysiology of fear extinction and its brain circuits in living people, informing future therapeutic development
to address fear extinction impairments that underlie chronic PTSD symptoms."
10933535,"Nutrient signaling integrates and coordinates gene expression, metabolism, and growth. In
multicellular organisms, growth factors and hormones are ineffective in growth promotion without
the support of nutrient signaling networks. However, surprisingly little is known about the primary
nutrient signaling mechanisms in plants and animals. Plants play a central role in bridging the
conversion of inorganic nitrogen to organic nitrogen in the global nitrogen cycle by assimilating
inorganic nitrate to generate amino acids, nucleic acids, and organic nitrogen-carbon molecules,
which are essential to build and sustain lives from plants to humans. Despite the fundamental and
multifaceted regulatory roles of nitrate in gene expression, metabolism, growth, and development,
the molecular and cellular mechanisms of nitrate signaling remain largely elusive in multicellular
plants. Hampered by gene redundancy and mutant lethality, classical genetic screens had limited
success in identifying key nitrate signaling components in plants over the past two decades. By
taking integrated molecular, cellular, biochemical, functional genomic, chemical genetic, and
systems analyses, we have discovered a surprising molecular link between specific Ca2+-sensor
protein kinases (CPKs) and the NODULE INCEPTION-LIKE PROTEIN (NLP) transcription factors
as the primary regulators of the nitrate-signaling network in plants. Our research has demonstrated
the unique role of nitrate as a central signaling molecule in transcriptome reprogramming and
shoot-root coordination to shape organ biomass and architecture. We also recently discovered the
first plant nitrate sensor NLP7 with a dual function as a transcription activator, and the combinatorial
actions of multiple NLPs in controlling the primary nitrate responses (PNR) central to coordinate
plant root and shoot development. We propose to build on our new findings and innovative
experimental platforms to elucidate the molecular and cellular basis of the nutrient-growth network
that orchestrates system-wide transcription and modulates plant developmental processes. We will
integrate complementary strategies and methodologies to advance our understanding of nutrient
signaling mechanisms for three specific aims:
Aim1. Elucidate the function and action of the NLP7 nitrate sensor complex
Aim 2. Dissect the intracellular Ca2+ signaling mechanism triggered by nitrate
Aim 3. Uncover the CPK-TOR link in nitrate signaling
The proposed research to unravel the nitrate signaling mechanisms will establish new paradigms in
the action of nutrient sensor complexes, nutrient-mediated Ca2+ signaling, as well as transcriptional
and developmental regulation with sustained scientific impact beyond plant biology."
10907009,"The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has been testing a 5-year demonstration program,
Enhanced Medication Therapy Management (MTM), since 2017 to ramp up the traditional Medicare MTM
program, whose eligibility criteria have underperformed in equity and effectiveness as has been reported partly
by our research team. To foster marketplace innovation, CMS purposefully granted the prescription drug (Part
D) plans complete liberty to devise new MTM eligibility criteria in Enhanced MTM. Although previous literature
reported that risk scores often generated through machine learning can perpetuate historical racial/ethnic
disparities in health outcomes, all participating plans in Enhanced MTM have used risk scores in MTM eligibility
determination. A critical barrier to tackling potential disparities arising from risk score-based MTM eligibility is
that all stakeholders have been silent about the disparity implications of such initiatives. Our proposed project
will explore strategies to identify and resolve disparities associated with risk score-based MTM eligibility in
Enhanced MTM. Our long-term goal is to improve health outcomes among the diverse older adult population
by reducing disparities in medication utilization. Our objective is to mainly analyze 100% Medicare Parts
A/B/D data (2018-2021; two years before and two years during COVID-19 to account for the impact of COVID-
19). Our team has extensive experience in claims data, disparities, MTM, and machine learning. The study
outcomes will be MTM eligibility and patient health outcomes. Aim 1. To determine racial/ethnic disparities
associated with risk score-based MTM eligibility. We will first employ regular machine learning algorithms and
use the same model outputs/outcomes as in Enhanced MTM. We will then modify the machine learning
algorithms by experimenting with alternative model outputs, applying deep transfer learning, and preprocessing
data to address potential disparities. Disparities in MTM eligibility will be compared between regular/modified
machine learning and the traditional Medicare MTM program. Aim 2. To determine implications of racial/ethnic
disparities in risk score-based MTM eligibility on patient health outcomes. Higher disparities in health outcomes
among the MTM-ineligible than MTM-eligible individuals would suggest that the MTM eligibility criteria
assessed may lead to worse disparities. Aim 3. To determine the comparative effectiveness of the MTM
eligibility criteria based on regular and modified machine learning algorithms across racial/ethnic groups. The
effectiveness of the MTM eligibility will be measured by the proportion of individuals deemed MTM-eligible
among patients with medication utilization issues. Successes of Aims 2 & 3 are independent of Aim 1 because
the success of Aim 1 is ensured due to well-documented potential racial/ethnic disparities associated with risk
scores. Impact: Our project can prevent risk score-based MTM eligibility from causing more disparities in
medication utilization in Medicare and beyond. This study will assist NIA in achieving its strategic goals of
“understand[ing] disparities and develop(ing) strategies to improve the health status of older adults.”"
10918322,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Due to the organ shortage, more than 15,000 patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) are waiting for a
life-saving liver transplant (LT) in the US, but fewer than 50% of waitlisted patients will go on to receive a LT.1
As a result, more than 2,000 LT waitlisted patients die each year. Racial disparities compound the organ
shortage: ESLD rates are increasing in the Black population, but Black patients receive disproportionately
fewer LTs than White patients.2 Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is a safe and effective treatment that
increases organ availability for LT.3 Yet Black ESLD patients receive fewer than 10% of LDLTs. Efforts to
redress these disparities are urgently needed.
 Assessing multilevel factors that affect Black potential LT recipients (LTR) along with potential living liver
donors (LLDs) is essential for developing interventions that foster equity in access to LDLT. In particular,
understanding how social determinants of health (SDOH) mediate racial disparities in access to LDLT is a
critical barrier to equity in access to LDLT because SDOH-related barriers are concentrated in racial minorities.
Few retrospective studies have identified patient-level factors associated with disparities in access to LDLT
(e.g., distance to transplant center, insurance, and neighborhood income). Understanding the mechanisms of
the interaction between potential LLD and LTR experiences during the transplant and donor selection process
is critical to effectively targeting interventions designed to improve access to LDLT to both the donor and
recipient experiences.
 The objective of the proposed study is to assess multilevel factors contributing to disparities in
access to the LT waitlist and LDLT for Black patients with ESLD and potential LLDs. In this descriptive
study, we will compare access to LT and LDLT among Black and White patients at two transplant centers with
large Black ESLD patient populations (Nashville, TN, and Durham, North Carolina). We will engage LDLT
stakeholders (i.e., potential LTRs, potential LLDs, and transplant clinicians) to identify multilevel barriers,
facilitators, and strategies for overcoming barriers to LT and LDLT using mixed methods. We will leverage
findings to develop an intervention designed to foster equity in LT and LDLT, and assess its feasibility using
implementation science. The specific aims are to:
1. Assess center documented multi-level factors contributing to racial disparities in LT and LDLT
2. Characterize patient perceived multi-level factors that influence access to LT and LDLT
3. Assess the interaction between multilevel factors contributing to racial disparities in LT and LDLT over time
 Study results will inform the development of a culturally sensitive, multilevel, transplant center-based
intervention to increase Black patients’ access to LDLT, and to save lives."

Since the inception Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) in 2003, the University of North Carolina
Clinical Center have led all DILIN centers in total subject recruitment, participation in DILIN's subcommittees,
execution of ancillary studies, and authorship on DILIN publications. In the next 5 years, we propose to
continue our center's leadership as the network strives to attain the four stated goals of the RFA: 1. Advance
the clinical, biochemical, histologic and biologic characterization of DILI. We will continue to participate
in, or lead, all subcommittees, and the majority of ancillary studies and publications. We will expand our
access to minority patients through a new Community Health Care Network coordinated by an historically
black university. 2. Lead in the proposal and execution of ancillary studies and collaborations that
would investigate basic mechanisms of liver injury due to specific drugs and provide insights into
pathogenesis of DILI and potential targets for prevention and treatment. We will continue to support
DILIN's pioneering work on Genetic Risk Scores, their mechanistic insight, and their clinical application. We
will also guide discovery and application of promising non-genetic biomarkers through collaborations with the
major European biomarker initiative (Transbioline), the National Institutes for Environmental Health Sciences,
and potentially with a lead company in clinical application of metabolomics. 3. Develop pilot/feasibility
studies that would lay the groundwork for future studies on treatment of DILI. Our center is well
positioned to participate in a proposed open label pilot study of budesonide. 4. Promote pharmacovigilance
of HDS and newly approved prescription medications (collaboration with FDA) and public resources
for accurate information on DILI (DILIN centers and Livertox). We will help improve the new Revised
Electronic Causality Assessment Method (RECAM) instrument, including incorporation of genetic risk scores,
which should soon be adopted in assessment of clinical trial and early post-marketing DILI cases. We will
help mentor, along with FDA colleagues, an FDA supported ORISE fellow to improve prediction of liver injury
severity using traditional liver safety biomarkers. All four of our center's investigators will continue help build
and improve the Livertox website. In summary, we believe we are well poised to help guide the accelerated
rate of discovery and clinical application that will occur in the next 5 years and are very excited about it."

Numerous genetic variants associated with inherited platelet function disorders are classified as variants of
unknown significance (VUS) because they lack functional evaluation. The functional validation of the genetic
causes of platelet mediated disease has been difficult because of the inability to make precise genetic
modifications in anucleate human platelets. As the precursor to platelets, megakaryocytes share many
functions with platelets and are the natural choice for platelet function studies, but have been traditionally
difficult to genetically modify
. In this proposal, we develop a non-viral and selection free CRISPR/CAS9
approach to make precise gene edits in human cord blood and adult CD34+ cell derived megakaryocytes
using homology directed repair. We apply the approach to functionally and mechanistically define VUS in
ITGA2B, mutations in which can cause the bleeding disorder Glanzmann’s Thrombasthenia. Our preliminary
data demonstrate the precise generation of insertions and point mutations in the gene ITGA2B in >95% of
megakaryocytes. We show that megakaryocytes harboring point mutations or insertions in ITGA2B that are
known to cause Glanzmann’s mimic functional responses observed for platelets from patients.
 In Aim 1 we generate 57 VUS or likely pathogenic variants in ITGA2B and test their effect on platelet-like
functional responses in megakaryocytes towards their clinical reclassification, while at the same time defining
rules for efficient homology directed repair in megakaryocytes. We further deep phenotype and mechanistically
dissect select ITGA2B variants, including in human platelets generated in mice. In Aim 2, we use homology
directed saturating mutagenesis in CD34+ derived megakaryocytes, followed by high throughput sequencing,
to identify all functional amino acid changes across mutation hot-spots of ITGA2B.
This work is innovative: we use a novel and straightforward approach to generate precise point mutations
and insertions at unprecedented levels in human CD34+ cells differentiated into megakaryocytes. We use
innovative methods, including the generation of gene edited human platelets in mice, and saturating
mutagenesis functional screens in primary cells, to examine the effect of genetic variants on
megakaryocyte/platelet functions. This work is significant because it will result in the clinical classification of
genetic variants that can be directly applied for the genetic diagnosis of patients, and provide hope for future
treatment options. Our studies will also provide new mechanistic insights into how variants affect ITGA2B
production and function in a physiologically relevant human primary cell."

Sedative-hypnotic ""z-drugs"" are dependence-forming substances associated with falls, fractures, high-risk
parasomnias (sleepwalking, sleep-driving), and cognitive impairment. However, these drugs are popular and
are usually prescribed long-term for insomnia, despite guideline recommendations to limit their use and to
favor cognitive-behavior therapy for insomnia. Behavioral economic nudges delivered in the electronic health
record are a promising way to encourage the use of cognitive-behavioral bibliotherapy and phone apps for
insomnia and to reduce high-risk Z-drug prescribing. Nudges are insights from behavioral science that fit into
existing clinical workflows, intended to preserve choice but influence decision-making toward desired behavior.
We propose the Study in Outpatient Medicine using NUdges to improve Sleep (SOMNUS) in response to
NHLBI's Notice of Special Interest (NOT-HL-21-010). The SOMNUS trial will simulate the long-term outcomes
of our nudging strategy using microsimulation from our Roybal Center for Behavioral Interventions in Aging's
Future Americans Model (Aim 1), align workflow and nudge performance in the electronic health record to
develop the best choice architecture (Aim 2), and conduct a randomized trial of minimally disruptive changes to
the electronic health record to encourage the use of evidence-based therapies for insomnia in everyday clinical
practice at 60 clinics in the U.S. (Aim 3).
The trial will employ the following two nudge concepts: 1) Social Accountability Nudges that ask a clinician
seeking to prescribe a Z-drug to either justify, in a brief free-text response, the reason for a
guideline-discordant action or to cancel the order, and to precommit to a brief deprescribing plan whenever
prescribing a Z-drug; 2) setting default days supply, pre-populated in the medication order, to a small number
of pills. In an 18-month trial involving 60 clinics (449 clinicians), clinic-clusters will be randomized to receive a)
social accountability nudges, b) defaults, c) both social accountability and defaults, or d) no intervention
(education control). The primary outcome measure is the change in Z-drug days supply ordered per patient.
Secondary outcomes include probability of starting a new patient on a Z-drug, probability of discontinuation
among long-term users, and a physician perceptions survey. To aid in deprescribing Z-drugs, we will also
provide bibliotherapy, access to insomnia, referrals for screening for related problems and visit assessments.
Sample size calculations indicate an 88.5% (95% CI: 83.3, 92.6) power to detect a 6.7% decrease in pills
ordered. This proposal will integrate behavioral economic approaches into implementation research to
encourage evidence-based decisions involving the treatment of insomnia. It will improve the safety and efficacy
of everyday clinical practice for people visiting their physician with sleep problems. It will also provide estimates
of the benefits of treatment to future Americans."

There is an increase in psychotropic medication use in women in their fertile ages. Due to concerns for the
developing fetus, half of women decide to discontinue their medication before- or at the beginning of pregnancy.
While the wish to avoid in utero medication exposure to the fetus is understandable, discontinuation of medication
might lead to relapse, which can have a profound negative impact on the health of mother and child. In our prior
R01, we showed that relapse risks were relatively limited for women with unipolar depression who chose to
discontinue their antidepressant medication before or during pregnancy. In addition, we found limited risks for
those women who choose to continue their antidepressants as we found a small increase in the risk of short-
term but not long-term outcomes associated with antidepressant exposure for offspring. While our findings
greatly help in weighting risks and benefits for women with unipolar disorders, there is an urgent need to
investigate risks in women with bipolar disorders, given that these women are at very well high risk of severe
relapse in the perinatal period which can lead to suicide or infanticide. Currently, antipsychotic medication (AP)
is the most used treatment option in bipolar patients during the perinatal period but data on the efficacy of AP in
preventing perinatal relapse is completely lacking. Moreover, both short- and long-term effects of AP on maternal
and offspring health are insufficiently known. In this renewal, we propose to investigate the risks and benefits of
antipsychotic use during pregnancy for women with bipolar disorder and their offspring. We will use large and
comprehensive Danish and Swedish population-based registers and with this sample size, we will be able to
investigate efficacy of Antipsychotics (AP) in prevention of relapse in bipolar women the perinatal period (aim
1); we will investigate adverse short and long term maternal health outcomes of both relapse and/or AP use (aim
2). In our last aim we will determine the long-term effects (up to 24 years) of maternal relapse during pregnancy
and the postpartum period on the offspring and the effects of in utero AP exposure on the offspring (aim 3).

10883653,"Project Summary
Formation and maintenance of synaptic connections between appropriate neuronal partners is essential for
proper nervous system function. Indeed, impairments in either initial synapse formation or in subsequent
developmental synapse elimination underlie many neurodevelopmental disorders. Synapse elimination that
occurs outside of appropriate developmental contexts underlies synaptic loss associated with age-related
cognitive decline and in neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, defining the mechanisms that underlie the regulation
of synapse number will provide insight into how appropriate connections are formed during development, and
these pathologies of synapse elimination.
Despite its essential role in nervous system development and function throughout life, we still know little about
the mechanisms underlying this process. We do know, however, that glia are required. In order to identify novel
glial regulators of synapse development, I completed a forward genetic screen in Drosophila, and identified 91
molecules that, when knocked down in glia, alter synapse number. Among these molecules is the immune
receptor Crq, which I found is required for glial elimination of synapses in development. This proposal will focus
on understanding Crq’s role in synapse elimination, in order to gain insight into the larger questions of which
synapses undergo developmental synapse elimination, the mechanisms underlying the specificity of this
process, and whether these same mechanisms are re-used in pathological synapse loss associated with aging.
Aim 1 will address the question of which synapses undergo developmental elimination across the nervous
system and evaluate which of these are Crq-dependent. I have recently developed an inducible pre-synaptic
label that makes this work possible, and will generate inducible postsynaptic labels as part of this aim. Aim 2 will
use proximity labeling to identify the neuronal ligand(s) for Crq that act to specify which synapses undergo
elimination, and will identify how expression and localization of these ligands are regulated. Aim 3 will define
which synapses are lost with aging, and identify whether Crq acts as a common mediator of synaptic loss in
development and aging. I will also perform a targeted screen based on a recent transcriptional profiling
experiment I completed to identify additional glial regulators of age-related synaptic loss.
Together, these studies will address the mechanisms by which synapses are targeted for elimination and how.
This is a key question in achieving the larger goal of understanding how neurons and glia work together to
create and maintain appropriate synaptic connections throughout life. Dissecting these mechanisms will also
provide insight into the process of age-related synaptic loss that underlies age-related cognitive decline. In
addition, performing this work will allow me to address existing gaps in my technical skills that will allow me to
carry out my long-term research goals as an independent invesitigator."

The overarching goal of this Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to provide Dr. Hannah Szlyk with
the training and research activities needed to become an independent researcher who develops, tests, and
implements cutting-edge digital therapeutic interventions that can promote health equity in recovery from
opioid use disorder (OUD) plus commonly occurring mental disorders (COMD). This application outlines an
integrated training and research plan that will provide Dr. Szlyk with the skills needed to achieve her career
goal. Under the mentorship of experts in clinical trials, health equity, implementation science, user-centered
design, and OUD research, Dr. Szlyk’s training will focus on the following key areas: (1) clinical trial
methodology (Dr. Esther Lu; (2) implementation science and user-centered design (Drs. Patricia Cavazos-Rehg
and Emily C. Williams); and (3) health equity in addictions and mental health (Dr. Darrell Hudson). Training
in these three areas will be achieved through didactic and applied activities, participation in national
conferences and institutes, and mentoring meetings. Dr. Szlyk will apply the skills acquired during the training
activities to conduct a research project to appropriately adapt and test an mHealth intervention for Black
Americans with OUD plus COMD. Rates of opioid-related deaths continue to rise among Black Americans in
the United States. These deaths are often concentrated in medium-sized metropolitan cities, like St. Louis,
Missouri, where this research is set. Yet, few interventions are developed to fit the unique needs of Black
clients; none address their heightened overdose risk often compounded by COMD which decreases likelihood
for recovery success. Also, Black individuals experience significant barriers to life saving OUD treatments, like
medication for OUD (MOUD), because of structural racism. To address this gap, the K01 research project will
integrate public health critical race praxis, implementation science, and user-centered design strategies to
appropriately adapt an mHealth intervention for Black Americans with OUD plus COMD. The central
hypothesis is that adaptations to the mHealth intervention will improve engagement and usability among Black
participants, improve adherence to MOUD, and impact decreases in COMD. This research will address key
gaps in treatment by 1) adapting an mHealth intervention for Black individuals with OUD plus COMD; 2)
identifying barriers and facilitators to implementing an mHealth intervention among stakeholders who serve
Blacks with OUD plus COMD; 3) examining the preliminary efficacy of an adapted mHealth intervention.
These data will inform the design of a larger RCT for a future R01 application. Dr. Szlyk’s training and
proposed research will be carried out in the outstanding intellectual environment of Washington University
School of Medicine, which will provide her with a multitude of resources to meet her goals."
10865021,"Neurological diseases are a leading cause of death and disability, and despite diverse etiologies, share a
common theme of immunological dysfunction. The immune and nervous systems are finely tuned to both
sense and orchestrate responses to external stimuli. There are billions of neurons in the brain, yet we know
next to nothing about how brain neurons interface with the immune system in the CNS. Recent advances in
neuroimmunology include the discovery of meningeal lymphatic, roles for immune cells in CNS homeostasis
and characterization of tissue resident memory T cells (Trm) that persist in the brain after CNS infection. We
recently (Urban et al, Nature Immunology, 2020) provided evidence that Trm were also generated uniquely in
the brain after peripheral immunizations and infections, suggesting that processes unique to the brain may
foster Trm persistence in this organ after peripheral immunization. However, it is unknown if specific neuronal
pathways in the brain contribute to Trm generation or persistence in this organ and whether neuronal signaling
influences protection by CNS Trm.
 Several CNS diseases in humans have immunological etiologies, with T cells thought contribute to the
pathogenesis of viral encephalitis (VE), cerebral malaria (CM) Thus, a second unknown is the role of brain
neuronal signaling pathways in T cell-mediated diseases of the CNS.
 We will attack these problems using chemogenetics. Specifically, there are highly conserved neurons
within the brainstem, such as the dorsal raphe (DR), which project broadly throughout the CNS and activate in
response to immunity-relevant signals such as stress, pain, and itch. Transgenic B6 mice expressing SERT-
cre target DR neurons. Stereotaxic injection of adeno-associated viruses expressing flox/stop designer
receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD), results in expression of the DREADD only in cre-
expressing neurons. Transduced cre-expressing neurons are detected by mCherry expression and can be
manipulated, depending on their nature (activating or inhibitory signals specified by the precise DREADD), by
injection of a designer ligand. We have obtained these mice and virus systems and provided proof of our ability
to perform the sophisticated stereotaxic surgeries and deliver the DREADD constructs to the targeted neurons.
We will use the chemogenetic technology and our capacity to evaluate CNS immunity and immune-mediated
pathogenesis to test the central hypothesis that brain neuronal signaling pathways contribute to the
generation, maintenance and function of CNS Trm and the outcome of T cell-mediated CNS diseases.
Specific Aim 1. Determine if DR neuronal signaling regulates the generation, maintenance or protective
function of brain Trm.
Specific Aim 2. Determine if DR neuronal signaling regulates CD8 T cell-mediated lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) induced VE or experimental cerebral malaria (ECM)."

 MRI has become a standard method to evaluate the extend of injury in the brain after stroke and
possibly guide treatments. This proposal aims to: i) develop and implement novel multiparametric MRI
methods to determine viability tissue status and to investigate therapeutic effects, ii) to apply these methods to
evaluate the efficacy for hydrogen water, minocycline, and combination of hydrogen water and minocycline
treatment in the established rat stroke model.
 Part one involves development of sophisticated multimodal MRI acquisition and analysis methods to
longitudinally characterize and track tissue viability, cerebral functional status, and cerebral vascular reactivity,
beyond infarct volume. Part two involves their applications to investigate the efficacy for hydrogen water,
minocycline, and combination of hydrogen water and minocycline treatment. Hydrogen or minocycline
individually has been shown to be neuroprotective in experimental ischemic stroke as well as other
neurological disorders. We recently found that the combination of hydrogen water and minocycline markedly
reduces MRI-defined lesion volume, gray-matter cytotoxicity, white-matter damage, and behavioral deficits in
rats after transient (90-min) middle cerebral artery occlusion.
 Our central hypothesis is that hydrogen water treatment reduces infarct size, vascular health, and
improves functional recovery as detected by MRI, and the combined hydrogen water and minocycline further

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of blindness worldwide that is characterized by
pathologic changes at the retinal pigment epithelium-choriocapillaris interface. We recently found that loss of
endothelial cells of the choriocapillaris is related to the earliest clinical signs of AMD, and that a reduced
vascular density and increased number of “ghost” vessels are related to the size and number of drusen and
other sub-RPE deposits. Compelling evidence suggest that activation of the terminal complement pathway and
formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) at the level of the choriocapillaris is a likely cause of
vascular loss and AMD pathogenesis. In this proposal we seek to identify the molecular and cellular responses
of choroidal endothelial cells to MAC assembly; to determine what makes choroidal endothelial cells
susceptible to MAC attack; and to determine if donor cell CFH genotype has an impact on integrative capacity,
function and longevity of iPSC-derived choroidal endothelial cells following transplantation. We anticipate that
completion of the aims outlined in this application will result in an important new understanding of disease
pathophysiology, which will allow us to further develop treatments focused on protecting and replacing
damaged blood vessels in AMD."

 In adults, the skin constantly renews itself and the stem cells (SCs) of the basal layer (EpSCs) of the
interfollicular epithelium and the hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) residing in the hair follicle bulge are responsible
for maintaining tissue integrity, structure, and reepithelization following an injury. However, over an organism’s
lifetime these SC pools of the adult skin either lose their vigor or diminish in numbers which manifests into aging-
related phenotypes that include epidermal atrophy, fragility, hair loss disorders and delayed wound healing. The
fundamental mechanisms that drive SC aging in the adult skin remain largely unknown.
 To date research in invertebrate and cellular models of aging have shown that there is a change in global
occupancy of many histone methylations, and modulation of methyltransferases and demethylases increase
organism longevity. While most of these studies have paved the way for us to understand how epigenetic
mechanisms influence the aging process, there is a need for addressing if these mechanisms also contribute
towards aging of a mammalian tissue. My preliminary in vivo loss-of-function studies indicate that the conserved
epigenetic regulators, Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs), may be functioning differentially in the HFSCs
and EpSCs to maintain their longevity in the adult skin. This is particularly intriguing in light of the fact that
genome-wide studies have implicated that the modulation of chromatin accessibility in aged HFSCs establish a
transcriptional landscape that promotes aging. The goal of this proposal is to add to these correlative
observations and elucidate if epigenetic regulators and their corresponding histone modifications have a
functional role in safeguarding SC longevity in the skin. To this end, the Specific Aims of this Proposal seek to
combine functional in vivo genetic models with state-of-the-art multi-omics approaches to:
 1) Characterize the age-dependent changes in transcriptional and chromatin landscape of the various SC
pools of the adult skin;
 2) Test the functional role of Polycomb-dependent mechanisms in maintaining the longevity and regenerative
capacity of adult skin SCs; and
 3) Establish a functional correlation that age-dependent changes in the SC chromatin state promotes aging-
associated phenotypes.
 The results of this Proposal will significantly enhance our understanding of how age-dependent changes in
epigenetic mechanisms establish a transcriptional landscape that promotes SC aging and will provide new
scientific avenues for translational research application in the treatment for aging-associated conditions and
disorders."

Adolescence is accompanied by enhanced risk for maladaptive decision-making, a profile that confers risk for
psychopathology. Prior work has shown that memory and decision-making systems continue to mature during
adolescence, however, developmental studies have traditionally tested these cognitive processes in isolation.
As a result, remarkably little is known about how the development of memory and the corresponding neural
processes influence adaptive and maladaptive behaviors in youth. The proposed project will test a novel
conceptual model that specifies the neurodevelopmental pathways through which memory guides decision-
making during adolescence. This unifying framework formalizes the neurocomputational mechanisms underlying
two dimensions of memory-guided decision making: specificity and generalization. The proposed research will
test this conceptual model by leveraging recent advances from computational neuroscience, including artificial
neural networks, multivariate neuroimaging methods, and machine learning approaches to predictive modeling.
Aim 1 (K99 phase) tests the hypothesis that enhanced interactions between the hippocampus and striatum
support the use of memory specificity to guide decisions. Aim 2 (K99 phase) tests the hypothesis that enhanced
interactions between the hippocampus and vmPFC support the use of memory generalization to guide decisions.
Aim 3 (R00 phase) tests the overarching hypothesis that adolescents rely on specificity to guide decision-making
due to the early maturation of hippocampal-striatal circuitry, whereas generalization emerges during the
transition to adulthood, in tandem with strengthening connections between the hippocampus and ventromedial
prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Further, Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that decreased hippocampal-striatal
interactions predict risk for depressive symptoms during adolescence. This work directly builds on the
candidate’s earlier postdoctoral work that has characterized the behavioral trajectories of memory-guided
decision-making during adolescence. By examining the computational foundations and neurodevelopmental
trajectories of memory-guided decision-making, the proposed research will reveal how learning and decision-
making processes refine with age during adolescence. This work has the potential to illuminate why adolescence
is a period of heightened risk for maladaptive decision-making, and the proposed research will identify how
aberrant decision-making confers risk for depression. This award will provide the candidate, who has a strong
background in developmental cognitive neuroscience, with critical training in computational modeling with neural
networks, multivariate fMRI methods, machine learning, and advanced statistical techniques to promote a
successful transition to an independent research career. The proposed research study and training plan will help
the candidate achieve her ultimate goal of leading an independent research lab, where she will implement
computational and translational approaches to study the neurodevelopment of adaptive and maladaptive
behaviors during adolescence."
10914162,"SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia. It is associated with significant
morbidity and mortality, being a leading cause of stroke. As age is a major risk factor for AF, this arrhythmia is
becoming an epidemic, with significant socioeconomic burden. Unfortunately, current therapies for AF are
suboptimal: pharmacologic therapies and catheter ablation have <50% efficacy, particularly in persistent AF. A
better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of AF will be crucial for the development of new therapies.
AF is a multifactorial disease, with chronic insults leading to progressive changes in the myocardium with
electrical, structural and autonomic remodeling. Endothelial dysfunction is a hallmark of most risk factors for AF
including heart failure, hypertension and diabetes. While multiple studies showed an association between
endothelial dysfunction and AF, the causal relationship remains unknown. Dr Pfenniger proposes to investigate
the role of endothelial dysfunction, and specifically of its major effector Endothelin-1, in AF using two clinically
relevant large animal models of AF, and harnessing novel gene therapy tools with high translational potential.
This proposal aims to first characterize the temporal and spatial relationship between endothelial dysfunction
and AF, with a particular focus on the transition from paroxysmal to persistent AF. In addition, this work will aim
to determine the mechanisms by which Endothelin-1 creates an AF substrate by promoting autonomic,
electrical and structural atrial remodeling. The objective of this proposal aligns closely with NHLBI's identified
strategic vision to investigate newly discovered pathobiological mechanisms important to the onset and
progression of heart, lung, blood, and sleep (HLBS) health. This Career Development Award will support Dr.
Pfenniger's transition to an independent physician-scientist. Dr. Pfenniger is currently an Assistant Professor at
Northwestern University, with the support of a KL2 Mentored Career Development Award and an AHA Career
Development Award. Dr. Pfenniger will carry out this work at the Feinberg Cardiovascular and Renal Research
Institute at Northwestern University under the primary mentorship of Dr. Rishi Arora. As a physician-scientist in
electrophysiology, Dr. Pfenniger will uniquely benefit from the support of her mentoring team led by Dr. Arora,
an internationally recognized physician-scientist with specialization in basic, translational and clinical
electrophysiology, who possesses expertise in large animal models of AF. The combination of mentors with
distinct expertise – EC coupling (Dr. Wasserstrom), high-throughput cellular electrophysiology (Dr. George),
vascular biology (Dr. Vaughan), translational AF research (Dr. Passman), advanced cardiovascular imaging
(Drs. Lee and Shah), and cardiovascular genetics (Dr. Roy-Puckelwartz) will allow Dr. Pfenniger to build on her
current skills and help her carve out her own niche in the field of heart rhythm disorders. Near the end of the
award period, Dr. Pfenniger will apply for a NIH R01 award, using the results of this proposal to develop an
independent research program to further study the role of endothelial dysfunction in AF."
10888415,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Skin diseases affect nearly one-third of the global population. Current dermatological drugs are inadequate for
many of these diseases, and some have few or no treatments available. There is an urgent need to develop new
dermatological therapies. RNA interference (RNAi)-based therapeutics—e.g., small interfering RNA (siRNA)—
represent a third class of therapeutic modalities, in addition to small molecules and biologics, that enable specific
and sustained mRNA silencing to prevent production of proteins driving disease. With recent advances in nucleic
acid chemistries, five siRNA drugs have been approved by the FDA for treatment of liver-associated diseases.
Key benefits of siRNA drugs include: (a) ease of sequence-based design; (b) high specificity; (c) a well-defined
mechanism of action; and (d) long durability (up to 3-6 months from one dose). These properties of siRNAs allow
rapid drug discovery and durable modulation of disease targets previously considered “undruggable”.
The goal of this proposal is to expand the clinical utility of therapeutic siRNAs for the treatment of skin diseases.
An siRNA that silences expression of the immune mediator, JAK1 (human and mouse), and supports functional
inhibition of JAK1 in vivo, has been identified. Aim 1 (K99 phase) will systematically evaluate the safety and
efficacy of selective JAK1 silencing by therapeutic siRNA in mouse models of autoimmune and inflammatory
skin diseases (i.e., vitiligo, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and skin fibrosis).
Gene silencing in skin requires efficient delivery of chemically-engineered siRNA to skin cell types expressing
the target gene. Aim 2 (K99 phase) will dissect the skin biodistribution and efficacy profiles of hydrophobically
conjugated siRNAs targeting JAK1 following local and systemic delivery. The R00 phase will expand the scope
of the siRNA delivery platform by determining skin cell biodistribution and efficacy of new siRNA conjugates and
scaffolds, and siRNAs targeting immune mediators in the IFN-γ (i.e., IFNGR1, JAK2, STAT1, and CXCL9/10/11)
and IL15 (i.e., IL15 and IL15RA) pathways, for which lead compounds have already been identified.
Preliminary work has developed a dual-targeting siRNA scaffold supporting simultaneous silencing of two genes
in vivo. Aim 3 (K99 phase) will test the efficacy of modulating two inflammatory targets in the mouse models
mentioned in Aim 1. In the R00 phase, biocompatible click chemistry and nanostructure engineering strategies
will be used to construct programmable unimolecular multi-targeting siRNA scaffolds to potentiate combinatorial
modulation of 3 or more inflammatory targets, a crucial goal for treating skin diseases with complex pathology.
This project will establish an siRNA-based platform for modulating gene expression in the skin, and foster the
PI’s continued scientific and professional training. Research in the mentored K99 phase will be carried out under
the guidance of an esteemed mentor committee, whose expertise range from basic RNA biology to clinical
dermatology. By the R00 phase, the PI will be ready to establish an independent lab focused on developing
novel siRNA therapeutic programs for complex skin diseases."
10847458,"The development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy requires the stimulation of gene transcription activated by
Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways. However, targeting specifically these Ca2+-dependent pathways is difficult
due to the multiple functions of Ca2+ in myocyte physiology. Recent evidence suggests that formation of distinct
Ca2+ microdomains provide the molecular mechanism that allows for specificity in Ca2+ signaling. Therefore,
understanding the components and regulation of each microdomain is key for the development of novel
therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of pathological hypertrophy. We have previously demonstrated
that binding of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) to the muscle-specific A
Kinase Anchoring Protein mAKAPβ mediates the induction of myocyte hypertrophy. New data show that the
mAKAPβ signalosome is also required for a perinuclear Ca2+ transient required for the activation of transcription
factors responsible for myocyte hypertrophy. We hypothesize that a pool of perinuclear RyR2 localized to the
mAKAPβ signalosome is responsible for this Ca2+ microdomain, and importantly, that these perinuclear RyR2
are segregated from those involved in excitation-contraction coupling (E-C coupling). The central hypothesis of
this proposal is that RyR2 localized to mAKAPb signalosomes induces perinuclear Ca2+ transients required for
CaN-dependent gene expression that are independent of the canonical function of RyR2 in E-C coupling. Aim 1:
Perinuclear RyR2 associated with mAKAPβ signalosomes are within an independent Ca2+ signaling
compartment that regulates myocyte hypertrophy. The goal of Aim 1 is to demonstrate that mAKAPb-
signalosome associated RyR2 is responsible for bAR-stimulated perinuclear Ca2+ transients that induce myocyte
hypertrophy and that this pool of RyR2 is regulated independently from RyR2 involved in E-C coupling. Using
novel, targeted activators and inhibitors of the perinuclear RyR2, we will demonstrate the importance of
perinuclear RyR2 for the regulation of pathological gene transcription, and show that modulation of perinuclear
RyR2 does not impact contractility. Furthermore, the importance of PKA-mediated phosphorylation of RyR2 at
several sites will be investigated. Aim 2: The dimensions of the mAKAPβ Ca2+/CaN compartment. Aim 2 will
map the perinuclear Ca2+ domain that is specified by the mAKAPb signalosome and demonstrate that this
perinuclear compartment does not affect cytosolic CaN activity, but functions to maintain perinuclear CaN
activity. Aim 3: Requirement of perinuclear RyR2 signaling for pathological remodeling in vivo. The therapeutic
potential of targeting perinuclear RyR2 in mouse models of cardiac hypertrophy will be investigated in Aim 3.
Through these Aims, this proposal will define a novel signaling compartment orchestrated by mAKAPb that is
required for pathological gene transcription and induction of cardiac disease, but does not affect E-C coupling.
Furthermore, completion of this project will reveal how targeting mAKAPb signalosomes can be therapeutically
beneficial in the prevention of cardiac remodeling and heart failure."
10873279,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Degenerative disc disease (DDD) is a major source of low back pain, which is not only the leading cause of
activity limitation and work absence but also represents a tremendous financial burden to the society. DDD is
defined as symptomatic intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration with pronounced catabolic and inflammatory
responses. Inflammatory mediators play an indispensable role in pain development during DDD. As current
treatment strategies for DDD are limited, often associated with high risks, and are not always long-lasting, great
hopes were once pinned on stem cells due to their regenerative and anti-inflammatory potential. However,
various studies (including ours) have demonstrated that the success of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based
treatments for DDD is limited due to the harsh microenvironment of the degenerated IVD that hampers cell
survival and functionality. More recently, extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from MSCs have been suggested
as a potential alternative treatment for DDD. Importantly, as an acellular approach, survival challenges
associated with cell-based therapies are eliminated. EVs are lipid membrane particles released from cells that
function as nanocarriers and, when derived from MSCs, are thought to have regenerative capacity. Targeted
genetic modification of MSCs, with overexpression of TNFα-stimulated gene-6 (TSG6), may promote the
regenerative capacity of the released EVs by altering their content. TSG6 is specifically promising as its
expression has been identified as a crucial regulator of the regenerative and tissue-protective capacity of MSCs.
The long-term goal of this research is to pave the way toward novel, non-opioid, pain management therapies for
patients suffering from DDD. Specifically, this project will determine the potential of different EV subpopulations
released from MSCs that underwent CRISPR/Cas9 activation of TSG6. We will address this goal by: (1)
Establishing the TSG6-modified MSCs line and characterizing cells and released EVs; (2) Evaluating the effect
of different EVs size subpopulations derived from TSG6-modified MSCs (which may differ in
cargo/uptake/mobility) on degenerated disc cells. We will determine the therapeutic potential of these EVs by
evaluating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, catabolic enzymes, nerve factors, and matrix proteins.
We will combine two recent biotechnological developments with outstanding therapeutic potential (MSC-derived
EVs and CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering) with a technical invention for the isolation of EV subpopulations
(nanopocket membrane). The concept of using CRISPR/Cas9 to improve the cargo of MSC-derived EVs for
improved DDD treatment is highly novel. If successful, it promises to provide a new therapy to combat DDD. The
proposed project is impactful due to the urgent need for new, targeted, and non-opioid treatment options for DDD
patients, and hence, fits the R21 mechanism well because of its high risk/high gain nature. Moreover, results
and developments are likely to find applications in other degenerative-inflammatory diseases."
10878850,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
For patients with advanced cancer, pain is a common and disabling symptom for which opioids remain a
mainstay of treatment. The current epidemic of opioid misuse and addiction has led to widespread changes in
opioid-related policies, including prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) and laws limiting dose and
duration of opioid prescriptions. Many such policies exclude patients with cancer; however, recent declines in
opioid prescribing by oncologists and opioid use among patients dying of cancer highlight potential unintended
consequences of opioid prescribing policies. Of particular concern is the potential impact on patients who are
Black, low-income, elderly or reside in rural areas, since these groups are already at highest risk for
inadequate pain treatment. To date, the impacts of opioid prescribing policies on patients with advanced
cancer near end of life are not well understood. This represents a critical knowledge gap because
understanding impacts of opioid-limiting legislation for patients with advanced cancer is essential to inform
policies that effectively confront the dual public health crises of opioid misuse and inadequate pain treatment.
This project investigates how state-level opioid policies can be structured to ensure safe and equitable opioid
access for the roughly 600,000 adults who die from cancer annually in the United States. We will use over 10
years of claims data from Optum for national samples of patients with advanced breast, lung, and colorectal
cancers near end of life. Patient data will be merged with detailed quarterly state policy data, which will be
updated and synthesized with expert stakeholder input. In particular, we will examine the intended and
unintended consequences of mandatory PDMP query laws, opioid prescribing cap laws limiting the
dose/duration of opioid prescriptions, and state-specific cancer-related exemptions impacting opioid fills on
patterns of use and pain-related outcomes. We will further investigate how state policy responses have
impacted disparities in these outcomes. Finally, we will draw on stakeholder expertise to triangulate
quantitative findings and inform policy recommendations. Our specific aims are to (1) assess impacts of state-
level opioid prescribing policies on opioid access and end-of-life cancer pain management across a diverse
national sample of decedents with advanced cancer using difference-in-difference models; (2) examine
heterogeneity of policy impacts, with a focus on historically underserved patient groups; and (3) engage a
stakeholder panel to inform, synthesize, and augment findings from Aims 1 and 2 and develop policy
recommendations. This research will be the first analysis combining claims and policy data to comprehensively
assess effects of state-level policies on opioid access, safety, and equity in this population. It will have a high
impact because it will clarify impacts of wide-reaching opioid legislation for the more than 600,000 Americans
who die annually with advanced cancer."
10733162,"Project Summary – No change from original submission
Cancer is a leading cause of morbidity in the United States, with more than half a million deaths
estimated in 2019. Systemic cancer therapies are increasingly being designed as long-term oral
anti-cancer medications, given the increased convenience of a self-administered regimen. For
instance, patients with operable hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer are prescribed adjuvant
oral hormonal therapy, with an expectation that they continue their regimen for a minimum of 5
years to maximize the benefits. Although many oral therapies have proven effective in mitigating
cancer recurrence and mortality, discontinuation to these treatments are not uncommon. This is
a concern because medication discontinuation before the completion of a prescribed treatment
protocol leads to lower survival rates, increased risks of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs.
To improve treatment adherence and promise better healthcare delivery, it is essential for
healthcare providers to know when and why a cancer patient will discontinue their medications.
While there have been various investigations into regimen discontinuation, the focus of these
studies is either on knowledge discovery or intervention. While knowledge discovery focuses on
characterizing the potential factors that lead to medication discontinuation, intervention aims to
leverage discovered knowledge to design and test effective strategies to help patients adhere to
treatments. Because there are thousands of cancer patients, it is impossible for healthcare
providers to apply intervention to each of them. Limited medical resources need to be allocated
efficiently, such that patients with a higher risk of discontinuing medications will receive greater,
timely attention. Yet, the increasing integration of online communication and mobile computing
technologies into the healthcare domain are generating massive quantities of patient-generated
information. Thus, we propose to apply online patient-provider communications in a patient portal
to supplement traditional EMR data to better understand a cancer patient’s medical experience.
The central hypothesis of this project is that such communications together with structured EMRs
can be applied to learn and forecast oral anti-cancer medication discontinuation. The specific
aims of this project designed to test our central hypothesis are to 1) discover what has been
communicated in a patient portal; 2) infer how patient portal messages and structured EMRs are
associated with medication discontinuation; and 3) determine who are more likely to discontinue
medications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply the messages in a patient
portal and structured EMRs to investigate medication discontinuation for cancer patients."

The microbiota provides many key signals that support development and functioning of the immune system.
Interactions between host and microbiota allows for proper induction of immune responses against pathogens.
These interactions are also necessary to limit inflammatory immune responses against the microbiota which, if
left unchecked, will result in inflammatory conditions including inflammatory bowel disease. Many intestinal cell
types including immune cells and the intestinal epithelium recognize and respond to the microbiota. It is unclear
how such signals are integrated to support homeostasis. In humans as well as in animal models of disease,
compositional changes in the microbiota, also known as dysbiosis, correlate with increased susceptibility to
inflammatory disease. Understanding the role of individual microbes within the community would allow for the
development of novel mechanistic approaches to restore homeostasis in the case of inflammatory disease. We
identified a subset of mucosa associated E. coli that induce intestinal macrophage production of IL-1b. This
activates innate protection of the intestinal barrier but also drives proinflammatory T cell responses against these
E. coli. Specific characteristics of these E. coli as well as how they interact with the host immune system likely
drives these responses. In Aim 1 of the proposed work, we will use in vitro and in vivo models to determine how
these E. coli activate IL-1b production. In Aim 2 we will define the regulation and consequence of T cell responses
against these E. coli. Together, these studies will identify molecular crosstalk between intestinal microbes and
immune system that underlie pro-inflammatory responses against the microbiota. Understanding these signals
will allow us to identify mechanisms for regulating these pathways and reducing unnecessary intestinal
inflammation."
10906096,"Impaired postpartum sleep significantly impacts postpartum recovery, maternal health, and the maternal-infant
dyad. Little is known about postpartum sleep as a construct, postpartum sleep disorders, or their association
with mental health. Data are limited to small non-racially diverse cohorts using measures with inadequate content
validity. Our pilot work demonstrates that one-third of patients with a postpartum sleep disorder have co-morbid
postnatal depression, a leading cause of maternal suicide. We propose to test our overall hypothesis that
postpartum sleep is inadequately assessed, and postpartum sleep disorders are underdiagnosed and linked to
postnatal depression. The Structured Clinical Interview for Sleep Disorders (SCISD-R) diagnoses common DSM-
5 sleep disorders, including insomnia disorder. However, SCISD-R is impractical outside research settings.
Wrist-worn actigraphy devices can also be used to measure sleep objectively. In contrast, patient-reported
outcome measures (PROs) are inexpensive, self-reported tools, which can be used to assess postpartum well-
being in large cohorts. Our recent work highlights that existing sleep PROs inadequately assess important
postpartum sleep domains such as infant sleep, nocturnal feeding patterns, awakenings, and protected maternal
sleep time. Clinicians currently lack robust PROs to assess postpartum sleep and screen for postpartum sleep
disorders. We therefore propose developing, calibrating, and validating sensitive, context-specific, sleep PROs
that capture the symptoms and dimensions of postpartum sleep, while screening for postpartum sleep disorders.
To achieve this objective, we will implement novel Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information
System® (PROMIS®) ‘gap’ methodology to: (1) adapt existing PROMIS Sleep Disturbance and Sleep-Related
Impairment PROs for postpartum use by identifying new PRO items, which improve their content validity, through
qualitative interviews and focus group meetings with ≥75 stakeholders and cognitive debriefing interviews with
≥20 patients; (2) calibrate and finalize the adapted postpartum sleep PROs through psychometric evaluation in
a racially and socioeconomically diverse cohort of 640 (160 White non-Hispanic, White Hispanic, Black and
Asian) women recruited across two hospitals in Stanford, CA and Little Rock, AR. Women will complete sleep,
global health and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale PROs at 4 postpartum time points (inpatient, 3 and 6
weeks, 6 months). SCISD-R will also be conducted in 300 of these women at 6 weeks and 6 months, as a gold
standard, to determine screening sensitivity and specificity of the adapted PROs. In 50 women, sleep data, (day,
nocturnal and total awake time), will also be compared between actigraphy and the adapted PROs; and (3)
characterize postpartum sleep and its association with postnatal depression using causal inference approaches.
Rigorous validation of the sleep PROs will support their widespread use to assess postpartum sleep, screen for
sleep disorders, identify disparities, explore links with postnatal depression, and to promote maternal health and
well-being. As such the proposed study aligns well with Goals 3 and 4 of the 2021 NIH Sleep Research Plan."

The overarching goal of this proposal is to understand, at a mechanistic level, how visual working memory is
controlled. It will achieve this by pursuing two Specific Aims:
Specific Aim I: To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the control of priority in working memory
Specific Aim II: To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the active removal of information from working memory
Working memory is understood to be a necessary elemental contributor to many aspects of high-level cognition
– including cognitive control, problem solving, and planning – and its impairment is characteristic of many
psychopathologies and psychiatric syndromes – including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), major
depressive disorder (MDD), and schizophrenia. The research pursuing Specific Aim I entails modeling working
memory behavior with recurrent neural networks, to refine algorithm-level models of the operations that
contribute to the control of priority working memory, then testing these models in human brains with functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and transcranial magnetic stimulation
(TMS). The research pursuing Specific Aim II entails the study of active-removal from working memory with
model-based analysis (using a reinforcement learning-based model of cognitive control) and computational
simulations of fMRI data, and with repetitive (r)TMS targeting frontal circuits responsible for active-removal
versus for the control of priority."
10930177,"Summary – Ecological Core
Recent advances in spatial ‘omics’ have led to an increased interest in studying and predicting emergent
aggregate behavior and interactions between the tumor and its microenvironment. Tumors are dynamic,
rapidly evolving and undergoing ecological shifts; therefore, the understanding of tumor progression and
response to therapy will benefit from studying eco-evolutionary interactions over time. Investigation of the
spatial and spatiotemporal interactions within the tumor immune microenvironment requires computational
approaches to identify and investigate the diverse ecological patterns that emerge by virtue of these complex
dynamics. The Ecological Analysis Core will cater to the generation, investigation, and application of the spatial
ecological models and techniques to support the two non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-focused Projects of
the proposal. Given that ecological change over space and/or time (the Δ-Ecology) is a central theme shared
by both Projects, the Core is poised to support and tailor the tools to the requirements of each Project. The
Core will have the capability to the ability to manage, visualize, store, share, and perform quantitative analyses
of the high-dimensional and high-resolution clinical and experimental histology images. We will also build
important computational approaches and developmental frameworks to improve our understanding and
prediction of emergent tumor behavior using the images. In summary, the Core will develop and apply spatial
ecological models in concert with mathematical models from the Mathematical Modeling Core to understand
the evolutionary ecology underlying the diversity and maintenance of tumor heterogeneity, and how this can be
leveraged to guide new therapeutic strategies for lung cancer."

Over the past 5 years, the DILIN Prospective and Retrospective studies have led to significant improvements in DILI
causality assessment (e.g. RECAM, HCV/ HEV testing) and improved understanding of the risk factors and outcomes of
DILI due to individual drugs and HDS products. Mechanistic insights include the identification of PTPN22 as a DILI
susceptibility factor across multiple drugs and patient ethnicities, a polygenic risk score for augmentin DILI, and other
drug-specific HLA allele associations. Furthermore, our University of Michigan site has created human liver organoids
(HLO) from iPSC-derived hepatocytes from DILIN patients that provide an exciting and unprecedented opportunity to
study DILI mechanisms in vitro at the individual patient level using a 384 well plate for high throughput screening as well
as a bioengineered dual chamber liver chip system. In the next 5 years, our PRIMARY AIM is to enroll additional high
causality DILI cases of varying age, gender, and ethnicity for further genetic susceptibility and natural history studies. To
accomplish this, we propose new co-investigators and recruitment sites, use of EMR searching algorithms, and increased
enrollment of ethnic minority patients by collaborating with other major medical centers and nearby members of the
Michigan Hepatotoxicity Network. Our SECOND AIM is to perform novel ancillary studies of diagnostic and prognostic
DILI biomarkers using genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic discovery approaches that utilize the clinical data,
biological samples and HDS products from enrolled patients. We also propose to improve our understanding of the
long-term outcomes in DILI patients by analyzing the 4-year liver elastography data and propose to improve the
diagnostic accuracy of the RECAM by incorporating genetic data in conjunction with international collaborators. In
addition, we propose to develop up to 50 total HLO lines from GWAS genotyped DILIN patients at Michigan to explore
the cellular and molecular events underlying DILI pathogenesis and incorporate iPSC-derived liver sinusoidal endothelial
cells and PBMCs into the HLO test system. Our THIRD AIM is for DILIN to become a national pharmacovigilance system
that can reliably detect and report new causes of hepatotoxicity in the United States. To accomplish this, we propose to
interact more regularly with members of the FDA, AASLD, AGA, and other professional societies via electronic platforms
and expansion of the DILIN sponsored @Livertox TWITTER account. We also propose to revamp the DILIN.org website
to provide more useful clinical data and tools for practicioners and update the LiverTox website drug likelihood scores
and create new chapters on HDS hepatotoxicity. Lastly, we propose a framework for the AASLD to assume the operation
of the LiverTox website after DILIN is completed. Our FOURTH AIM is to propose a pilot clinical trial of budesonide in
patients with severe acute hepatocelular DILI and jaundice. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of short-
term open-label oral budesonide in hastening liver injury recovery compared to a contemporaneous cohort of untreated
propensity-matched controls. With our track record as a leading enroller in the DILIN Registry studies since 2003 and
the successful design and execution of informative ancillary studies, we believe that Michigan is well equipped to help
DILIN achieve its goals in the next 5 years."
10731373,"Aims and Rationale: Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of premature death in the United States.
Veterans smoke at a higher rate than the U.S. population (21.6% vs. 15%), and therefore suffer
disproportionately from smoking–related illness. To reduce the enormous health and economic harms of
smoking amongst Veterans, we need a comprehensive approach to engage all Veterans who smoke in
treatment that effectively helps them stop smoking. Unfortunately, most smokers are unwilling to make a quit
attempt at any given time (70%-90%), and we know little about how to effectively engage such smokers in
treatment and help them quit. The standard recommended intervention for such smokers, brief advice to quit,
is far too minimal to mobilize most smokers to make an aided quit attempt. Thus, a critical public health
challenge is to identify successful interventions that motivate smokers to make quit attempts and improve their
likelihood of success when they try. The proposed research will address gaps in smoking treatment by
evaluating Enhanced Chronic Care, an intervention designed to increase treatment engagement and
abstinence amongst Veterans initially unwilling to quit smoking. Enhanced Chronic Care provides ongoing
motivational interventions and interpersonal support designed to promote readiness to change, with facilitated
access to both smoking reduction and cessation treatments that are appropriate for all smokers (both those
willing and unwilling to make quit attempts). Reduction treatment is a notable addition to chronic care since it
can increase the proportion of smokers who enter smoking treatment, and increase quit attempts and
abstinence amongst smokers initially unwilling to quit. Enhanced Chronic Care will be compared with Standard
Care (brief advice to quit once per year) on criteria that are of great clinical and public health importance: long-
term abstinence (primary outcome), treatment reach, cost-effectiveness, and implementation. Such
comprehensive data will permit identification of an optimal smoking treatment strategy for VA clinical practice.
Methods: We will evaluate these interventions using a rigorous 2-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT).
Veterans who smoke daily, but who are not willing to enter smoking cessation treatment (the vast majority of
smokers), will be eligible to participate, with no obligation to quit or reduce their smoking. Participants (N=500)
will be randomized to one of the following treatments: 1) Enhanced Chronic Care (n=250) or 2) Standard Care
(n=250). These intervention conditions will last 2 years to permit analysis of their cumulative impact on
abstinence (primary outcome) and treatment use, and to gather information on factors, including cost-
effectiveness, that could affect the implementation and effectiveness of Enhanced Chronic Care.
Innovation/Significance: This research is highly innovative in that it will be the first study to experimentally
evaluate chronic care for smokers who are unwilling to make a quit attempt. It will provide the most
comprehensive evaluation of a chronic care smoking treatment to date, one that rigorously tests the
effectiveness of a chronic care intervention involving an ongoing motivational intervention with ready access to
evidence-based reduction and cessation treatment, while simultaneously gathering secondary implementation
data to inform subsequent implementation efforts and research. This research has important clinical and public
health significance because smoking is especially common amongst Veterans and is the leading preventable cause
of disease and disability. Success in treating smoking in healthcare has been limited because smokers use
smoking treatments far too infrequently and the treatments that they do receive are typically of modest intensity
and effectiveness. The proposed research builds on our expertise and prior research findings to address these
critical knowledge gaps by identifying an intervention that, over time, should greatly increase both Veterans’
use of effective treatments and their quitting success, thereby leading to significant declines in tobacco-related
morbidity and mortality."
10731374,"Objectives: The overall objective of the proposed CDA-2, “Understanding and targeting stress reactivity in
women Veterans with alcohol misuse”, is for the candidate to receive mentored training on, and to develop
skills for, conducting research among women Veterans. Women are expected to comprise 35% of the U.S.
Veteran population by 2035, making them the fastest growing segment of VHA users. Within this growing
population, understanding their particular clinical needs will become increasingly important. Alcohol misuse is
one clinical issue salient for women Veterans. Recent estimates of lifetime alcohol use disorder among women
Veterans are up to 27%, equaling those of their male counterparts and exceeding those of civilian women, and
women with alcohol misuse have high rates of co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Training
goals of the CDA-2 grant include learning novel research methods, neurobiological markers of stress and
addiction, advanced statistics, and professional development, all within the context of improving care for
women Veterans. Aims for the study proposed in this CDA-2 project are two-fold: 1. conduct a randomized trial
testing the effects of an emotion regulation skill (cognitive reappraisal) on stress-induced drinking among
women with alcohol misuse and varying levels of co-occurring PTSD; 2. examine whether progesterone levels
and/or severity of co-occurring PTSD – factors which impact women’s stress reactivity and emotion regulation
– moderate the effectiveness of the cognitive reappraisal in reducing stress-induced drinking. Research has
shown that serum levels of progesterone and its metabolites are associated with less stress reactivity, less
alcohol craving and use, and better ability to regulate emotion. Women with PTSD, however, exhibit a deficit in
progesterone metabolism, and women’s alcohol use and craving has been shown to fluctuate across the
menstrual cycle. This research suggests that women with low progesterone levels, within the context of
menstrual cycle phase or co-occurring PTSD, may be particularly prone to stress-induced drinking and may
benefit from learning and using effective emotion regulation skills. Methods: The proposed study will use
innovative methodology, combining experimental sessions in a randomized trial with daily longitudinal data
collection. Each woman Veteran (n=60) will be randomized to one of two conditions: a control condition (n=30)
or a condition in which participants learn to use cognitive reappraisal to regulate stress and negative emotion
(n=30). Women in the cognitive reappraisal condition will be asked to practice and use this skill over a 35-day
period (to encompass an entire menstrual cycle), and will complete daily logs of alcohol use and stress. Each
participant will come in for two experimental sessions, scheduled at the time of her peak and lowest
progesterone levels, during which participants in the cognitive reappraisal condition will use that skill in
response to a personalized stress induction. Throughout these sessions, the effect of cognitive reappraisal on
the following variables (after the stress induction) will be assessed: (1) alcohol craving, (2) inhibitory (cognitive)
control, and (3) physiological arousal (heart rate variability). These three variables, and (4) stress-induced
drinking during the 35-day period, will be the main study outcome variables. Results/Implications: Results from
this study will enhance knowledge of at-risk groups of Veterans (women Veterans with mental health
conditions) with Veteran-salient illnesses (PTSD and alcohol misuse) and advance the field of personalized
medicine to improve the effectiveness of treatment. The study uses a novel approach (“microintervention”
design) which isolates therapeutic strategies typically taught in larger therapeutic protocols, to understand their
effects. The training and experiences included in this CDA-2 will provide the candidate with skills and
knowledge in studying stress, substance use, and cognitive control among women Veterans. The line of
research and training will facilitate the candidate’s career development, accelerating her progression in
becoming a women’s health researcher in the VA."

Type 1 diabetes affects more than 1.25 million people in the United States and the annual
incidence is increasing at an alarming rate of 3-4%. The emotional and financial burden of the
disease is overwhelming and we currently have no way to predict or prevent new cases. As we
gain a better understanding of the pathophysiological processes in the pancreas and the
downstream effects of hyperglycemia (and periodic hypoglycemia during treatment), more
robust biomarker assays are needed to improve the reproducibility of research findings and to
translate those findings to clinical care. One technology that can provide robust, transferable
assays for the measurement of proteins is liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
By directly detecting the analyte of interest, assays that use mass spectrometry detection can
have better specificity than immunoassays and when paired with enrichment strategies, they
can also be very sensitive. As we have demonstrated previously, it is straightforward to
harmonize the results of mass spectrometric assays, which is significantly more difficult for
immunoassays in general. This proposal aims to generate and validate novel transferable
protein assays that harness the power of mass spectrometry. We aim to leverage a new method
for the enrichment of extracellular vesicles and new de novo proteins for affinity enrichment,
called minibinders, to help with sensitivity of the methods. Whenever possible, assays will be
multiplexed and if antibodies are required for enrichment, they will be widely distributed through
the Iowa Hybridoma Bank. Plasmids encoding minibinders will be deposited at Addgene.
Chromatographic data from method development (particularly peptide selection, which will use
narrow-window data-independent acquisition rather than relying on algorithms or data-
dependent acquisition methods) as well as chromatographic data from method validation will be
distributed via Panorama, along with detailed standard operating procedures. As requested in
RFA DK-21-031, a portion of the assays produced will target glucagon, other fragments of
proglucagon, proinsulin and its fragments, glycated soluble CD59, amylin, and the
chromogranins. Our Target Prioritization Committee will help identify the most important
proteins to add to this list and focus our development efforts."

The psychosocial care of patients with advanced lung cancer (ALC) has not kept pace with current medical
treatments, creating significant gaps in care. Treatments like immunotherapy have radically changed ALC care,
yielding less toxicity and unprecedented increases in 5-year survival. However, mental health and quality of life
concerns persist, which must be addressed to fully realize the survival benefits of these medical
advancements. To meet the needs of patients in this new treatment context, psychosocial and palliative care
for ALC must shift from a predominant end-of-life framework to one of survivorship. A hope-based intervention
to support patients’ goal pursuits in their family, social, work, and leisure lives is a promising approach to
support mental health and quality of life in this current context. The long-term goal of this research is to
improve ALC patient mental health and quality of life during cancer treatment. The overall objective in this
application is to test the efficacy of a novel psychosocial intervention called “Pathways” to support personal
goal pursuit during ALC treatment. The central hypothesis is that Pathways will reduce goal disruption and
thereby improve mental health and quality of life during ALC treatment. The rationale for this project is that
Pathways, a brief, hope-based intervention delivered primarily at the point of ALC patient care by a range of
healthcare providers (e.g., nurse, occupational therapist, social worker) has demonstrated feasibility and
acceptability to ALC patients, with encouraging preliminary effects on goal disruption, mental health, and
quality of life outcomes. The central hypothesis will be tested through two specific aims: 1) Test the efficacy of
Pathways against enhanced usual care; and 2) Evaluate goal interference and goal adjustment as mediators of
intervention effects. Because ALC disproportionately affects rural, older underserved populations who have
been underrepresented in psychosocial intervention trials, Aim 3 will use mixed-methods to evaluate the reach
and effectiveness of the Pathways intervention among these subgroups. To accomplish these aims, 234
patients undergoing treatment for ALC at the University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center will be randomized
to Pathways or enhanced usual care, with outcomes collected, pre, post, and at follow-up. The research
proposed in this application is innovative because it is testing a novel intervention with respect to intervention
focus and intervention delivery at the point of ALC care. The proposed research is significant because it will
determine the efficacy of an intervention that is responsive to patients’ needs in the current medical landscape
for ALC and has high potential for broad dissemination into routine ALC care in both high- and low-resourced
settings. Once efficacy is demonstrated, the effectiveness of the intervention will be tested in both academic
and community oncology practices with other advanced cancer patient populations, significantly advancing
psychosocial and palliative care in this new treatment era and ultimately having a large impact on the over
600,000 people living with advanced cancer in the U.S."

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal genetic disease that currently affects ~100,000 people worldwide. CF is caused
by a spectrum of loss-of-function mutations that compromise the biogenesis and/ or function of the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) ion channel, most of which enhance its misfolding and
degradation. Recent drug discovery efforts have yielded a suite of approved small molecule “correctors” that
enhance the expression of misfolded CFTR variants and “potentiators” that restore conductance to CFTR
variants with defective gating. Combinations of these molecules have recently revolutionized the treatment of
the ~90% of CF patients bearing at least one copy of the well-studied ΔF508 CFTR variant, which is highly
penetrant among Caucasians. However, the efficacy of current combinatorial therapies varies widely among the
~10% of patients bearing diverse combinations of rare, uncharacterized CF variants with divergent
pharmacological properties (“theratype”). Efforts to expand the labels of current therapeutics and maximize the
number of treatable CF genotypes, in particular amongst non-white populations, are constrained by the large
number of CF variants and the limited throughput of current methods. Identifying rare CF variants that respond
to therapeutic cocktails is likely to become even more challenging as new correctors and/ or potentiators gain
approval. Addressing this challenge requires new techniques that enable efficient biochemical and/ or
pharmacological profiling of rare CF variants. In the following, we propose to address this challenge with a unique
fusion of emerging genetic, biochemical, and computational methods. We show how deep mutational scanning
(DMS) can be used to compare the effects of correctors on the expression of hundreds of variants in parallel.
Our preliminary findings provide an unprecedented glimpse of the divergent theratypes of CF variants while
identifying numerous variants with unique biochemical and/ or pharmacological properties. We first propose to
expand on these investigations in order to measure the response of the complete set of CFTR2 missense
variants to a panel of structurally diverse corrector molecules. We will then characterize the interactomes of
variants with distinct corrector responses to identify CFTR interactions that antagonize the effects of these small
molecules. We will then fuse CRISPR/ Cas9 technology with DMS to determine how these interactions impact
the spectrum of CF variant theratypes. Using state-of-the-art structural modeling approaches, we will then
identify structural defects in the CFTR protein that are associated with the formation of antagonistic interactions
and deviations in CFTR variant theratype. We will then utilize machine learning to classify CF variants based on
their observed pharmacological properties. Finally, we will assess the effects of approved correctors on the
functional properties of previously uncharacterized variants using industry-standard short-circuit current analysis
in Fischer Rat Thyroid and human airway epithelial cells. Together, these investigations will help expand the list
of treatable CF genotypes and provide new tools to optimize the targeting of CF drugs."

People of African ancestry have been grossly underrepresented in genetic studies, across domains and
disciplines. In aggregate, this is most visible through the constitution of large genetic databases like gnomAD, in
which only 14% of individuals have some African ancestry. The great majority of those African-ancestry
individuals are African American, and most commonly have a mixture of West African and European ancestry.
This means that East African populations, and other Africans living on the African continent, are even further
underrepresented in genetic studies to date. If African ancestry individuals remain underrepresented in genetic
research, they will continue to be less likely to receive accurate genetic diagnoses and less likely to benefit from
advances in genomic medicine. Here, we will use data from gnomAD, NeuroDev and NeuroGAP-Psychosis to
address this representation gap and to improve medical genetic and diagnostic pipelines for individuals of all
types of African ancestry (Aim 1). The pipeline improvements will be made immediately available through seqr,
an open access analysis platform that is available on AnVIL for use by the medical genetics community. We will
genetically characterize all participants from the NeuroDev Kenya project (NDK) and use this data to test and
improve this pipeline and identify genetic diagnoses for participants (Aim 2). Using data from NDK’s 3 hour
medical, cognitive and behavioral battery, we will conduct the largest phenotypic characterization of rare genetic
disorders in East African individuals to date (Aim 3). As described by the NHGRI Atlas initiative, syndromic
neurodevelopmental disorders often vary in their phenotypic presentation between ethnic groups. The
presentations of relatively common genetic disorders (e.g. DDX3X and 22q11.2 deletion syndromes) have not
been well characterized in non-European populations. In a collaborative analysis, we will compare the phenotypic
profiles of NDK cases and cases from the Deciphering Developmental Disorders Africa study with common
genetic disorders against those observed in European ancestry cases, as described in GeneReviews and the
G2MH network. Lastly, all data (e.g. genetic data, HPO terms) and algorithms generated by this work will be
made publicly available in order to rapidly improve medical genetics research and resources for African
communities (Aim 4)."
10736996,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Preterm birth is well established as the leading cause of perinatal mortality and a significant contributor to both
chronic medical conditions and learning/societal challenges amongst those born too soon. Though complex in
its origins, preterm birth is predominantly the result of spontaneous preterm birth and ischemic placental diseases
(preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction and abruption). Beginning in the 1980's low dose aspirin (LDA) was trialed
as a therapy for the prevention of preeclampsia. Subsequent meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials of
LDA have demonstrated its efficacy in preventing both preterm birth and other components of ischemic placental
diseases. Limited data suggest that the effect of LDA in preventing both preterm birth and preeclampsia may be
greater if therapy is begun before 16 weeks and utilizing doses >100 mg. Recently the ASPIRIN trial randomized
11,976 nulliparous women with a singleton gestation in low-middle income countries to either aspirin 81 mg orally
or an identical appearing placebo between 60/7 weeks and 136/7 weeks. This trial demonstrated a 11% decrease
in preterm birth, 25% decrease in early preterm birth <34 weeks, 11% decrease in hypertensive disorders of
pregnancy and 62% decrease in preterm delivery at <34 weeks with hypertension. Though promising, Aspirin
has yet to be fully accepted as a preventive strategy for preterm birth, whether aspirin portends efficacy in a
dose-response fashion remains unexplored, and mechanistic studies of the pathways by which LDA prevents
both preterm birth and ischemic placental disease are lacking. The proposed project is designed to overcome
these limitations.
The goal is to enroll 1,300 women with a prior preterm birth due to either spontaneous birth or indicated preterm
birth and a current singleton pregnancy between 100/7 weeks to 166/7 to a randomized clinical trial of Aspirin 81
mg orally daily and a sham (n = 650) or 162 mg orally daily (n = 650). We will test three overarching
hypotheses: (i) Women with a prior preterm birth randomized to 162 mg of Aspirin daily compared to 81 mg of
Aspirin daily will have lower rates of preterm birth; (ii) Women with a prior preterm birth randomized to 162 mg
of aspirin daily compared to 81 mg of Aspirin daily will have lower rates of ischemic placental diseases; and (iii)
Biochemical markers (Thromboxane B2, Specialized pro-resolving mediators, etc.) will correlate with clinical
outcomes. Our research group will draw upon the collective experience and leadership of the Perinatal Research
Consortium (10 academic centers), an experienced data management and statistical analysis core and a strong
biospecimen analytic core. This innovative project by combining a rigorously conducted RCT with appropriate
biospecimen analysis will both address a pressing question about one of the few therapies shown to improve
the obstetrical outcomes of preterm birth and ischemic placental diseases and provide insight to the mechanisms
of how aspirin improves outcomes."
10898805,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal aims to characterize the impact of GLP-1 analogue obesity treatment on mechanisms of
modifiable cardiometabolic risk factors in young people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) complicated by obesity
through assessment of adipose, glucose, and lipid physiology.
Obesity and overweight impact 40% of adolescents and young adults with T1D, a population in whom T1D
alone already drastically increases future cardiovascular disease risk. Our preliminary data indicate that
regardless of BMI category, most adolescents with T1D have a visceral to subcutaneous adipose tissue ratio
as high as youth with obesity and prediabetes. This visceral fat ratio in youth with T1D is proportional to the
degree of hepatic insulin resistance.
The study will comprehensively assess drivers of cardiometabolic risk factors in young people with T1D and
obesity while examining the impact of GLP-1 analogue obesity treatment on visceral adipose tissue (the ratio
of visceral to visceral+subcutaneous adipose tissue), insulin resistance, and postprandial lipemia. To achieve
these aims, we will utilize 1) an abdominal MRI to quantify abdominal adipose distribution, 2) the stepped
euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp with stable isotope tracers to assess insulin resistance and
gluconeogenesis, 3) a DEXA scan to measure body composition, and 4) a high-fat mixed meal tolerance test
to quantify postprandial changes in atherogenic lipoproteins. After completing these assessments, 54 young
adults with T1D and obesity who meet the criteria for anti-obesity pharmacotherapy will be randomized to 1-
year of treatment with oral semaglutide or placebo. The metabolic assessments will be repeated at 1-year of
the treatment. A comparator group of 15 young adults with T1D and lean body mass index will undergo the
metabolic studies at one-time point.
Carrying out the proposed research program is critical to advance the understanding of the strategies to
reduce cardiometabolic risk and impact the pathophysiologic mechanisms promoting cardiometabolic risk in
young patients with T1D and obesity. This is consistent with the NIDDK's mission to improve the health and
quality of life of individuals with diabetes. Results will reveal the intricacies of cardiometabolic disease risk and
potential treatment in young people with T1D complicated by obesity."

Encoding social arousal within prepronociceptin circuits in the extended amygdala
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
As a social species, humans thrive on the ability to form social connections for individual well-being, survival,
and societal success. Physiological arousal responses regulate this process by encoding information from social
stimuli that guides subsequent behavioral actions. Dysregulation of the neural circuitry responsible for encoding
arousal responses is thought to contribute to disturbed motivated behavior, a characteristic in many
neuropsychiatric disorders. We can track the rapid changes in arousal responses by recording certain
physiological metrics such as pupil size, frequency of heartbeats, and respiratory cycles, however, little is known
about the neural circuits that regulate these rapid arousal responses and how they influence ongoing social
behavior. We recently found that neurons that express the prepronociceptin gene in the BNST (BNSTPnoc
neurons) encode the arousal responses that occur rapidly upon exposure to motivationally salient stimuli, such
as predator and food odors. Interestingly, BNSTPnoc neurons project predominantly to the medial amygdala (MeA)
and the medial preoptic area (mPOA), which are brain regions that regulate aspects of social motivation. Here,
we will study how BNSTPnoc neurons that project to either MeA or mPOA regulate social arousal responses and
modulate social behaviors. Our global hypothesis is that unique populations of BNSTPnoc neurons will selectively
encode arousal responses to social stimuli in a stimulus-dependent manner and independent of encoding
behavior. To accomplish this, we will precisely map afferent and efferent circuit connections of BNSTPnoc neurons
(Aim 1), test the hypothesis that BNSTPnoc neurons encode social arousal responses (Aim 2), and test the
hypothesis that neurons that encode arousal responses influence social behaviors (Aim 3). Identifying the
function and natural dynamics of BNSTPnoc neurons is important because we currently do not understand the role
of arousal in the generation of behavior and behavioral disorders, nor do we understand the circuitry underlying
the contributions of arousal on social behavior. This gap in knowledge prevents us from developing therapeutic
strategies that target this potentially critical biological substrate to treat disorders defined by maladaptive social
behaviors."

 This proposal is focused on the development of high frequency dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) to enhance sensitivity in NMR based structural biology experiments.
1 CW DNP at 527 GHz/800 MHz: The 800/89 magnet with a sweep coil and console is operating. We
plan to use the 800 MHz/527 GHz system to examine amyloid proteins and other interesting systems and to
develop the methodology to perform DNP experiments at high fields. This is the sole 527 GHz/800 MHz DNP
instrument available for biophysics experiments in North America.
2. Applications to Peptides and Proteins: The familial mutants of A which lead to early onset AD,
are sparsely available. Thus, and structural studies require methods with high sensitivity and we intend to
determine the structure of the Arctic mutant, E22G-A1-42, and other familial mutants, such as D23N.
2 High Resolution 17O NMR: With new isotope labeling procedures, high fields, and high spinning
frequencies which improve sensitivity, it is finally possible to record high resolution spectra of 17O. We plan to
incorporate DNP in 17O experiments to increase sensitivity and to examine model systems GGVVIA to develop
the methodology and to 17O label proteins for structural studies.
3 Time Domain DNP Experiments: To translate pulsed DNP to 250 GHz we have developed a series
of new swept frequency and pulsed DNP experiments. Using a fast AWG, and a TWT amplifier operating at
250 GHz, we will investigate off resonance NOVEL, the frequency sweep integrated solid effect (FS-ISE) and
the stretched solid effect (SSE) and new versions of time optimized DNP (TOP DNP) as approaches for time
domain polarization transfer. These should eventually replace standard CW techniques like the solid effect
and cross effect.
6 1H Detected DNP: We propose to develop methods for 1H detected DNP of 13C, 15N and 17O
resonances using recently developed diamond rotors and a helium recirculation system that will permit
r/2>100 kHz at 90 K. The system will initially use 1.3 and 0.7 mm ZrO2 rotors and we will convert to laser
machined diamond rotors which we have successfully produced that will spin at >100 kHz. The recirculation
system will also be useful for spinning at ambient temperatures at >200 kHz and will permit design of a variety
of new pulse experiments for structural studies."
10850809,"Precise control of protein synthesis is essential for maintenance of normal cellular function and is central to innate antiviral responses within the cell. For example, the protein 2’-5’-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) family of proteins detects cytosolic double-stranded (ds)RNA and initiates a translational control response via activation of the latent ribonuclease L (RNase L), to limit viral protein synthesis and thus replication. Structures of OAS1 and OAS1-dsRNA complexes have revealed important insights into OAS1 activation: dsRNA binding drives a functionally essential reorganization of the OAS1 active site. For OAS3, individual domain structures suggest that key elements of the activation process are similar but functionally divided among its three OAS domains, with one (catalytically inactive) domain primarily dictating dsRNA binding and a another distant (active) OAS domain responsible for 2’-5’-oligoadenylate synthesis. However, our published studies on OAS1-activating RNA sequence and structural motifs, and extensive new preliminary data presented here, strongly argue that we still have an incomplete understanding of how specific RNA features and their contexts combine to drive potent activation of OAS1 and OAS3. In particular, our unpublished studies indicate that the extent of OAS3 activation is dependent on the action of some of the same RNA molecular signatures (sequence and structural motifs) that we have defined for OAS1. This proposal continues our innovative, multidisciplinary study with a specific focus on defining the RNA features and contexts responsible for driving OAS1 and OAS3 activation and their resultant impacts on the cellular antiviral response. In Aim 1, we will continue deciphering the “rules” that govern OAS1 activation using in vitro biochemical and human cell-based assays, coupled with biophysical and structural approaches. Specifically, we will define: 1) how placement of common RNA structural motifs affects the function of OAS1-activating RNA signatures; 2) the molecular mechanism of action of dsRNA terminal motifs capable of strongly enhancing OAS1 activation; 3) the proposed role for OAS1 oligomerization on dsRNA for full enzyme activation; and 4) the basis of OAS1 activation by the SARS-CoV-2 5’-UTR and the impact of disrupting the OAS/RNase L pathway on viral propagation. In Aim 2, we will use high- resolution single-particle cryo-EM to determine the structures of full-length OAS3 bound to two cellular non- coding RNAs. These studies will reveal the molecular basis for OAS3 activation by 1) a defined dsRNA region larger than the accepted 50 base pair (bp) minimum length, and 2) an RNA with less than 50bp but containing a unique RNA tertiary motif that we hypothesize drives a distinct mode of OAS3 activation. These studies will also provide a launch point to begin defining OAS3’s dependence on specific RNA sequence and structural motifs for its potent activation as we have done for OAS1. Collectively, these studies will substantially deepen our fundamental understanding of OAS/RNase L pathway regulation by RNA and may offer an essential foundation for development of novel, generally applicable anti-viral therapeutic approaches."

Microtubule-binding chemotherapeutics such as vincristine are among the most widely used anticancer agents
in oncology for the treatment of multiple solid tumors and leukemias in children and adults. The clinical use of
vincristine is associated with a debilitating, dose-limiting peripheral neurotoxicity for which no effective
preventative treatments are presently available. In addition, the mechanism by which vincristine accumulates
into dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons remains unclear to this day. Using a transporter screen of xenobiotic
uptake carriers in heterologous overexpressed models, we recently found that the organic anion transporting
polypeptide OATP1B3 (in mice, OATP1B2; collective referred to as OATP1B2/3) is an efficient transporter of
vincristine that is expressed in human and mouse DRG neurons. Functional validation studies in OATP1B2-
deficient mice and secondary screens confirmed that vincristine is transported into DRG neurons by OATP1B2.
Furthermore, deficiency of OATP1B2 protected mice from vincristine-related changes in various hallmarks of
peripheral neurotoxicity without altering the plasma levels of vincristine. To provide proof-of-principle and
demonstrate translational relevance of this transport mechanism, we found that several known
pharmacological inhibitors of OATP1B, including rifampin and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, nilotinib, can
preserve DRG neuronal function following treatment with vincristine without affecting its plasma levels or its
cytotoxic potential against multiple acute leukemia cell lines. Finally, we identified α-tocopherol (vintamin E) as
a previously unrecognized biomarker of neuronal OATP1B2/3 function that can be measured in the systemic
circulation, and we validated the translational utility of this biomarker in a mouse model receiving treatment
with OATP1B inhibitors. Based on these preliminary findings, we now outline three sets of related studies that
will further test and refine the validity of our central hypothesis that targeted modulation of OATP1B2/3 function
with optimized doses and schedules of novel OATP1B2/3 inhibitors can specifically affect accumulation of
vincristine in DRG neurons and affect downstream toxic events without negatively influencing its plasma
pharmacokinetic profile or anti-leukemic properties: (i) mechanistic characterization of nilotinib as the proof-of -
principle OATP1B inhibitor, and identification and validation of additional modulators derived from a library
screen that includes FDA-approved agents; (ii) biomarker-driven optimization using α-tocopherol as a
companion diagnostic to guide dose selection of OATP1B modulators for in vivo testing; and (iii) safety and
efficacy analyses of optimized combinatorial regimens of OATP1B inhibitors with vincristine, including
simultaneous assessment of neuroprotection and anti-leukemic properties in established experimental models
of acute leukemia. It is expected that these collective studies will not only shed light on the etiology of
vincristine-induced peripheral neurotoxicity, but will be of translational relevance and provide a rationale for the
future implementation of novel targeted intervention strategies to prevent this debilitating side effect."
10920426,"PROJECT SUMMARY. COPD is a leading cause of death and morbidity worldwide and is attributable to the
aggregate burden of toxic gases and particles that individuals inhale during their lifetime. In the US, this exposure
is primarily cigarette smoke; however, even after smoking cessation, patients with COPD continue to suffer
respiratory morbidity. International 2022 COPD guidelines (GOLD) emphasize non-pharmacological
interventions to improve health, but few evidence-based interventions exist. The indoor environment is of
particular concern, as adults with COPD spend >90% of their time in the home. Particulate matter (PM) and
nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are common pollutants in indoor environments and lead to worse respiratory morbidity.
Our own study found that former smokers with COPD who have higher exposure to indoor pollutants have worse
respiratory-specific quality of life, symptoms, and a higher risk of respiratory exacerbations. Our group recently
completed a randomized controlled trial of 116 former smokers with COPD in Baltimore, MD (PI Hansel),
demonstrating that the placement of two portable air cleaners with high efficiency particulate air and carbon
filters can significantly reduce in-home PM and NO2 concentrations. In intention-to-treat analysis, there was a
trend toward better respiratory-specific quality of life, as measured by the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire
(SGRQ) and statistically significant lower risk for moderate exacerbation, but not severe exacerbations, among
those who received the active air cleaner compared to sham. Further, per-protocol analysis suggested a dose-
response; among those who used the air cleaner at least 80% of the time, with a statistically significant
improvement in SGRQ. Despite encouraging results, the study did not meet its primary endpoint and was not
powered to determine whether air cleaner interventions can reduce moderate/severe exacerbations, including
acute health care utilization. Furthermore, the trial did not include strategies to increase adherence; and results
are limited to a small geographic area, limiting generalizability. The proposed study is a Phase III multi-center
randomized sham-controlled environmental trial to test the effectiveness of an air cleaner intervention targeting
indoor pollutants (PM and NO2) on quality of life and exacerbation risk reduction among former smokers with
COPD (n~770) across multiple clinical practice locations. We will conduct cost-effectiveness analysis to ensure
that study results address both clinical and economic efficacy to support policy decisions. We hypothesize that
the placement of two portable air cleaners with high efficiency particulate air and carbon filters can lead to
improved quality of life, reduced COPD exacerbation risk and reduced need for rescue medication use. Lastly,
we hypothesize that the use of portable air cleaners is cost-effective. The trial will provide a novel approach to
improve quality of life in these patients with significant morbidity; and for the prevention of COPD exacerbations,
which drive the morbidity and mortality of this chronic disabling disease. In addition to addressing clinical efficacy,
the study results will provide an economic evaluation to support policy decisions regarding reimbursement."

Despite the well-known Latina birth paradox, recent data (2020) show that Latina mothers are 1.2-1.5 times
more likely to have low birth weight infants compared to White mothers. Additionally, compared to White
women, annual national vital statistics data from 1989 through 2020 show consistently higher rates of worse
birth outcomes among Latinas. The longstanding focus on the Latina birth paradox has left a gap in the
literature, resulting in a critical need for research on birth outcome disparities faced by Latinas, and the
mechanisms driving those disparities. We propose two novel mechanisms as contributors to poor birth
outcomes for Latinas: anticipatory racism threat and area-level racial bias. A strong body of evidence has
demonstrated links between chronic social stress and poor birth outcomes. Racial discrimination, a chronic
psychosocial stressor, is a prominent explanation for racial/ethnic disparities in birth outcomes. However,
evidence is limited by the predominant focus on racism events and racism experiences at the individual-level.
We previously developed and validated a measure of anticipatory racism threat (aRT) for African American
women and found associations with hypertension, allostatic load and telomere length. These preliminary
studies suggest that anticipating racism, above and beyond actual racism events, is related to biological
dysregulation, including dysregulation of systems that have previously been linked with low birthweight and
preterm birth. Another neglected component of racism-related stress is area-level racial bias. Emerging
evidence demonstrates significant links between negative area-level racial sentiment and birth outcomes for
racial/ethnic minorities groups. The specific objectives of the K99 phase are to 1) create and psychometrically
validate an aRT-Latina scale and 2) examine associations with low birth weight and preterm birth in recent
Latina mothers. R00 phase objectives include developing and testing associations between a novel
county-level indicator of area-level racial bias towards Latines and county-level birth outcomes among Latinas.
The expected impact of the proposed research is re-focusing attention on poor birth outcomes among Latinas,
a long-standing disparity but largely neglected area of investigation; helping to elucidate some of the predictors
and underlying mechanisms driving those disparities; and ultimately informing the types of interventions likely
to ameliorate those disparities. These data will also provide preliminary data for a subsequent R01 application.
Our central hypothesis is that higher anticipatory racism threat and more negative area-level racial bias toward
Latines will predict worse birth outcomes (i.e., low birth weight and pre-term birth) for Latina mothers."

11037881,"Neurons rely on autophagy to constitutively degrade damaged proteins and organelles to maintain neuronal
homeostasis. When neuronal autophagy capacity is overwhelmed, aggregated proteins and damaged organelles
accumulate and contribute to neuronal dysfunction or death. Indeed, autophagy dysfunction is consistently
associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s Disease. How do neurons respond when
faced with the accumulation of dysfunctional proteins and organelles that overwhelm autophagy? Do neurons
employ alternate quality control mechanisms? Recent findings suggest that autophagy-dependent degradation
and autophagy-dependent secretion can act in coordination to regulate cellular homeostasis in non-neuronal cell
types. When autophagosome maturation is impeded, autophagy-dependent secretion of extracellular vesicles
(EVs) can be initiated as a mechanism to unburden the degrative machinery. Whether neurons similarly
extrude damaged material via autophagy dependent secretion is unclear. I hypothesize that stressed
neurons engage autophagy-dependent secretion as an alternate quality control mechanism to dispel
cellular waste, e.g., mitochondria, which is then internalized by surrounding astrocytes. This model is
supported by my preliminary findings that neurons with reduced capacity for autophagy upregulate secretion of
EVs. Of particular interest, I find that mitochondrial proteins are shunted from degradation toward a secretory
fate in chronically stressed neurons. These observations have important implications in neurodegenerative
diseases where autophagy is strained, and the expulsion of mitochondria could heighten systemic inflammatory
responses. This proposal will contribute to our fundamental understanding of neuronal homeostasis mechanisms
and could reveal important clues underlying neurodegenerative disease.
In Aim 1, I test the hypothesis that stressed neurons shunt autophagy cargo toward secretion via secretory
autophagy. I will track secretion of EVs from neurons facing chronic or acute autophagic stress and determine
which autophagy proteins are required for compensatory secretion. Using immunoblotting and high-resolution
microscopy, I will confirm the secretory autophagy pathway prompting secretion in stressed neurons. Finally, I
will use proteomics to molecularly profile the cargo expelled via autophagy dependent secretion.
In Aim 2, I test the hypothesis that neurons expel mitochondria for transcellular internalization. I will use neuronal-
astrocyte co-culture to visualize neuronal mitochondria internalized by nearby astrocytes. Next, I will track
astrocyte engulfment of neuronal mitochondria in vivo."
10912818,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Rates of alcohol use disorder and alcohol associated liver disease requiring liver transplantation continue
to rapidly rise. Return to alcohol use after liver transplant is associated with increased rates of liver transplant
failure and mortality, but there is no evidence-based integrated intervention to address alcohol use disorder in
liver transplant recipients. The goal of this K23 award application submitted by a liver transplant surgeon is to
address a critical gap in knowledge and care for liver transplant recipients with concurrent alcohol use disorder
by developing and pilot testing an integrated liver transplant and alcohol recovery program (ILTARP) consisting
of an integrated community health worker supporting post-transplant alcohol relapse prevention, outreach, and
care coordination. To address this knowledge gap, I propose three research aims. Aim 1 is to co-develop the
ILTARP intervention with stakeholder and expert input though an iterative process of evidence gathering and
stakeholder panels. Aim 2 will conduct a pilot feasibility study of the newly developed ILTARP intervention
testing feasibility, acceptability, and potential effectiveness of ILTARP in the liver transplant clinical setting
through a randomized control pilot trial (n=40). Aim 3 will assess barriers and facilitators of the ILTARP
intervention through an integrated mixed methods approach to prepare the intervention for a future R01
application for a fully powered multisite Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial.
 My long-term goal is to be an independently funded researcher developing, testing and implementing
interventions in solid organ transplantation integrating care of complex co-occurring health conditions. The
research aims directly inform my three training goals: Goal 1 to gain advanced knowledge in alcohol use
disorder treatment and addictions research; Goal 2 to acquire skills in intervention development and
randomized trials of multi-component interventions; and Goal 3 to develop expertise applying implementation
research frameworks and evaluating implementation outcomes through the use of mixed methods. The training
plan includes guided reading, mentored research projects, monthly seminars, and selected coursework,
planned research manuscripts, and frequent mentor meetings to review progress. The research project, the
research environment, and the exceptional multidisciplinary mentorship team (Drs. Bartels, Kelly, Aschbrenner)
and consultants (Drs. Cameron, Wakeman, Cheng) are ideally suited to my career development.
 Overall, this career development award will provide the opportunity for me to acquire the necessary
research skills to advance my career goal to become a leading expert in intervention development and
implementation research in solid organ transplantation integrating care of complex co-occurring health
conditions. This formative work has the potential to result in a paradigm shift in liver transplant centers across
the nation by broadly disseminating ILTARP to improve access, equity, and long-term outcomes for the
growing number of patients suffering from alcohol use disorder and alcohol associated liver disease."
10916464,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall objective of this K23 application is to provide support for the additional training and experience that
the principal investigator, a pediatric endocrinologist and epidemiologist, needs to develop an independent,
patient-oriented research program in hyperinsulinism. Congenital hyperinsulinism (HI) is the most common
cause of persistent hypoglycemia in infants and children. Onset of hypoglycemia in HI overlaps with a critical
period of neurocognitive development that occurs in the first years of life. While children with HI are more likely
to have neurocognitive deficits, little is known about the factors influencing trajectories of neurocognitive
development in affected children. This project will: (1) identify neurocognitive trajectories in children with HI
employing an accelerated longitudinal design, and (2) examine the relationship between timing of
hypoglycemia exposure and neurocognitive outcomes through comparison of two clinical phenotypes of HI with
natural variation in clinical course. To accomplish these aims a comprehensive neurocognitive battery will be
administered at baseline and repeated at 1- and 2-years after baseline, to school-aged children with cured,
focal HI (hypoglycemia exposure limited to early life), diffuse HI (early life and ongoing hypoglycemia
exposure), and age, sex, and socioeconomic status matched healthy controls. The results of this project will fill
critical gaps in knowledge about the impact of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia during periods of marked brain
development and carry significant implications for clinical practice. This study may also have broad implications
for other disorders associated with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, including diabetes mellitus. The principal
investigator will take full advantage of the rich scientific environment and outstanding resources afforded by the
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and University of Pennsylvania to achieve her research and training goals.
The proposal includes advanced training in longitudinal data analysis and longitudinal neurocognitive outcome
assessment, which will be achieved through a combination of didactic coursework, practical research
experience, and support form an expert, multidisciplinary mentorship and advisory team. The support of this
K23 will enable the principal investigator to launch a successful career as an independent investigator
dedicated to optimizing neurocognitive outcomes for children with hyperinsulinism."
10881977,"Project summary. Inflammation underlies majority of human diseases including diabetes, atherosclerosis, and
cancer. These diseases are responsible for majority of deaths and represent substantial global health burden.
Macrophages and T-cells, subsets of immune cells, have emerged as key mediators of inflammation. The role
of biochemical cues in shaping the transcriptional response of these cells have been investigated. However,
accumulating evidence has shown that physical factors also tune their phenotype and effector functions. Recent
two-dimensional studies have shown that mechanical confinement directs the nuclear translocation of
transcription factors in macrophages. Another study found enhanced T-cell killing of cancer cells stiffened
through cholesterol depletion. These studies have contributed to the field of mechano-immunology that seeks to
understand how physical factors direct immune cell fate.
 Recent mechano-immunology findings have laid the groundwork for my proposal aimed at determining
how biophysical cues shape macrophage and T-cell cell behavior. We have developed a three-dimensional
culture that allows us to interrogate how biophysical cues regulate immune cell trafficking and macrophage-T-
cell interaction in the tumor microenvironment. We have already identified that naïve macrophages are more
efficient at trafficking to tumors than polarized macrophages. Furthermore, macrophages adopt different shapes
depending on their activation state and their local microenvironment. Our preliminary results show that T-cells
have longer-lived interactions with rounded macrophages, compared to elongated ones. This implicates
macrophage shape, a biophysical property, in regulating its interaction with T-cells. We will extend these findings
by elucidating the role of matrix viscoelasticity on immune cells behavior and performing a rigorous
immunophenotyping of these cells. In addition, the proposal will implement machine learning algorithms to high
resolution spatiotemporal information obtained from live confocal imaging. This will unlock the potential to identify
heterogenous phenotypic states and quantify their evolution over time. Further, the proposal will integrate
confocal live imaging with the single-cell RNA sequencing data. Such detailed, single cell analysis will identify
genetic programs that are responsible for heterogenous morphometric states.
 The proposed research will be significant because it is expected to yield mechanistic insights that have
broad translational impact for a myriad of diseases where inflammation is the underlying cause. These include
Alzheimer’s, atherosclerosis, arthritis, diabetes, and cancer, which represent a growing global burden. The
pathology of these diseases is orchestrated by macrophages and T-cells. Insight into the mechanobiology of
macrophages, T-cells, and associated intracellular, transcriptional, and epigenetic modifications will deliver novel
therapeutic options. Analysis of morphological heterogeneity using machine learning algorithms will provide a
useful clinical and research tool to monitor disease progression."
10881949,"Abstract
 Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for women globally, with over 2.3 million cases
diagnosed each year. Most cases are hormone receptor positive and effectively treated with anti-estrogen
therapy, but some patients have aggressive disease and are at risk for recurrence and death without
chemotherapy. Gene expression based recurrence assays, such as OncotypeDX, were designed to predict
recurrence on hormonal therapy and are used to select patients for chemotherapy. However, these assays are
expensive (> $3,000 per test), take considerable time to perform leading to treatment delays, and testing is
underutilized or frankly unavailable in low resource settings in the US and globally. Conversely, every patient
with breast cancer has a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis, which is routinely analyzed by pathologist to determine
subtype of breast cancer and grade. Deep learning is an emerging technique for quantitative image analysis,
and can identify non-intuitive features from pathology, including gene expression patterns. In preliminary work, I
have demonstrated that deep learning on pathology samples can provide rapid and cost-effective prediction of
OncotypeDX score using readily available data, and can identify patients at low risk of recurrence on hormonal
therapy.
 However, OncotypeDX remains an imperfect predictor of chemotherapy benefit, as it was developed to
predict recurrence on hormonal therapy. By refining my deep learning biomarker to incorporate clinical and
immune features of breast cancer, I can improve accuracy in prediction of chemotherapy benefit and thus the
ability to personalize treatment. First, I will capitalize on the recent expansion of clinical data in the National
Cancer Data Base to develop a more accurate clinical models of prognosis and chemotherapy benefit. Next, I
will use multiplex immunofluorescence to better characterize spatial and cell density features associated with
chemotherapy benefit, and use deep learning models to infer these features from standard hematoxylin and
eosin stained digital pathology. Finally, I will integrate these clinical and immune models with my existing deep
learning pathologic model and validate the integrated model in a multi-institutional cohort. The result of this work
will result in a prognostic and predictive deep learning biomarker that makes accurate predictions from readily
available clinical, pathologic, and inferred immune features. This approach has the potential to reduce
chemotherapy delays due to rapid turnaround time, combat healthcare disparities through improved availability
of testing, and improve personalization of treatment by tailoring a biomarker for prediction of chemotherapy
benefit."
10726558,"Defining translational mechanisms to promote regenerative healing of chronic wounds
Abstract:
Chronic wounds are common among our veterans, often impacting negatively on their ability to
achieve a high quality of life as productive members of our society, and the care of these wounds and
their sequelae consumes a significant portion of resources within the Veterans Health Administration.
The ultimate objective of the research described in this proposal is to develop solutions that allow
durable and regenerative healing of these wounds. Patients who are aged and/or diabetic are at
major risk for developing difficult non-healing wounds, and diabetes occurs among veterans at about
three times the rate of the general US population. To effectively manage these wounds, it is essential
to understand the normal healing process and engineer treatments that promote the physical and
biochemical environment of healing tissue. Pathologically, our identification of specific subclasses of
cells within human skin and how they control skin wound healing carries the potential to ameliorate
skin infections and chronic wounds.
Our long-term goal is to translate our understanding of the cellular and molecular interactions that
drive skin repair into viable treatments for chronic wounds. Our prior work has identified the
importance of cytokines and unique cell types including fibroblast subtypes and macrophages in skin
wound healing in mice. The overall objective of this translational research proposal is to define the
molecular mechanisms by which fibroblast subtypes contribute to wound repair in aged and diabetic
skin and how that can be translated into novel treatment modalities for chronic wounds.
Our central hypothesis is that fibroblast heterogeneity is essential for proper skin repair after injury
and is altered with diabetes and age. This hypothesis is based on our findings that: 1) Multiple
classes of fibroblasts contribute to skin repair after injury; 2) Human skin wounds contain multiple
fibroblast populations; 3) Wound growth factors such as Igf1 specifically contribute to proliferation of
non-fibrotic fibroblast populations in mouse wounds and in vitro and Igf1R expression is altered in
diabetes; 4) Specific populations of fibroblasts are lost in aged skin. Based on these preliminary data,
our record of discovery in skin wound healing, and our team of experts from plastic surgery and skin
cell/developmental biology, we are exceptionally capable of executing the proposed experiments.
We plan to objectively test our central hypothesis and obtain the objective of this proposal by
pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Determine whether the lack of IGF1R in fibroblasts alters
wound healing in mice; 2) Assess the heterogeneity and IGF-1 response of human dermal fibroblast
subpopulations in wounds; and 3) Determine whether transplantation of young fibroblasts and/or
IGF1 treatment can ameliorate wound healing defects in aged and diabetic mouse skin.
We will test this hypothesis using in vitro cell functional studies involving fibroblasts derived from
human patients as well as in vivo studies in a rodent model. This work will greatly increase our
understanding of fibroblast function during skin wound healing and how that is impacted by age and
diabetes. It is expected that this translational work will identify novel factors that coordinate skin
wound healing and provide additional therapeutic targets for the treatment of chronic non-healing
wounds in our veterans."
10726560,"Summary/Abstract:
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of cancer-related death worldwide including the United States
due to late detection and limited effective therapeutic options. It is imperative to obtain a better understanding of
the molecular events underlying the progression of HCC, so that rational therapeutic strategies can be designed.
The current proposal focuses on a key signaling molecule, Mixed-Lineage Kinase 3 (MLK3), a member of the
MAPK Kinase kinase (MAP3K) family to determine its role in HCC. Using a carcinogen-induced HCC model, we
found that MLK3 knockout (KO) mice are protected from developing liver cancer and showed reduced
proliferation compared to wild-type (WT) mice. MLK3 expression was induced in a panel of human HCC samples.
In addition, in cell-based assays, treatment of various HCC cells with the pan-MLK inhibitor CEP-1347 reduced
cell survival, promoted cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, suggesting a potential role of MLK3 in mediating these.
Furthermore, overexpression of MLK3 increased the expression and release of cytokines, which in turn promoted
MLK3 activity, indicating the presence of a potential positive feedback loop between MLK3 and cytokine signaling
axis during HCC progression. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that MLK3 represents a novel
target involved in mediating liver tumorigenesis via a crosstalk with cytokine signaling, and targeting of MLK3-
cytokine axis by the available pharmacological inhibitors might be a viable means of antagonizing HCC
progression. The current proposal is aimed towards establishing MLK3’s role in HCC progression, while
elucidating the underlying mechanisms by which this is accomplished, to achieve a mechanistic insight towards
MLK3-induced HCC. As a proof-of principle, we will examine the feasibility of pharmacological inhibition of MLK3
on HCC progression using preclinical mouse models. The following specific aims are proposed to achieve our
goals: (1) Elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying MLK3-mediated HCC progression, 2) Establish that a
crosstalk between MLK3 and cytokine axis promotes HCC progression, and 3) Determine whether
pharmacological inhibition of MLK3 and cytokine signaling mitigates liver cancer progression. While studies in
Aims 1 and 2 are expected to provide a mechanistic insight towards the signaling pathway by which MLK3
promotes HCC and identify potential downstream targets, those in Aim 3 will provide important proof-of-principle
preclinical information on the in vivo efficacy of the pharmacological inhibitor of MLK axis (CEP-1347) and IL-11
antagonist in antagonizing HCC progression. Successful outcome of the proposed studies will not only provide
newer insights towards understanding the mechanism by which MLK3 mediates HCC progression, but also
provide information on the preclinical efficacy of MLK3 inhibitor combination, which can be utilized towards
developing effective MLK3-based therapeutic strategies for targeting HCC in the future."
10726561,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 There were about 81,000 drug overdoses in the U.S. from June 2019 to May 2020 – the
highest rate ever recorded. Synthetic opioids (i.e., fentanyl and its analogues) are the primary driver
of the increase in deaths, despite availability of naloxone for treatment of opioid-induced respiratory
depression. Ten Western states reported an over 98% increase in synthetic opioid-involved deaths
(CDC). Recent scientific data indicate, “The rate of opioid use disorder among patients in the
Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is 7 times higher than that of non-VHA enrollees.” (Ahonle et
al., Fed Pract. 2020; PMID: 33029067 PMCID: PMC7535957). Generally and too frequently, drug
abuse is a confounding problem that is co-morbid with post-traumatic stress disorder and other
mental illnesses, including schizophrenia and depression. Psychiatric outpatients are the second
largest group of patients serviced by the Department of Veterans Affairs, with psychotic disorders
such as schizophrenia being one of the most frequent diagnoses. Because there are no etiology-
(biologically-) based treatments, these patients experience recurrent admissions to V.A. hospitals,
and treatment compliance and symptom improvement are variable. Nationally, the V.A. spends over
$3 billion and the Portland V.A. spends over $25 million annually on mental health programs. In
addition, the V.A. spends over $250 million on antipsychotic medications and the Portland V.A. alone
spends over $2.5 million annually on antipsychotic medications. Thus, drug abuse and schizophrenia
have had an overwhelming impact on medical and financial aspects of the V.A. patient care mission.
Developing treatments and cures could profoundly and positively impact medical and financial facets
of the V.A.
 Our laboratory’s overarching goals are to 1) discover and characterize genetic and
neurochemical pre-determinants for both neuropsychiatric disorders and drug response, and 2)
discover and develop new etiology-based pharmacotherapies for neuropsychiatric disorders,
including addictions.
 Using engineered cells expressing recombinant proteins, the laboratory has developed and
continues to develop medium throughput radioligand binding and second messenger/signal
transduction system assays for about (currently) 15 human G protein coupled receptors or ion
channels and their polymorphisms. Additionally, we quantify radioligand binding, neurotransmitter
uptake and neurotransmitter release by recombinant human neurotransmitter transporters and the
vesicular monoamine transporter. Similar assays are used to characterize receptors and transporters
in animal models of human disease and in human tissue. Newly developed imaging reagents are
used to identify the intracellular localization of proteins of interest, as well as their orientation within
cells to aid in computational modeling for new pharmacotherapies. Currently, we are identifying
disease and drug-induced changes in the miRNA cargo of extracellular vesicles (EVs), their impact
on cells taking up EVs, and differences between control subjects and subjects with schizophrenia.
Because there is a paucity of methods for patients to easily, safely, and effectively deliver
therapeutics directly to the central nervous system, we are developing clinically useful delivery
systems for EV/miRNAs. Additionally, we have characterized pharmacological differences in vitro
and in vivo between synthetic opioids (fentanyl and its analogues) and morphine, and are now
developing pharmacotherapeutics for overdose symptoms specific to each."
10925343,"Summary
The skin forms a protective barrier against harmful substances and pathogens that we contact through our
immediate environment. Specialized glands in the skin known as sebaceous glands secrete sebum, a lipid-rich
substance with anti-microbial peptides (AMPs) that enhances the physical, chemical, and immunologic barrier
function of the skin. This proposal describes a 5-year research plan focusing on the novel concept that the skin
microbiome regulates a newly described immune-mediated sebum axis as a feedback mechanism to enhance
skin barrier function and to create an optimal skin microenvironment.
 We have recently reported that sebum secretion can be regulated by immune cells in response to a
keratinocyte-derived cytokine called thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). In this process, which we call the
immune-sebum axis, TSLP stimulates T cells directly through their TSLP receptor (TSLP-R), which induces
their migration to the sebaceous glands to promote sebum secretion in an IL-4/13-dependent manner. We now
provide preliminary data suggesting that the trigger of the immune-sebum axis could be the skin microbiome.
We find that compared to conventionally raised mice, the skin of germ-free mice contains significantly fewer T
cells, exhibits ~50% reduction in sebum secretion, and displays lower expression of TSLP, sebum synthesis-
related genes, and AMPs. In addition, we found that mice lacking the IL-1 receptor or MyD88 (a molecule
critical for signaling downstream of IL-1 family cytokine receptors and Toll-like receptors) also display ~50%
reduction in sebum secretion. Thus, we propose that a feedback mechanism exists to maintain homeostasis of
the skin microenvironment, whereby skin microbes promote sebum secretion, which in turn controls their
growth.
 Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that skin microbes induce the IL-1/MyD88
signaling pathway in the skin to promote sebum secretion and skin barrier function in a TSLP-
stimulated T cell-derived IL-4/13-dependent manner. We will test this hypothesis in 3 separate aims. Aim 1
will investigate how the skin microbiota and MyD88 regulate sebum secretion. Aim 2 will probe how IL-4/13
derived from TSLP-stimulated T cells affects sebaceous gland function. Aim 3 will test whether the skin
microbiota and TSLP affect skin barrier function and protects against pathogenic skin infection in a sebum-
dependent manner. This multidisciplinary project will be led by two co-PIs (Drs. Kambayashi and Grice), who
share complementary expertise. Dr. Kambayashi is an expert in T cell biology, cellular immunology, and signal
transduction. Dr. Grice is an expert in skin barrier function and skin microbiota. Other collaborators include Dr.
Amanda Nelson, as an expert in sebaceous gland biology and Dr. Sunny Wong as an expert in sebaceous
gland development. This investigation will provide novel insight into how the skin microbiome engages both the
innate and adaptive immune system to promote optimal skin barrier function for the host."
11121513,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Immune checkpoint receptor blockade (ICB) has been approved recently for the treatment of
metastatic, unresectable, or recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNC) in the first-line setting.
Multiple priming strategies have entered into trials, aiming to turn cold HNCs, which account for about 85% of
the cases, into T-cell inflamed hot tumors and expand the pool of patients who can benefit from
immunotherapy. Mechanistically, many priming strategies activate innate immune sensors to launch the
production of type-I interferons (IFN-I) by cancer cells and myeloid cells. The activation of IFN-I and its target
genes promotes antigen-presenting cell (APC) and effector cell trafficking to the tumor bed and enhances APC
cross-priming efficiency. A central converging point of the current priming approaches is an adaptor molecule
located at the endoplasmic reticulum and its associated membranes, stimulator of interferon genes (STING).
Lead cold tumor sensitization treatments, such as irradiation, inhibition of DNA damage repair, induction of
DNA replication stress, and STING agonists all engage the STING pathway, further validating the promise of
STING-priming in restoring the immunogenicity of cancers. However, recent trials of STING agonists showed a
high resistance rate in patients with solid tumors, even in combination with ICB. The mechanism of HNC
resistance to STING priming is poorly understood, and few strategies are available to overcome cancer
resistance to innate immune sensing. The long-term goal of this program is to establish the biochemical and
metabolic regulatory network of HNC immunogenicity and improve HNC prevention and immunotherapy by
releasing the checkpoints on innate immune sensors. During the initial funding period, we have uncovered
driver oncogenes that disable the STING pathway and promote immune tolerance, we have engineered the
first-generation nanoparticles to improve the intracellular delivery of STING agonists, we have streamlined our
single-cell immune analysis pipelines to render intra-lesional immune landscape as a function of time.
Recently, we discovered a new pathway that suppresses HNC initiation through IFN-I activation. This renewal
project will parlay our previous accomplishments and our recent discovery into a cohesive program that
addresses the mechanisms of HNC resistance to STING stimulation and optimizes the engineering of a new
generation of nanoparticles for innate immune priming in hosts insensitive to free STING agonists. To support
this goal, we have established comprehensive modeling for HNC initiation and response plasticity to STING
stimulation, including carcinogen-induced models, implantable models, and genetically engineered models.
Resistance to STING stimulation disqualifies a spectrum of cold cancer priming strategies. This renewal project
will uncover a pivotal molecular mechanism underpinning the fitness of innate immune sensors and optimize
robust nanotechnology overcoming cancer resistance in individuals insensitive to STING stimulation."
10888402,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex disorder of brain development characterized by difficulties in
social interaction and communication and the presence of restricted and repetitive behaviors and is often
accompanied by disruptions of sensory and perceptual processing. Altered sensory and perceptual processing
leads to a range of individual experiences including heightened and dampened sensory reactions that can
profoundly affect quality of life. Despite the prominence of sensory and perceptual symptoms in ASD there is
no unifying explanation for their etiology. The central premise of this proposal is that the sensory and
perceptual processing differences that occur in ASD derive from differences in attention. Specifically, we will
test the hypothesis that spatial- and feature-based attention is more narrowly focused and that rapid
oscillations of attention occur at a slower rate in people with ASD. Our proposal employs computational models
of visual cortical responses in combination with psychophysical and brain imaging measures of neural
responses. Overall, our results will significantly advance understanding of the neural and computational basis
of sensory and perceptual changes in ASD."

The broad, long-term objective of this multi-PI grant application is to understand the role of calcium (Ca2+)
dysregulation as the mechanistic driver for synaptic loss between the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and
hippocampus (HPC) in evolving Alzheimer’s disease (AD). While dysfunction of the LEC-HPC circuit has been
implicated, the cause of the early, selective vulnerability of LEC neurons and projections remain unknown. We
will test the hypothesis that dysregulation of neuronal Ca2+ signaling plays a key role in LEC-HPC circuit
dysfunction in early AD. Specifically, in experiments with the APPKI mouse model of AD, we will investigate
if normalization of the activity of two key proteins, the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) or
the prolyl isomerase, Pin1 rescues defects in LEC–HPC communication, function and stability in early
AD. Pin1 is a key target of CaN-mediated inhibition in neurons, directly leading to synaptic and neuronal loss. In
experiments with APPKI mice, we will also determine if dominant negative Pin1 accelerates defects in
LEC–HPC communication irrespective of CaN normalization in APPKI mice. We will use a combination of
molecular, biochemical, imaging, electrophysiological, behavioral and neuropathological techniques to address
these specific aims. The proposed studies, if successful, will provide a mechanistic understanding of early AD
evolution as well as a rationale for the use of CaN inhibitors such as FK506 or voclosporin to treat early AD."

and ApoA1, respectively. On the basis of these novel findings, the following aims focus on elucidating how miR-
541-3p regulates the expression of these TFs, and how these TFs regulate ApoB and ApoA1 expression.
Furthermore, we plan to establish the roles of these TFs in the control of plasma lipoproteins and atherosclerosis.
Aim 1. Establish that miR-541-3p enhances post-transcriptional degradation of Znf101 and Casz1 mRNA
by interacting with 3´-untranslated region (UTR) sequences. We propose to establish that RNA-RNA
interactions between miR-541-3p and Znf101/Casz1 mRNAs are necessary for the regulation of mRNA levels
and show that miR-541-3p interacts with target sequences in the 3´-UTR, thereby enhancing mRNA degradation.
Aim 2. Explain the mechanism of regulation of ApoB and ApoA1 expression by Znf101 and Casz1 in
human and mouse liver cells. We plan to elucidate how Znf101 and Casz1 regulate transcription of the APOB
and APOA1 genes. We propose to show that Znf101 is an enhancer of APOB gene transcription, and Casz1 is
a repressor of APOA1 gene transcription. Furthermore, we plan to clarify the roles of mouse orthologs of these
TFs in the transcriptional regulation of mouse Apob and Apoa1 genes. These studies should reveal the molecular
underpinnings of the regulation of ApoB and ApoA1 by miR-541-3p.
Aim 3. Elucidate the roles of Zfp961 (mouse ortholog of human Znf101) and Casz1 in the regulation of
plasma LDL, HDL, and atherosclerosis in mice. In these in vivo studies, we will investigate the physiological
roles of ApoB and ApoA1 regulation by the TFs identified and characterized in the earlier aims. We will
interrogate whether regulation of ApoB and ApoA1 by these TFs decreases LDL levels, increases HDL levels,
and diminishes atherosclerosis. These studies should demonstrate that transcriptional regulation of ApoB and
ApoA1 leads to an anti-atherogenic profile in mice.
This proposal is based on our discovery of a novel miR-541-3p that regulates the expression of ApoB and ApoA1
in opposite directions through two newly identified TFs. After completion of the proposed studies, we expect to:
(1) elucidate how miR-541-3p regulates various TFs; (2) explain the molecular mechanisms through which these
TFs regulate APOB and APOA1 transcription; and (3) establish the physiological importance of the identified
molecules and mechanisms in the regulation of plasma lipoproteins and atherosclerosis. These genes and
mechanisms may serve as new therapeutic targets to prevent and treat cardiovascular disease."
10865044,"Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death and the primary cause of preventable disability and
hospitalization in the U.S according to the most recent statistics by the American Heart
Association. Each year, approximately 795,000 people continue to experience a new or recurrent
stroke. On average, every 40 seconds, someone in the United States has a stroke, and someone
dies of one approximately every 4 minutes. This high fatality rate is partly due to the fact that
state-of-the-art methodologies such as CT, MRI and ultrasound are currently failing to inform
timely intervention. Identification of patients with high-risk, asymptomatic carotid plaques despite
their low stenoses remains thus an elusive but essential step in stroke prevention. In current
clinical practice, the risk assessment of carotid plaque rupture is based on the degree of intima-
media thickness (IMT) and endoluminal stenosis despite the fact that they do not necessarily
correlate with vulnerable plaques or subsequent rupture. Current clinical modalities fall thus short
in informing on plaque stability. Reliable information on plaque stability would ensure timely
treatment, especially in asymptomatic or low endoluminal stenosis patients whose stroke risk
remains severely underdiagnosed. Such information shown to be critical but clinically unavailable
lies in the plaque compliance and the associated blood flow. Lipid plaques (which are typically
less stable and are associated with ischemic stroke) have been shown to have distinct stiffness
from calcified plaques. Increased arterial stiffness has also been reported in stroke patients. The
objective of the proposed study is thus to amplify the role of carotid sonography by optimizing the
combined PWI and VFI methodologies (PWI+VFI) and quantifying the biomarkers of compliance
and flow in order to provide critical biomechanical information on plaque stability. In reported
studies, our group has shown that plaque characterization in large animals and stroke patients
can be achieved. We have demonstrated that PWI+VFI is capable of characterizing carotid
plaques based on their distinct stiffness and flow. In this study, we aim towards the
characterization of carotid plaques for the ultimately reliable assessment of ischemic stroke risk
based on plaque wall and flow biomarkers. We thus hypothesize that PWI can significantly
reinforce the diagnostic capability of a conventional vascular ultrasound. The team assembled is
highly multi-disciplinary encompassing expertise in ultrasound imaging, biomechanics, vascular
radiology, pathology, neurology, vascular surgery and biostatistics. Following the proposed
studies, this highly translational technology could be readily integrated in a standard sonogram to
accurately inform carotid plaque stability and thus subsequent timely treatment."
10904938,"High rates of incidence and prevalence of oral cancers occur in 15-20 developing low-and-middle income
countries (LMICs) in Asia and Africa. Visual clinical examination followed by biopsy is the standard for diag-
nosing oral lesions. But the low and variable specificity of 16-100% of visual examinations results in biopsies
of an estimated 37-51% indeterminate lesions (1.4-2.1 million lesions in India, alone) and in benign-to-malig-
nant biopsy ratios of 2-24. Patient compliance for biopsy and follow-up care is low (35-63%) in LMIC settings
due to pain, fear, time and cost. Our novel solution is noninvasive imaging with a low-cost handheld reflec-
tance confocal microscopy (RCM) - optical coherence tomography (OCT) device. Diagnosis and grading of
oral dysplasia are based on cellular atypia in the epithelium and underlying architectural changes. RCM imag-
ing shows cellular morphology in the entire epithelium to depth of 300 µm. OCT imaging shows epithelial lay-
ers and underlying lamina propria to deeper depth of 1 mm. Combined RCM-OCT imaging with a single de-
vice will enable simultaneous imaging of cellular atypia and architectural changes in co-located fields of view to
guide diagnosis, grade dysplasia, monitor progression to malignancy and assess invasion. Stratification, with
a quantitative RCM-OCT scoring algorithm, will guide triage of oral lesions into low-grade dysplasia, which can
be monitored or immediately treated with non-surgical therapies, versus high-grade, which may be immediately
biopsied, versus carcinoma, which will be surgically excised. Diagnosis may be combined with treatment, all
integrated in a single patient visit - a “one stop shop” patient care paradigm. We are an academic-industry
team at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (New York, NY), Physical Sciences Inc. (Andover, MA), Cali-
ber Imaging and Diagnostics (Rochester, NY) and our LMIC collaborators at Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH,
Mumbai). For FOA PAR-21-166, innovation is defined to be “likelihood of delivering a new capability to end-
users.” Innovations will be in delivering an RCM-OCT device with a new probe for intra-oral imaging and in
designing a quantitative diagnostic scoring algorithm to guide diagnosis and treatment, in real-time, at the bed-
side. The device will be delivered to TMH and will ultimately cost $25,000, when scaled up and locally manu-
factured in LMICs, which will support dissemination of RCM-OCT as a new and affordable imaging capability in
LMICs. In preliminary studies, RCM-OCT imaging detected oral lesions and cancers with sensitivity of 100%
and specificity of 80%. Our specific aims are (1) to design a handheld RCM-OCT device for imaging in the
oral cavity; (2) to prospectively test on 4,422 patients for diagnosis, grading of dysplasia and assessment of
invasion in oral lesions and cancers in vivo. Testing will be in LMIC settings, at TMH in Mumbai and in their
regional clinic in Varanasi. Affordability, delivery of care in LMICs: the return-on-investment on our device
can be in 6-9 months at cancer centers, while the cost of care to deserving patients can be as little as zero to
50 cents for the imaging procedure. Our initial success in India will seed global effort in LMICs."

The US not only has the highest rate of maternal mortality in the developed world but is the only country in which
this rate is rising. It is also notorious for marked racial disparities, with black maternal deaths being 3-4 times
greater than that of white pregnant people. While affecting only 4% of pregnancies, cardiovascular disease
(CVD) accounts for up to 30% of maternal deaths and yet there no is evidence about how best to stratify risk or
deliver care in this population. While cardio-obstetrics (COB) clinics have emerged, with encouragement and
support from both the AHA and ACOG, these have been implemented with very heterogeneous structures. In
collaboration with a large network of COB clinics, we have identified 5 structural components of care that have
been variably deployed and for which further evidence is needed to define whether any of these components
independently improves outcomes. Along with 33 partner sites, we propose the first-ever, US-based, prospective
evaluation of 1000 (40% minorities) consecutive pregnant people with CVD to identify clinical, patient-reported
(including perceived discrimination) and structural characteristics of care associated with adverse pregnancy
outcomes (APO), maternal adverse cardiac outcomes (MACE), neonatal adverse clinical events (NACE) and
quality of life (QoL). Our study will address both the exceedingly high prevalence of adverse outcomes and racial
disparities in pregnancy by: 1) Identifying patient characteristics, at the time of prenatal care initiation and
throughout pregnancy, associated with APOs, NACE and MACE with a special focus on racial disparities; and 2)
By adjusting for these factors, define the independent association of alternative structures of care so that future
COB clinics can be developed to optimize outcomes. We will prospectively collect detailed patient-level
variables, and the first ever serial assessment of quality of life data, from initial COB presentation and throughout
pregnancy, delivery and 1 year postpartum. This will be the first national, multisite, prospective study of pregnant
people with CV disease ever conducted in the US and is critically important to address our country's marked
disparities and rising maternal morbidity and mortality. This work will be the foundation for future RCTs. To
accelerate the translation of our findings to clinical practice, we have actively engaged dissemination partners
from the design phase of the program to join us in the analysis and interpretation of our findings so as to
accelerate their efforts to improve maternal care."
10888377,"This project focuses on the role of glycobiology in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) immune evasion strategies.
Our long-term goal is to understand how the virus exploits host protein glycosylation pathways to shield its
virions and decorate the surfaces of infected cells with oligosaccharide patterns that prevent antibody binding
and/or suppress immune responses. The Specific Aims are (1) to evaluate how the HCMV ER resident protein
UL148 impacts the glycocalyx, or “sugar cloak,” of virions and infected cells, (2) to carry out a structure
function analysis of UL148 to determine the mechanisms by which UL148 activates sculpts the host cell to
enhance glycosylation of virion envelope proteins, and (3) to evaluate how UL148 contributes to evasion of
antibody responses. Throughout the three Specific Aims, wild-type (WT) and UL148-null mutant viruses are
evaluated in comparison to each other. In Specific Aim 1, mass spectrometry based ‘glycomics’ is applied to
profile N-linked oligosaccharide structures conjugated to virion envelope proteins and surface proteins of
infected cells in the presence versus absence of UL148. A second aspect of Aim 1 makes use of mass
spectrometry-based proteomics together with genetic and pharmacological perturbations targeting the unfolded
protein response (UPR) and cellular genes whose expression is positively regulated by UL148 to determine
how the viral protein harnesses the host cell’s stress response circuitry toward the generation of virions that
resist neutralization by antibodies. In Specific Aim 2, computational predictions of UL148’s three-dimensional
protein structure are used to guide mutagenesis studies aimed at understanding the molecular basis for its
biological functions, focusing in large part on the roles of (i) a consensus metal binding motif and (ii) two non-
conserved cysteine residues. Aim 2 also leverages structural models non-human primate cytomegaloviruses
homologs to elucidate the determinants of HCMV UL148’s unique biological functions. These studies will make
use of recombinant HCMVs to test the impact of selected mutations and chimeric UL148 proteins in the context
of infected cells. In Specific Aim 3, we will (i) characterize UL148’s impact on neutralization resistance of
virions while targeting glycan modification enzymes hypothesized to be important for biogenesis of
neutralization resistant virions, (ii) map specific antigenic domains on virion glycoproteins whose reactivity to
neutralizing antibodies is impacted by UL148, (iii) compare the humoral immunogenicity of UL148 competent
versus UL148-null HCMV virions in a mouse model, testing for neutralizing antibody titers, and overall
polyclonal antibody titers against whole virions, viral envelope proteins and internal virion antigens.
Collectively, these studies will address a key knowledge gap concerning how enveloped large DNA viruses
exploit glycobiology to evade adaptive immunity and establish persistent infection."

Obesity is a major public health problem. Modulating energy expenditure through behavioral or
pharmacological intervention is a key strategy to alter energy balance and battle obesity and metabolic
diseases. Targeting molecular pathways underlying the cold-induced non-shivering thermogenesis has been
an important and promising strategy to elevate energy expenditure in animals and humans. However, it is well-
known that mammals compensatorily increase food intake due to higher expenditure, such as in the cold.
While it is generally agreed that the brain centrally controls this feedback, the neural mechanism underlying
this coupling is largely unknown. Here, we propose to systematically investigate the behavioral, metabolic, and
circuit basis of cold-induced feeding. By combining calorimetry and behavioral modeling, our preliminary study
demonstrated that cold-induced increase of food intake involves dynamic bi-directional behavioral switches
and is mediated by non-canonical feeding circuits. Using whole-brain clearing, lightsheet imaging, and c-fos
activity screening, we identified a group of nuclei at the ventral midline thalamus (vMT) associated with cold-
induced feeding. The central hypothesis is that the vMT nuclei are activated by the elevated energy
expenditure and recruit downstream targets to mediate cold-induced feeding. The first aim is to use in vivo
calcium imaging to measure the endogenous activity of vMT in relationship to cold and feeding behaviors. The
second aim is to use optogenetic and chemogenetic approaches to determine the causal significance of vMT
neural activity in driving cold-induced feeding. The third aim combines anatomical mapping and functional
manipulation to study how vMT integrates into the well-established feeding circuits in hypothalamic and limbic
systems. The completion of these studies will provide a new understanding of the coupling between energy
expenditure and intake in the brain, bringing many opportunities to leverage these mechanisms to maximize
and maintain the metabolic benefits from targeting energy expenditure."

Up to 25% of individuals will develop acute low back pain (LBP) each year. As many as 63% of those individuals will
develop chronic LBP that persists for most or every day for several months. The reasons why some individuals transition
from acute to chronic LBP are poorly defined. Our prior funding period, and work from others, have identified elevated
inflammatory cytokines among individuals with chronic LBP. The reasons why inflammation persists are unknown. Our
long-term goal is to discover how inflammation, regulated by the immune system, predicts the transition from acute to
chronic LBP. Identifying mechanisms that regulate the inflammatory response to acute LBP and the development of chronic
LBP could identify novel therapeutic targets and broadly impact the pain research field. To accomplish this goal, we will
conduct an observational cohort study enrolling n=480 participants with acute LBP from two diverse communities in
Durham and Cabarrus, North Carolina. At baseline, 3 months (primary endpoint), and 6 months, participants will provide a
blood specimen, pressure-pain threshold testing, physical performance measurement, physical activity via actigraphy, and
patient-reported questionnaires. At 12 months, survey-based measures will be collected. The rationale for this proposed
research comes from our strong pilot work in that 1) identifying a change in immune cell profiles and baseline inflammatory
cytokines may be important biological factors predicting persistent inflammation and chronic LBP, and 2) these responses
from the immune system may be different by race (Black versus White) and 3) acute LBP transition to chronic LBP can
result from biological, social, psychological domains or a combination of these sources and well-defined phenotypes from
these domains could improve chronic LBP prediction. To our knowledge, we will be the first to comprehensively define the
biochemical reaction and inflammatory and immune-regulated trajectories in the transition from acute to chronic LBP in a
diverse community. Understanding the immune response to acute LBP would lead to new multifactorial phenotypes of LBP
transitions and specific intervention targets based on phenotype composition."

This Mentored Career Development (K01) Award proposal will provide an outstanding educational environment,
mentoring, and training for Dr. Jillian Hurst, a pediatric infectious diseases researcher whose overarching career
goal is to integrate clinical and biological data to further our understanding of the role of the microbiome and
related host factors in modifying susceptibility to common childhood infections Dr. Hurst originally trained in
biochemistry and molecular biology and has worked in translational pediatric research for the past five years.
This career development award will allow her to receive training in omics and advanced statistical analyses using
large datasets, permitting her to lead multidisciplinary teams that use large clinical and omics datasets to
evaluate factors underlying common pediatric infections. The proposed research studies center on the role of
the upper respiratory microbiome in the development and recurrence of acute otitis media (AOM; middle ear
infection), the most common infectious disease of childhood. Dr. Hurst will test the hypothesis that early life
antibiotic exposures disrupt the development of the URT microbiome, predisposing children to AOM and other
common respiratory infections. She will use over eight years of electronic health records data, banked
longitudinal upper respiratory specimens collected from children from birth to age 2, and samples and data from
a prospective cohort of children with recurrent AOM to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Assess the
impact of early life antibiotic exposures on recurrent AOM development.; 2) Delineate the effects of early life
antibiotic exposures on URT microbiome development; and 3) Evaluate associations between antibiotic
exposures and the URT microbiome in children with recurrent AOM. Findings from these studies will guide the
development of new strategies to prevent and treat AOM and associated infections, including guidance for
antibiotic use and identification of therapeutic targets within the URT microbiome that could be leveraged to
restore URT microbiome function and improve respiratory health among young children. Mentorship will be
provided by a group of three established investigators with complementary expertise: Dr. Christopher Woods,
an infectious diseases physician and clinical epidemiologist with expertise in the evaluation of host responses to
infectious agents; Dr. Matthew Kelly, a pediatric infectious diseases physician with expertise in the human
microbiome and clinical omics analyses; and Dr. Benjamin Goldstein, a biostatistician with expertise in the use
of electronic health records data for population health analyses. Additionally, Dr. Hurst will be advised by internal
and external advisors with expertise in antimicrobial stewardship, pediatric otolaryngology, health informatics
and omics analyses, and the treatment and pathophysiology of AOM. Completion of the proposed training and
research activities will establish Dr. Hurst as an independent investigator who will lead an NIH-funded research
program investigating host factors and exposures underlying common infections in children."
10871833,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A surgically created arteriovenous fistula (AVF) between an artery and vein is now the preferred approach to
provide a vascular access for life-saving hemodialysis in chronic kidney disease CKD) patients. However, nearly
60% of AVFs fail to mature into a clinically useful conduit due to insufficient outward remodeling and flow
capacity, occlusive neointimal hyperplasia, and/or fibrotic stenosis. Currently, there are no therapies that can
improve AVF early maturation failure by enhancing AVF outward remodeling, largely due to our nascent
understanding of the mechanisms underlying vein adaptations to AVF hemodynamic stresses. Acute increases
in shear stress and pulsatile pressure in the vein are normalized by rapid dilation followed by wall thickening.
Venous smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) are the predominant cells sensing vessel wall stretch in response to
increased flow volume and blood pressure. A significant barrier to progress is a deficit in our knowledge of the
mechanisms by which vSMCs respond to arterial hemodynamics in early AVF adaptation. Strong evidence from
both AVF mouse models and human sample studies demonstrate, for the first time, a role for differentiated
vSMCs in AVF outward remodeling and maturation. This is further supported by new preliminary data from our
clinically relevant 5/6-nephrectomy CKD AVF mouse model. We further show early AVF maturation involves
vSMCs reprogramming from a quiescent to a previously uncharacterized proliferative, synthetic state that
surprisingly retains differentiated contractile properties. Myocardin related transcription factor (TF) A and B
(MRTFA and B, MRTFs) respond to cyclic stretch by transactivating multiple gene programs. VSMC-deficiency
of MRTFs impairs AVF maturation with reduced AVF wall thickness. Beyond the contractile gene program,
MRTFA upregulates novel target genes (MMP2 and ATF3) to facilitate matrix remodeling and cell proliferation.
This suggests that MRTFs act as nodal TFs of vSMC reprogramming. CAMK2 is a major signal transducer
poised to integrate stretch-induced vascular remodeling. Preliminary data show growth factors induce nuclear
interaction of CAMK2 and MRTFA in cultured vSMCs. VSMC-deficiency of a major VSMC CAMK2 isoform,
CAMK2D, phenocopies loss of VSMC MRTFs, suggesting that CAMK2D transduces a signal(s) from AVF wall
stress to trigger MRTF transactivity. These preliminary data support our central hypothesis that successful AVF
adaptation and maturation involves CAMK2/MRTFs-dependent vSMC reprogramming to a proliferative,
matrix organizing, and contractile phenotype. Aim1 will elucidate mechanisms of vSMC-dependent AVF
adaptive remodeling and maturation using Itga8CreERT2Confetti reporter, single nucleus (sn) ATAC/RNA-seq,
and spatial omics to determine vSMC clonal expansion and transcriptomics underlying AVF maturation. Aim 2
will use novel VSMC-specific MRTFs and CAMK2D knockout mice to elucidate the mechanistic role of
CAMK2D/MRTFs in AVF maturation. Successful completion of these studies will provide novel insights into, and
potential therapeutic targets for, AVF maturation failure attributable to inadequate vein adaption in humans."

Atherosclerosis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Recently, cell lineage tracing, single-cell
RNA sequencing and human genomic studies have been integrated to demonstrate that a) majority of plaque
foam cells are of vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) origin and b) SMC can undergo a fate switch to transitional,
multipotential cells that can adopt plaque altering phenotypes. Although these results identify SMC as potential
therapeutic targets, most current treatments for atherosclerosis have little direct impact on SMC. The endocytic
processes by which SMC take up lipids and become foam cells in the arterial wall are not clearly defined. In
addition, the mechanisms underlying SMC phenotypic switching in the arterial wall remain largely unknown.
Using a combination of high-resolution imaging, 3D cell reconstruction, and LDL immunolabeling, we have
recently demonstrated that foam cells (lineage unknown) in human and murine atherosclerotic plaques
internalize LDL via macropinocytosis. Novel preliminary data using SMC lineage tracing identifies SMC subsets
performing macropinocytosis in the arterial wall in vivo. Stimulation of macropinocytosis of LDL in SMC promotes
dedifferentiation and phenotype switching into plaque-promoting phenotypes in vitro. Further, pharmacological
blockade of macropinocytosis using the Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1) blocker, EIPA, inhibits LDL uptake in
atherosclerotic arteries and abrogates atherosclerosis development in multiple murine models of atherosclerosis.
Preliminary data also show that the matricellular protein thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) stimulates macropinocytosis
via CD47 in SMC, leading to foam cell formation and phenotypic switching, and global Cd47-/- mice are protected
from atherosclerosis. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that SMC macropinocytosis drives
atherosclerosis through foam cell formation and regulation of SMC phenotypic switching. The hypothesis will be
tested via the following specific aims: Aim 1: SMC internalize LDL via macropinocytosis in atherosclerotic
arteries. Aim 2: SMC-specific inhibition of macropinocytosis attenuates transdifferentiation of SMC into a plaque-
promoting phenotype and inhibits atherosclerosis. Aim 3: TSP1 via CD47 stimulates SMC macropinocytosis,
promotes SMC phenotypic switching and contributes to atherosclerosis development. The proposal will employ
SMC-specific knockout mice (Nhe1-/-, Cd47-/- and Cd36-/-), primary human and murine aortic SMC, a vascular
SMC-restricted Cre driver mouse model (Itga8-CreERT2+/-; mTmG+/-), and other genetic tools to test the
hypothesis. Multiple complementary techniques will be used to study SMC macropinocytosis in vitro
(pharmacological, genetic, fluorescence/SEM imaging) and in vivo (TEM/IEM microscopy, SMC-specific Nhe1
knockout mice). At their conclusion, the proposed studies will define key mechanism(s) promoting SMC foam
cell formation and phenotypic switching and potentially identify new targets for therapeutic interventions of
atherosclerosis."

The overall goal of this career award is to build Dr Batte into an independently funded physician scientist
improving survival of children with acute kidney injury (AKI) and identify interventions that will enable
children to thrive. Dr Batte will delineate mechanisms of kidney-related brain injury in children with severe
malaria. Dr Batte is a Lecturer and a Pediatric nephrologist at Makerere University college of health
sciences. From his past research work, he has established evidence-based approaches to AKI diagnosis
and phenotypic characterization. He has explored the utility of point-of-care tests in evaluating AKI, and has
mechanistically compared severe malaria AKI and non-malaria febrile illnesses related AKI demonstrating
differences in endothelial activation and immune activation. He has also evaluated brain injury and
neurological outcomes of children with AKI following acute malnutrition and sickle cell anemia. He has
published an invited review highlighting challenges in the diagnosis and management of AKI in children and
outlined priorities for future research, which included detailed neuro-developmental assessments following
AKI in children with severe malaria. Dr Batte will use the 75% protected time for the next 5 years working
with his mentors to understand how acute changes in brain-kidney crosstalk translate to long-term injury
and to identify modifiable pathways amenable to intervention to promote adaptive kidney and brain
recovery following severe malaria. Dr Batte has developed an educational plan that builds on his past
training and addresses research training gaps, that once filled will provide the basis to propel him into an
independent research career. This K43 will be structured around specialized training in neurobehavioral
evaluation along with biomarker testing and interpretation. It will help Dr Batte to achieve his objectives
which are to; (1) determine the extent that AKI phenotypes are associated with biosignatures of brain injury
and recovery (2) establish the extent that AKI and AKI phenotypes are associated with cerebral edema (3)
define the association between neurobehavioral outcomes, brain injury biomarkers and AKI phenotypes. Dr
Batte will attain a number of skill-sets in kidney and brain biomarker testing and interpretation, skills in brain
imaging interpretation, data analysis and conduct of longitudinal studies, and neurobehavioral evaluation of
children. It is expected that at completion of this award, with the developed expertise and data generated,
he will elucidate modifiable pathways of kidney-brain cross talk in severe malaria, setting the stage for an
R01 application and a platform for future intervention studies to prevent injury and promote brain and
kidney recovery following severe malaria."

Sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals face dramatic health inequities in general, especially among
racially/ethnically diverse SGM living in the Deep South, home to the country’s largest SGM population.
Despite dramatic shifts in the political and social acceptability of SGM people across the United States,
progress remains tenuous in the Deep South, where there is pervasive stigma and discrimination. Further,
there are few health research training programs that view sex and gender through a wider, multifaceted lens,
inclusive of sexual orientation and gender identity, and none are located in the Deep South. Our overarching
goal is to train graduate students enrolled in health-related degree programs (e.g., public health, social work)
with an interest in health research to increase knowledge and advocacy skills addressing SGM health. We will
achieve that goal through creating and implementing a 4-year sex and gender program in SGM health,
GenderS (Education on Gender and Sex). We have built a unique community-academic partnership to lead
the GenderS program, including Dr. Emma Kay, founding director of the Magic City Research Institute, one of
the few research institutions in the Deep South housed within a community-based organization; and Dr. Sarah
MacCarthy, inaugural holder of the Magic City LGBTQ Health Studies Endowed Professorship, one of the few
positions nationally focusing exclusively on SGM health. Our specific aims include: 1) Develop GenderS, a
hybrid advocacy and community-based education program that addresses core concepts and hyperlocal
approaches to gender and sex in health; 2) Increase knowledge of and advocacy for SGM health via
implementation of GenderS; 3) Disseminate a GenderS Toolkit nationally to enable local adaptations,
implementation, and evaluation. Year 1 includes development of an online 14-week course covering core
concepts in SGM health, providing a foundational understanding of factors driving SGM risk and resilience with
attention to intersectional identities (e.g., age, ability, and race/ethnicity). The course will be complemented by
hyperlocal approaches, including an in-person 1-week residency highlighting knowledge and expertise among
community partners and a 6-month period of virtual mentoring and networking salon sessions. Years 2 and 3
include recruitment of two, 1-year cohorts (n=5-7 scholars per cohort) and implementation of the GenderS
program. Year 4 includes the development and national dissemination of a toolkit with guidance on how others
can develop, implement, and evaluate their locally adapted version. Our rigorous evaluation plan consists of
pre/post surveys to assess scholars’ mastery of topics taught in the online course, as well as interviews with
scholars and surveys with program mentors and faculty/community partners to assess opportunities for
program improvement. Through national dissemination of the toolkit, GenderS will be broadly available;
supporting tools will enable organizations to create locally-relevant experiences for future scholars to further
their understanding of sex, sexual orientation, gender, and gender identity influences on SGM health."

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a devastating disease often occurring in children and young adults resulting from the
autoimmune-mediated loss of pancreatic β-cells. It has been challenging for monitoring the disease progression
and the efficacy of clinical interventions. Therefore, a critical need remains for highly reliable assays that quantify
proteins or peptide hormones (e.g., insulin, glucagon) and their specific isoforms (or proteoforms) as markers of
endocrine and exocrine function. Such assays will play an important role in facilitating effective monitoring of
disease progression or efficacy of novel clinical interventions prior to or following the onset of T1D. Most current
clinical assays depend on the use of antibodies or other affinity reagents almost exclusively. However, the exact
specificity of affinity reagents is often unknown or difficult to characterize. Targeted mass spectrometry (MS)
presents a promising alternative to immunoassays. Therefore, the overall objective of this application is to
develop reliable, proteoform-specific, and multiplex targeted MS assays for a list of protein/peptide analytes of
significance in T1D. Specifically, we aim to develop multiplex targeted MS assays for the following panel of
targets as markers of endocrine and exocrine function: insulin, glucagon, amylin, chromogranin, somatostatin,
prohormone isoforms (e.g., proinsulin, proglucagon), hybrid insulin peptides, trypsinogen, glycated CD59, as
well as other markers of interest to the T1D research community. To facilitate full validation of the robustness
and transferability of the assays, the overall objective will be accomplished through the collaborative efforts of
two independent targeted MS labs and through a multi-lab assay validation effort. Specifically, Aim 1 will be
focused on establishing optimal assay configurations for confident detection of endogenous analytes in serum
samples for specific proteoforms or peptides of interest in T1D. Aim 2 will be centered on assay optimization and
full assay characterization in the aspects of reproducibility, stability, selectivity, linearity, and limit of
quantification. Inter-lab assay protocol transfer and assay characterization will also be pursued. Aim 3 will
demonstrate the robustness and utility of the assays through multi-lab validation of the assays by analyzing the
same cohort of clinical serum samples and benchmarking against well-established immunoassays for selected
analytes such as insulin and c-peptide. Together, the project will establish highly reliable and easy-to-transfer
multiplex targeted MS assays for many difficult to measure T1D markers. These assays are expected to make
a significant contribution to the monitoring of pancreatic endocrine/exocrine functions, the disease progression,
as well as the efficacy of clinical interventions in T1D research."

While there is abundant evidence that certain musical behaviors (e.g., regularly listening to loud music) are risk
factors for age-related hearing loss (ARHL), human musicality also has the potential to support hearing health
across the lifespan. For example, studies in small samples of younger adults show that individual differences in
musical aptitude are positively associated with hearing outcomes such as speech recognition in noisy
conditions, and that musicians show enhanced hearing outcomes and auditory processing compared to non-
musicians. Further, advances in the genetics of musicality show that genes involved in cochlear development
are associated with phenotypic variation in musical aptitude. Preliminary studies also show a positive
association between music engagement frequency and hearing sensitivity. Given this evidence, could higher
degrees of musicality – both aptitude for and engagement with music – be a protective factor against hearing
loss as we age? This project systematically tests this novel hypothesis using experimental, epidemiological,
and genomic approaches. Aim 1 uses robust experimental approaches to characterize associations between
musical aptitude and hearing outcomes in older adults, over and above music engagement (e.g. practice,
formal training, listening) and neurocognitive skills (e.g. executive function). Aim 2 uses epidemiological
approaches to characterize associations between music engagement frequency and hearing outcomes in large
cohorts of middle-aged and older adults. Aim 3 uses computational genomics approaches to investigate
shared genetic architecture between human musicality and ARHL, in large cohorts of middle-aged and older
adults for whom available health, phenotypic, and genotypic information is known. Evidence for and against
our hypotheses will allow us to disentangle three competing theories about the links between human musicality
and hearing health, namely that links are either driven by (a) shared genetic and neural architecture underlying
both traits, (b) auditory neurocognitive affordances and preferences shaping musicality, (c) or “wear and tear”
of sensorineural auditory biology due to cumulative loud music exposure. Taken together, findings from this
project will help evaluate musicality as a protective factor against hearing loss as we age, and lay the
groundwork for understanding longitudinal and causal relationships between music engagement and hearing
health. Further, findings will lay the groundwork for examining specific biological functions (e.g., expression
and regulation) of genes linking musicality, sensorineural auditory mechanisms, and hearing outcomes. This
work addresses a critical health need: one in three adults aged 70 or older in the United States suffers from
hearing loss, with cascading consequences on social isolation, depression, and cognitive decline and
dementia. Innovations in personalized prevention and care are sorely needed. Further the work is timely and
leverages recent advances in computational genomics and health biobank approaches, and in the genetics of
human musicality traits."

 Cell reprogramming represents a major advancement in biology, and has wide applications in
regenerative medicine, disease modeling and drug screening. Somatic cells such as fibroblasts can be
directly converted into induced neuronal (iN) cells via the forced expression of three transcription factors:
Ascl1, Brn2 and Myt1l (BAM). However, a major challenge of cell reprogramming, especially iN
reprogramming, is the low reprogramming efficiency, which has limited the translation of this technology
for biomedical applications. Biophysical factors from the microenvironment have been shown to regulate
many aspects of cell functions such as cell growth, migration and differentiation. Recently, we have shown
that mechanical deformation of cell nucleus through microfluidic channels can promote open chromatin
structure and enhance cell reprogramming, yet the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Based
on our recent findings, we hypothesize that a mechanopriming process such as mechanical squeezing of
cell nucleus can induce NL reorganization and a permissive chromatin state to facilitate the activation of
neuronal genes in the heterochromatin of fibroblasts, which promotes iN reprogramming and CRISPR-
mediated gene editing/activation. To test our hypothesis, we propose three Specific Aims: (1) To
investigate how nuclear deformation modulates the epigenetic state to enhance iN reprogramming; (2) To
determine the role of nuclear lamina in mediating nuclear deformation-induced LAD dissociation,
epigenetic changes and iN reprogramming; (3) To investigate the enhancement of CRISPR-mediated
neuronal gene activation by mechanical squeezing. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team with
expertise on cell engineering, microdevice fabrication, high-throughput genomic and epigenomic analysis,
neuroscience, biosensors and CRISPR gene editing to work together and investigate the mechanical
regulation of epigenetic state and cell reprogramming. We propose to optimize a high-throughput
microfluidic device, further investigate the causative mechanisms and profile the genome-wide site-specific
epigenetic changes induced by nuclear deformation, which can provide a rational basis for the design of
site-specific gene editing for cell engineering. Accomplishment of this project will advance our
understanding of how biophysical factors regulate cell reprogramming and the epigenetic state, and
unravel new mechanisms of cell fate determination, which will have wide applications in gene editing, cell
and tissue engineering, disease modeling and drug discovery."

ABSTRACT
Consistent with the second pillar of WHO's Global Breast Cancer Initiative for improving
breast cancer (BC) control in LMICs, our long-term goal is to improve the timeliness of
breast cancer diagnosis in Mexico. The goal of the proposed study is to develop and test
implementation strategies designed to improve integrated care for rapid BC
diagnosis across health system levels among women presenting with BC in primary
care settings. The Specific Aims are:
(1) Assess barriers, facilitators, and organizational readiness for implementation of
rapid BC diagnosis system. We will conduct qualitative interviews with healthcare
personnel (informed by CFIR and ISF frameworks) to identify barriers and facilitators
for implementation. Also, we will cross culturally adapt the R=MC 2 measure and assess
organizational readiness across the 166 primary care centers that serve the uninsured
population in Monterrey, Nuevo León. (2) Develop strategies to improve the
implementation of a rapid BC diagnosis system. Using Implementation Mapping in
collaboration with the key stakeholders, we will design contextually appropriate
implementation strategies (including practice facilitation) to address barriers and
strengthen organizational readiness for implementation of integrated care that will
enable rapid diagnosis. (3) Evaluate the impact of practice facilitation on
implementation of a rapid BC diagnosis system and determine effectiveness on patient
outcomes. We will conduct a hybrid type 2 implementation-effectiveness study using a
cluster randomized stepped-wedge design. Primary implementation outcome: reduction
in the time between symptomatic presentation at the primary care clinics and arrival to
the diagnostic clinic. Effectiveness outcome: down-shift in the stage of BC. The proposed
study will address a pressing need in BC control in Mexico (and other LMICs), and
advance implementation science by adapting and validating a Spanish language
organizational readiness measure and evaluating the use of practice facilitation to
improve readiness for implementation of cancer control practice change in LMICs."
10928166,"The shortwave infrared (SWIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum has become an exciting avenue for
imaging in mammals due to the increased penetration of light through tissue, decreased light scattering, and
minimal autofluorescence. In the previous granting period, we showcased an additional advantage of the SWIR
region– the enhanced spectral real estate which facilitates non-invasive multicolor imaging in mice. Taken
together, all these advantages set the stage for: 1) fundamental biological studies in animal models analogous
to those which have been enormously successful in cells and transparent organisms, 2) the ability to evaluate
controls in same animal as the experimental group, and 3) advanced clinical diagnostics for both intraoperative
and non-invasive use.
While the SWIR region has great potential, it cannot be realized without biocompatible contrast agents. This
proposal focuses on contrast agent development for high resolution multicolor imaging in the SWIR region,
building on the expertise we have gained in polymethine fluorophores over the last granting period. We have
prepared over 100 polymethine fluorophores and gained predictive metrics on the most classical photophysical
parameters of lmax.abs, lmax,em and FF. We have also learned some key lessons regarding utility of the fluorophores
including how to solubilize them in water and have gained appreciation for the different approaches to formulating
fluorophores for imaging. In collaboration with the Bruns laboratory, we demonstrated excitation-based multicolor
imaging with fluorophores well-matched to common laser lines.
In the next granting period, we specifically focus on optimizing fluorophores for use in excitation-based
multiplexing with detection in the high-resolution region of the SWIR (above 1400 nm) such that mm resolution
can be achieved. Aim 1 explores the chromophore scaffold itself optimizing the photophysical properties for
maximum absorption at commercial laser lines and emission >1400 nm. We take a physical organic chemistry
approach to fluorophore optimization and capitalize on the continually growing, fully characterized set of
systematically modified fluorophores our laboratory has prepared. Our work is aided by computation and theory
collaborations with the Lopez and Caram Laboratories. Aim 2 transforms the lead fluorophores from aim 1 into
water-soluble, targeted contrast agents. Finally in Aim 3, we aim image the lymphatic system, demonstrating the
need for mm resolution imaging and then using excitation-based multicolor imaging to evaluate sentinel lymph
node mapping and cancer metastasis."
10734060,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
This career development proposal is focused on acquiring the necessary technical research and professional
skills to establish an independent extramurally funded research program focused on investigating sex specific
effects of air pollutants on respiratory health. This work builds on my current research, which focuses on the
effects of air pollutants such as wood smoke, ozone, tobacco products, and e-cigarettes on the upper airway,
specifically in the nasal mucosa. This TIEHR career development award will broaden my technical research
skills and build needed expertise in lower airway assessment to effectively establish my independent career as
an inhalation toxicologist.
The research proposed in this grant is designed to test the central hypothesis that that genetic and hormonal
sex mediate respiratory immune responses to wood smoke exposure. The aims of this grant include: 1)
determining sex specific pulmonary physiology and immune effects of wood smoke exposure in vivo and 2)
evaluating ex vivo interactive effects of wood smoke and sex hormone manipulation on primary lung epithelial
and macrophage cell cultures. Data generated by the completion of this grant will fill a large gap in knowledge
and understanding of sex specific respiratory responses to air pollutant exposure, specifically to wood smoke.
It will also begin identifying mechanisms of genetic and hormonal regulation of immune response in the airway.
More globally, this work will provide new targets of exploration for preventative or treatment measures against
adverse responses to air pollutants.
To complete my training, this grant unites multiple experts to synergistically support the goals of research and
career training. The aims are designed to achieve training in: 1) clinical studies, 2) respiratory function
assessment, 3) wood smoke chemical characterization, 4) lower airway sampling and sample analysis
techniques, and 5) genomic analysis pipelines, in order to determine comprehensive effects of wood smoke
exposure on the lower airway. This training will enhance my ability to systematically investigate sex-specific
regulation of the immune system and responses to air pollutant exposure in human clinical studies. Training in
each area will be provided by experts in their respective fields. Additionally, laboratory management,
grantsmanship, scientific communication, mentorship, and career development skills will be attained through
workshops, presentations, and other hands on training. Upon successful completion of the training portion of
this grant, it is expected that I will be successful as an independent investigator and prepared to establish a
R01 funded research program."
10932927,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There is growing recognition that area-level biological and physical exposures associated with residential location across the life-course must be considered for more precise cancer risk and outcomes. Yet many cohort studies lack comprehensive residential history information or limit analyses to the residence at enrollment or cancer diagnosis, a critical limitation in assessment of exposure causation potentially leading to misclassification or biased associations. Residential histories derived from commercial vendors offer an exciting opportunity to integrate the neighborhood environment into cancer research. Little research has been conducted incorporating life-course residential history information into cohort studies, particularly among historically marginalized populations living in persistent poverty regions such as in the Southeast. Populations living in the Southeast have the highest cancer risk and some of the poorest health outcomes among all U.S. populations. To address gaps in knowledge of how best to integrate geospatial data via life-course residential histories into cancer research cohort studies, we propose to evaluate residential histories in a well-resourced and large-scale observational prospective cohort of underrepresented adults, with the following specific aims: 1) collect and describe self-reported adult life-course residential histories from a historically marginalized population, 2) develop algorithms to reconstruct temporal residential histories for historically marginalized individuals, and 3) evaluate residential mobility and spatiotemporal changes in area-level life-course exposures and cancer disparities. We hypothesize concordance of residential history between vendor and self-report varies by population group and incorporating residential mobility improves exposure assessment and reduces bias in cancer research. We propose to construct residential histories, link residential histories to geospatial exposures, and test associations between geospatial exposures across the life-course and cancer disparities. We will focus on the four most common cancers (breast, lung, colorectal, prostate) in over 84,000 participants recruited across 12 Southern states. Our design focuses on robust methods to identify factors predictive of residential history patterns among historically marginalized populations, including those living in persistent poverty regions, and novel translation of residential history information into an interpretable context. Our project then examines neighborhoods which can influence cancer risk over space and time. Our project fosters innovative collaborations among a multidisciplinary team with scientific expertise in cancer disparities, cancer epidemiology, survey design, geospatial analyses, small area estimation, and biostatistics. Findings from our multidisciplinary approach will have sustained impact since it will reveal pathways for improved precision to incorporate area-level exposures across the life-course and motivate strategies to address disparities."

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a complex disease and represents a spectrum of histopathological
changes in the liver. Accumulating evidence suggests that multiple types of immune cells are involved in the
pathogenesis of alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH), particularly neutrophils. However, the mechanisms
underlying neutrophils in mediating AH pathogenesis are not well understood. Our exploratory experiments
had led to an important and clinical observation on the inter-patient variability and two distinct patterns of
hepatic neutrophil infiltration. Our data also indicated that higher level of hepatic parenchymal neutrophils was
associated with AH disease severity. The key question we would like to address in this application is how
neutrophils drives disease severity and mediates liver injury in ALD. Mechanistically, neutrophils, as an innate
inflammatory response, mediates tissue injury by producing inflammatory mediators and reactive oxygen
species (ROS). ROS production in neutrophils is regulated by the multi-meric transmembrane enzyme
complex, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX). Among them, the NCF1
gene, which encodes the phagocytic oxidase (phox) unit p47phox, is predominantly expressed in neutrophils
and plays an important role in controlling ROS production in neutrophils. Our data suggested that miR-223,
the most abundant neutrophilic miRNA, may be a downstream target of NCF1 and its induction ameliorates
alcohol-induced liver injury. In specific aim#1, we will determine the molecular mechanism on the inhibition of
neutrophilic miR-223 by NCF1. Our data and planned experiments in specific aim#1 will expand our current
knowledge on the signaling pathway in the neutrophils, neutrophilic Ncf1-induced oxidative stress, and miR-
223 expression. The next important question to address is how the inhibition of miR-223 by NCF1-induced
oxidative stress leads to hepatocyte injury. In specific aim #2, we will determine the downstream crosstalk
between neutrophil-induced ROS generation and hepatocytes via extracellular vesicles (EVs) leading to
alcohol-induced liver injury. Taken together, we have developed animal and cellular models to mechanistically
examine the roles of neutrophils in ALD pathogenesis. Understanding the mechanism linking neutrophils to
ALD pathogenesis is of importance; this will pave a way for the discovery of potential targeted therapy for
patients with ALD."

Social relationships are a key component of human health and survival and impairments in social
behavior have a major impact in many psychiatric conditions. Yet despite the importance of social
context to health, there remains no FDA-approved medications that target social cognition and
behavior. Social context is defined by the social stimuli available to an animal, is a key mediator
of behavior in rodents, and impacts social choices. Yet little is known about how neuronal circuits
encode social context and choice.In rodents, circuits in ACC that project to the amygdala (ACC-
BLA) and Nucleus accumbens (ACC-Nac) have been shown to be necessary for different aspects
of social information transfer. However, how neural activity in these regions encode social context
and choice is not known. We developed a social choice paradigm in which mice choose access
to a novel or a familiar/cagemate mouse. In this novel paradigm, mice consistently show
preference for a social target over a novel object, but they show variable individual biases in social
choice between a novel and cagemate conspecific. Recording neural activity from the ACC-BLA
and ACC-Nac circuits during this behavioral paradigm will allow for a more nuanced
understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying social choice. In order to better understand
how activity recorded during this and traditional social behavioral paradigms we will leverage
recently developed statistical models and inference algorithms to cluster nonlinear dynamical
neural responses into an unspecified number of functional sub-groups called Functional Encoding
Units (FEUs). We will also apply deep learning tools for behavioral analysis to engage in joint
modeling of neural and behavioral data. This will enhance our ability to predict social context and
enrich encoding of social behavior. Lastly, given the impact of 3,4-Methylenedioxy
methamphetamine (MDMA) on social behavior and empathy and its recent clinical significance in
post traumatic stress disorder, we hypothesize that MDMA paired social exposure will bias social
choice in our paradigm. We will apply deep learning to behavioral analysis of our paradigm in
order to test this hypothesis. Through this K-Award we will define how social stimuli are encoded
in a context-specific manner within ACC-BLA and ACC-Nac circuits during social choice and how
MDMA biases these social choices. In parallel, intensive mentoring, directed readings, and
structured coursework will enhance my skills and toolkit in computational modeling and machine
learning-based analysis of both neural and behavioral data, and behavioral pharmacology, setting
the stage for independence."
10876314,"Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a major cause of liver disease. However, there are no FDA-approved
drugs to treat NASH, due in large part to an incomplete understanding of NASH mechanisms, particularly those
involved in NASH-induced liver fibrosis. A key feature of NASH is the accumulation of dead hepatocytes (HCs),
particularly apoptotic HCs (apHCs) and necroptotic HCs (necHCs). In other diseases, the impact of dead cells
is largely determined by their fate, i.e., clearance by macrophages (Mφs), but surprisingly little is known about
this in NASH. This proposal aims to address this fundamental gap and thereby gain new insights into potentially
druggable and human-relevant NASH mechanisms, particularly those involving cellular cross-talk. A key concept
is that the Mφ clearance of apoptotic cells (""efferocytosis"") vs. necroptotic cells are distinct in terms of mecha-
nisms and consequences, and I have shown the Mφ clearance of both apHC and necHCs is impaired in human
and mouse NASH. Based on extensive preliminary data, my proposal addresses specific hypotheses on apHC
efferocytosis in Aim 1 (K99) and necHC clearance in Aim 2 (R00). In Aim 1, I will test the hypothesis that loss of
the efferocytosis receptor TIM4 in NASH Mφs causes defective apHC clearance and contributes to NASH pro-
gression. I will ask if deletion of Mφ-TIM4 in NASH mice accelerates the progression to impaired efferocytosis
and liver fibrosis in early NASH. Conversely, I will use an inducible model to restore Mφ-TIM4 during NASH. I
have shown this restores apHC efferocytosis, and I will test the prediction that it will decrease HSC activation
and liver fibrosis. I will next explore a mechanism-based therapeutic idea to restore Mφ-TIM4 in NASH, asking if
this drug can improve efferocytosis and dampen NASH progression. Finally, I will conduct scRNA-seq analyses
of the livers of the Mφ-TIM4-restoration model to probe the hypothesis that apHC efferocytosis leads to the
secretion Mφ molecules that promote a pro-resolving Mφ phenotype and maintain HSCs in a quiescent state. In
Aim 2, I will study a new pathway in NASH in which upregulation of the CD47-SIRPα axis impairs necHC clear-
ance. I propose that Mφ necHC uptake induces Mφs to secrete protein(s) that down-regulate HC-TAZ, thereby
suppressing the TAZ-IHH-HSC pathway involved in fibrotic NASH. I will seek proof for this idea in complementary
models of NASH by testing the effect of combining HC-TAZ-silencing and SIRPα blockade. I will then use a Mφ-
specific ""secretome"" mouse model and proteomics to identify the Mφ protein(s) induced by necHC uptake that
lower HC-TAZ. Finally, I will address 2 fundamental questions: (1) How is SIRPα up-regulated in NASH Mφs?;
and (2) Is Mφ uptake of necHCs in the setting of CD47/SIRPα-axis blockade receptor-mediated? My preliminary
data in these areas have highlighted new roles for two Mφ proteins in NASH, TREM2 and LRP1. Through these
Aims, I hope to gain new insights into NASH mechanisms and therapeutic concepts. My K99 project will allow
me to receive invaluable knowledge-based and technical mentoring and career advice as I transition to inde-
pendence, and the R00 encompasses an exciting research program that will help launch my independent career."
10726562,"Background and Veteran significance: Pathogens such as mycobacteria and Staphylococcus aureus, are
not only intrinsically antibiotic resistant, but are rapidly acquiring multi-drug resistant traits. Two billion people
are currently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and an increasing proportion are resistant to clinical
treatments. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a massive burden in healthcare, and
vancomycin resistant strains are increasingly problematic. These resistant infections are endemic to
developing countries and areas with a regular military presence, causing an increased burden for the Veterans
Administration healthcare system. Furthermore, MRSA infections are a major concern in VA hospitals and
are a significant cost in time, resources, and lives. New effective antibiotics are needed, and development
against novel targets is needed to treat infections caused by these resistant organisms.
Novel antibiotic targets: Protein kinases and phosphatases are critical in transducing cellular and
environmental signals to trigger growth and division or to respond to stress and environmental changes.
Human phosphorylation signaling is well studied, but bacterial signaling is less known and no antibiotics
targeting these pathways exist. Penicillin-binding And Serine/Threonine Associated (PASTA) kinases are
unique transmembrane kinases present in Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. PASTA kinases are necessary for
virulence, making them attractive drug targets. Genetic knockouts in MRSA and pharmacological inhibition in
MRSA or tuberculosis increase β-lactam susceptibility. Furthermore, genetic deletion of the cognate S/T
phosphatase in MRSA increases this synergy and decreases in vivo virulence. Inhibiting both kinases and
phosphatases to enhance β-lactam synergy is a novel approach to antibiotic development.
Goals of this award: The goals of this award are to 1) provide time and resources to facilitate Dr.
Wlodarchak’s transition from a mentored scientist to an independent translational investigator in the VA
system and to 2) develop lead compounds against novel antibiotic targets in MRSA and tuberculosis. The
central hypothesis tested here is that a coordinated attack on several nodes of the serine/threonine
phosphorylation signaling cascade will be an effective pharmacological strategy with low likelihood
of resistance development. This hypothesis will be tested by characterizing hits from a biochemical
phosphatase screen, developing MRSA kinase inhibitors, and performing the first global transcriptomic and
phosphoproteomic screen on MRSA under pharmacologic stress on this pathway.
Expected outcomes and impacts: Upon completion of this award, it is expected that Dr. Wlodarchak will
transition to a fully independent VA investigator with several well-characterized lead compounds against
MRSA and tuberculosis and leads on other potential targets in this pathway. This research will provide
preliminary data for a competitive VA Merit award for a translational drug development project. This will have
a positive impact on not only Dr. Wlodarchak’s career but also on Veterans’ health by providing mechanistic
insight on how phosphorylation signaling controls virulence and by providing tangible compounds that may
become clinical drugs. This will help provide options to stifle the current antibiotic resistance crisis and thus
improve patient survival and quality of life."
10726606,"To ensure aging Veterans remain active and mobile with as little musculoskeletal pain as possible, new
approaches to the prevention of osteoporosis and promotion of timely bone regeneration following a fracture are
necessary. This collaborative research study brings together a group of VA investigators with diverse
perspectives and insights of disease models and complementary technical expertise, to synergistically attack a
major clinical problem. i.e., a bone fracture, that leads to high morbidity and mortality among Veterans. The
overall research strategy of each integrated project is to use pre-clinical models of diseases that either weaken
bone or delay bone repair, to investigate novel ways to enhance the ability of parathyroid hormone (PTH) to
promote bone formation, and to assess disease and treatment effects on bone in a unified, stringent manner.
Already under-diagnosed and under-treated, osteoporosis is likely to increase the number of fragility fractures
being treated at VA hospitals without novel tools for early detection and novel treatment strategies that
circumvent the rare but devastating side effects of current therapies that inhibit bone loss. Addressing this unmet
clinical need, the overall aims are to identify therapeutic strategies to improve bone health among Veterans and
to enhance the bone anabolism of PTH signaling. The collaboration will address the overarching hypothesis:
health problems disproportionately affecting Veterans activate signaling pathways that increase bone resorption,
suppress bone formation, or impede the transition of cartilage to bone in a fracture callus such that improvements
in the clinical management of osteoporosis lie in understanding how these health problems hurt bone health.
This specific proposal is based on a large body of investigations that demonstrate a central role of the Ca2+-
sensing receptor (CaSR) in mediating systemic mineral homeostasis by counteracting the calciotropic activities
of PTH and in synergizing the anabolic effects of PTH on bone as well as the recent studies that show robust
anabolic actions of a long-acting PTH1-34/PTHrP hybrid analog, namely, LAPTH. We will test the hypothesis
that co-injections of calcimimetics with LAPTH produce much more robust osteoanabolism than the current
PTH1-34 therapy without producing hypercalcemia to accelerate rehabilitation of aging- or estrogen deficiency-
induced osteoporotic skeletons by activating CaSRs in mature OBs, OCYs, and OCLs through 3 highly integrated
specific Aims. Aim 1 will first establish the clinical relevance of the combined LAPTH/calcimimetic regimen by
(a) optimizing the drug doses needed to produce maximal skeletal anabolism without producing hypercalcemia
and the related complications in aging male mice and ovariectomized mice; and (b) determining whether an
antiresorptive treatment is required to retain the newly formed bone and ultimately resist bone fracture following
the combined treatment. Aim 2 will (a) define the role of CaSR in mature OB/osteocytes in mediating the anabolic
actions of the combined LAPTH/NPS-R568 treatment by assessing changes in mineral and skeletal parameters
and perilacunar remodeling (PLR) activities in mice with their Casr genes ablated in those cells; (b) delineate
the underlying cell-autonomous mechanisms by comparing the effects of the compounds individually and in
combination on the proliferation, survival, differentiation, and mineralizing functions of primary OBs and
osteocytic MLO-Y4 cells with or without CaSR overexpression or knockdown in culture; and (c) elucidate
signaling cross-talk between CaSR and PTH1R in mature OBs and MLO-Y4 cells by single live cell imaging
technology. Aim 3 will (a) define the role of OCL CaSR in preventing the development of hypercalcemia and in
mediating osteoanabolic effects of the combined LAPTH/NPS-R568 treatment by assessing changes in mineral
and skeletal homeostasis in mice with their Casr genes knocked-out in OCLs; and (b) define the underlying
mechanisms by examining the effects of the compounds on the growth, survival, differentiation, and bone-
resorbing functions of cultured OCLs overexpressing or lacking CaSR. Successful completion of the study will
provide essential information for designs of “first-in-man” trials for more effective treatments of osteoporosis."
10726607,"Nationwide, Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile infection is the most common cause of antibiotic-
associated diarrhea and the most frequent hospital-acquired infection. Recent epidemiological studies have
shown an alarming increase in incidence of C. difficile infection in disabled Veterans. Hospital-based infection
control programs and careful choice of antibiotic treatments have been beneficial, but recurrent and drug-
resistant C. difficile infections persistently burden the VA healthcare system. Therapeutically, fecal microbiota
transplant has shown promising success but lacks specificity and standardization. To identify new therapeutic
targets or strategies for disease prevention, a better fundamental understanding of how C. difficile toxins damage
colonic tissue, and how the human host responds, is essential.
 Pathogenic strains of C. difficile produce toxin A (TcdA) and/or toxin B (TcdB), which directly kill host cells
and induce an inflammatory response in the colonic mucosa. Clinical isolates of C. difficile encoding TcdB alone
are sufficient to produce the whole spectrum of pathology in patients with C. difficile infection. Bezlotoxumab is
a neutralizing antibody against TcdB and a therapeutic drug for preventing recurrent C. difficile infection.
Therefore, TcdB is considered a prominent driver of human disease and will be the specific focus of this proposal.
Recently, significant progress has been made to identify host cell surface receptors for TcdB, specifically Nectin-
3, CSPG4, and the Frizzled family of Wnt receptor proteins. The expression of these receptors in human colonic
tissue and their respective contribution to TcdB function is not clearly understood. Furthermore, the epithelial cell
subtypes targeted by TcdB and how interactions with these cells contribute to pathogenesis during the course
of C. difficile infection is understudied. Emerging data suggest TcdB specifically targets the stem and progenitor
cells in the base of colonic crypts potentially with the effect of delaying epithelial reconstitution. The Frizzled
family of receptors are critical for regulating colonic stem cell function. Additionally, TcdB transactivates the
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a mediator of colonic epithelial cell stem cell behavior. This proposal
is based on preliminary data suggesting EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3 receptors facilitate TcdB-induced cell death.
The effect of TcdB on ErbB signaling has not been studied in vivo, and the impact of this pathway on C. difficile
pathogenesis is not known.
 Given the relevance of ErbB signaling to colonic stem cell behavior in homeostasis and injury repair, it may
be that targeting stem or progenitor cells is a critical mechanism of TcdB virulence. The main hypothesis of
this proposal is TcdB induces ErbB signaling in colonic stem/progenitor cells as an important
component of the pathogenesis of C. difficile infection. The proposed experiments are aimed at using
recombinant TcdB and isogenic C. difficile spores with in vivo mouse models and ex vivo human colonoids to
understand how TcdB interacts with ErbB receptors in gastrointestinal epithelial cells. The results will determine:
(1) the ability of wild type and specific mutant TcdB toxins deficient in receptor binding to alter ErbB pathways in
vivo; (2) the impact and mechanism of ErbB inhibition on TcdB-mediated cell death; (3) the specific cell subtypes
that are affected during TcdB-mediated colonic injury. The long-term goal of this work is to reveal targets for
therapeutic strategies that interdict the pathogenesis of C. difficile infection."
10864034,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a re-emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus, that during the 2015-2016 outbreak in the Americas was associated with severe and devastating developmental abnormalities, including microcephaly, in babies born from infected women. The single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of ZIKV directs translation of viral proteins, functions as a template for replication of the genome and is packaged into new virus particles. These functions are in part regulated by specific RNA structures within the untranslated regions of the RNA, and via interactions with viral and cellular proteins. More recently RNA modifications have been shown to significantly affect the virus infectious cycle. Although more than 170 different RNA modifications are known to decorate natural RNAs, only N6-methyladenosine has been reported to affect ZIKV gene expression. The role of other RNA modifications on ZIKV RNA is presently unknown. Using biotinylated antisense oligonucleotides to affinity isolate virus RNA from cells and virions, and mass spectrometry to identify RNA modifications, we discovered that more than 30 different RNA modifications are present on ZIKV RNA. In this application we focus on pseudouridine (Y), an abundant but understudied RNA modification. The incorporation of Y on cellular RNAs affects the folding, stability, and translation of RNA, and RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions. We propose that Y on the ZIKV RNA genome promotes virus translation and replication. In this application we propose using a next generation sequencing approach combined with chemical modification of pseudouridine to identify specific Y sites on ZIKV genome (Aim 1). Next, we will undertake RNAi depletion and overexpression of cellular pseudouridine synthase proteins to identify the host enzymes responsible for installing pseudouridine on ZIKV RNA (Aim 2). Last, we will use mutagenesis and modulation of the pseudouridine synthase enzymes to elucidate if pseudouridine regulates ZIKV translation and/or replication (Aim 3). Moreover, these studies will be undertaken in the context of virus infection in mammalian and mosquito cells, two hosts biologically relevant to the virus life cycle, which could inform the role of RNA modifications in virus transmission and host adaptation. We expect that this research will advance our knowledge of RNA modifications which have been shown to be novel and important regulators of viral gene expression and improve our understanding of the molecular biology of ZIKV. This research will therefore provide critical information on a virus with significant impacts on human health and that currently lacks therapeutic options."
10929554,"Because children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) are frequently unable to report their pain
verbally, parents often serve as proxy reporters in interpreting and describing their child's pain. Although there
is substantial evidence that interactions among biological, psychological, and social factors at the level of both
the child and the parent influence children's behavioral pain expression and parents' interpretation of pain
behavior in the general population, there has been almost no work investigating the influence of dyadic
parent-child relationships on pain assessment among children with IDD. The long-term goal of this project is to
improve the understanding of dynamic and reciprocal processes influencing how parents rate and respond to
pain in children who have difficulty expressing themselves verbally due to IDD and who may exhibit
idiosyncratic pain signs. To achieve this end, the short-term goal of this project is to identify the specific parent
and child factors associated with pain expression among children with IDD and differences in parental pain
intensity ratings. The project will achieve this objective by recruiting a large sample of parent-child dyads in
which the children are between the ages of 1.5 and 5 years and have been diagnosed with global
developmental delay (GDD). Dyads will be video recorded during a clinically-indicated blood draw to evaluate
pain expression, parents' pain intensity ratings, and parental behaviors during the pain event. Information on
parents' overall judgments of their children's pain sensitivity will also be collected. We will collect information on
the children's adaptive behavior, communication abilities, and gross motor function, as well as several
standardized rating scales to categorize parents' general negative affect and pain-related beliefs and
cognitions. Completion of the proposed project will lead to improved understanding of how parent-child factors
interact to influence parents' judgments of pain among children who cannot self-report."

Owing to the aging of populations worldwide, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is reaching epidemic proportions, with
a large social and economic burden. While the most notable symptom of AD is the severe memory loss,
patients with AD also suffer from neuropsychiatric symptoms, including impaired sociability and aggression,
which represent significant challenges to the care for these patients. Unfortunately, the mechanisms
underlying these neuropsychiatric deficits during AD pathogenesis remain to be fully understood and
effective treatments are limited. The brain 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) regulates multiple
physiological functions, including the control of anger, aggression, mood and cognition. Interestingly,
numerous studies reported that the brains of AD patients display extensive “5-HT denervation”, as
demonstrated by reduced 5-HT neuron numbers or 5-HT bioavailability. These suggest that impaired brain
5-HT signaling contributes to certain AD symptoms. We identified several loss-of-function point mutations in
the human HTR2C gene, encoding 5-HT 2C receptor (5-HT2CR), from individuals with cognitive deficits and
social incompetence. We generated a knock-in mouse model, Htr2cF327L, to mimic one such mutation and
found that these mutant mice recapitulate human symptoms, including impaired memory, decreased
sociability and increased aggression. Given the similarity between the Htr2cF327L-induced phenotypes and
those seen in AD, we tested effects of lorcaserin (a selective 5-HT2CR agonist) in an amyloid precursor
AppNL-G-F knock-in AD mouse model. Interestingly, lorcaserin ameliorates cognitive and neuropsychiatric
deficits in AppNL-G-F mice, associated with enhanced neural plasticity in the ventral hippocampal CA1 (vCA1).
These findings led to a general hypothesis that the 5-HT/5-HT2CR signaling ameliorates cognitive and
social behaviors in AD. To test this hypothesis, we will first combine the retrograde chemogenetics and
loss- or gain-of-function mouse models to determine the role of the 5-HT→vCA1 circuit in cognition,
sociability and aggression in health and AD pathogenesis. Using site-specific gene manipulation and the
humanized genetic mouse models, we will also determine the role of vCA1 5-HT2CRs in cognition, sociability
and aggression in health and AD pathogenesis. Finally, we will test lorcaserin effects in two pre-clinical AD
models (with distinct pathogenic mechanisms): AppNL-G-F and PS19. Importantly, we will test these mice at
various ages along the disease progression to determine the crucial time window for this pharmacological
strategy to be most effective. Results obtained from these studies are expected to advance our
understanding about the fundamental biology of cognitive/social behaviors and the neurobiology of human
AD progression. In addition, these studies carry significant translational values and will provide a framework
for novel therapeutic strategies to ameliorate cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD."
10894061,"Project Summary/Abstract: River Rwizi the main source of water for Mbarara City and
surroundings is threatened by anthropogenic pollution. Preliminary studies detected pesticides,
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals at concentrations higher than WHO drinking
water recommendations, exposing over 91,964 City residents to pollutants. Pollutant exposure
is linked to Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDS) and emerging pollutants (EPs) pose new
threats to human health. No study has fully characterized EPs in River Rwizi or wastewater
treatment plants (WWTPs) in its catchment yet EPs and wastewater have an inextricable link. It
is hypothesized that the changing anthropogenic activities in Mbarara City have increased the
concentrations of EPs in River Rwizi, exposing residents to higher risks of NCDs through
perturbations of the metabolome. This study will inform intervention strategies to reduce
environmentally induced diseases in LMICs contributing to NIEHS goals and Uganda’s health
priorities of disease prevention, mitigation and control. Candidate: I have skills in research
methodology, data analysis, scientific presentation, and manuscript writing accrued during my
BS, MSc and PhD training and research works that resulted in 23 publications so far. This K43
grant will secure me training and mentorship in: advanced research methodology, management
of large data, research administration, responsible conduct of research, and grant writing. This
proposed career development plan will build on my previous training to facilitate me to
become an independent investigator through five training goals: 1) execution of advanced
qualitative and quantitative 1H-NMR and LC-MS metabolomics; 2) advanced statistical
analyses; 3) interpretation of metabolomics data in the context of biological processes; 4)
strengthening leadership and professional skills; and 5) application of histopathology to chronic
exposure studies. Mentors and Environment: This plan will benefit from physical and human
resources available through Mbarara University of Science and Technology [through Dr.
Tusubira and Prof. Alele (Biochemist and Toxicologist)], the Universities of San Diego and
Makerere [Profs. Bolender and Ntale, Chemists]. Research: I will (i) Identify and quantify EPs in
River Rwizi and in WWTPs in its catchment using chromatographic techniques and Wastewater
Epidemiology approach. (ii) The effect of exposure to EPs will be studied by metabolomics and
histopathology approaches. My short-term goal is to identify candidate metabolites associated
with exposure to EPs while my long term goal is to develop a career in Environmental
toxicology. Towards the end of this support I will apply for an R01."
10881985,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Microphysiological systems have great potential for modeling human disease but advanced in vitro models of
parasitic infection and immunity are severely underrepresented. Parasites are major causes of morbidity and
mortality globally, infecting millions of people every year, yet, there are no effective vaccines available for any
enteric parasitic infection. Oral transmission via contaminated food or water is the most common route of
parasitic infection for humans, but our knowledge of parasite/host interactions, including how parasites interact
with immune cells to either cause disease or elicit a protective immune response, within the intestinal tract is
very limited. There is a critical need to create improved in vitro models of human immune-parasite interactions
to capture key features present during parasitic infection establishment and disease progression. To address
this need we will develop a microphysiological gut vasculature lumen system based on the LumeNEXT
microfluidic device system. This 3-dimensional cell culture device recapitulates the gut architecture and
includes a human intestinal epithelial lumen flanked by blood and lymphatic vasculature. With these advanced
in vitro models, we will introduce parasites into the intestinal epithelium and human immune cells into the
vasculature to monitor parasitic disease and immune response. Our goal is to create a microphysiological
system that can be used for the study of any protozoan parasite. For this proposal, we will use the protozoan
parasites Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) and Entamoeba histolytica (E. histolytica) because 1) they are human
pathogens of global importance, 2) they are on distinct branches of the protist evolutionarily tree, 3) they have
defined lab growth conditions and genetically tagged marker strains, 4) our lab has recently developed the
unique ability to produce large numbers of the highly infectious oocysts and cysts forms of both T. gondii. Our
data shows that T. gondii infection of the intestinal epithelial lumen in our in vitro model system elicits an active
immune response and migration of human immune cells from the vasculature. In this project, we will use these
3D biomimetic gut-vasculature lumen models to address critical knowledge gaps of the human immune
responses to T. gondii and E. histolytica. We will incorporate an anaerobic environment so that the immune
responses can be defined under hypoxic conditions. These experiments will provide the foundational
understanding of the human innate immune responses to intestinal T. gondii infection that are essential for
vaccine development. We will also model E. histolytica invasive disease using nutrient limitation and co-culture
with Clostridiodes difficile. The advances we will achieve in this proposal will allow the microbiology and
immunology fields to determine the immune responses to the biologically relevant stages of intestinal parasites
in human models."

Aberrant immune response to injury is a major pathogenic driver of adverse extracellular matrix remodeling after
acute lung injury (ALI) and a wide range of fibrotic lung diseases (referred to inflammation-fibrosis axis).
However, there is currently no established approach for noninvasive assessment of dysregulated lung
inflammation. This gap along with the pathophysiological heterogeneity and variability of the clinical course of
patients has hampered precision medicine management of fibrotic lung diseases. Chemokine-like receptor-1
(CMKLR1) is chemokine receptor which is overexpressed in profibrotic monocyte-derived macrophages, a
leukocyte subset with crucial roles in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis. Our central goal is to determine the
potential of CMKLR1-targeted PET for i) quantitative imaging of lung inflammation; ii) prognostication of
the risk of disease progression; and iii) early monitoring of the response to anti-inflammatory and anti-
fibrotic interventions in experimental models of ALI and fibrotic lung injury. We will also address the clinical
relevance of CMKLR1-targeted PET and its potential for future clinical translation by determining the expression
of CMKLR1 in the lungs of patients with COVID-19 and several categories of fibrotic lung diseases vs. healthy
controls. Our preliminary data revealed a significant increase in lung uptake of a novel CMKLR1-targeted tracer
(64Cu-NODAGA-CG34) in two murine models of lipopolysaccharide-induced ALI and bleomycin-induced fibrotic
lung injury, which was primarily driven by the accumulation of monocyte-derived macrophages. Our central
hypothesis is that i) CMKLR1 serves as a biomarker of monocyte-derived macrophages in ALI and
fibrotic lung diseases; hence its targeted imaging by 64Cu-NODAGA-CG34 PET allows for ii) predicting
the risk of progression into sustained inflammation and fibrosis; and iii) monitoring the early therapeutic
response to anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic interventions. We propose three Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1: To determine the immunoprofile of CMKLR1-expressing leukocytes in A) murine models of ALI
and fibrotic injury, and B) lung specimens of patients with COVID-19 and fibrotic lung diseases.
Specific Aim 2: To validate the accuracy of CMKLR1-targeted PET as a biomarker of inflammation at different
stages of ALI and fibrotic injury in murine models.
Specific Aim 3: To determine the potential of CMKLR1-targeted PET in A) disease prognostication; and B) early
detection of the therapeutic response in murine models of ALI and fibrotic lung injury.
Impact: By determining the role of CMKLR1-targeted PET for imaging macrophage-driven inflammation and
defining the expression of CMKLR1 across various fibrotic lung diseases, this proposal may lead to a precision
medicine strategy that allows for i) improved risk stratification; ii) prospective identification of patients with a high
likelihood of favorable response to anti-inflammatory/anti-fibrotic interventions (hence, sparing the others from
adverse effects and costs); & iii) personalized treatment adjustment based on early monitoring of the response."
10930869,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Knee osteoarthritis is a very common and debilitating condition, affecting >14 million Americans. Many people
with knee osteoarthritis require total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to treat pain and improve function, and opioids
remain the primary modality for treatment of pain after TKA. However, opioids carry significant side effects,
with ~80% of surgical patients reporting at least one moderate or severe side effect (e.g. nausea, dizziness,
constipation). Moreover, perioperative opioid exposure is associated with patients becoming dependent on
opioids long after surgical recovery, and new chronic opioid dependence is subsequently associated with
increased healthcare costs, the development of opioid use disorder (addiction), overdose, and death. Hence,
research into opioid alternatives for postoperative pain is of critical importance. Cannabinoids,
including
cannabidiol (CBD), are one class of potential opioid-sparing pain medications. While CBD is used by an
estimated 14% of the general public, most frequently for chronic pain and related symptoms (including as an
opioid substitute), rigorous clinical research on CBD is limited. CBD shows great promise, as it is non-
intoxicating, and reduces pain, anxiety and inflammation in animal studies. Previous research has found that
CBD reduced opioid craving and anxiety, which further suggests it may decrease opioid use after surgery. It is
also well tolerated across numerous medical conditions. Moreover, CBD (Epidiolex), the study drug we will
use, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating some seizure disorders, and it is not subject
to the same regulatory restrictions as
Δ
-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). In this study, we will recruit 380 patients
undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) from two large health systems. In this multi-site, 2x2 factorial,
double-blind, randomized controlled trial, participants will receive one of four combinations of placebo or CBD
(300 mg/day) for one week prior to surgery together with CBD or placebo for 4 weeks following surgery. Our
primary outcome will be post-operative opioid consumption in the 4-week period following surgery. The study
design will also allow us to investigate and untangle CBD's pre- and post-surgical effects, including reduction
of anxiety, sleep disturbance and inflammation. We will also conduct detailed investigations of the side effects
and adverse events, as well as pharmacokinetics of CBD throughout the treatment course. The successful
completion of this study will give much needed evidence for the role of CBD as an opioid-sparing medication
for pain after surgery. Given that there are more than 50 million surgeries each year in the United States, these
findings could have much broader implications beyond TKA and would motivate important new lines of
research into the role of CBD."
10917231,"Approximately one in 10 US households experience food insecurity, which is associated with cardiometabolic
disease risk. Federal food assistance programs are often insufficient, and therefore the charitable food system,
largely comprised of food banks that distribute food to partner agencies (e.g., pantries), is a regular food
source for 53 million people a year. The quality of food offered in pantries and consumed by clients often does
not align with US dietary guidelines. Pantry interventions to promote healthier food choices can improve clients’
health but have not been widely adopted due to implementation barriers. The project’s overall objective is to
use multi-level behavioral economics (BE) interventions to implement evidence-based strategies to improve
the dietary quality of food offered by pantries and selected and consumed by clients. Traffic light nutrition
ranking is an evidence-based BE strategy for increasing healthy food choices in multiple settings. Feeding
America, the largest U.S. private hunger relief organization, released recommendations in 2021 for food banks
to implement traffic light nutrition ranking on their ordering platforms. Supporting Wellness at Pantries (SWAP)
is a program to guide both traffic light labeling for use on ordering platforms and pantry shelves, as well as food
pantry layout to inform clients and encourage healthy food choice. Nevertheless, widespread implementation of
SWAP is challenging due to barriers such as time constraints and competing priorities. The proposed project is
a collaboration with the Greater Boston Food Bank (GBFB) to test BE strategies (choice architecture, framing,
social norms, and incentives) for implementation of an evidence-based intervention (traffic light nutrition
ranking, SWAP) at two levels of the charitable food system: a food bank and food pantries. We will conduct a
Hybrid Type II effectiveness-implementation study, guided by the Practical, Robust, Implementation, and
Sustainability Model (PRISM) to examine Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-
AIM) domains. Aim 1 is a randomized controlled trial of 600 GBFB partner agencies to determine if using BE
strategies on the GBFB ordering platform will increase agencies’ utilization of the platform’s traffic light nutrition
labels (Reach) and their orders of healthy food over 12 months (Effectiveness and Maintenance). Aim 2 is a
waitlist-control randomized trial of 30 GBFB pantries to determine if BE interventions will increase pantries’
implementation of SWAP (Implementation, Adoption) and improve clients’ food selection and dietary intake,
assessed with the PRIME diet screener and Veggie Meter skin carotenoid measure over 24 months
(Effectiveness, Maintenance). Aim 3 will evaluate the budget impact and cost-effectiveness of BE strategies
(Implementation, Effectiveness) from the food bank’s and pantries’ perspectives. Results of this research will
inform Feeding America and other national and local hunger relief organizations about the implementation and
dissemination of evidence-based nutrition recommendations that can improve the diet and health of
marginalized families at highest risk for cardiometabolic diseases."
10877003,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Enteric viruses encounter a vast array of microbes in the mammalian intestine, and microbiota influence their
infection efficiency. Previous work has shown that most enteric viruses benefit from the microbiota, and
microbiota depletion reduces infection with enteric viruses including poliovirus, coxsackievirus, noroviruses,
and one strain of reovirus called T3SA+. However, recent studies indicate that members of the Reoviridae
family are outliers in microbiota effects. For example, rotavirus infection is inhibited by bacteria, and most
tested strains of reovirus have enhanced replication upon microbiota depletion. Interestingly, a pair of reovirus
strains differ by a single amino acid but have opposing effects from microbiota depletion. Microbiota depletion
decreases replication of strain T3SA+ but increases replication of strain T3SA-. These viruses differ by a
proline-leucine polymorphism in the s1 attachment protein, which confers sialic acid binding to the T3SA+
strain but not the T3SA- strain. Recent studies indicate that these two reovirus strains also differ in intestinal
cell tropism and sensitivity to host innate immune responses in mice. Thus, these isogenic viruses provide an
unprecedented opportunity to define how microbiota influence viral infection. In this work we will 1) examine
the specificity of reovirus-glycan interactions including interactions with microbial glycans, 2) determine how
microbiota facilitate infection with reovirus strain T3SA+, and 3) elucidate mechanisms of microbiota inhibition
of reovirus strain T3SA-. These studies will provide mechanistic insight into how microbiota influence enteric
virus infection in the complex environment of the intestine."
10897989,"The scope of the problem is that kidney diseases become more abundant as the US population lives longer.
In particular, the risk, incidence, and prevalence of CKD increases with age. As a result, disease severity is
higher in elderly patients, the largest group to undergo first-time chronic dialysis. Injury to podocytes remains
the primary cause for glomerulosclerosis in both aging and disease. Yet, understanding the intersection of
podocyte injury and aging, and the underlying mechanisms responsible are a major unmet need. To close this
knowledge gap, our pilot studies showed that podocyte injury in young mice from two models of experimental
Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) unexpectedly induces short-term replicative- and stress-induced
premature senescence. In the long-term this results in premature podocyte aging in early middle-aged mice,
which under healthy conditions typically do not exhibit signs of senescence and aging. This phenotype was
accompanied by glomerulosclerosis and a reduced kidney function. Finally, the same correlations were also
observed in young patients with FSGS. Based on these preliminary data, we propose a novel paradigm that
podocyte injury and aging intersect, and because of these overlapping mechanisms, injury amplifies aging.
 The overall goal of this proposal is to identify novel mechanisms for podocyte injury progression with
advancing age. Specific Aim #1 will prove that injury to podocytes causes a premature aging podocyte
phenotype. This will be achieved by testing the following hypotheses: (i) Injury to non-aged podocytes causes
a p16-dependent replicative senescence and an aged phenotype; (ii) Injury to young podocytes causes a p53-
p21 axis-dependent stress-induced premature senescence; (iii) Long-term consequences of injury-induced
senescence is a premature podocyte aging phenotype causing glomerular scarring and reduced kidney
function. Specific Aim #2 will prove that the mechanisms of podocyte injury and that of aging intersect/overlap
and are amplified when superimposed on one another. We will test the following hypotheses: (i) Distinct
subpopulations of podocytes are responsible for the intersection between injury and aging; (ii) A combination of
inflammatory cytokines, immune modulators and growth factors secreted as a result of the senescent-
associated secretory phenotype triggered by podocyte injury promotes disease progression.
 Innovative experimental approaches used include two models of podocyte injury, loss-of-function
approaches using four new podocyte-specific mouse mutants to limit podocyte senescence/ aging, gain-of-
function approaches using two new podocyte-specific transgenic mice, single nuclei transcriptomics of injured
podocytes over time and the Design-of-Experiment methodology to holistically explore the podocyte signaling
environment. The proposal is significant for its short-term translational impact by integrating our mouse data
with large transcriptomic data sets from aged and diseased human kidneys and for its long-term impact in
developing new strategies to counter the age-dependent demise of kidney function from disease."
10867407,"Project Summary
 Adult digestive epithelia depend on adjacent mesenchyme to sustain intestinal stem cells (ISCs) at the
crypt base and drive cell maturation at the villus base. Precisely layered cells that provide redundant and
partially overlapping “trophic” factors execute these essential polarized functions. Our lab’s contributions to
this emerging understanding include deep characterization of small intestine (SI) and colonic mesenchyme,
discovery of potent “trophocytes,” a cellular explanation for the crypt BMP signaling gradient, identification
of the authentic source of canonical Wnt ligands, and discovery of niche self-organization. Importantly,
work from several groups converges on nearly identical consensus cell populations in mouse and human
intestines. Strategically localized fractions of the most abundant cells (which express low PDGFRA),
including distinct CD81+ trophocytes, represent notable functional niche elements. In the developing gut
mesoderm, PDGFRAlo cells seem to give rise to key structural elements, such as different smooth muscle
(SM) compartments and unique intestinal capillaries, before the remaining PDGFRAlo cells generate the
ISC niche. Against the backdrop of a complete census of adult mesenchymal cells, these findings pave the
way to understand their embryonic origins in modern mechanistic terms. This simple but crucial tissue thus
offers opportunities to address a broad, fundamental question in developmental biology: How does an
embryonic anlage with limited external cell input achieve and retain its adult form? Because injured
intestines must reconstitute the mesenchymal compartment, the answers have important implications for
understanding and treating ulcerative and other forms of intestinal damage. Prior investigation of signaling
in intestinal development elegantly implicates Hedgehog (Hh, from endoderm) and BMP (from mesoderm)
in specifying at least SM and endothelial cells (EC), and possibly other compartments, but how these
signals elicit distinct cell fates in ostensibly similar progenitors remains unclear. Discrete cell identities
reflect opening and closing of thousands of different cis-regulatory elements (CREs); to deconstruct steps
that lie between a mesodermal anlage and the functional tissue into which it develops, we propose to study
the chromatin basis of SM (Aim 1) and EC (Aim 2) differentiation. We will map mesenchymal ontogeny
rigorously with respect to signature CREs for each resident cell type (Aims 1A and 1B), then investigate in
primary fetal cell cultures how Hh activity and BMP inhibition together induce the CRE complement
necessary for naïve precursors to undergo SM differentiation (Aim 1C). We then ask how the same signals
(albeit likely in different forms or concentrations) induce ECs in similar progenitors (Aim 2A). Finally, we
propose studies for mechanistic insight into processes designed for intestinal capillary growth to match, but
not exceed, resting tissue demands (Aim 2B). Together, this basic science effort aims for fundamental
knowledge about a tissue that is critical for intestinal function in resting and injured states."
10909312,"Our goal is to define the structural and functional mechanism by which the kinesin-3 motor KIF1A
generates force and moves along microtubules, and to define the structural basis of KIF1A-related
human diseases. The microtubule (MT) transport system regulates essential eukaryotic activities,
including neuronal cell division, neuronal migration and the transport of subcellular cargoes.
KIF1A, a member of the kinesin-3 family of MT-associated motor proteins, is a key mediator of
these activities as the major generator of MT plus-end-directed motility in neurons. KIF1A’s
cargoes include nuclei in dividing brain stem cells and synaptic vesicle precursors and dense core
vesicles in axon terminals. Not surprisingly, its dysfunction is implicated in a growing number of
neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders referred to as KIF1A-associated
neurological disorder (KAND). Unfortunately, these diseases remain poorly understood, in part
because KIF1A’s molecular mechanism remains unclear. For example, while most mutations
occur in KIF1A’s motor domain, high-resolution structures of the KIF1A-MT complex do not exist.
In addition, it remains unknown why Kif1A is superprocessive but easily gives up under load. In
this proposal, we will combine cryo-electron microscopy, single-molecule fluorescence, and
optical tweezers-based force measurements with innovative protein engineering to determine why
KIF1A is a weak but superprocessive motor, define high-resolution structures of the KIF1A-MT
complex as a function of KIF1A’s mechanochemical cycle and determine the structural defects
caused by disease mutations in KIF1A. These studies will provide a new understanding of KAND
and elucidate molecular targets for therapeutic interventions."
10918234,"Cell proliferation is a fundamental biological process that often occurs for cells in a 3D context in vivo, in which
cells are surrounded by extracellular matrix (ECM) and other cells, and various applications rely on the
proliferation of cells within a biomaterial. It has long been known that changes in matrix stiffness impact cell
behaviors through mechanotransduction, and mechanisms of stiffness-sensing in 2D culture are now
established. However, the mechanisms mediating the impact of changes in matrix stiffness on cell proliferation
in 3D remain unclear. Further, living tissues and ECMs are viscoelastic, exhibiting some characteristics of elastic
solids and some of viscous liquids. Matrix viscoelasticity is sensed through mechanotransduction, and we have
found that changes in matrix viscoelasticity impact cell spreading, migration, proliferation, stem cell
differentiation, matrix deposition, morphogenesis, and gene expression. However, the mechanisms mediating
the impact of matrix viscoelasticity on these processes, particularly proliferation remain unclear. The goal of the
proposed work is to determine the mechanism mediating the impact of matrix stiffness and viscoelasticity on cell
proliferation in 3D matrices. Our overall hypothesis is that mechanosensitive ion channel-mediated pathways
and integrin-mediated pathways interplay to sense matrix viscoelasticity and stiffness, and subsequently control
proliferation through changes in chromatin accessibility, YAP-independent transcription, and a set of molecular
regulators not implicated from 2D culture studies. We will address this hypothesis in 3 aims, using an approach
that involves the use of alginate hydrogels with independently tunable viscoelasticity, stiffness, and RGD ligand
density for 3D culture of adherent cells, including fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and mesenchymal stem cells. In
aim 1, we will determine the biophysical mechanisms underlying the impact of hydrogel viscoelasticity, stiffness,
and adhesivity on the proliferation of adherent cells in 3D culture. In Aim 2, we will elucidate transcriptional and
epigenetic regulation of mechanotransduction and proliferation, using RNA-seq and ATAC-seq combined with
advanced bioinformatics analyses. In Aim 3, we will identify novel regulators of proliferation and
mechanotransduction in 3D using genome-wide CRISPR screening. Innovative aspects of this approach include
the study of mechanisms mediating mechanotrasduction and proliferation in 3D matrices, the focus on
viscoelasticity (beyond stiffness), the potential for discovering YAP-independent mechanisms of
mechanotransduction, the identification of how the epigenome regulates mechanotransduction and proliferation
in 3D, and the application of a CRISPR screen to identify novel molecular regulators of mechanotransduction.
The significance of this work is that it will determine the biophysical and molecular mechanisms by which ECM
or biomaterial stiffness and viscoelasticity regulate cell proliferation in 3D. Given the importance of cell
proliferation, the ubiquity of matrix viscoelasticity in ECMs, and the potential relevance of discovered
mechanisms of mechanotransduction to other processes, the significance is expected to be high."

 Early-life adversity (ELA) is associated with vulnerability to mental illnesses that involve disruption of
the brain’s reward circuits. These vulnerabilities may manifest as anhedonia, a reduction in reward desire or
pleasure that is core feature of major depression. However, whether the association of ELA with anhedonia is
causal is difficult to establish in humans, and mechanisms underlying this relationship are not understood. Our
well-characterized rodent ELA model reliably leads to reward-circuit disruptions in a sex-dependent manner,
yet the circuit nodes and pathways that are most affected remain unclear.
 In searching for ELA-sensitive reward-circuit components, we discovered and are characterizing a
novel projection from basolateral amygdala (BLA) to nucleus accumbens (NAc) that expresses the
neuropeptide corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH). Neurons expressing CRH are often stress-sensitive, and
our preliminary data suggest this is also the case for the novel CRH+BLA-NAc pathway. Building on these
robust data, we will determine the functional roles of the projection in mice and test the hypothesis that ELA-
induced plasticity in this pathway contributes to sex-dependent effects of ELA on reward pursuit and
consumption, significantly advancing our understanding of the origins of mental illness.
 Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the novel CRH+BLA-NAc pathway modulates reward pursuit
(motivation) and / or consumption in typically reared male and female mice, capitalizing on the temporal
resolution of optogenetics and on formal motivation tasks to probe the specific role of the projection in the
motivational vs. consummatory aspects of reward. Aim 2 will use the same technologies to determine the role
of the CRH+ BLA-NAc projection in aberrant, sex-specific reward behaviors resulting from ELA. Aim 3 will
examine the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which aberrant CRH+ BLA-NAc inputs regulate reward
behaviors: we will identify the target cells of the projection following ex vivo optogenetic activation of BLA-
origin projection fibers in the NAc, and determine the relative roles of GABA neurotransmission vs CRH
receptor activation in the effects of projection stimulation on reward behaviors in male and female mice."
10908703,"WESTPA: A high-performance framework for simulating at the frontiers of biology (Renewal)
There is a ‘silicon ceiling’ that ultimately limits many, if not most, types of dynamical biological
simulations. That is, even the world’s most powerful computers cannot generate sufficiently long
simulations, whether for atomistic models of proteins or for realistic models of cell behavior. In many
cases, the key events may occur beyond simulation timescales – such as large conformational
transitions in proteins, drug membrane permeation, or transitions of cell behavior from healthy to
pathological states. The WESTPA software package is a powerful ‘meta tool’—software that controls
other software–which can make possible computations which otherwise would be impossible within a
given computing budget, while letting researchers continue to use simulation engines and models of
their choice. WESTPA appears to be the most commonly used platform for simulating ‘rare events’ at
different scales. WESTPA controls existing dynamics engines by orchestrating up to thousands of
trajectories run natively by those packages at any scale (e.g., OpenMM, Amber, BioNetGen, MCell)
using a ‘weighted ensemble’ strategy. Not only does WESTPA automatically parallelize the use of
dynamics engines – but because of the statistical process by which trajectories are added and
removed, WESTPA can obtain estimates of key kinetic and equilibrium observables in significantly less
computing time than would be required in ordinary parallelization. The aims of the proposal are (i) to
optimize WESTPA for cloud computing and supercomputing platforms, engineering interoperability with
state-of-the-art machine learning frameworks, and improving its ease of use; (ii) to make algorithmic
advances to enable applications to ever more challenging problems; (iii) to demonstrate the
effectiveness of WESTPA through a series of “showcase” examples from molecular to cellular scale
using a variety of dynamics engines; and (iv) to continue offering individualized guidance to
researchers, user support, training tutorials, and workshops. Completion of the aims will enable the
investigators, their experimental and computational collaborators, and users throughout the world to
make a wide range of contributions to the burgeoning field of biological simulation at multiple scales."

Hormone receptor (HR)+ breast cancer (BC) causes the majority of BC-related deaths in the US, reflecting an
unmet need for innovative therapeutic approaches. Indeed, resistance to standard treatments and metastatic
spread remain major challenges, and novel approaches such as immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs) have shown
limited efficacy so far. The long-term objective of this proposal is to mechanistically dissect the impact of BCL2,
an antiapoptotic protein that favors the resistance of cancer cells to death imposed by chemotherapy and
radiation therapy (RT), on the immunological configuration of treatment naïve and irradiated HR+ BCs.
Specifically, this project will test the highly innovative hypothesis that BCL2 may represent a therapeutically
actionable immune checkpoint because of its ability to preserve mitochondrial integrity, based on these
specific aims: 1) determining the influence of BCL2 levels on the immune microenvironment of treatment-naïve
human and mouse HR+ BCs; 2) defining the impact of BCL2 on the immune microenvironment of HR+ BCs
responding to RT in vitro and in vivo; and 3) elucidating the value of BCL2 as a target to boost the
immunostimulatory effects of RT in mouse models of HR+ BCs, including an innovative model that mimics key
features of human HR+ BC. BCL2 is a particularly significant target because ~80% of HR+ BC cases
overexpress BCL2, and the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax, is approved for clinical use. To achieve our goals,
diagnostic biopsies from women with HR+ BC will be evaluated by CODEX for BCL2 expression, tumor infiltration
by key immune cells that regulate anticancer immunity, and expression of immunosuppressive proteins like MHC
Class I and PD-L1. The impact of BCL2 on the immunological response of HR+ BC cells to RT will be interrogated
in vitro, by genetic (deletion, overexpression) and pharmacological (e.g., venetoclax administration) methods
coupled to flow cytometry, IF microscopy and ELISA for the assessment of key regulators of anticancer immunity.
Similar genetic and pharmacological approaches will be harnessed to alter BCL2 competence and delineate the
influence of BCL2 on the immunological TME of treatment-naïve and irradiated mouse HR+ BCs established in
immunocompetent hosts, based on IHC, flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing. In vitro studies by flow
cytometry and clonogenic assays, as well as in vivo studies based on mouse HR+ BC cells growing in
immunodeficient vs immunocompetent mice, will be employed to dissect the impact of BCL2 on intrinsic
radiosensitivity vs immune-dependent tumor control. Finally, different combinatorial regimens involving RT and
venetoclax will be investigated for efficacy (in both treatment-naïve and treatment resistance settings) and
potential mechanisms of resistance in an endogenous mouse model of HR+ BCs that mimics key features of
human HR+ BC. Our findings will elucidate the impact of BCL2 on the immune TME of HR+ BC and identify
the best approach to inform the initiation of clinical trials testing RT plus venetoclax in women with HR+
BC, a devastating disease that still affects >200,000 and kills >25,000 new women every year in the US."

The overarching goal of this research is to promote children’s positive socioemotional pathways and to prevent
maladaptive pathways. We elucidate why some children embark on positive paths toward prosocial,
internalized, rule-abiding conduct, and robust social competence, whereas others enter maladaptive paths
toward callousness, disregard for conduct rules and others’ feelings, antisocial behavior, and impoverished
competence. We focus on the parent–child early relationship, formed in the first years of life, as an influential
source of the divergent paths, and we longitudinally chart its complex, indirect yet powerful, long-term legacy.
Drawing from our extensive research, correlational and experimental, in low- and high-risk families, we propose
that although early relationship may not have long-term unqualified, direct effects, it nevertheless serves as a
powerful moderator of future parent–child unfolding dynamics. Specifically, early relationship can set the stage
for an adversarial, negative cascade. In suboptimal, insecure parent–child dyads, the child’s difficult
temperament easily triggers the parent’s negative, harsh, power-assertive control, which, in turn, leads to
detrimental child outcomes. In contrast, an early optimal relationship sets the stage for positive, cooperative,
effective socialization, and defuses risks of negative cascades. We proposed that parents’ and children’s
differing internal representations, expectations, and perceptions of each other (Internal Working Models, IWMs)
that characterize suboptimal and optimal relationships and come to guide parents’ and children’s behavior and
interactions are the key mechanisms that account for the divergent cascades. We are testing this framework in
an ongoing study of 200 community mothers, fathers, and children, richly assessed at 8, 16, 38, and 50-54
months. This application proposes to leverage those massive data to follow up the families at ages 5-6, 7-8,
and 9-10. Using state-of-science measures of parents’ and children’s social representations, in Aim 1 we
examine how their unfolding IWMs of each other are linked to their relationship quality, how children’s Theory
of Mind contributes to their IWMs, how children’s IWMs of the parents generalize to their representations of the
social world, particularly hostile attributional biases, and how the child’s IWMs of two parents become integrated
in development. In Aim 2, we examine the parent’s IWM of the child as moderating paths from child difficulty to
parental control, and the child’s IWM of the parent as moderating paths from parental control to child outcomes.
In Aim 3, we embed our model in the dynamics of the family system. Our multi-method, multi-level approach
encompasses observational, genetic, and reported measures of the parent’s and the child’s relational
information processing, representations, temperament, relationships, parental control, and child developmental
outcomes. Variable- and person-centered analyses rely on structural equation modeling to elucidate divergent
developmental cascades. We aim to realize a long-advocated – but yet to be accomplished – vision of research
integrating relationships, temperament, representation, and behavior in pathways to children’s adjustment."
10881924,"Project Summary: DNA 5'-C-phosphate-G-3' (CpG) methylation is a covalent epigenetic modification that
regulates gene expression and is highly sensitive to age and environmental factors. Critically ill patients exhibit
altered circulating blood DNA methylation profiles. We have recently reported a large scale methylome analysis
of COVID-19 in association with clinical outcomes, which suggests an epigenetic regulation of genes controlling
disease severity. Recent evidence indicates that many surviving COVID-19 patients develop long term
dysfunctions and the NIH-NHLBI has recently launched an initiative to elucidate the nature of Post-Acute
Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (PASC). It is currently unknown if the rapid methylome regulation evoked by
acute illness persist after SARS-CoV-2 resolution. Such persistence could underpin long term sequela
associated with this condition. Because DNA methylation is a relatively stable DNA chemical modification that
could influence long-term gene expression profiles and given that we recently found that multiple regions
developed during acute illness persist differentially methylated one year after hospital discharge, we
hypothesize that COVID-19 infection leads to enduring DNA methylation abnormalities that remain after
resolution of acute illness in association with the post-COVID-19 clinical profile. In this application, we
plan to conduct whole genome DNA methylation and RNA sequencing of circulating leucocytes to establish sub
phenotypes of PASC, predict future PASC development in the acute COVID-19, and determine which circulating
leucocyte lineage contributes to that enduring methylome."

MOLECULAR REGULATION OF CARDIOVASCULAR SEVEN TRANSMEMBRANE
RECEPTORS. All aspects of cardiovascular function are regulated by members of the seven
transmembrane receptor (7TMR or GPCR) family, and they are the commonest target of
therapeutic drugs. A universal mechanism regulating these receptors is desensitization of
heterotrimeric G protein signaling. Classically, this is mediated by a two-step process in which
activated receptors are phosphorylated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases, leading to the
binding of a β-arrestin (βarr) molecule which sterically interdicts further activation of the G protein.
More recently it has become clear that βarrs can also serve as multifunctional adaptors which act
as signal transducers in their own right. Moreover, for many receptors, ligands can be found which
disproportionately activate either G protein- or βarr-mediated signaling—i.e., ""biased ligands""
which may possess greater specificity of action and fewer side effects. Biased drugs for GPCR's
represent a major, as yet largely unmined opportunity for drug development. Another such
untapped opportunity to develop drugs with greater specificity and safety is presented by allosteric
ligands which, rather than binding to the orthosteric site of the receptors, where endogenous
ligands bind, interact with other sites. Accordingly, this proposal has three closely linked aims
which involve laying the groundwork for targeting both of these largely untapped opportunities by
developing the first biased allosteric ligands for a receptor of great cardiovascular significance,
the angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) as well as for the βarrs. In the process we aim to also
develop a molecular and atomic level understanding of how biased allosteric GPCR drugs
regulate signaling. These aims are: 1. To discover the first small molecule biased allosteric
modulators of the AT1R; 2. To discover novel small molecule allosteric modulators of the signal
transducer βarr; 3. To elucidate the mechanisms of allosteric regulation of downstream effectors
of βarrs. The insights which we will generate have the potential to guide the design of powerful
new cardiovascular drugs and will further our understanding of the conserved signaling
mechanisms of the greater GPCR family."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is exerting a significant public health impact in Mexico despite the availability of
effective screening strategies. Yet, there are no national CRC screening (CRCS) guidelines or organized CRCS
programs in Mexico. We aim to implement a CRCS program in an integrated health system that is context-
appropriate, sustainable, scalable, and easily transferable to different health systems in Mexico. We will
optimize FIT uptake and CRCS completion by adapting and evaluating evidence-based interventions (EBIs)
(patient education, patient reminders, patient navigation); designing implementation strategies (training with
technical assistance, practice champions, audit and feedback) to deliver these EBIs; and evaluating the
effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and implementation outcomes using a type 2 hybrid effectiveness
implementation study. Our proposed research is potentially groundbreaking and of substantial public health
significance in that it will be the first implementation research study in Mexico to address CRCS while applying
rigorous implementation science methods. It will advance scientific knowledge on the effectiveness of EBIs that
have been developed and tested in other countries and adapted for use in Mexico; it will also study the impact
of implementation strategies to deliver them in a real-world setting. Our proposed study will incorporate an
economic evaluation of the implementation of the EBIs to provide healthcare institutions with the necessary
information to plan for adoption and sustainability in settings with different resources."
10738719,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) are a growing problem among our nation’s Veteran population,
and current treatments are both costly and potentially disfiguring. The primary risk factors for NMSC development
are exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) wavelengths of sunlight and advanced age. Though the mutagenic effects of
UVB-induced bipyrimidine dimers in genomic DNA are well known, the mechanisms by which age impacts UVB-
dependent NMSC initiation in skin keratinocytes are less clear. The unique structural and physiological properties
of geriatric skin likely influence both the number and distribution of photolesions that form across the genome of
basal keratinocytes after UV exposure and the ways in which these cells respond to the damage. Moreover,
aged tissues including skin are known to contain a higher number of senescent dermal fibroblasts than younger
skin, which may alter cytokine and growth factor production and contribute to a pro-tumorigenic
microenvironment. One such factor that is expressed at lower levels in geriatric skin is insulin-like growth factor
1 (IGF-1). Our published and preliminary data show that the loss of IGF-1/IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) signaling in
epidermal keratinocytes results in UVB-irradiated keratinocytes that are unable to efficiently remove UVB
photoproducts from DNA or to properly activate the apical DNA damage response kinase ATR, which functions
to suppress error-prone DNA synthesis on damaged DNA templates. The objective of this proposal is to
determine how age and specifically IGF-1 receptor activation affect the formation and replication of UVB DNA
photoproducts in basal epidermal keratinocytes in human skin. The background of the research team, which
includes expertise in DNA repair, replication stress response signaling, genomics, keratinocyte biology, and
clinical dermatology, makes this group uniquely qualified to address this important clinical issue. The central
hypothesis of this proposal is that the skin of geriatric individuals is prone to carry out a more mutagenic form of
DNA synthesis following UVB exposure than the skin of younger individuals. This hypothesis has been derived
from significant preliminary and published data with both cultured keratinocytes in vitro and human skin biopsies
ex vivo and in vivo. The rationale for this proposed research is that it will define how the unique features of
geriatric skin predispose it to UVB mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. Our hypothesis will be tested by carrying
out the following three specific aims: Aim 1) Define how age and IGF-1 status influence UVB-induced DNA
photoproduct formation and repair across the keratinocyte genome in human skin epidermis; Aim 2) Determine
how IGF-1 signaling impacts the utilization of error-prone DNA polymerases in UVB-irradiated human skin
explants ex vivo and cultured keratinocytes in vitro; and Aim 3) Define how subject age and IGF-1 status affect
the replication of UVB-damaged DNA in human skin epidermis in vivo. Our approach is innovative because it
will provide a detailed, quantitative characterization of DNA damage formation and replication in skin epidermis
using novel technical approaches that have not previously been applied to human skin. The proposed research
is significant to the VA because it will show how the geriatric skin microenvironment contributes to UV
mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. Ultimately, we expect that the knowledge that will be gained here will provide
further mechanistic rationale for the use of clinical skin rejuvenation interventions aimed at preventing NMSC in
specific patient populations. Lastly, because many other cancers are associated with both advanced age and
the exposure of epithelial tissues to environmental and dietary DNA damaging agents, our work likely has
implications for understanding the pathogenesis of lung, colon, and esophageal cancers in older veterans."
10877968,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Nearly 5 million people in the USA suffer from heart failure, with approximately 400,000 heart failure-related
deaths occurring yearly. Heart failure causes a significant public healthcare burden and significantly reduces
mobility and quality of life. Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is a promising therapeutic option for end-stage
heart failure patients besides cardiac transplant, which is limited by the number of available donors. However,
severe complications, including bleeding and thrombosis, significantly worsen the long-term outcome in patients
with implanted LVADs. This proposed innovative interdisciplinary effort aims to maximize the LVAD
hemocompatibility from two different fronts: hemocompatible slippery hydrophilic (SLIC) coatings and innovative
stented inlet design. We hypothesize that by using the SLIC coating and innovative design optimization, the
device will achieve excellent hemocompatibility and dramatically reduce blood damage and thrombosis risk. The
objective of this project is to develop a novel magnetic levitated (maglev) LVAD with excellent hemocompatibility
to reduce thrombosis and complication incidents significantly. After a series of in vitro validation testing and
hemocompatibility evaluation, the LVAD prototype will be evaluated and validated in vivo with large animal
models. These breakthrough innovations will bring LVAD technology a giant leap forward, eventually crossing
the threshold of non-inferior outcomes compared to cardiac transplants. Four aims are proposed to complete
this project. In Aim 1 (Optimize SLIC Coatings for Maximum Antithrombotic Response), we will fabricate and
characterize the physical and chemical inhomogeneities of SLIC coatings. The coating will cover the entire
device, including drive system and inlet cannula. The properties and durability of the coatings will be thoroughly
tested. In Aim 2 (Optimize LVAD Design and Develop Novel Stented Inlet to Reduce Thrombosis Risk), we will
use a machine learning-based optimization framework and an innovative stented inlet design to reduce blood
damage and eliminate the risk of thrombosis at the inlet. The device's hemodynamic performance will be
evaluated in vitro by using 2D and 3D particle image velocimetry. In Aim 3 (Design and Evaluate Maglev Drive
System with Heart Rate Sensing for Speed Control), we will develop the Maglev drive system to reduce the
hemolysis and incorporate it with speed control modulation to reduce the occurrence of regional blood
stagnation. Finally, the SLIC LVAD will be validated in Aim 4 (Evaluate In Vitro and In Vivo Hemocompatibility
of the Pump Prototype) by both in vitro blood loop experiments and large-animal models for hemocompatibility
performance and device energy transmission efficiency. This novel device will potentially be developed as
a low-thrombosis-infection-risk therapeutic, a better alternative to cardiac transplant, providing long-
term support to end-stage heart failure patients."
10930175,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The key appeal of polygenic risk scores (PRS) is the provision of individual-level estimates of genetic liability to
complex disease. These proxies of genetic liability enable a raft of applications across basic research and clinical
settings. However, while PRS are set to play a pivotal role in the future of biomedical research, their present
formulation is suboptimal for application across diverse and admixed populations.
To address this we propose to develop high-resolution modeling to optimize the computation of PRSs across
diverse populations, which will: (i) use Bayesian hierarchical modeling to account for the population genetic
and statistical causes of low PRS portability between populations, (ii) deconstruct genetic risk into shared,
ancestry-specific and gene*environment sub-components, (iii) produce pathway-based PRSs that can help
expose the functional sources of the portability problem and explain ancestry disease heterogeneity. The key
deliverable will be the production of a suite of powerful PRS tools tailored to diverse and admixed populations.
The rationale is that failure to model important structural features that are inherent to diverse clinical populations
constitutes a vital loss of information. By modeling this high-resolution data in statistically principled and
rigorous ways, researchers will be equipped to perform powerful PRS prediction across all human populations
and in all individuals. This will offer unprecedented predictive power and insights into disease mechanisms.
In Aim 1, we develop a Bayesian hierarchical PRS method, BridgePRS3, that models differences in LD, effect
sizes and allele frequencies between ancestries and their constituent sub-ancestries. In Aim 2, we build a novel
method, admixPRS, for application to admixed individuals that deconstructs the genome into local ancestry
tracts corresponding to sub-ancestries, accounting for known admixture history, and decomposing genetic risk
into 3 sub-components. In Aim 3, we develop a pathway-based PRS method for diverse populations, PRSet+.
Finally, we will build a unifying PRS method, globalPRS, that calculates PRS in any individual, of any ancestry.
Our proposal is significant because the burgeoning application of PRS means that reducing disparity in PRS
predictive power will have immediate, high impact in diverse populations. By performing high-resolution modeling
to boost PRS predictive power by mirroring the structure of human populations, and exposing gene*environment
and pathway-level contributions to the PRS portability problem, our suite of PRS tools have the potential to
increase the clinical utility of PRS and our understanding of how genetic risk varies in global populations.
Our proposal is innovative because we develop the first Bayesian hierarchical PRS tools to model the high-
resolution structure of diverse and admixed populations, in relation to: (i) ancestry (modeling sub-ancestries),
genetic risk (3-component admixPRS model), the genome (pathway-level PRS), and phenotype (sub-types).
In summary, our proposal will deliver a suite of tools to the field to perform powerful PRS analyses in diverse
and admixed populations and to better understand global heterogeneity of PRS, traits and diseases."
10854822,"Project Summary:
Overview: Neurosurgical resection, ablation and stimulation can be curative for patients with medically
refractory epilepsy (MRE), however, successful treatment depends on precise localization of the seizure onset
zone (SOZ). Stereo-electroencephalography (EEG) is the gold standard for determining the SOZ and involves
implanting many intra-cranial depth electrodes to detect epileptiform activity. Unfortunately, there are often no
visible lesions on brain MRI and only a crude spatial map from scalp-EEG to guide the stereo-EEG
implantation, resulting in electrode positions that fail to definitively determine the SOZ. To meet the unmet
clinical need for consistent and accurate stereo-EEG guidance we will develop innovative diffusion MRI (dMRI)
encoding paradigms that provide specific sensitivity to epileptic microstructural pathology and validate with 3D
histology and high-density scalp- and stereo-EEG.
Relevance: There are ~400,000 patients with MRE and non-lesional MRI in the U.S. Given the lack of
guidance and sparse sampling of stereo-EEG, identifying the seizure onset zone with confidence is extremely
challenging for in these non-lesional patients. If we are successful in the proposed work, we will enable MRI
identification of a probable lesion location for the majority of patients with MRE. In this way , we will increase
their likelihood of a definitive stereo-EEG identification of the SOZ and enable a potentially curative
neurosurgical treatment option that might not have been possible otherwise.
Approach: Our approach is to: 1) Develop and validate diffusion MRI cortical fiber mapping for detection of the
disrupted cortical architecture within focal cortical dysplasias. 2) Test whether diffusion MRI cortical fiber
mapping can detect focal cortical dysplasias and 3) Test whether diffusion tractography and functional
connectivity MRI can predict seizure propagation. Specifically, we will use these MRI connectivity to predict
probable cortical nodes of the seizure propagation network, as well as, the latency and spatial propagation of
epileptiform activity between stereo-EEG electrodes.
Summary: The proposed neuroimaging methods will improve localization of the SOZ and propagation network
enabling more patients with MRE to be treated more effectively with neurosurgery."

Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL) is an incurable disease characterized by the localization of neoplastic T
lymphocytes to the skin. Patients display a progressive disease pattern, limited to the skin, often requiring life-
long treatment, significantly impacting the quality of life. Given that the incidence of CTCL is rising and long-term
treatments are needed to manage the debilitating skin lesions caused by this disease, there is an urgent need
to better understand the mechanisms of neoplastic T-cell localization to the skin and disease progression. Given
our new findings highlighting the role of tumor-derived interleukin-15 (IL-15) signaling in CTCL progression in
the skin, this pathway presents an opportunity to understand the role of inflammatory cytokines in the skin-
tropism of CTCL. Using a transgenic mouse model of IL-15, we previously showed that IL-15 overexpression
induces a spontaneous CTCL that phenotypically mimics human CTCL. IL-15 transgenic mice show an early
accumulation of neoplastic T-cells and persistent keratinocyte hyperplasia, resulting in immune cell recruitment
and skin inflammation. IL-15 is also chronically elevated in CTCL patients, and neoplastic T-cells derived factors
are suggested to cause skin inflammation. We have discovered a new signaling cascade in which IL-15 induces
constitutive activation of skin-homing chemokine receptors on the malignant T-cells, thereby promoting their
ligand-dependent localization to the skin in CTCL. Pharmacological inhibition of IL-15 blocks this signaling
pathway, thereby preventing cell migration and keratinocyte proliferation. To fully establish this pathway and its
role in CTCL progression, we will - 1) elucidate mechanisms of IL-15 production in CTCL, 2) evaluate the impact
of IL-15 on lymphoma cell migration to the skin, 3) clarify the IL-15 dependent mechanisms of CTCL progression
in the skin, 4) understand how this leads to chronic skin inflammation, and 5) evaluate therapeutic potential of
blocking IL-15 pathway in CTCL treatment. The proposed studies will expand our fundamental understanding of
the mechanisms that control CTCL progression in the skin and will lay the foundation for developing novel anti-
IL-15 therapies that inhibit oncogenic signaling in the treatment of CTCL."

10884272,"Project Summary: Chemical carcinogens and xenobiotics in the diet play a significant role in colon cancer (CC)
formation. The intestinal tract, including the colon, is often the first site that is exposed to these carcinogens and
xenobiotics. CC is a common malignancy in men and women, and p53 mutation (p53D) or inactivation is
observed in ~60% of CC and ~90% of all human cancers. As such, the development of therapeutic strategies
that will rejuvenate wild-type (WT) p53 function or target p53D should have profound implications in the
prevention and treatment of CC. Similarly, a high frequency (40-60%) of KRAS mutation (KRASD) is observed
in organisms exposed to environmental chemical contaminants, and ~40-45% of CC is associated with KRASD.
We found a reciprocal association between GPR109A expression and KRASD CC. GPR109A is a Gai-coupled
receptor for the bacterial fermentation product butyrate (BTR), the ketone body b-hydroxybutyrate (bHB), and
the vitamin Niacin (NA). About 85% of CC shows a reduced expression of GPR109A. GPR109A agonists NA is
the precursor of NAD+ and p53 is an NAD+-dependent molecule and NA deficiency impairs p53 function.
Therefore, GPR109A could be the molecular target of KRAsD and it plays an important role in the
regulation of p53 signaling. Pharmacologic doses of NA, a vitamin and also an FDA-approved drug for
dyslipidemia, is taken by millions of Americans. Though the role of NA in decreasing LDL and increasing HDL is
well recognized, little is known about its anti-tumor potential. Similarly, the link between commensal bacteria and
CC prevention is known for a long time, but the mechanisms underlying this link are not well understood. BTR,
the prominent bacterial metabolite in the colon, is the endogenous agonist for GPR109A in colonic epithelia. bHB
is the natural agonist for GPR109A in immune cells present in the lamina propria and this agonist is synthesized
in colonic epithelia using the bacterial metabolite BTR via ketogenesis. This highlights the biological significance
of the colon as a ketogenic organ. In addition, commensal bacteria control GPR109A expression and ketogenesis
in the colon via their xenobiotic metabolites (butyrate, indole derivatives, 1,3-diaminopropane, and reuterin).
This offers a novel molecular link between commensal bacteria and CC prevention. Our central hypothesis is
that activation of GPR109A in colonic epithelia and immune cells lead to sustained activation of p53 and anti-
tumor immunity. We will test this hypothesis with three specific aims: (Aim 1) Determine the role of the GPR109A-
p53 axis in KRASD, chemical, and dietary carcinogen-induced CC; (Aim 2) Elucidate the molecular
mechanism(s) of GPR109A agonists-induced p53 activation and test if GPR109A agonists can be used as novel
therapeutic drugs to target p53D CC; and (Aim 3) Demonstrate that commensal bacterial metabolites maintain
WTp53 function and prevent the immune system from undue activation in colon via GPR109A with an obligatory
involvement of colonic ketogenesis. These studies will involve the use of genetically modified mouse lines with
colon-specific deletion of not only Gpr109a and p53, but also the rate-limiting enzyme in ketogenesis, Hmgcs2."

 Estradiol orchestrates feeding behavior and metabolism. Aromatase is the sole enzyme responsible for
producing estradiols from androgens, and it is highly expressed in gonads. In humans and rodents, neurons in
discrete brain regions densely express aromatase. The role of brain aromatase and locally de novo (brain)-
derived estradiols in energy balance control remains poorly understood. Our goal is to provide answers for
several pressing basic questions: – is brain-aromatase necessary for feeding and energy balance control? Is the
role of brain aromatase neuroanatomically and sex divergent? How do brain and gonadal aromatase interact in
metabolic control? We identified two populations of aromatase-expressing neurons, in the central nucleus of
the amygdala (CeA) and in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), in female and male rats. Our preliminary
data suggest aromatase specifically in the CeA controls feeding behavior and subsequent weight gain in a sex-
specific manner. In contrast, aromatase in the VMH, exerts control over the brown adipose tissue thermogenic
capacity and response, in both sexes. Therefore, in this project we will pursue the hypothesis that aromatase in
the CeA is critical to feeding behavior control in a sex-selective manner, while aromatase action in the VMH has
the primary role of energy expenditure control in both males and females. We further posit that aromatase in the
VMH, but not CeA, may be particularly important under conditions of metabolic challenges and pathophysiology.
The proposed studies combine behavioral, metabolic, neuroanatomical, molecular, and virogenetic strategies in
adult rats to support or refute this hypothesis by conducting detailed mechanistic experiments organized in two
aims. In Aim I we strive to identify the specific contribution to feeding control and downstream mechanisms
orchestrated by amygdala aromatase. Here we will resolve whether CeA aromatase is necessary and sufficient to
control food-motivated and ingestive behavior. We will determine whether local, intra-amygdala, and distal,
lateral hypothalamic sex-specific pathways are engaged by CeA aromatase neurons, and whether loss of this
input leads to disinhibition of hypothalamic orexigenic pathways. The specific broad goal of Aim II is to test
whether hypothalamic aromatase controls feeding and thermoregulation under normal and metabolically
challenging conditions. We will examine whether aromatase in the VMH is necessary and sufficient for energy
expenditure and body weight control in both sexes. Experiments here are also designed to reveal whether VMH
aromatase has a critical role in adaptation to metabolic challenges: obesogenic diet and cold exposure, in both
sexes. Finally, and in contrast to CeA, we hypothesize that VMH aromatase and resulting estradiol are responsive
to and work in concert with gonadal steroids. If our hypothesis is supported, we will show that brain aromatase
and resulting locally produced estradiols are key to maintenance of energy balance during metabolic health and
disease."

 Preclinical and clinical data show elevated glutamatergic transmission and neuronal activity within the
hippocampus during the early stages of schizophrenia development, and it is proposed that such elevations drive
the progression of the disorder. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that give rise to schizophrenia-
related elevations in hippocampal glutamatergic transmission are unknown. Recent human genetic data supports
a connection between reduced DLG1 gene expression/function and schizophrenia. The DLG1 gene encodes
the putative synaptic regulatory protein SAP97. However, a clear synaptic regulatory role for SAP97 has
remained elusive. We have now, for the first time, identified a native synapse in the brain where SAP97 plays a
critical and direct role in synaptic regulation. The long-term goal of our research is to understand how
glutamatergic synapse dysfunction contributes to the development of psychiatric disorders. Our central
hypothesis is that disruption of SAP97 function in dentate granule neurons (DG neurons) of the hippocampus
produces pathological synaptic strengthening that contributes to schizophrenia etiology. Guided by strong
preliminary data, we will pursue this hypothesis in three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will combine
electrophysiological methods with brand new imaging tools to characterize pathway-specific roles of SAP97 in
regulating glutamatergic neurotransmission and plasticity. In Aim 2, we will use a combination of newly generated
antibodies, molecular biological and electrophysiological/imaging approaches to identify the roles of SAP97
subregions in governing SAP97’s subcellular localization and influence over glutamatergic synapse function in
DG neurons. In Aim 3, we will deploy cutting-edge in vivo imaging tools in freely behaving animals in order to
understand how hippocampal neuron activity is altered in rodents with compromised SAP97 function. The
present proposal is innovative because it deploys new and powerful genetic, in vivo imaging, and behavioral
analysis tools that will allow a precise characterization of a newly discovered role for SAP97 in regulating the
function of native glutamatergic synapses in the hippocampus. The proposal is significant because it stands to
identify synaptic pathology in a specific brain region that represents a common component in schizophrenia
development. This proposal squarely meets the mission objectives of the NINDS given its focus on
understanding glutamatergic synapse regulation and memory formation which are found to be disrupted in
complex brain disorders."

 Nearly 90% of individuals with OUD report lifetime trauma exposure and 33% meet criteria for PTSD.
Patients with co-occurring PTSD and OUD are at significantly greater risk for poor substance use and mental

for PTSD, its efficacy is commonly undermined by poor attendance. We recently demonstrated the initial
feasibility of a novel PE protocol for improving therapy attendance and PTSD symptoms among individuals
maintained on MOUD. Participants were randomly assigned to: (a) Treatment as usual (TAU) (b) Prolonged
Exposure therapy (PE) or (c) PE with attendance contingent financial incentives (PE+). Our results demonstrated
the initial efficacy of PE+, as PE+ participants attended significantly more therapy sessions than PE participants
and experienced significant improvements in PTSD symptoms. Our findings also suggest that, rather than
undermining patients’ stability with illicit drug use, PE may be associated with less illicit substance use than SUD
treatment alone.
 In the proposed research, we seek to: a) conduct a more definitive evaluation of this novel PE
intervention, b) utilize a novel telemedicine platform to reach underserved patients, and c) further investigate this
promising initial data suggesting that PE therapy may also be associated with improvements in illicit drug use.
Primary Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of a novel telemedicine-delivered PE protocol for improving therapy
attendance and PTSD symptoms. We will conduct a parallel three-group RCT among 135 adults with PTSD who
are maintained on MOUD (45 TAU, 45 PE, 45 PE+). All study visits will be conducted via telemedicine and
attendance-contingent financial incentives will be delivered digitally. We hypothesize that participants assigned
to PE+ will demonstrate greater PE session attendance and decreases in PTSD severity relative to those
assigned to PE or TAU. Secondary Aims: (1) We will utilize rigorous and fine-grained assessment strategies to
evaluate whether individuals receiving PE may actually experience reductions in their illicit opioid and other drug
use. (2) We will conduct the first characterization of telemedicine-delivered PE acceptability and explore their
association with PE treatment retention and PTSD symptom reduction.
 This study represents the first effort to examine the efficacy of PE delivered via telemedicine to individuals
with OUD, and our investigative team is uniquely poised to disseminate our findings to improve clinical practice
in real-world settings throughout the country."
10873914,"Project Summary / Abstract | The overarching goal of this project is to develop targeted therapies for
peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL), a diverse group of aggressive lymphomas that develop from T cells or natural
killer cells and lack standards of care. The current therapeutic options for PTCL are limited due to the lack of
effective targeted therapeutics and incomplete understanding of the molecular etiology for this dismissal disease.
In this application, the team aims to address this critical gap by developing novel Proteolysis Targeting Chimera
(PROTAC) and repurposing existing drugs to treat PTCL with genetic defects in TET2 and RHOA (G17V as the
hot spot mutation). The co-existence of TET2 and RHOA mutations is frequently detected in T cells of PTCL
patients but not in other types of hematological neoplasms, making it an ideal target for targeted therapeutics
development. We further discovered that an oncogenic synergy between TET2 and RHOA drives Vav1-
calcineurin (CaN)-NFAT signaling axis to augment NFAT activation and promote malignant transformation of T
cells. These novel findings led the team to hypothesize that targeting this oncogenic synergy can effectively
reduce tumor burden. To accelerate the mechanistic and translational studies with clinically-relevant animal
models, the team has generated genetically modified mouse models that recapitulate the PTCL-like genotype
and the major disease hallmarks of PTCL. Capitalizing on the unique transgenic mouse models, the newly-
determined 3D structure of the RHOA-G17V mutant, structure-aided screening of mutant RHOA-specific binders
and degraders, as well as a suite of molecular tools to probe GTPase signaling, the team is uniquely suited to
lead the proposed studies. In Specific Aim 1, the team will develop PROTAC degraders tailored for RHOA(G17V)
and test their anti-tumor effects in cellular systems ex vivo. In Specific Aim 2, the team will test the anti-lymphoma
efficacy of mutant RHOA degraders in vivo, as well as a combination therapy designed to suppress both
upstream mutant RHOA and downstream CaN/NFAT activity with FDA-approved drugs (PROTAC + Tacrolimus).
The team will also probe the mechanism of action to better inform the pathogenic mechanism underpinning
PTCL. If successful, the proposed study will illuminate previously-underappreciated mechanisms underlying
T-cell lymphoma, and establish the preclinical rationale for novel interventional approaches against PTCL.
Preclinical testing results obtained from our study will form the basis for immediate follow-on clinical trials.
Notably, the PROTAC strategy against RhoA(G17V) will provide one the first examples of targeting a specific
GTPase for lymphoma treatment. The potential benefit will be significant considering that apporximately 50-
70% patients with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (a subgroup of PTCL) harbor the RhoA(G17V) mutation
but lack effective treatment options. Although we propose a study limited to PTCL, the approaches and drug
candidates that we develop can be applied to encompass the study of other cancers."

An estimated 41% of adults in the US and one in five of children are estimated to have obesity; over 37 million
Americans have diabetes and 96 million adults have prediabetes. Racial and socioeconomic disparities in obe-
sity and diabetes prevalence are well-documented, widespread, and persistent. Policies addressing the root
causes of health inequities are critical to understanding and ultimately eliminating disparities in obesity and dia-
betes risk. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD’s) new, $50 million Community
Choice Demonstration seeks to test strategies that help low-income households overcome structural barriers
and entrenched racism that constrain their ability to move to lower-poverty ‘opportunity’ neighborhoods. The
Demonstration offers an exciting, time-sensitive chance to study the impact of this new targeted housing mobil-
ity program on obesity and diabetes risk, and, more broadly, provides a window into the mechanisms through
which neighborhoods impact obesity and diabetes risk for low-income populations. Starting in the Fall of 2022,
approximately 16,000 households will take part in a randomized controlled trial: one group will receive compre-
hensive mobility services such as security deposit assistance and landlord outreach to facilitate moving to a
lower-poverty neighborhood and a control group will not receive mobility services. This proposed project, the
Mobility Opportunity Vouchers to Eliminate Disparities (MOVED) Study, will recruit 900 households en-
rolled in the Demonstration from three sites (Pittsburgh, PA; Cleveland, OH; Nashville, TN). We will conduct
baseline and 2-year follow-up in-person surveys to investigate the extent to which the receipt of comprehen-
sive mobility services is associated with changes in measured BMI and HbA1c among adult and changes in
BMI z-score among children after 2 years compared to the control group (Aim 1). Aim 2 investigates outcomes
along the causal pathway, focusing on potential behavioral, psychosocial, contextual, and structural factors
that may differ between the intervention and control groups. Data for this aim includes validated question-
naires, geographically-derived data, and, among a subset of participants, accelerometry data on physical activ-
ity and sleep. Aim 3 uses in-depth qualitative interviews to delve deeper into potential mechanisms through
which moving to a lower-poverty neighborhood influences obesity and diabetes risk. The proposed research
answers recent national calls for innovative research on the impact of housing mobility and neighborhoods on
health and, working with HUD and other stakeholders, offers a time-sensitive chance to provide foundational,
policy-relevant knowledge designed to reduce inequities in obesity and diabetes."

Physician-scientists play key roles in discoveries and the ensuing translation of research advances into improved
health care for patients, a process central to the NIH Roadmap. Therefore, dedicated and intensive research
education is essential to developing the next generation of clinician-scientists. Otolaryngologists are trained and
primed to undertake research in the NIDCD mission areas of hearing, balance, voice, communication disorders,
taste, smell, and related cellular biology. The goal of this training grant is to provide research experiences at key
stages of medical training. Specifically, we propose to support: 1) 9-month predoctoral research experience for
two medical students interested in otolaryngology and the communication sciences, to encourage pursuit of
residencies that include research training and, ultimately, academic careers; and 2) 18 months of research
education for otolaryngology residents to define and develop a research interest to be continued as an academic
faculty member. Preceptors have been selected from the internationally-recognized faculty at the University of
Michigan, consisting of basic science, translational and clinical researchers with primary appointments in the
departments of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, Neurology, Psychiatry, Psychology, Anesthesiology,
Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Human Genetics and Mechanical Engineering. Major focuses of
research include the mechanisms of hearing loss and hearing restoration, head and neck oncology, tissue
bioengineering, nerve regeneration, 3D printing, applied cochlear implant research and health services for deaf
and hard of hearing patients. Each trainee will have academic otolaryngology faculty as either a primary or a
secondary mentor. Emphasis will be placed on project design/translational potential, multidisciplinary
collaboration, grantsmanship, manuscript development, and presentation of research proposals and findings.
Opportunities will be provided to attend extramural or intramural conferences or educational courses relevant to
the trainee's chosen research discipline. The program benefits from the well-equipped facilities of the

10894287,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth leading cause of cancer death. Current limitations
in our understanding of intratumoral cellular heterogeneity (ITH) in HNSCC cause major challenges in patient
stratification and development of novel targeted therapeutics. Our seminal single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-
seq) analysis of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) revealed a partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (p-EMT) program that is a key feature of ITH in HNSCC. p-EMT is characterized by expression of a
unique set of mesenchymal markers, without loss of epithelial markers or expression of classical EMT
transcription factors and is associated with invasiveness and treatment failure. We demonstrated that
transforming growth factor beta-3 (TGF-β3) from cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF) drives p-EMT via cancer
cell TGFβ-induced (TGFBI), a principal marker of the unique subpopulation. As in vitro efficacy of TGFβ inhibitors
targeting EMT has not translated to the clinic, there is a clear need for better models of in vivo biology. Current
modeling of p-EMT is hindered by the inability of OSCC cell lines in monolayer culture to capture ITH or p-EMT.
In contrast, three-dimensional patient derived organoids (PDO) maintain differentiation gradients, recapitulating
cancer cell heterogeneity. We will use OSCC PDOs and CAFs to investigate the role of the novel TGF-β3-TGFBI
axis in driving p-EMT and the value of p-EMT as a predictive biomarker for response to therapy.
First, to determine the mechanism by which cancer cell TGFBI regulates p-EMT to promote tumor growth and
metastasis, we will use CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) to knock down TGFBI in OSCC PDOs and evaluate the
impact on p-EMT. To model the functional impact of this knockdown, we will orthotopically transplant TGFBI-
modulated PDOs into the buccal mucosa of immunodeficient mice, anticipating that TGFBI knockdown will
reduce p-EMT, tumor formation, and metastasis. Second, to determine the mechanism by which CAF influence
OSCC p-EMT via the TGF-β3-TGFBI axis, we will use CRISPRi to knock down TGF-β3 in OSCC CAFs and co-
culture modified CAFs with OSCC PDOs. To assess the impact of TGF-β3-TGFBI signaling on xenograft tumor
growth and metastasis, we will then orthotopically co-transplant modified CAFs and PDOs into NSG mice. Third,
to determine how p-EMT predicts therapeutic response, we will treat TGFBI-modified PDOs, with or without
admixed TGF-β3-modified CAFs, with a series of standard OSCC chemotherapies, as well as inhibitors of the
TGFβ pathway. To support the use of p-EMT as a predictive biomarker, we will then treat our large biobank of
OSCC PDOs with this same set of therapies and determine the relationship between p-EMT expression and
therapeutic response. We anticipate that p-EMT, induced by the TGF-β3-TGFBI axis, will be associated with
differential responses to standard and TGFβ-targeting therapies, supporting its use as a predictive biomarker.
Beyond OSCC, our study may provide the basis for a paradigm shift in therapies targeting p-EMT and other rare
subpopulations, as well as the paracrine interactions that drive them."

People with serious mental illness (SMI) are substantially overrepresented in the US criminal justice system. In
an effort to reduce recidivism among this vulnerable population, average effects of administering single
interventions to all have been studied in recent years. These interventions include ones that target SMI symptoms
(such as mandated psychiatric services) and others that target criminogenic risk factors (such as cognitive
behavioral therapy). However, justice-involved people with SMI are diverse in their characteristics, needs, and
risk factors; there is no “one-size-fits-all” solution to prevent recidivism. Decreasing adverse criminal outcomes
for this population requires recognizing its heterogeneity. Therefore, the broad objective of this proposal is to
understand which interventions work best for which justice-involved people with SMI using state-of-the-art
precision medicine methods drawn from causal inference, statistical theory, and machine learning. This is a step
toward the long-term goal of identifying optimal ways to reduce criminal behavior in this population by matching
interventions to those who need and benefit from them. Supported by a dedicated and talented mentorship team,
the training portion of this grant will fill gaps key to achieving this goal: 1) subject-matter training and field
experience on SMI in the criminal justice system, 2) development of novel technical methods in precision
medicine, 3) skills in translating technical findings to high-impact recommendations for practice and policy, and
4) professional skills development. This rich training will provide a foundation for accomplishing the following
research aims to reach the proposal's broad objective: 1) understand the differential pathways that situate this
population at risk for re-offending, 2) identify tailored rules for administering interventions to those who benefit
from them based on individual characteristics, and 3) assess whether and how the identified rules for matching
interventions generalize across the US. This research will leverage randomized controlled trial data, federal data
from the Administrative Office of the US Courts, and state data from the North Carolina Department of Public
Safety to achieve these aims. Importantly, research from this grant will result in novel statistical precision
medicine methods for transporting rules to settings different than those on which they are learned. The aims of
this grant are well-aligned with NIMH's strategic goal of striving for prevention and treatments among people with
SMI, including, but not limited to, the objectives of: a) advancing methods to match interventions to individuals
and populations (especially marginalized and underserved communities) and b) strategies for scaling up
interventions for the greatest public health impact. By learning who benefits from which interventions using the
latest advances in precision medicine methods, this work has the potential to help stop the so-called “revolving
prison door” for justice-involved people with SMI. Further, this research will advance the toolkit for data-supported
precision medicine strategies that most efficiently and effectively increase public health and safety."

Climate change and extreme weather events pose a growing threat to the health and development of
vulnerable populations in the United States. Psychological distress from extreme storms often persists
for years, air pollution from wildfires increases the risk of adverse birth outcomes, and floods spread
contaminants in land and water. While the threats from climate change to wellbeing are clear, research
has predominantly focused on the effects of extreme events, rather than how the “new normal” under
climate change can cause frequent disruptions and long-term stress for households and communities.
For many coastal communities, sea level rise is creating a new normal with routine flooding from
monthly high tides and rain. While those floods are not as catastrophic as hurricanes, their near-certain
occurrence causes different problems – and potentially leads to different responses – than low-
probability hurricane strikes. Understanding the impacts of chronic stresses from climate change, alone
and in combination with acute disasters, is necessary for enabling effective adaptation. This K01 Award
proposal will advance our understanding of the impacts of chronic and acute coastal flooding on
migration and stress. By building on my expertise in climate exposures and impacts, it will accelerate
my progress towards my career goal of becoming an independent researcher at the intersection of
climate change and population science. I will train in demographic theory and methods, conduct guided
readings with my mentors on measurement of psychosocial and physical health, and develop survey
design and analysis skills. Then, I will apply those skills to study the interactions between flooding,
migration, and health in coastal communities in the US. My research aims are: 1) to characterize the
relationship between flood experience and in- and out-migration, 2) to analyze how health, economic
resources, and flood experience shape migration intentions, and 3) to assess the health and economic
wellbeing of movers and stayers. To achieve these aims, I will draw on two primary datasets: an
administrative dataset consisting of individual address histories for most adults in eight Atlantic coast
states, and a detailed household survey currently underway in four coastal North Carolina counties. My
mentor team, with expertise in environmental migration, survey methods, and health measurement, are
ideally suited to help me achieve my research and training goals. The outcomes of the research and
data collected in this study will form the basis for future R-level proposals to expand the geographic
scope of the household survey on the impacts of coastal flooding and to examine the health and
development impacts of sea level rise on children and young adults. Combined, the research and
training proposed here will enable me to apply my expertise in climate change adaptation to the
widespread and urgent challenge of climate impacts on health, migration, and human development."

Racial disparities in end-of-life (EOL) care continue to persist in nursing home (NH) residents with Alzheimer’s
disease and related dementia (ADRD). Recent studies reported that black NH residents with dementia were
more likely to receive aggressive EOL care, including hospitalizations, ER visits, feeding tubes and aggressive
medication therapy, compared to Whites. ADRD is a progressive, life-limiting syndrome without a curative
treatment. Hence, hospice care is preferable for older adults with ADRD during EOL because it prioritizes
comfort and quality of life by reducing pain and suffering. Medicare is the primary insurer of patients with
ADRD and covers hospice for all with a 6-months or shorter prognosis. As about 90% of older Americans with
ADRD are placed in NHs before death, it is critically important for Medicare policy makers to understand
contemporary characteristics of racial disparities in hospice care in NHs in order to implement efficient policies
to promote health equity. Recently, there raised concerns about fraudulent/inappropriate patient selection
practices that favored long-stay patients, particularly ADRD patients, because patients with longer hospice
stays generated greater profits for hospices. To discourage hospice selection for long-stay patients, Medicare
launched the 2014 Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation (IMPACT) Act to mandate auditing
targeted hospices with high proportion of patient staying longer than 180 days. It remains unaddressed how
racial disparities change with implementing IMPACT in NH residents with ADRD.
The project’s overall goal is to improve EOL health equity for NH residents with ADRD. The aims for this R01
proposal are to identify the effects of IMPACT on racial disparities in hospice care in NH residents with ADRD,
and to characterize subgroups that are most likely to experience inadequate hospice care. The primary
hypothesis is that racial disparities in EOL care increased persistently after IMPACT was implemented. We will
employ mixed methods to accomplish the following aims (A) and hypotheses (H):
A1. To examine impacts of IMPACT on racial disparities in hospice care in NH residents with ADRD.
A2. To characterize phenotypes of NH residents with ADRD based on multimorbidity who have high risks for
very short or very long hospice care, and compare these phenotypes between Black and White residents.
A3. To obtain perspectives of care providers in NHs about how hospice polices may influence hospice
care referrals among residents with ADRD. An expert panel of clinical advisors will identify barriers to
hospice care referrals, and potential mechanisms through which Medicare policies could reduce them.
This study will evaluate Medicare policy on racial disparities in hospice care among a very vulnerable
population: older adults with ADRD who reside in NHs. Results will also identify subgroups of these individuals
at high risk of inadequate hospice stays. Findings will support clinicians with insight about how interventions to
reduce racial disparities and improve health equity can be targeted to individuals in high-risk groups."

The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) plays an important role in regulating immune responses and exposure to
AhR-activating compounds, including environmental toxicants such as dioxins may contribute to the
dysregulation of cytokines and the development of immune system disorders. The ligand-dependent activation
of AhR can promote differentiation of inflammatory T helper Th17 cells or lead to profound immunosuppression
and an increase of regulatory T cells. Significant gaps exist in our understanding of how the AhR regulates the
inter- and intracellular communication processes between dendritic cells (DC) and other immune cells on the
molecular level, which is of central importance to understanding both physiologic and pathophysiologic immune
reactions mediated through AhR. The overall goal of this proposal is to identify the functional role of the AhR and
its specific repressor (AhRR) interacting with Toll-like receptor (TLR) and NFkB signaling in controlling function
and differentiation of DC and T-cell activation. The reported dysregulation of TLR and NFkB signaling by AhR
ligands may be key steps in triggering immune system disorders. The transcriptional repressor of the AhR, the
AhRR is implemented in the AhR pathway, although much remains to be elucidated at the level of TLR and
NFkB signaling. In transgenic mice overexpressing AhRR we discovered that AhRR is critically involved in
regulation of dioxin-induced inflammatory gene expression as well as LPS-mediated inflammatory responses
and LPS shock. Thus, the AhRR Tg mice give us the opportunity to recognize how AhRR is involved in the
regulation of TLR-mediated responses and other parts of the immune system. Bone-marrow derived DC from
genetic mouse models as well as human DC, will be used to investigate how DC are regulated through ligand-
induced activation of the AhR and inflammatory signals via TLR/NFkB. A genome-wide identification of AhR/Rel
binding sites will be conducted and related to gene expression analysis. Mutants of binding sites will be
generated to validate whether a particular binding event is actually required to regulate the expression of target
genes. Protein-protein interaction studies will identify the specific interacting domains of AhR and Rel proteins
and provide insight into how these interactions impact the functional activity of each protein and the outcome of
AhR/NFkB crosstalk. A novel in vivo method to monitor immune responses noninvasively via Positron Emission
Tomography (immuno-PET) imaging will be used to ultimately show how AhR ligands modify TLR-mediated
recruitment and accumulation of DC, neutrophils, B cells, and T cells in vivo. This study can provide a definite
link and mechanism between the exposure to AhR activating compounds and the development of inflammatory
chronic diseases. Findings will allow for more clearly defined endpoints to assess the effects and toxicity of AhR
activating ligands including environmental pollutants. This study will also provide new concepts for future
innovative uses of AhR and AhRR as molecular targets for therapeutic applications in inflammation, infection,
and chronic diseases."

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease, with varying contributions of
emphysema and large and small airway disease. COPD heterogeneity is also manifest in variable responses to
treatments, including inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). There is an unmet need for biomarkers for COPD outcomes.
Our group has led RNA-sequencing on blood samples collected at the Phase 2 (5 year) visit in the Genetic
Epidemiology of COPD Study (COPDGene). We found that a type 1 interferon-stimulated gene expression
signature in whole blood was associated with airway measures from quantitative analysis of chest computed
tomography (CT) scans. A score summarizing the expression of these genes was associated with reduced lung
function and COPD exacerbations. The association between the interferon gene score and airway disease was
abolished in ICS users. Our hypothesis is that interferon pathway blood gene expression could be used to define
an endotype of COPD characterized by airway disease, which will serve as a predictive biomarker for COPD
exacerbations and progression and can be targeted with ICS therapy. We will address the following Specific
Aims: (1) Airway-interferon predictor of exacerbations and progression: Using COPDGene Phase 3 (10 year)
clinical and imaging data, we will use the interferon airway gene signature as a biomarker to develop prediction
models for acute exacerbations and disease progression in subjects with and without COPD. The gene signature
prediction will be validated in additional COPD studies. (2) Airway-interferon endotype of COPD: We will perform
RNA-sequencing in blood samples from the COPDGene Phase 3 visit to test for stability vs. change of gene
expression signatures and clinical phenotypes over a five-year interval. To identify lung tissue correlates of the
blood gene expression, we will analyze RNA-seq data in resected lung samples from smokers with and without
COPD from the Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC), testing for associations between interferon signature
genes with chest CT scan-defined airway disease and COPD phenotypes. (3) Response to inhaled
corticosteroids: In COPDGene and LTRC, we will test whether the associations between the interferon gene
signature and COPD phenotypes of airway disease, exacerbations, and lung function decline are altered in ICS
users compared to non-users. We will measure expression of interferon signature genes in a previously
completed 12-week clinical trial of ICS in COPDGene subjects, and test whether ICS use affects the interferon-
stimulated gene expression pattern. We will re-analyze the clinical trial to test whether the interferon signature
predicts response to ICS. This proposal will complement the ongoing analyses in COPDGene by developing a
biomarker for COPD outcomes and targeted ICS prescription, which can be used for a future pharmacogenomics
clinical trial. Understanding the airway disease interferon gene signature can guide future mechanistic studies
and research into targeted therapies beyond ICS."

Nuclear movement is evolutionarily conserved throughout eukaryotes, a testament to the fundamentally
important nature of this process. The importance of this process is most evident in syncytial muscle cells,
which move their nuclei to maximize the distance between each nucleus and its neighbors, a process thought
to establish a series of independent myodomains. Furthermore, mispositioned nuclei in muscle cells are
prevalent in muscle disease. In recent years, dozens of proteins have been implicated in the movement and
spacing of nuclei, but their mechanisms of action, and the consequences of nuclear spacing, remain elusive.
The goal of the proposed research is to fill this critical gap in knowledge. Specifically, we will define the
features of the microtubule cytoskeleton that are critical for both moving nuclei to establish the spacing and
anchor nuclei to maintain the spacing. Only recently have the molecular, physical, and imaging tools emerged
to make it possible to address these mechanistic questions in vivo. In the proposed research we will generate
and test mutant proteins that target the microtubule specific functions of pleitropic proteins to isolate the
specific contribution of the microtubule interactions. We will then apply our recently developed analyses of
nuclear movement and microtubule organization combined with classical genetic approaches to determine the
genetic and molecular mechanisms by which these factors move and anchor nuclei during muscle
development. Within this work we will test whether two emergent properties of the microtubule cytoskeleton,
branching and sliding contribute to nuclear spacing in muscle. Finally, we will directly tie these data to disease
pathogenesis by determining how dystrophin, the gene mutated in the most common and debilitating muscle
disease contributes to these processes. Successful completion of these aims will provide the first mechanistic
understanding of nuclear movement in an in-tact developing muscle cell making it possible to manipulate
nuclear spacing to understand how the position of the nucleus impacts its function."

Current therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is inadequate. Despite newly available therapeutics agents,
the overall survival rate for patients with the disease is still poor. It was previously shown that JMJD1C, a histone
demethylase of KDM3 (lysine demethylase 3) family, is required for AML leukemogenesis but largely dispensable
for steady state hematopoiesis and therefore, a potential therapeutic target in AML. In a recent study, loss of
JMJD1C in leukemia cells was shown to lead to elevated RAS signaling pathway and increased sensitivity to
inhibitors against the pathway. Furthermore, the presence of RAS activating mutations that are common in AML
confer resistance to JMJD1C loss. These data led to the hypothesis that targeting RAS pathway in combination
with JMJD1C would be more effective in eliminating leukemia cells harboring activating RAS mutations. This
hypothesis will be tested by the following plan: i) efficacy of combining JMJD1C modulation with RAS pathway
inhibitors in treating AML with RAS mutations will be tested in mouse as well as xenograft models of AML; ii)
molecular mechanism of resistance to JMJD1C loss in AML with RAS mutations, as well as the role of
biomolecule condensates, emerging key regulator of transcription and AML leukemogenesis, in mediating the
molecular function of JMJD1C in AML will be studied. Overall, the proposed project, once accomplished, will
provide rational for the design of novel combination therapy for AML with co-occurring activating RAS mutations."
10739810,"Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, immune-mediated, allergic disease characterized by remarkable
eosinophil accumulation in the esophageal mucosa. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) indicated that
the pathogenic tissue Th2 cells are specifically enriched in EoE tissue, with a large amount of Th2 cytokine
production and a unique signature. Notably, by bulk and single-cell CD3+ T cell sequencing, we identified that
the gene of the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA, e.g., butyrate) receptor FFAR3 is the top tracking gene with IL5,
with both genes uniquely expressed in tissue Th2 cells at the single-cell level. FFAR3 can be induce by IL-4 in
circulating naïve T cells. We also found that butyrate, a putative ligand of FFAR3 and a metabolite produced by
esophageal microbiota, significantly enhanced Th2 cytokine production in a human and mouse cell line,
primary T cells, and a model of murine experimental asthma. These collective findings prompt our central
hypothesis Our overall hypothesis is that FFAR3, ligated to microbiome-originated SCFA in esophageal
mucosa, is induced by IL-4 in tissue effector Th2 cells and enhances type 2 responses in esophageal T
cells that locally contribute to EoE pathogenesis. The proposed study will delineate unique populations of
tissue Th2 cells and elucidate a novel and pivotal role of FFAR3-SCFA axis in Th2 activation, Th2 cytokine
production and EoE molecular pathogenesis. Our preliminary data show that FFAR3 is an IL-4–induced SCFA
receptor that regulates Th2 cytokine production by Th2 cells in vivo and ex vivo. We will substantiate whether
the boosting effect of butyrate in circulating T cells occurs in tissue-resident T cells and whether there is a
difference between normal control and EoE; measure the SCFA concentrations in the EoE and control
esophageal tissue; and assess the SCFA and dietary fiber content in an EoE vs. non-EoE diet. We will also
employ a T cell–specific FFAR3-deficient mouse to study the involvement of SCFA in murine Th2 immunity. By
ChIP-Seq and ATAC-Seq, we will define epigenetic alterations induced by SCFAs, explore FFAR3's roles in
altering chromatin structure at the Th2 cytokine locus, identify new Th2-promoting transcription factors driven
by FFAR3 and analyze binding of the Th2 transcription factor GATA3 to genomic DNA regions in human T
cells in the context of butyrate exposure. To profile the FFAR3+ tissue Th2 cells with high resolution, we will
characterize a cohort of 5000 residential esophageal lymphocytes by scRNA-Seq, analyze Th2-specific
markers and transcription factors, scrutinize the TCR clonotypes of tissue Th2 cells and correlate tissue Th2
cells' key parameters to EoE clinical characteristics. Collectively, this grant focuses on understanding human
tissue-resident T cells and their contribution to EoE in the context of FFAR3-SCFA axis. The immediate
significance of this study is its potential to uncover tissue Th2 cytokine production mechanisms, the novel
functionality of SCFA in Th2 inflammation and the characterization of the newly identified FFAR3+ tissue Th2
cells, all of which may provide new rationales for improved therapeutic strategies for allergic disorders."

 Energy metabolic reprogramming occurs in the developing and diseased hearts. Mitochondria are
responsible for coordinating cellular energy production in response to physiological and pathological
stimuli. The mitochondrial regulatory system is highly regulated by several transcription factors and
coactivators that orchestrate the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, maintenance,
and respiration capacity. However, the transcriptional regulatory machinery in mitochondrial
bioenergetics is complex, and it is still not completely understood how mitochondria coordinately respond
to physiological and pathological stimuli.
 Perm1 (“PGC-1 and ERR regulator in muscle 1”) was recently identified in skeletal muscle, as a
novel muscle-specific protein that regulates mitochondrial oxidative capacity. Perm1 is induced by
exercise, and the increased expression of Perm1 enhances mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative capacity,
and fatigue resistance in mouse skeletal muscle. These findings point to a new path towards
understanding mitochondrial myopathies and muscle atrophies. However, the role of Perm1 in the heart
has never been investigated. Moreover, the regulatory mechanism of Perm1 in mitochondrial function is
currently unknown. Our preliminary data suggest the significant role of Perm1 in cardiac
pathophysiology: (1) Perm1 is highly expressed in the heart and is downregulated in the mouse failing
heart and in patients with heart failure; (2) Perm1 expression is increased during differentiation and
maturation in human iPS cell-derived cardiomyocytes; (3) Perm1 knockdown in cultured cardiomyocytes
leads to reduced mitochondrial respiration capacity. Furthermore, our preliminary data suggest that
Perm1 controls mitochondrial function through the regulation of ERRα, a well-known transcription factor
that orchestrates the expression of genes in mitochondrial bioenergetics.
 This application will leverage a genetic animal model and state-of-the art multisystems approach
to conceptually advance our understanding of mitochondrial bioenergetics in the heart. Specifically, this
work is expected to demonstrate that Perm1 is a critical regulator of mitochondrial biosynthesis and
energetics in the heart through the ERRα pathway. Furthermore, this study will determine if gene
delivery of Perm1 to the heart protects against mitochondrial impairment and cardiac dysfunction in the
setting of pressure-overload-induced heart failure. Conclusive evidence that Perm1 is a novel
transcriptional cofactor of the mitochondrial regulatory pathway in the heart will profoundly advance our
knowledge of cardiac metabolism, and may suggest new therapeutic approaches for heart failure."

 How neural circuits control complex behaviors is a fundamental problem in neuroscience. Optogenetic
tools have transformed our ability to identify genetically marked neuronal subpopulations of interest (NSOIs),
which serve as “points-of-entry” to behaviorally relevant circuits. However, a gap remains between the
identification of such NSOIs, and the ability to identify and map their downstream target neurons (DTNs);
identification of such DTNs is a crucial step in further tracing the circuit. To fill this gap, we will combine
optogenetic stimulation of NSOIs with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), automated immediate early
gene (IEG) mapping, anatomical tracing and electrophysiology in candidate downstream target regions
(CDTRs), to identify DTNs of NSOIs in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), which controls aggression,
defense and other emotional behaviors. The long-term goal is to elucidate the neural circuits that control
decisions between complex social and defensive behaviors. The overall objective of this application is to
develop a general approach for identifying and functionally characterizing DTNs of any NSOI of interest. Proof-
of-principle for these methods will be obtained by applying them to NSOIs in VMH which have previously been
shown to robustly control social and defensive behaviors. Preliminary studies have revealed that optogenetic
stimulation of estrogen receptor-1 (Esr1)-expressing neurons in VMHvl in solitary animals can be used to map
candidate DTNs throughout the brain, using serial-2-photon tomographic analysis of c-fos expression. This
approach will be used to identify candidate DTNs, using scRNAseq and activity-dependent marking systems.
The central objective of this proposal is to molecularly identify, and determine the behavioral function, and
downstream connectivity, of DTNs to which VMHvlEsr1 neurons (and other behaviorally relevant VMH NSOIs)
project. The rationale for this research is that solving this general problem is essential to making forward
progress in mapping the circuitry that governs complex behaviors. In Aim 1, we will develop an approach for
unbiased brain-wide mapping of DTNs activated by optogenetic stimulation of a genetically defined NSOI. In
Aim 2, we will develop and apply a new method, opto-Act-seq, to transcriptomically identify activated DTNs in
CDTRs. In Aim 3, we will identify projection DTNs (DTN-PNs) that are monosynaptic targets of the NSOIs,
using the novel methods “opto-TRACM” and “CRACM/TRACM-guided Patch-seq”. In Aim IV, we will determine
the functional role of DTN-PNs in social behaviors using “multiplex opto-TRACM.” The contribution will be to
develop a new approach to identify functionally and behaviorally relevant downstream targets of NSOIs in a
systematic, brain-wide manner. This contribution is significant because it allows unbiased, global mapping of
downstream circuits activated by a given NSOI. The approach is innovative, because it will develop novel tools,
and apply them to a behaviorally important circuit. The work proposed in this application will, therefore, both
advance knowledge in this specific field, and will also provide tools for investigators study other circuits."

The number, size, and plasticity of spiny excitatory synapses underlies connectivity in neuronal circuits, and
their alterations are central to the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including autism
spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability (ID), and fragile X syndrome (FXS). Our long-term goals is
to uncover the biological functions of Rho-like small GTPase pathways at central excitatory synapses and
their contributions to NDDs. Rho GTPases, including Rac1, play key role in spiny excitatory synapse
formation, plasticity, neurotransmission, circuit development, and behavior. Conversely, alterations in Rho
GTPase signaling occur in many NDDs, including ASD, ID, and FXS. Notably, overactivation of this pathway
occurs in FXS model mice (Fmr1 KO), as well as in patients with gain-of-function mutations in the TRIO,
RAC1, and PAK1 genes, and is associated with synaptic hyperconnectivty, hyperexcitability, ASD, ID, and
epilepsy. Hence detailed knowledge of the regulation of Rho GTPases and ability to modulate them would
have broad implications for understanding brain function and dysfunction in NDDs. Rho GTPases are
directly activated by guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). The paralog GEFs kalirin and Trio are
important regulators of neuronal connectivity, and are dysregulated in several NDDs. Both proteins directly
activate Rac1 and subsequently, p21-activated kinase (Pak), which also play key roles in brain development,
plasticity, and NDDs. Notably, inhibition of Rac1 and Pak rescued phenotypes in Fmr1 KO mice. Here we
outline a set of experiments designed to determine the role of the kalirin/Trio->Rac1->Pak axis in basal
brain function and in preclinical models of NDDs characterized by excessive synaptic connectivity
(hyperconnectivity). Specifically, we will test whether inhibition of the kalirin/Trio->Rac1->Pak axis to
reverse structural, functional, and behavioral deficits in several mouse models relevant for NDDs. We will
pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) To characterize the biological effects of kalirin/Trio inhibition in basal
brain function in mice. 2) To determine the effects of genetic deletion of kalirin and Trio on disease-relevant
phenotypes in mouse models of NDD with synaptic hyperconnectivity. 3) To compare the biological effects
of kalirin/Trio inhibition with that of known Rac1 and Pak inhibitors in mouse models of NDD with synaptic
hyperconnectivity."
10929481,"Nerve injury can affect anyone and carries consequences that last forever, and traumatic peripheral
nerve injury (TPNI) can result from settings as diverse as battlefield or motor vehicle trauma, to iatrogenic
injury from surgical treatments of other serious conditions. For other tissue types, the prognosis and treatment
plan are straightforward. However, when nerves fail, doctors have few tools to help guide the treatment plan
and patients forever remember their experiences with pain and paralysis. If nerve injuries can happen from
many causes, what is the determinant that most predicts a good outcome?
 The answer is nerve continuity. A nerve that has been severed, say by a bullet will never heal without
surgical repair and yet, that same nerve, grazed by the bullet, or caught in the shockwave of a passing bullet,
is indistinguishable from the nerve cut by the bullet. Both nerves do not work, and yet the latter, unsevered
nerve is best left to recover on its own without surgery. Two types of nerve injury exist, both yield nerves that
are equally dysfunctional and yet we need to surgically repair one whereas surgery is detrimental to the other.
No test exists to tell these nerves apart until weeks have passed after the injury. After weeks have passed, we
use electrodiagnostics (EDX) to tell which nerves were severed. This is the state of the art in TPNI diagnosis.
 Because continuity of the nerve is itself impossible to define for weeks after injury, the current standard
treatment is waiting for spontaneous recovery in most patients we guess do not have a severed nerve. In
every field of medicine, there are nerve injuries monitored in this way - without tools for definitive diagnosis,
based on our clinical suspicion.
 We recently discovered that a current, FDA-approved drug (4-aminopyridine, 4AP), has the previously
unknown effect of immediately allowing diagnosis of traumatically paralyzed nerves. Small doses can
distinguish the severed nerve, which requires immediate surgery, from the non-severed nerve, which can be
safely monitored. This novel property of 4AP, a drug already used in humans may be explored while we wait
for function to spontaneously return. Based on our preliminary data, we intend to repurpose 4AP to diagnose
nerve discontinuity instead of just guessing if the nerve is severed and hoping for recovery.
 We want to try 4AP in patients who have nerve injury where we cannot tell if the nerve was severed or
not. We obtained FDA approval for a trial of 4AP in humans to investigate nerve continuity and have modified
our institutional IRB approval to proceed. We want to test 4AP in humans with TPNI in a novel way: As a
pharmacologic diagnostic, where the results of a challenge with the drug reveal something about the
underlying nerve continuity. With the knowledge gained from this trial, we hope to provide solid information
that can confirm or refute clinical guesswork on the critical issue of nerve continuity."
10913606,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Of the millions of Americans who visit an emergency department (ED) each year, there are substantially higher
rates of ED use among racial and ethnic minorities and patients with significant socioeconomic barriers.
However, EDs rarely provide any sort of preventive care, and the care they provide is often not well
coordinated with critically important outpatient care. The consequences are higher rates of undiagnosed
diseases like diabetes among ED patients, which then go untreated, exacerbating health disparities, poor
glycemic control, diabetic complications, and early diabetes-related death. Given the high volume of ED
patients, especially those who are high-risk and have poor access to care, ED-based diabetes screening can
help identify undiagnosed cases and presents an important opportunity to link newly diagnosed patients to
appropriate outpatient care. Nearly 1 in 5 Americans visit an ED in any given year and more than 50% of ED
patients receive some type of blood test. NYU Langone Health has recently launched a system-wide initiative
to screen ED patients already receiving blood work using HbA1c tests. Our preliminary data demonstrate that
this screening approach can help identify ED patients with previously undiagnosed diabetes, especially among
minorities and those without a regular primary care provider. The most critical practical consideration that has
emerged from this initiative is how to improve follow-up with outpatient care. Only 23% of these newly
diagnosed patients had a follow-up outpatient visit within our healthcare system. While these patients may
have had visits elsewhere, this statistic is consistent the low rates of follow-up after ED visits. Therefore, this
proposal seeks to address the following questions: (1) which patients are least likely to follow-up after a new
diagnosis of diabetes, (2) what are the primary reasons why these patients do not follow-up as outpatients, and
(3) whether targeted interventions can help bridge these gaps in care. Therefore, this study will develop clinical
algorithms using data from electronic health records to identify which patients are least likely to follow-up for
patient care after being newly diagnosed with diabetes. It will also perform detailed qualitative interviews
among these newly diagnosed ED patients who fail to follow-up to obtain a comprehensive understanding of
their barriers to care. We will also perform a randomized controlled trial of telemedicine to link ED patients
identified as having newly diagnosed diabetes to appropriate outpatient care. This study will help improve
diabetes surveillance by testing a scalable model to transform EDs into a clinical setting that can effectively
screen and refer the millions of high-risk patients that visit EDs in the United States each year, thereby
reducing disparities in diagnoses, the frequency of diabetic complications, and early diabetes-related death."

Our knowledge of cochlear organ-of-Corti (OoC) mechanics is undergoing major rethinking. Recent findings
show that the reticular lamina (RL) moves much more than the basilar membrane (BM) and with a different phase
than previously thought. Our high-resolution optical-coherence-tomography (OCT) imaging and vibrometry
measurements in the gerbil high-frequency basal region reveal that the RL at outer-hair-cell (OHC) row 3 (RL3)
moves significantly more than at OHC row 1 (RL1). This new discovery suggests that the RL’s mosaic structure,
comprised of the cuticular plates of the basally tilted OHCs and apically tilted phalangeal processes (PhPs) is
not stiff, but rather bends and/or stretches. Our central hypothesis is that the PhP extensions of the Deiters’ cells
(DCs) influence radial and longitudinal motion of the RL mosaic to provide the motion phase and/or magnitude
at each OHC row required for cochlear amplification, and sensitive hearing. This hypothesis will be tested by
measurements and models to determine if: (1) RL3 motion has a bigger radial component that increases the
drive to the OHC3 stereocilia; (2) cytoarchitectural differences below the RL mosaic (e.g., the radial and
longitudinal PhP angles) cause the radial and longitudinal motions to differ across the three OHC rows; (3) the
outer-tunnel (OT) fluid space is part of a resonant system that has a substantial effect on RL radial motion; and
(4) the OoC area changes the pressure in the scala media to produce amplification, and (5) how these motions
influence the drive to inner-hair-cell (IHC) stereocilium bundles. A high-resolution, high-framerate OCT system
(approx. 2.3-µm axial resolution) will be used to image and measure motions of the OoC in gerbils and mice. We
will measure the transverse and radial motions and/or the radial and longitudinal motions of the BM, OHC–DC
junctions, RL, OT, and tectorial membrane (TM) in response to acoustic stimulation at multiple sound levels; and
will do so at cochlear locations corresponding approximately to 0.5-kHz (apical), 2-kHz (middle), and 45-kHz
(basal) locations in gerbil, and 10-kHz (apical), 20-kHz (middle), and 60-kHz (basal) locations in mouse, to
determine the applicability of our hypotheses. The measurements from the middle and apical turns in these two
species will span much of the 0.02–20 kHz frequency range of human hearing. To translate the measured OoC
motions into a detailed understanding of the mechanisms responsible for OHC and IHC stimulation, we will use
our OCT images and measurements to build and test passive and active 3D finite-element models of gerbil and
mouse cochleae. The models will incorporate, in a viscous-fluid environment, the detailed OoC microanatomy,
including the radial and longitudinal PhP angles across the three rows, pillar cells, IHCs, and TM. The models
will allow clear relationships to be established between cochlear function and the structure and material
properties of the OoC. This work will combine experimental and modeling efforts to deepen our understanding
of the complex mechanical interactions within the cochlea that produce amplification and sound transduction."

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative disease that affects motor neurons.
Mutations in the gene SOD1 (superoxide dismutase 1) and in chromosome 9 seem the most prevalent
in those affected by the disease. Despite tremendous efforts aimed at identifying contributing factors
for ALS, the mechanisms underlying motor neuron death have not yet been fully elucidated and
consequently no effective treatment is currently available for ALS. Several clinical trials have been
initiated based on drugs selected from animal studies, however, these ultimately failed. Obviously
among the possible reasons for such failures is the lack of a proper drug target responsible for the
onset and progression of ALS and associated pharmacological tools. In this regard, numerous recent
studies clearly suggest that the EphA4 receptor tyrosine kinase is a potential drug target for ALS and
that targeting its ligand–binding domain may provide a possible avenue to novel and effective
therapeutics. Based on these premises, we have previously recently obtained the first bona fide EphA4
agonistic agents targeting its ligand binding domain, that are brain penetrant and show protection in
cellular and animal models of the disease. Our studies aimed at further optimizing and characterizing
this series will provide critical pharmacological tools and mechanistic insights on the role of the EphA4
modulation in the progression of ALS, and the data gathered in this study will be critical in supporting
the development of these agents into innovative targeted therapeutics for ALS."

Genome-wide polygenic score for coronary artery disease (CAD) identifies 20% of the population with more
than double the average risk. Those individuals are not identified by clinical risk factors or family history, yet
they derive the greatest relative and absolute benefit from LDL-cholesterol lowering therapy.
A key barrier to the use of polygenic score in clinic to prevent CAD is the lack of prospective implementation
studies that quantify and characterize coronary atherosclerosis in individuals with high polygenic risk and
reverse it using pharmacological interventions. LDL-cholesterol pathways account for only a small proportion of
risk, and other mechanisms such as inflammation are of interest. Low dose colchicine has been shown to
reduce the risk of cardiovascular evens in patients with stable coronary artery disease, but the exact
mechanism of how colchicine affects coronary plaque is unknown.
Our proposal addresses those gaps and leverages recent innovations in genomic medicine, biobank data, and
coronary imaging for plaque characterization, through a genomic medicine implementation study of returning
results to hospital biobank participants followed by a mechanistic clinical trial of rosuvastatin and colchicine
using biomarkers and coronary plaque phenotypes on noninvasive coronary CT angiography (CCTA).
We already identified a target population from our hospital biobank consisting of several thousand individuals
who have no known cardiovascular disease, are not on lipid lowering or anti-inflammatory therapy, and have a
high polygenic score defined as top 20% of the distribution. In AIM1, we will return a high polygenic risk score
result to 300 participants and assess baseline and one-year cardiovascular health compared to a matched
group from the MGH Primary Care Cohort. In AIM2, we will measure lipid and inflammatory biomarkers and
perform CCTA on the 300 participants to study coronary plaque volumes and high-risk features, and their
association with cardiovascular health and lipid and inflammatory biomarkers among individuals with high
polygenic risk. In AIM3, we will determine if combination therapy with statin and low dose colchicine –
compared with statin alone – favorably modulates progression and composition of coronary atherosclerosis in
individuals with high polygenic score in a mechanistic pilot study of 150 participants followed for one year. This
study will provide a framework for identification, disclosure, and reversal of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis
in individuals with high polygenic risk and inform the mechanism by which low dose colchicine reduces
cardiovascular events through longitudinal phenotyping of coronary plaque."

Nicotine is the primary addictive constituent in tobacco. For an individual, chronic tobacco use is associated with
a significant increase in heart disease and many forms of cancer. Increasingly, researchers are documenting
health issues associated with vaping flavored e-juice containing nicotine. There are some important sex
differences in chronic nicotine use and its health consequences. Women on average are impacted more by
environmental and sociocultural factors, take less time to become nicotine dependent, make fewer attempts to
quit, abstain for less time, relapse at higher rates, and benefit less from nicotine replacement therapy. Enormous
gains to the individual and society would come from a more complete understanding of factors that contribute
to nicotine use and misuse. Through Pavlovian conditioning processes, environmental stimuli associated with
drugs such as nicotine can become powerful modulators of drug-seeking behavior. Another related and
important factor in the development of chronic nicotine use is the pharmacological effects of nicotine serving as
an internal (interoceptive) stimulus that enters into a conditioned association with other reinforcers (e.g., peer
acceptance, alcohol, work breaks, stress relief, etc.). Thus, smokers/vapers over time develop a rich interoceptive
conditioning history with the stimulus effects of nicotine. Our long-term objective is to understand how this
conditioning history alters the trajectory of use and misuse in individuals and, in doing so, provide new clues on
how to improve cessation programs. To this end, we recently developed an innovative new approach using rats
that merges interoceptive conditioning of intravenous (IV) nicotine with its later self-administration. When IV
nicotine is repeatedly paired with an appetitive reinforcer (i.e., sucrose), this conditioning history dose- and sex-
dependently increases nicotine self-administration (21 to 126%)—an effect more profound in female rats.
Leveraging the methodological strengths of this new approach, we address three Aims in the present proposal.
Aim 1 will assess whether the need to recall the learning after a retention interval alters the strength of the
conditioned reinforcing effects of nicotine. Aim 2 will determine whether the addition of a weak reinforcer during
self-administration interacts with nicotine and its newly acquired conditioned reinforcing effects. Aim 3 will
examine whether an external (exteroceptive) stimulus will compete with the interoceptive nicotine stimulus for
conditioned reinforcing value, thus weakening its later impact on nicotine intake. A fundamental understanding
of such factors that influence the effect of interoceptive conditioning with nicotine will refine and advance our
theoretical models. These advancements will provide foundational research for other basic scientists and clues
for clinical scientists and healthcare providers working to improve approaches to treating nicotine use disorder."

Pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria are collectively responsible for over 5 million deaths annually. A number of
species also exhibit high levels of antibiotic resistance, comprising nine out of twelve members on the World
Health Organization’s list of priority pathogens. Gram-negative bacterial infection is often mediated by so-called
autotransporters, a class of proteins that cross the outer membrane to the extracellular space where they act
as virulence factors, such as adhesins, proteases, and other harmful agents. Autotransporters consist of a
translocator domain, which remains in the membrane, and a passenger domain, which secretes across the
membrane to the other side, even without the use chemical energy, e.g., ATP. Targeting these autotransporters
for inhibition represents a promising means of controlling infection while limiting the development of resistance.
However, first, research into the molecular mechanisms of autotransporter folding, secretion, and expression
beyond the cell surface is critically needed. This project will meet that need through three specific aims. In
the first aim, how the passenger domain folds will be characterized, answering why folding in vivo is orders
of magnitude faster than in vitro. The second aim focuses on the secretion of the passenger domain across
the membrane through a hybrid-β-barrel of the translocator domain with BamA, the protein responsible for its
membrane insertion. The pathway through the combined barrels will be determined, as well as the influence of
the outer membrane on the process. In the third aim, another class of autotransporters, two-partner secretion
systems, will be modeled, with a goal of identifying both commonalities and differences between them and other
classes. The primary methodological tool to be used for this project is atomic-scale molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations. These simulations will all be carried out in realistic environments, including an accurate model of the
asymmetric Gram-negative outer membrane. Multiple innovative approaches will also be used, including deep
learning for modeling the folding process, Markov state modeling for extracting kinetics information, and coarse-
grained Brownian dynamics for observing spontaneous secretion. Close collaboration with multiple experimental
labs will provide key inputs to and validation of the MD simulation results."

 Inter-organelle communication plays an essential role in maintaining cellular homeostasis
and animal aging. Mitochondria, as a highly dynamic organelle and the metabolic hub of the cell,
frequently interact with other cellular organelles to coordinate metabolic processes and maintain
cellular homeostasis. Although it is well known that mitochondrial dynamics are often altered
during animal aging, it remains largely unanswered whether and how inter-organelle
communication plays a crucial role in age-dependent alternations of mitochondrial dynamics. Like
mitochondria, peroxisomes play an important role in redox and lipid metabolism (e.g., ether
phospholipid biosynthesis). However, peroxisome aging research is an understudied area. In this
proposal, we will combine CRISPR genome editing, organelle proteomics, metabolomics, and
cutting-edge imaging tools to investigate the important role of peroxisome-mitochondrion
communication in animal aging. The proposal is based on our previous exciting findings showing
that activation of peroxisomal receptor protein Pex5 not only rescued age-dependent decline of
peroxisomal import, but also preserved mitochondrial structure and function. We further show that
peroxisomal ether phospholipid biosynthesis is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial
dynamics. Furthermore, we uncovered a novel positive feedback loop that regulates the ether
phospholipid synthesis pathway under oxidative stress.
 In this proposal, we will address two outstanding questions: 1) Why and how does
peroxisomal import decline with age? 2) How does peroxisomal dysfunction contribute to cellular
aging? Could inter-organelle communication be a core mechanism? The proposed work will
provide novel insights into the significant role of peroxisome-mitochondrion communication in
animal health aging and longevity. Three specific aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1. Determine
how peroxisomal import function declines with age. Specific Aim 2. Determine the role of
peroxisome-derived ether phospholipids in age-related alterations of mitochondrial dynamics.
Specific Aim 3. Determine the role of ATF4 in transcriptional regulation of Gnpat and peroxisomal
ether phospholipid biosynthesis during aging."

The proposed K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will prepare Manshu Yang, Ph.D. to
become an independent researcher in developing cutting-edge and practical statistical methodology to address
the timely issue of missing data in drug use and addiction (DUA) research. Dr. Yang is currently an Assistant
Professor of Quantitative Health Psychology at the University of Rhode Island. The outlined proposal builds
upon her training and research experience in statistics and psychology and will facilitate her path to become a
scholar dedicated to bridging state-of-the-art methodologies and substantive theory to advance knowledge of
DUA etiology and intervention strategies. DUA has a myriad of deleterious impacts and continues to raise
public health concerns in the US. In the past two decades, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) has been
increasingly used to help researchers understand the influence of psychosocial and contextual factors on
substance use in the real world and nearly in real time, so that more efficacious interventions can be
developed accordingly. However, along with the opportunity of using EMA comes a significant methodological
challenge: missing responses are inevitable, often substantial, and not properly handled in data analysis,
hence significantly increasing researchers’ risks of reaching incorrect conclusions and developing ineffective or
even unsafe interventions. Current methods cannot address all the unique methodological challenges in DUA
EMA studies due to their complex missing data patterns and untestable missing data assumptions. On the
other hand, EMA brings a unique opportunity to address these challenges by re-prompting participants shortly
after they missed an EMA survey to retrieve their data. Such later-retrieved data are readily available from
existing data (e.g., morning reports capturing missed DUA consequences in the prior day) or can be easily
added to an automated EMA system without altering EMA schedule. The outlined proposal includes a
comprehensive mentorship and didactic plan to support Dr. Yang’s career development and advance her
knowledge and skills in DUA etiology/intervention, EMA design, data management, and analysis, Bayesian
missing data analysis, and statistical programming. Specifically, the aims of the proposed research study are
(1) to use all available data (initially observed and later retrieved) to characterize missing data mechanisms in
DUA EMA, (2) to develop a novel Bayesian method for handling missing data and making valid inference on
DUA etiology, (3) to develop a Bayesian sensitivity analysis method to test the robustness of findings to
possible departures from missing data assumptions. The proposed study will investigate missing data issues
and develop analysis methods using empirical EMA datasets from three NIDA-funded projects and computer-
simulated data in a cost-effective way. Statistical methods developed from the study will greatly help
researchers elucidate the real-world mechanisms of DUA and develop tailored, effective interventions."

Septic shock impacts 10% of children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit, 25% of whom die. Outcomes
are particularly poor in those who suffer sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI), a heterogeneous
syndrome driven by the dysregulated host immune response to infection, and for which limited treatment options
exist. Informed by existing adult literature and a strong foundation of preliminary data, Dr. Stanski’s proposal
seeks to develop a precision medicine approach to management of these high risk children with septic shock
and SA-AKI, by leveraging clinical and biomarker data to identify unique SA-AKI subphenotypes that may inform
vasoactive medication selection at the bedside. The results from these studies will guide future prospective work
to identify treatment strategies for pediatric SA-AKI, and improve outcomes for children with septic shock as a
whole. Candidate: Dr. Natalja Stanski is an Assistant Professor of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine at the
University of Cincinnati College of Medicine and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC). She
has a strong early track record of patient-oriented research in the areas of acute kidney injury and sepsis
precision medicine, focusing on identifying strategies to characterize syndrome heterogeneity. Dr. Stanski’s long-
term goal is to become an independent physician-scientist leading precision-medicine informed patient-oriented
research to improve outcomes for children with sepsis and SA-AKI. As such, her training goals as part of this
award include gaining advanced knowledge in the following areas: design and conduct of patient-oriented
research (including clinical trials), implementation science and qualitative research methodologies, advanced
biostatistics (including techniques for cluster analysis), and content expertise in precision medicine, sepsis and
SA-AKI. To accomplish these goals, Dr. Stanski’s career development plan includes formal coursework in
advanced biostatistics, clinical trial management, implementation science and qualitative research;
individualized expert mentoring; training by expert consultants; and completion of the proposed research aims.
Research: The aims of this study are: 1) to use cluster analysis methodology to identify novel pediatric SA-AKI
clinical subphenotypes and describe their associations with outcomes and serum biomarker profiles, and 2) to
use Implementation Mapping to develop a rigorous, theory-based implementation plan for personalized
vasoactive selection in children with septic shock and SA-AKI. This application leverages the outstanding
research infrastructure at CCHMC, and the support of a formidable expert mentorship, consultant and
collaborator team. Specifically, Dr. Stanski’s access to the existing large patient datasets and biorepositories
necessary to conduct this important work makes her uniquely suited to complete her proposed research aims.
The support and training provided by this K23 will leave Dr. Stanski well-positioned to achieve her long-term goal
of research independence, and the preliminary data generated will provide the foundation for a feasible precision
medicine approach to SA-AKI management that is needed to improve outcomes in pediatric septic shock."

Despite increasing diagnoses, gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) remain poorly
understood, both in relation to their molecular pathogenesis and cells-of-origin. My recent work using transgenic
mice demonstrated, for the first time, the involvement of enteric neural crest-derived cells (ENCCs) in
neuroendocrine differentiation and tumor development driven by Men1 gene deletion. Consistent with its role in
cell fate patterning, Hedgehog signaling was implicated in neuroendocrine reprogramming of ENCCs. Menin,
encoded by the MEN1 gene, has been shown to regulate Hedgehog signaling in mouse models of pancreatic
NET development, however reciprocity between menin and Hedgehog has yet to be studied in ENCCs. This
proposal aims to address whether loss of menin in ENCCs drives acquisition of the neuroendocrine cell fate with
lineage commitment being actively modulated by Hedgehog signaling. My goals are to define the cells-of-
origin for MEN1 GEP-NETs and to decipher the role of Hedgehog in driving neuroendocrine cell
patterning. I will combine my experience using novel transgenic mouse models and ex vivo tissue culture
techniques with state-of-the-art single cell and spatial transcriptome profiling to define the contribution of ENCCs
to neuroendocrine differentiation and GEP-NET development. I hypothesize that reciprocal signaling by
menin and Hedgehog drives ENCC reprogramming and gives rise to hyperplastic neuroendocrine cells
with tumorigenic potential. This Research Plan will determine whether MEN1-associated GEP-NETs originate
from reprogrammed ENCC populations (Aim 1) and decipher the role of Hedgehog signaling in neuroendocrine

sequencing methods, this award will enable me to establish a state-of-the-art research program with the long-
term goal of defining the cellular signals that govern enteric neuroendocrine cell fate."
10899578,"Project Summary/Abstract
How is our visual system capable of making sense out of the complex pattern of light received in the retina?
Machine vision has recently been successful at solving complex tasks on natural images such as object
classification. Thus, we can use these models to infer computations which transform the pattern of light intensities
driven by a natural image all the way up to the behavioral output such as the category of objects in the image.
However, the models of vision offered by machine vision don’t provide insight into the cellular and molecular
mechanisms in the visual system. On the other hand, classical models of visual system offer biologically faithful
accounts for multiple phases the visual system goes through during development, from before eye-opening to
adulthood. However, their scope is often very limited and they cannot provide functional accounts for the cellular
and molecular mechanism they model.
In this proposal, my aim is to put large-scale models of object recognition under biological constraints to be able
to understand the computational and functional roles of those constraints. To this end, I focus on a theoretically-
tractable aspect of optimization problems that both natural vision and machine vision face: regularization.
Regularization refers to the parts of optimization goal that subject the mapping between input and output to some
constraints usually related to resources e.g., energy efficiency in biological systems or robustness to input noise
in machine vision.
I hypothesize that regulatory mechanisms in natural vision have a fundamental computational role in shaping
the visual cortex rather than the mere maintenance and stability roles they are often attributed to. To test this
hypothesis, I aim to conduct a series of computational, theoretical and eventually experimental steps (in
collaboration with experimental labs). In Aim 1, I build large-scale models of the visual cortex and I train them
under different regularization terms, notably cellular-level regularization constraints mimicking neuronal self-
regulatory processes. I then assess those models under a battery of functional and brain similarity measures. In
Aim 2, I build a theoretical framework to gain a fundamental understanding of how these regulatory mechanisms
relate to each other. Finally, in Aim 3, I develop experimental protocols to validate the predictions made by Aim
1 and Aim 2. Based on my preliminary results, I hypothesize that retinal spontaneous activity can play a
significant regulatory role with functional implications for natural vision and I envision a new use for retinal
prosthetic devices as valuable experimental tools to study visual development."
10726563,"Diabetes is the number one cause of end stage kidney disease and accounts for approximately 47% of
cases in the US. More than 34 million Americans have diabetes. It is prevalent in the people aged 18 years and
older. The demographic of Veteran population falls in this age group. In Veterans aged 65 years and older,
approximately 27% are afflicted with diabetes. A recent study demonstrated that diabetic patients with kidney
disease had 87% higher risk of cardiovascular mortality. One in three patients with diabetes develop diabetic
nephropathy (DN). Early pathologic changes in DN involve renal, especially glomerular hypertrophy and
expansion of matrix proteins. The focus of our research is to investigate the signal transduction mechanisms that
lead to the progression of DN. To test our concepts, we use both renal glomerular mesangial and proximal
tubular epithelial (PTE) cells in culture and, mouse and rat models of diabetes exhibiting kidney pathologies. In
kidney, high levels of transforming growth factor-b (TGFb) mediate many pathologic effects of hyperglycemia.
Therefore, along with the effects of high glucose, we investigate the signaling mechanisms of TGFb in mesangial
and PTE cells. We were the first to discover that high glucose decreases the expression of the tumor suppressor
protein PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in chromosome 10) in these cells and in the renal
tissues of diabetic mice and rats. We identified that this effect of high glucose is mediated by TGFb. In
investigating the mechanisms, we for the first time reported that multiple microRNAs such as miR-21, miR-26
and miR-214 that are significantly increased in the diabetic kidneys regulate the hyperglycemia- and TGFb-
induced inhibition of PTEN. In fact, we showed that this inhibition of PTEN expression resulted in sustained
activation of Akt kinase that led to activation of mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1). mTORC1
contributes to mesangial and PTE cell hypertrophy, and expression of matrix proteins fibronectin and collagen I
a2 causing renal hypertrophy and fibrosis in DN. Indeed, we showed that rapamycin ameliorated complications
of DN including albuminuria in type 1 and type 2 diabetic mice. Since increased expression of above-mentioned
microRNAs contribute to PTEN inhibition/Akt kinase-mediated mTOR activation, our studies opened the door to
the novel application of anti-miR therapy for DN. Rapamycin-mediated complete inhibition of mTORC1 causes
deleterious clinical outcome. Proximal tubular loss of mTORC1 in mice showed progressive renal fibrosis.
Therefore, more recently we have focused on a novel protein, called deptor, which is a component of mTOR and
is a negative regulator of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities. For the first time, we showed that the renal
expression of deptor was significantly reduced in humans with diabetes and in diabetic rodents. This reduction
contributed to enhanced mTOR activity. We also found that both high glucose and TGFb decrease the
expression of deptor in mesangial and PTE cells. We identified a microRNA, miR-181a, which is increased in
response to high glucose or TGFb, regulates the downregulation of deptor. More recently, we identified an
independent epigenetic mechanism involving the PRC2 (polycomb repressor complex 2) component enhancer
of zeste homolog 2 for high glucose-induced deptor suppression. We plan to use both these mechanisms to
target the complications of DN in rodent models. Furthermore, we have identified a novel cross-talk between
high glucose/TGFb and PDGFRb (platelet-derived growth factor receptor-b) activation in mesangial and PTE
cells. PDGFRb inhibitor blocked hypertrophy and matrix protein expression, indicating that this can be utilized
therapeutically for amelioration of DN. A strong correlation between diabetes and renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
has been established. We have identified two microRNAs, miR-21 and miR-214, which are involved in DN, also
contribute to the activation of mTORC1 and, proliferation and invasion of renal carcinoma cells. Thus, the goal
of our studies is to investigate the molecular mechanisms of the progression of DN and RCC, and identify
signaling molecules that can be targeted by small molecular drugs and anti-miR based therapies."
10726608,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mental illness that affects more than 300 million people
worldwide. Depression is the most prevalent mental illness among U.S. veterans and increases their risk of
hospitalization and death. Also, the prevalence of depression in veterans is significantly higher than in general
U.S. adult population. Available treatments are ineffective for many MDD patients, and there is an urgent need
to obtain a better understanding of biological bases of MDD in order to develop novel therapeutic strategies.
 Genetic contribution to MDD is ~40%, and recent large-scale GWAS discovered 102 significant loci that
are linked to MDD risk. However, as in other complex disorders, the majority of the MDD risk loci reside within
non-coding regions of the genome and are predicted to alter the activity of gene regulatory elements (GREs;
e.g., enhancers or promoters). In addition, the effect of a GRE on gene expression is frequently dependent on
the cell and tissue type, making it a challenge to understand the functional impact of GWAS risk loci. Linking
the disease risk variants with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and/or with epigenetic maps of GREs in
relevant tissues/cell types yielded formidable results in other psychiatric diseases and holds promise for MDD.
In addition, a systematic experimental validation of eQTLs/enhancers’ activity via massively parallel reporter
assays (MPRAs) provides a powerful platform to decipher the functional impact of the disease risk variants.
 To date, many neurobiological studies of MDD have been concentrated on neuronal dysfunction.
However, multiple studies implicate microglia (MG)—the immune cells of the brain—to the pathogenesis of this
disorder. Our preliminary data shows that MDD genetic risk is reflected in gene expression changes in the blood-
derived myeloid cells. Because of the substantial overlap in transcriptomes of these cells and MG, these data
suggest that MG might play an important role in susceptibility to MDD. However, large-scale gene expression
data in purified MG are not available to test this hypothesis.
 Our overarching goal is to discern MG dysfunction in MDD as well as to link this dysfunction to genetic
predisposition to MDD by integrating MDD GWAS, MG eQTLs, and epigenetic maps of enhancers that are active
in MG. In Aim1, we will use our novel fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting (FANS) protocol (which allows the
separation of MG from autopsied human brain) to generate high-quality gene expression data in MG purified
from a large cohort of MDD cases and controls (N~300). Importantly, the cohort includes specimens from the
U.S. veteran population. We will also perform a case-control comparison of gene expression in MG, including
testing if alterations in MDD are different in veterans vs. non-veterans, In Aim2, we will use gene expression data
from Aim 1 to map MG eQTLs, and will integrate these eQTLs with MDD GWAS findings using rigorous
computational approaches. These analyses will unravel the functional implications of MDD risk variants on gene
expression in MG, and will identify candidate causal eSNPs that will be functionally validated in Aim 3. Finally,
in Aim3, we will use MPRAs to validate the candidate causal eSNPs that are harbored by putative enhancers
and/or eQTL regions in MG. MPRAs will be performed in MG-like cells that will be differentiated from human
induced pluripotent stem cells.
 Collectively, the proposed studies will lead to the discovery of MDD risk variants and the affected genes
that are likely to be causal for MDD and act specifically in MG cells, paving the way for the development of novel
treatment approaches. These studies are especially important for U.S. veterans, as the surge of depression-
related suicides among veterans necessitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies for MDD."
10726609,"Within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract the primary function of the mucosal surface is to provide a selective barrier
to the outside. It is widely understood that the GI tract exists in a state of low-grade inflammation, as a result of
constant processing of luminal antigenic material. The GI tract is home to trillions of commensal bacteria which
contribute significantly to GI homeostasis, but can also initiate and drive the progression of mucosal diseases.
Acute intestinal inflammation involves early accumulation of neutrophils (PMN) followed by either resolution or
progression to chronic inflammation. Without efficient PMN clearance at sites of infiltration, PMN can
accumulate and contribute to chronic inflammatory conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease. The
ongoing studies outline in this proposal have revealed that PMN transepithelial migration (TEM) results in a
significant decrease in extracellular pH, deemed inflammatory acidification. Extensions of these studies have
shown that this acidic microenvironment impacts barrier function and gene transcription in intestinal epithelial
cells (IEC). Guided by an unbiased RNAseq of IEC exposed to low pH in vitro and tissue metabolomics in vivo,
we identified a gene signature that includes induction of both TNF and members of the DUSP and NR4A
families. We also identified a role of IEC GPR31 in sensing extracellular pH and the loss of microbial-derived
indoles during active inflammation. Extending these studies, we observed significant improvement in IEC
barrier function under acidic conditions in T84 cells which had GPR31 knocked down. Additionally, we
observed that indole treatment significantly decreased inflammatory acidification following PMN TEM and in
K12 E. coli acidic conditions induce the production of indole. Based on these observations, we hypothesize
that inflammatory acidification promotes inflammatory signaling in IEC and that the microbiota-derived indoles
have a significant role in promoting pH homeostasis at sites of inflammation. In vitro functional assays will
define the impact of extracellular acidosis and pH sensing on PMN TEM, IEC barrier function, and IEC
adaptation to chronic extracellular acidosis. These studies will be extended to examine the influence of
microbial/host interactions on IEC responses to extracellular acidification. Finally, utilizing in vivo murine colitis
and ileitis models we will profile inflammatory acidification. We will extend these studies to investigate the
impact of the microbiota and microbiota-derived metabolites on inflammation-associated acidosis. The career
development and training plan outlined in this application is designed to guide and promote my transition to
independence as a VA funded researcher. The proposed combination of didactic courses, professional
conferences, and mentorship committee have been designed to strengthen my knowledge of mucosal
immunology and mucosal inflammation. Technically, I will gain experience in the generation of murine intestinal
enteroids, genetic modification of enteroids, both chemically induced and spontaneous murine models of ileitis
and colitis, and expand my knowledge of microbial/host response and technical experience in manipulating the
microbiota. Upon completion of this proposal I will be well prepared to establish myself as an expert in pH
regulation and inflammation-associated acidification. Furthermore, it is our hope that the studies outline in this
proposal will lay the groundwork for the identification of novel therapeutic avenues in IBD, directly benefiting
the veteran population."
10878988,"Project Summary/Abstract
Light is processed in the eye for both visual and non-visual [i.e., non-image-forming (NIF)] pathways. NIF pathway targets
include circadian rhythms, hormones (e.g., melatonin, which is important in sleep and circadian rhythms), heart rate, EEG,
mood, and pupillary light response physiology. NIF pathway targets are central to many circadian, sleep, psychiatric, and
neurologic health outcomes whose risks and progression vary by sex and age. It is therefore important to document
whether the response to light input to the NIF pathway and its targets differ by sex and age because of their potential
contribution to the pathogenesis, risk, and/or severity of some disorders; this should facilitate targeted diagnosis,
monitoring, and treatment strategies.
Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells containing melanopsin are the primary sensors for NIF processing, whose
response to light stimuli’s wavelength, intensity, and duration differ from those of rods and cones. We will test the
hypothesis that the responsiveness of the melanopsin pathway depends on sex and age. A method for probing the
response of the melanopsin pathway uses the post-illumination pupil response (PIPR) which can be documented using
commercially available pupillometers in sessions lasting less than an hour by trained staff with results available almost
immediately. PIPR is reported to be altered in individuals with circadian sleep/wake, psychiatric, and neurologic disorders
that have different distributions by sex and age. There are four problems with prior studies using PIPR that severely limit
interpretation and translation of the prior work: (i) not designed to test for sex and age effects; (ii) considerable variation in
stimuli and analysis methods; (iii) stimuli that may not be melanopsin-pathway specific; and (iv) no documentation of time-
dependent response variation by sex and age. Sex or age differences would require appropriate study population
composition to avoid confounding. The most frequently used test of the melanopsin pathway for NIF-influenced circadian
rhythms is light-induced melatonin suppression. This method requires multiple hours of data collection over two nights, is
onerous for participants, has expensive assay costs, and does not provide results in close-to-real time.
We will test for sex and age differences in PIPR in 48 healthy individuals (1:1 for F:M; and 1:1:1 for age groups 18-40,
40-60 and 60-85 years). Individuals will have (i) pupillometry with specific durations, light wavelengths and intensities
chosen to primarily affect the melanopsin pathway (M+) or not (M-) at three different clock times; (ii) melatonin suppression
testing using M+ and M- stimuli from portable light boxes; and (iii) documentation of circadian phase and sleep timing. We
will calculate multiple measures of PIPR (including pupil size at 6 sec, time-varying changes in pupil size and others); these
will be correlated with melatonin suppression, circadian phase, and sleep timing.
As a resource for standardization of methods, we will make available our data cleaning and analyses programs on a public
website. Increased use of pupillometry could be beneficial for further investigations of NIF pathway-related sex- and age-
related differences in health and disease; clinical applications including diagnosis and monitoring before disease symptoms
emerge; and design and testing of personalized targeted interventions including retina-based therapies and/or light exposure."
10910129,"Abstract
Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) is a highly prevalent health issue exhibited by ~50% of men by age 50, and
75% by age 80 which may be associated with bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) and lower urinary tract symptoms
(LUTS). First line treatments include α1-adrenoceptors antagonists (e.g., tamsulosin) to decrease smooth muscle
tone in the prostate and bladder neck and 5α-reductase inhibitors (e.g., finasteride) to block conversion of
testosterone to more potent dihydrotestosterone for reducing prostate volume. However, these agents are often
ineffective in preventing disease progression to urinary retention which may necessitate surgical intervention in
many patients. Multiple lines of evidence support that apart from aging, the pathogenesis of LUTS comprises
multiple modifiable factors including compromised prostatic perfusion, oxidative stress mediated inflammation,
fibrosis, and neuroplasticity. Clinical evidence argues against “one size fits all” therapy and highlights the
preference of treatment options with lower risk of sexual side effects which is underscored by the FDA approval
of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (PDE5I), tadalafil, and its recent (2021) combination with finasteride (i.e.,
Entadfi) as a single pill for BPH/LUTS. Since some patients develop refractoriness to tadalafil, there is a
compelling reason to advance our understanding of nitric oxide (NO•)-cGMP signaling in the pathophysiology of
BPH/LUTS. The canonical target for NO• is soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) that catalyzes the production of
cGMP. The responsiveness of sGC is dependent upon cytochrome B5 reductase-3 (CYB5R3) that maintains
the sGC heme in the NO• sensitive reduced state (Fe2+). We recently reported that aged (≥24 mo) male mice
without hormonal manipulation recapitulate the BOO phenotype of high bladder pressure/low urine flow
compared to low pressure/high flow of adult mice (9 mo), and that daily oral treatment with the sGC activator,
cinaciguat (10 mg/kg/2 wks) reversed prostate hyperplasia and BOO in these aged mice. We propose that the
aged mouse is a suitable model for testing our novel hypothesis that BPH/LUTS arises in the milieu of age-
related oxidative stress potentiating the neurodegeneration of NO• producing (nitrergic) nerves and
inflammation-induced inactivation of CYB5R3 to decrease cGMP-PKG signaling. The vicious feed forward cycle
of BPH/LUTS can be circumvented by cinaciguat, a heme mimetic that can stimulate cGMP production when
sGC is oxidized and the heme displaced, while its combination with a PDE5I can check PDE5 upregulation due
to prolonged elevation of cGMP. This is supported by our selective knockout (KO) of CYB5R3 in the
prostate/bladder, with both models to be compared with prostatic tissue from aged men with BPH. Our aims are:
1) Probe the role of the NO•-sGC-cGMP signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of BPH/BOO/LUTS in aged mice
with cinaciguat treatment; 2) Study the impact of tissue specific deletion of CYB5R3 in the prostate or bladder in
our conditional KO mouse; and 3) Determine if cinaciguat/PDE5I combination therapy can override PDE5
overexpression driven refractoriness to PDE5Is and any untoward cardiovascular effects that may occur with
cinaciguat."
10857202,"NAD+ depletion is observed in diseases including heart failure and metabolic cardiomyopathy. Maintaining
NAD+ homeostasis by activating NAD+ synthesis pathways has shown great promise to treat diseases. We
here explore that inhibiting NAD+ consumption will prevent NAD+ depletion and ameliorate heart disease. NAD+
hydrolases catalyze NAD+ degradation to form nicotinamide and ADPR. SARM1 is an intracellular NAD+
hydrolase that is known as an executer of axonal degeneration and promotes mitochondrial dysfunction.
Recent studies showed that SARM1 is activated by increased NMN/NAD+ ratio and SARM1 phosphorylation.
However, the role of SARM1 in metabolic cardiomyopathy has never been reported, and how SARM1 is
activated to cause mitochondrial dysfunction is not known. The overall objective of this project is to investigate
how SARM1 promotes NAD+ decline and regulates mitophagy during metabolic cardiomyopathy. Further
understanding of SARM1 in the heart will lead to a new target for therapeutic development of heart disease.
In our pilot data, we showed that SARM1 deficiency in SARM1-KO mice and in newly developed
cardiomyocyte-specific SARM1-KO mice (SARM1-cKO) protected against metabolic stress-induced
cardiomyopathy, providing the first evidence on the role of SARM1 in causing dysfunction of diabetic hearts.
Pilot data further suggested that NAD+ metabolic and JNK1 phosphorylation signaling may activate SARM1,
and SARM1 promotes mitophagy in diabetic hearts. Based on these results, we propose to dissect the
pathogenic mechanisms of SARM1 in metabolic cardiomyopathy with the three aims. Specific Aim 1 will use
SARM1-cKO mice to determine the impact of cardiomyocyte SARM1 deficiency on type 1 diabetes (T1D)-
induced and diet-induced obesity (DIO)-induced cardiomyopathy. Multi-omics analyses targeting known
mechanistic pathways of diabetic hearts will be performed to identify how cardiomyocyte SARM1 deficiency
protects hearts against the two types of metabolic stresses. Specific Aim 2 will understand how metabolic
stress activates SARM1 to cause compartmental NAD+ decline. We will manipulate NAD+ metabolic and JNK1-
SARM1 phosphorylation signaling to establish how the two pathways activate SARM1 to cause NAD+ decline
in mitochondria or cytosol using compartment-specific NAD+ biosensors. Specific Aim 3 will determine how
SARM1 promotes mitophagy in diabetic hearts. Mitophagy flux impacted by metabolic stress and SARM1
deficiency will be measured by mito-Keima mice. How SARM1 promotes mitophagy via traditional PINK1-
Parkin and/or alternative Ulk1-Rab9 pathways will be examined in diabetic hearts. This project will establish
SARM1 as a new target to promote NAD+ decline mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic cardiomyopathy.
The results from this project will identify new therapeutic targets linked to SARM1-dependent mechanisms."
10733286,"SUMMARY
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest cancers, with a one-year survival rate of only
20%. A major barrier to treatment is that activating mutations in KRAS (e.g. KRASG12D) drive >90% of PDAC, but
there are currently no effective drugs that target this classic oncogene. PDAC is also characterized by the build-
up of more compressive stress than any other tumor. The effects of mechanical compressive stress are also
poorly understood. Compressive stress distorts and compresses cells leading to increased intracellular
molecular crowding. This crowding has two key effects: molecular motion is inhibited, and also molecular
assembly is increased as molecules are pushed together. We have found that increased molecular crowding
greatly favors phase separation, and drives stress granule formation. Our original hypothesis was that KRASG12D
oncogene activation would confer resistance to mechanical compression. In fact, the opposite was true:
KRASG12D softens cells, leading to increased susceptibility to compressive stress. The consequent high
molecular crowding increased stress granules, which we found actually help alleviate molecular crowding by
sequestering RNA. We are now determining if stress granules are key for survival under compressive stress.
High crowding and distortion also led to imbalances in the physical properties of mitotic spindles, issues with
DNA replication, and frequent nuclear ruptures, all of which contribute to an extremely high rate of mitotic errors
when KRASG12D and compression are combined. We therefore, investigated the new hypothesis that the
combination of KRAS mutation and compression accelerate cancer cell evolution. In support of this idea, we
found frequent and highly stereotyped aneuploidies in cells that we evolved in vitro under compression for one
month. We also saw frequent whole genome duplications and mutation of TP53. The evolved cells were able to
outcompete parent cells when grown under mechanical compression, indicating that they had adapted to this
perturbed mechanical environment. We will now determine the mechanisms of this adaptation. We also identified
Myc in a screen for genes that conferred resistance to compression. Myc is also present on chromosome 8,
which we found was frequently gained in both our in vitro evolution experiments, and in patient PDAC biopsy
samples. We hypothesize that genes and signaling pathways that are crucial for cancer cell survival under
compression, will represent new therapeutic targets for solid tumors, especially highly mechanically perturbed
tumors like PDAC. We are well positioned to discover these genes by analysis of large numbers of mechanically
evolved clones, all of which originated from an isogenic parent. New approaches to treat PDAC are desperately
needed. Therefore, the ultimate translation of our research has the potential for significant impact."
10892855,"Humans with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) experience several disorders of skeletal health, including
decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and increased risk for fragility fractures (i.e., osteoporosis). These
features are the primary clinical characteristics of diabetic bone disease (DBD). Evidence suggests that DBD
occurs early in the progression of T1D; involves impaired bone formation; results in micro-architectural
abnormalities and poor bone matrix quality; and coincides with hyperglycemia and a decline in endogenous
insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 production. While many have postulated that skeletal deficits in diabetes
occur as a direct result of glucose dysregulation, our pre-clinical studies in mouse models, supported by
observational studies in humans, show that impairment in the production and action of insulin and insulin-like
growth factor-1 (IGF-1) may be root causes of DBD. Specifically, our laboratory and others have demonstrated
that in rodent models of T1D: 1) deficits in bone formation occur in the context of insulin-deficiency; 2) near-
normalization of serum glucose alone is not sufficient to prevent DBD; 3) insulin and IGF-1 therapy improve
fracture resistance and new bone formation; and 4) both insulin and IGF-1 utilize similar down-stream
pathways to promote osteoblastogenesis and bone formation. To clarify the mechanisms and signaling
pathways by which insulin and/or IGF-1 modulate osteogenesis; to understand how deficiencies or impaired
signaling of each may contribute to DBD; and to delineate how each may contribute to therapeutic approaches
to prevent or treat DBD, we propose to 1) determine how insulin and IGF-1 deficiencies contribute to DBD at
the tissue, cellular, and molecular level, and 2) how each hormone may perform overlapping and independent
effects through specific downstream signaling pathways that may ultimately become therapeutic targets for
preventing and/or reversing DBD."
10898777,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common age-related disorder and a leading cause of long-term pain and
disability, for which there is a substantial therapeutic gap. Baduanjin (BDJ) is a unique mind-body exercise
consisting of eight movements that can be practiced at home with video guidance, thereby making it a suitable
option for older adults with KOA. Our recent study showed that BDJ can significantly reduce pain in patients
with KOA. However, responses to BDJ intervention are heterogeneous, and some individuals demonstrate only
a moderate response. Thus, there is an urgent need for mechanistic research to enhance the modulation effect
of this promising mind-body therapy.
One characteristic of BDJ is the practice of controlled fine body/limb movements and muscle and tendon
strengthening. This property suggests motor learning and control may play an important role in BDJ. Improving
motor performance should enhance the modulation effect of this promising mind-body intervention. The
primary motor cortex (M1) is the principal brain region of the motor system and integrates input from other
cortical brain areas to generate neural impulses that pass down the spinal cord and control the execution of
movement. Thus, M1 may play a crucial role in BDJ practice.
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a safe and clinically applicable neuromodulation tool that can
alter cortical excitability and has been used to investigate the causal relationship between brain and behavior.
Studies have shown that tDCS at M1 can facilitate motor performance. Thus, increasing the excitability of M1
using tDCS should be able to improve performance of BDJ, increasing its modulation effects. Furthermore, M1
is the most commonly used neuromodulation target for pain management. This proposal aims to investigate
whether we can enhance the modulation effects of BDJ mind-body intervention by enhancing the cortical
excitability of bilateral M1 using multifocal tDCS in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Specifically, we will
conduct a randomized study using a 2 x 2 factorial design in which 140 KOA patients will be randomized to one
of four groups: 1) BDJ + real tDCS, 2) BDJ + sham tDCS, 3) stretching + real tDCS, and 4) stretching + sham
tDCS. Multidisciplinary assessments will be evaluated at baseline and 12 weeks, with a follow-up at 24 weeks.
Our expected outcome is significant and highly innovative in that the findings obtained will lead to the
establishment of a new and clinically implementable treatment paradigm for KOA and be broadly applicable to
the management of chronic musculoskeletal pain."
10872154,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The goal of this study is to investigate the role of the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) in the symptomatology
of borderline personality disorder (BPD), a condition associated with alarmingly elevated risk for suicide
attempt (SA; up to 75%) and death by suicide (up to 10%). Despite BPD’s relatively low prevalence (1-5%),
epidemiological research has shown that up to 33% of suicide deaths in the general population are attributable
to BPD. Adding complexity, research suggests that significant sex differences exist in BPD with respect to both
symptoms’ presentation and neurobiology; BPD males have higher suicide risk, but less access to effective
treatment. Despite this, available treatments are largely not capable of addressing overall BPD symptom
severity or rapidly reducing suicide risk. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have identified structural
and network alterations in BPD and have associated structural differences and dysregulation in a frontolimbic
circuit of regions with incidence of BPD and increased symptom severity, and suicidal behavior in BPD.
Investigation of molecular mechanisms responsible for BPD symptoms, and suicide risk specifically, is an
essential next step to both promote development of novel treatments and facilitate risk prevention in BPD.
 Emerging evidence implicates KOR in BPD and suicidal behavior. KOR plays critical roles in emotion
regulation, social functioning, and impulsivity– all of which are both central to BPD and related to suicide risk.
Postmortem studies have shown an association between KOR and death by suicide. Further, a variety of
studies in both animals and humans have shown that KOR antagonists can produce antidepressant, anxiolytic,
and even anti-suicidal effects, though research also suggests men and women may respond differently to such
agents. Importantly, KOR agents’ effect on dopamine is modest relative to drugs of abuse, reducing concerns
about abuse potential. Based on support from novel pilot data using the same techniques, we now propose a
novel investigation of KOR availability in individuals with BPD relative to healthy adults (HA) using positron
emission tomography (PET), a brain imaging technique, and radioligand [11C]EKAP which binds selectively to
KOR in the brain (Aim 1a). We will also evaluate the association between KOR availability and SA history in
BPD (Aim 1b). Next, we will evaluate the association between impulsivity, emotion dysregulation, and BPD
symptom severity – key endophenotypes related to prognosis and suicide risk and resistant to treatment – and
KOR availability in BPD (Aim 2). Finally, we will evaluate sex differences in KOR availability in BPD and HA.
Results of this study will provide potentially critical insight into the relationship between this novel molecular
target, BPD symptom presentation, and suicidal behavior. Based on findings we will pursue funding for a larger
PET study to test potential non-addictive KOR targeted medications for both overall BPD symptom reduction,
and suicide risk."
10898921,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Current immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint blockage therapy and adoptive T cell therapy, have
resulted in promising results in certain types of cancer patients. However, these immunotherapies have so far
been insufficient to reproducibly eliminate tumors. It is clear that tumor-reactive T cells are suppressed and
dysfunctional in the suppressive tumor microenvironment that is a major obstacle for successful tumor
immunotherapy. Thus, dissecting the distinct mechanisms responsible for T cell dysfunctional states within the
suppressive tumor microenvironment should provide novel avenues for tumor immunotherapy.
 We discovered that induction of T cell senescence is an important T cell dysfunctional state and a novel
suppressive mechanism utilized by both human naturally occurring and tumor-derived regulatory T (Treg) cells
in the tumor microenvironment. In fact, significant accumulation of senescent CD8+ T cells has also been found
in the tumor-infiltrating T cells (TILs) from various types of cancer patients. Importantly, we found that these
senescent T cells are functionally suppressive and molecularly distinct from anergic and exhausted T cellsand
that they are a critical mediator and amplifier for immune suppression within the tumor microenvironments.
Therefore, a better understanding of this novel suppressive mechanism and the molecular processes in
responder T cells suppressed by Treg cells is essential for the development of effective strategies to treat
human cancers. Cellular energy metabolism directs T cell survival, proliferation and their specific functions.
Different T cell subsets have different metabolic profiles. We have more recently identified that Treg-induced
senescent T cells exhibit active lipid metabolism, resulting in upregulation of lipid metabolic enzymes and
secretory lipid species, and accumulation of lipid droplets (LDs). The central hypotheses of this proposal are
that: 1) Excessive lipid metabolism is critical for senescence development and immunosuppression of effector
T cells mediated by Treg cells; 2) Senescent and dysfunctional tumor-specific T cells can be rejuvenated via
lipid reprogramming for enhanced anti-tumor immunity. Specific Aim 1 seeks to identify whether the excessive
lipid metabolism is involved in senescence development and immunosuppression of T cells induced by Treg
cells. Specific Aim 2 will explore the novel concept and develop effective strategies to overcome senescent
and exhausted tumor-specific T cells via lipid metabolism reprogramming combined with selective checkpoint
blockage therapy of anti-PDL1 for enhanced anti-tumor efficiency in the adoptive T cell transfer therapy tumor
models. The positive outcome of these studies should lead to novel strategies to reprogram lipid metabolism
and effector functions of tumor-specific T cells for cancer treatments."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a global crisis facing the aging population and society as a whole. With the number
of people living with AD predicted to rise dramatically in the coming decades, it is imperative to pursue research
that aims to reduce the expected incidence of dementia, such as identifying modifiable risk factors for lifestyle
interventions. A prerequisite to establishing lifestyle interventions is demonstrating a causal effect of the
proposed exposure (a risk factor) on AD or AD endophenotypes. The overarching objective of this research
program is to enhance our understanding of the causal relationships underlying Alzheimer’s disease by
utilizing genetically informed causal inference methods. We will use state-of-the-art techniques in
statistical genetics that exploit the polygenic risk scoring (PRS) and Mendelian randomization (MR)
approaches. PRS provide an estimate of an individual's genetic propensity to a trait and can be used to infer
genetic overlap between phenotypes via predicting one phenotype from the PRS of another. The first aim will
identify traits that have a shared genetic etiology with AD outcomes by conducting a phenome-wide PRS
analysis. This will prioritize putative disease-modifying traits for AD outcomes. The second aim will conduct an
MR phenome-wide association study to identify novel risk factors for AD that have not been identified using
previous epidemiological approaches, while prioritizing hypotheses identified in the current literature (e.g.
vascular health). MR uses genetic variants as proxies for exposures to provide an estimate of the causal
association between an intermediate exposure and an outcome and conceptually similar to a ‘genetic
randomized control trial’ due to the random allocation of genotypes from parents to offspring. In the final aim,
PRS and MR will be used to determine if individual risk factors differentially contribute to the development of AD
in at-risk subgroups by performing sex, ancestry, age, and APOE ε4 stratified analyses to identify subgroup-
specific risk profiles and predictors. The proposed research will elucidate the risk factors underlying AD, which
will have a significant impact on the development of lifestyle interventions to prevent AD and may explain
differences in risk by sex and ancestry. Under the guidance of his mentor Dr. Alison Goate and co-mentor Dr.
Kristine Yaffe, and a team of other advisors, Dr. Andrews will pursue a rigorous training program to accomplish
the aims of this award and to develop into an independent researcher. This training will focus on developing
skills in (1) causal inference, (2) big data analytics, (3) computational genomics, and (4) professional
development. Development in these domains will be accomplished via coursework, attendance at conferences
and workshops, gaining experience in providing mentoring and leading teams, and regular feedback from his
advisory committee. Overall, the proposed study addresses a crucial and timely unmet need, and the additional
skills developed during this award will provide a strong foundation for the candidate to establish independent
leadership in the genetic epidemiology of Alzheimer’s disease."

 Alcohol use disorder (AUD) may result from profound dysregulations of affective valence
processing in brain circuits. Repeated episodes of binge drinking can alter positive and negative valence
processing and result in enhanced appetitive drives to seek and drink alcohol and the emergence of
aversive symptoms, respectively. This research proposal aims to understand how repeated binge drinking
alters neural coding and plasticity correlated with behavioral changes in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), a
well-known brain area for valence coding, and its afferents from the anterior insular cortex (aIC), a core area
for interoception. These aims will be empirically pursued using a combination of an alcohol operant self-
administration paradigm, behavioral assays for anxiety measurement, and a “drinking-in-the-dark”
procedure. Here, experiments will functionally and molecularly identify neuronal populations within the aIC-
BLA circuits that participate in alcohol drinking and determine how repeated binge drinking affects these
neurons and leads to maladaptive affective behavior, such as enhanced alcohol seeking and anxiety-like
behavior.
 Supported by preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that repeated binge drinking differentially
alters the activity of valence coding amygdala neurons (Thy1+), in part, through the synaptic plasticity of
aIC-amygdala projections, resulting in alcohol-related enhanced appetitive and aversive behavior. Aim one
will use in vivo calcium imaging and optogenetic approaches to determine the role of BLA valence coding in
repeated binge drinking-induced behavioral plasticity. In the second aim, we plan to investigate synaptic
plasticity in the aIC afferents to the BLA valance coding neurons that contribute to the persistent motivation
for alcohol intake after repeated episodes of binge alcohol drinking. This work will uncover changes in
overlapping, intersecting or parallel valence coding systems in the aIC-BLA circuits that are critical for the
development of maladaptive affective behaviors by repeated excessive alcohol drinking. The proposed
experimental work portrays a neural circuit-oriented and highly translational investigation of AUD-associated
symptoms."

Current treatment for Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), the most common malignant brain tumor in adults,
involves maximal safe resection, followed by adjuvant chemoradiation. Although this treatment is life prolonging,
it is never curative. Five year survival is less than 7 %1 and improved therapies are urgently needed. In this
proposal, we aim to develop a new targeted therapy with reduced toxicity and increased efficacy for GBM patients
by leveraging nanotechnology discoveries in our laboratory to improve adoptive cell therapy. Chimeric Antigen
Receptor (CAR) T cells combine the cytolytic potency of a T cell with the tumor specificity of an antibody. Recent
clinical trial experiences of CAR T cells in solid tumors have identified the immune-suppressive tumor
microenvironment (TME) as a major barrier to clinical success2-4. One immune-suppressive endogenous
negative regulator in GBM TME is TGFβ, which has been identified as barrier to CAR T tumor eradication. Small
molecule inhibitors of the TGFβ receptor as well as TGFβ resistant CAR T cells have been developed and tested
clinically, however they are limited due to systemic toxicity. Herein we propose developing a platform technology
to drug-load CAR T cells with nanocarriers, thus enhancing the therapeutic window of CAR T cells, and
addressing one of the major obstacles to CAR T cells in brain tumors."
10878937,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Treatment-related cardiomyopathy/heart failure (CHF) is a leading cause of premature morbidity in childhood
cancer survivors. Given the widespread use of anthracycline and related cardiotoxic chemotherapeutics, and in
combination with radiotherapy exposure to the chest, over half of long-term survivors of childhood cancer are at
significantly increased risk of early CHF compared with an age-matched general population. Currently, national
and international consensus guidelines recommend the routine use of 2-dimensional (2D) echocardiography to
screen this high-risk population for early signs of CHF, in particular, left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction and
changes in LV geometry. At present, 2D echocardiography represents the standard of care across the US given
its widespread availability, relatively lower cost, and avoidance of ionizing radiation or sedation. Nevertheless,
limitations of 2D echocardiography include greater intra-patient and inter-observer variability. As a result, current
echocardiography-based surveillance continues to have limited sensitivity and often requires serial studies
before a patient is identified as having a potential abnormality. Although there is insufficient evidence to guide
CHF management specific to pediatric cancer survivors, the evidence for non-cancer-related cardiomyopathy in
both children and adults suggests that earlier intervention can mitigate or delay CHF progression. Therefore,
methods that improve the detection of early CHF in childhood cancer survivors may have important clinical
implications. Deep learning (DL), a subfield of machine learning, can automatically extract patterns from large
unstructured datasets, such as medical images, and is increasingly being utilized in medicine for disease
diagnosis as well as disease onset and outcome prediction. We propose to leverage a unique imaging dataset
we have assembled from the Children’s Oncology Group (COG), a part of the NCI-sponsored National Clinical
Trials Network and Community Oncology Research Program, to explore the potential of DL for enhanced
detection of CHF. We have longitudinal echocardiographic data on over 100 survivors of childhood cancer who
developed CHF and over 350 who did not, all defined using standardized criteria, representing an imaging
repository of >3000 individual echocardiograms (and growing). Using this extant and clinically annotated dataset,
we propose to: 1) Using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), identify the optimal process for a DL-
based assessment of CHF in pediatric cancer survivors; and 2) Assess the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of
DCNN-based prediction of cardiomyopathy onset from pre-CHF diagnosis echocardiograms. Expected results
include the development of a DCNN that will differentiate between abnormal and normal echocardiograms from
pediatric cancer survivors with and without CHF, respectively. After optimization, we will conduct a preliminary
efficacy analysis to determine how many years in advance a survivor's transition to CHF can be predicted using
an optimized DCNN."
11087259,"BRAIN GLUCOSE DEFICIENCY: MECHANISMS AND MODULATION. ABSTRACT
Biochemical principles and experimental and clinical observations support the centrality of glucose metabolism
to brain function. In this context, diagnostic positron emission tomography applied to several categories of
neurological disorders such as dementia or epilepsy has long made patent reductions in glucose accumulation
in certain brain areas. However, this is not necessarily synonymous with similar reductions in downstream
metabolic flux and neural excitation. In fact, endogenous alternative fueling and hyperexcitability are often
observed in these diseases. In this proposal, we will develop the metabolic and neurophysiological means to
clarify this apparent excitability paradox by using Glucose transporter I (GLUT1) deficiency (G1D) as a model
system. The conceptual framework rests on 3 postulates applicable to an increasing number of disorders: 1)
metabolic failure results in preferential inhibitory (relative to excitatory) neuron dysfunction, which alters specific
neural circuit activities; 2) these mechanisms can be non-invasively observed at play in afflicted persons and 3)
they may be metabolically modulated for therapeutic gain. To test the postulates, we will first characterize the
interrelation between metabolism and excitability in a G1D mouse model. With this information, we will then
measure flux downstream from glucose to neurotransmitters in conjunction with neurophysiological activity in
persons. A team approach will harmonize the progression of mechanisms and results across the biological
scale spanning from molecular flux and interconversions to cells, the thalamocortical circuit, behaving mice and
the human brain. The team is indispensable because each of our investigational aims is fulfilled by more than
one of our laboratories, with the results obtained from each experimental method informing the rest of the studies.
Because the methods are inherently sensitive to flux rather than simple abundance, we will evaluate two flux
ratios that describe the overall neurophysiological and metabolic states of the G1D brain: 1) LGR (low to gamma
frequency electrical oscillation ratio) and 2) GOI (blood glucose oxidation by the brain TCA cycle index).
Translation will be achieved via a Basic Experimental Study with Humans that will test whether GOI reflects
disease severity. We will further test GOI and LGR in a Mechanistic Trial that will utilize a mechanism-testing
framework broadly applicable to metabolic interventions. The trial will investigate red blood cell exchange (i.e.,
the replacement of human G1D circulating red cells, which are deficient in GLUT1) with healthy donor cells as a
novel means to augment blood-to-brain glucose transport. The proposal benefits from structured management,
timed benchmarks and Plans for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives and Data Sharing that leverage and extend
extensive institutional and G1D Foundation resources. If successful, our approach will provide the conceptual
and methodological groundwork to transform the evaluation or treatment assessment of other thalamocortical
disorders and the mechanistic analysis of metabolic treatments in types of dementia and epilepsy."
10880707,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite the durable suppression of viral replication by ART, HIV persists indefinitely in infected individuals.
Several promising avenues to cure HIV-1 infection have come to light, including gene editing of the CCR5
receptor in CD4 T cells, anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody immunotherapy and the infusion of broadly neutralizing
antibodies. These therapeutic approaches constitute a prime opportunity to extensively understand the
underlying mechanisms associated with the establishment and maintenance of the HIV reservoir, which will
ultimately serve to identify key novel targets for future more refined therapies. Furthermore, the heterogeneity in
human immune function has been mapped to multiple environmental factors such as microbiome, metabolome
and diet, some of which have been associated with the maintenance of the HIV-1 reservoir. In this P01, we
hypothesize that specific key metabolites, microbes and other environmental factors influence the
responsiveness to different therapeutic approaches targeting the HIV reservoir. The main objective of the
Machine Learning and Modeling Core (MLMC) will be to bring together all datasets generated by Projects
1-3 into a cohesive whole to generate mechanistic models of HIV reservoir maintenance. We shall look
into how metabolites modulate the immune transcriptome and epigenome of many subsets. In Aim 1, the MLMC
will provide statistical and bioinformatics support for all projects and identify key correlates of HIV viral rebound
and HIV DNA decay from all large-scale datasets (OMICs). In Aim 2, the MLMC will perform integrative analysis
using novel datasets generated in Aim 1. In Aim 3, the Core will integrate parallel models of regulation of the
HIV reservoir into a global unified model where key recurrent features will be identified as prime targets for future
therapeutic avenues. The MLMC will thus serve as the central resource for this U19 for the integration of all
datasets and generation of mechanistic insights."
10880710,"ABSTRACT - PROJECT 1
Despite antiretroviral treatment (ART) induced viral suppression and gradual decay of the HIV reservoir, PLWH
harbor thousands to millions of latently infected CD4+ T cells containing replication competent proviruses,
regardless of the duration of ART. Clinical intervention trials aiming to eliminate the HV reservoir have shown
that triggering HIV reactivation without boosting innate or adaptive immunity fails to reduce the size of the HIV
reservoir. Preliminary data obtained by Dr. Søgaard have shown that priming of specific effector cells, i.e.,
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells, enhance their ability to eliminate infected cells,
combined with the infusion of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against conserved viral proteins will
facilitate clearance of HIV infected cells through FcγR-dependent mechanisms. We and others have shown that
gut dysbiosis observed in PLWH modulate the circulating microbiome and metabolome; these impact on
successful immune reconstitution post infusion of therapeutic Abs in cancer and HIV infection. In this project we
have obtained samples from a clinical trial of 45 virologically suppressed subjects treated with an engager of
innate immunity (TLR 9 agonist) and HIV specific bNAbs. We will test the hypothesis that targeting innate
immunity will enhance the HIV specific adaptive immune response and as well result in a state of refractoriness
to the infection of new target cells upon ATI. We propose three highly integrated and complementary aims. Aim
1 will identify virological features pre-intervention that are associated with delays in viral load rebound and
enhanced immune control. In Aim 2, we will identify innate immune antiviral mechanisms triggered by TLR-9 and
by Ab/Fc receptor engagement that induce an antiviral immune response that limits viral dissemination and pro-
inflammatory immune responses through efficacious adaptive T and B cell responses. Aim 3 will identify the
innate immune mechanisms triggered by the microbiome and the metabolome pre-intervention that modulate
the immune responses associated control viral during the ATI. Execution of these aims will rely on state-of-the-
art assays that measure virological features (i.e., integration sites, translation competence and integrity of viral
sequences), immunological and epigenetic features of pro-inflammatory innate immune responses. These in
turn are associated with adaptive immune responses that control levels of viral reactivation and time to viral
rebound post immune intervention. The data generated will enable us to explore synergies of innate and adaptive
immune mechanisms that contribute to virological control and the delay of viral rebound during ATI."
10731377,"The overall goals of this project are to recruit and characterize a VA-based cohort of veterans with post-
9/11 southwest Asia, Afghanistan, and Djibouti (SWAAD) deployment with and without deployment-related
lung diseases (DLD) such as asthma, bronchiolitis, and other small airways/distal airways disease and to
identify clinical markers to accurately diagnose and monitor longitudinal lung function and health outcomes.
This approach will lay the groundwork for future research efforts to identify treatment/management strategies
to improve the health of United States veterans, understand and reduce disability, and avoid costly and
unnecessary medical testing.
 Nearly three million military men and women have deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, and other southwest
Asia locations since 2001 as a part of several major military operations. The major ones include Operation
Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS) in Afghanistan as well as Operation Iraqi
Freedom (OIF), Operation New Dawn (OND) and Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) in Iraq. Deployment to
these regions is associated with exposure to complex inhalational hazards that may include burn pit/trash-
burning emissions, desert dust, diesel particulates, and combat dust. Previous studies have demonstrated links
between these exposures and post-9/11 deployment-related asthma and small airways/distal lung diseases
such as bronchiolitis. Several studies have shown that DLD diagnosis often is challenging using conventional
diagnostic tools, and long-term prognosis of DLD is unknown. Previously, our deployment lung disease
research team demonstrated that newer techniques such as the lung clearance index (LCI) test may have a
role in disease detection as a noninvasive marker of deployment-related distal lung disease. LCI testing may
be more sensitive in detection of deployment-related distal lung diseases (DDLD) such as bronchiolitis than
traditional diagnostic testing that includes pulmonary function testing, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and
chest imaging with computerized tomography. Thus, LCI also may be a more sensitive test to monitor
longitudinal lung function in those with DLD that was missed by traditional lung function testing but detected by
lung biopsy (the goal-standard diagnostic method for lung disease).
 Our study hypothesis is that post-9/11 southwest Asia and Afghanistan veterans with DLD will have
longer deployment duration, lower diffusion capacity (e.g. abnormal diffusion/possible gas exchange
abnormalities) on lung function testing, exhibit clinical biomarkers of increased cell activation and inflammation,
and have worse longitudinal respiratory health outcomes (decline in lung function) compared to post-9/11
southwest Asia and Afghanistan veterans without DLD. We anticipate that LCI testing will be a useful early
marker of distal lung injury in deployers and will correlate with abnormalities on surgical lung biopsy better than
spirometry. We also hypothesize that LCI will be more sensitive in detecting abnormal lung function decline
than conventional pulmonary function testing (PFT) in deployers with DLD.
 This study should help inform a standardized approach to managing symptomatic post-9/11 veterans in
the larger VA system, where consistent evaluation and care is currently lacking. The clinical characterization of
DLD in veterans and the establishment of a biorepository of blood and lung tissue in a cohort that is clinically
phenotyped will lay the groundwork for evidence-based treatment and care. Furthermore, assembling this well-
characterized cohort of post-9/11 veterans with and without DLD will provide a foundation for future clinical
translational studies that will include clinical trials/interventions as well as longitudinal health outcomes
research that may yield novel and accurate methods of diagnosis and treatment for veterans with DLD."
10731378,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most prominent cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with
chronic kidney disease (CKD), and end stage kidney disease (ESKD). Unfortunately at the present time, we do
not have an effective treatment to reduce the high CVD mortality in these populations. Accelerated
atherosclerosis, inflammation, and vascular stiffness are prominent factors contributing to CVD in CKD.
Interventions that can effectively counter these factors may provide significant benefits for the management of
CVD in CKD. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an inexpensive and safe anti-inflammatory drug that has been in
clinical use for over 4 decades even in patients with CKD and ESKD. In recent times, multiple in vitro, in vivo,
and human cohort based data have shown that HCQ benefits multiple parameters of CVD, including
inflammation, endothelial function, metabolic syndrome, insulin sensitivity and atherosclerosis. Recently we
through our animal validated that HCQ indeed has significant anti-atherosclerosis and vasculoprotective effects
in CKD milieu. We further conducted a small, human, feasibility study that shows a potential for HCQ on
parameters relevant to CVD in CKD.
 The next step requires evaluation of HCQ's role for the treatment of CVD in CKD. However, in the absence
of a universally agreed-on surrogate for CVD, a proof-of-concept clinical study needed to validate the anti-
atherosclerosis and vasculoprotective potential of HCQ in CKD. We propose such a study that will enroll 90
albuminuric, stage 3b CKD subjects in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 1:1 allocation (HCQ : placebo),
stratified by their diabetes status, and treat for a duration of 18 months. We will examine the effects of HCQ on
structural, functional, and biochemical measures of atherosclerosis and CVD.
Specific Aim (SA) 1 will evaluate the ability of HCQ, compared to placebo, to slow the progression, or reverse
atherosclerosis. We will evaluate the progression of carotid atherosclerosis with a non-contrast MRI performed
at baseline and after 9 and 18 months of treatment with HCQ or placebo. The primary outcome measure will
be change in total carotid plaque volume (TPV). Secondary outcome measures will be changes over time in
total plaque surface area, maximal stenosis, and the type (fibrous, stable, or unstable), and stability of plaques.
Specific Aim 2: will evaluate the extent to which HCQ can affect inflammation (SA2a), and vascular stiffness
(SA2b) in CKD. We will examine the effects of HCQ and placebo at baseline, and at 6, 9, 12, and 18 months
on the secondary outcome measures of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (SA2a) and aortic pulse wave
velocity (SA2b).
 Though the sample size and power calculations have been designed for the primary outcome (SA1), we
will have adequate power to evaluate meaningful impacts of HCQ on the secondary outcomes in SA2.
Specific Aim 3 will examine the effect of HCQ and placebo on the trends of hard cardiac and renal outcomes
and drug safety. While not powered to detect the differences in the rates of these clinical events, trends in
outcomes, drug safety, and tolerability are mandatory and will assist in the planning of the future, definitive
RCT.
 If the results of this trial are positive with a favorable AE profile, it will provide critical preliminary data to
justify and plan a definitive, multicenter RCT to examine the effects of HCQ on hard outcomes of CVD in CKD.
Additionally, this study may provide insights into the importance of select inflammatory and vascular factors in
CVD with wider future implications for those with CKD and perhaps the general population."
10904985,"Summary
Because cancer immunotherapy constitutes one of the most transformative therapeutic movements over the
history of cancer treatment, there are now hundreds, if not thousands, of ongoing clinical trials in this field.
Despite the remarkable success for a subset of patients, there are substantial gaps in our knowledge. No more
than 30% of patients respond to immune checkpoint blockade and related therapies, many responding patients
develop therapeutic resistance, and many responding and non-responding patients suffer from immune-related
toxicities. There is a clear need to identify critical biomarkers of response, resistance, and toxicity. To improve
our ability to meet this challenge, the NCI-sponsored Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center (CIMAC)
program was created to enable consistent and comparable interrogation of patient biospecimens across multiple
clinical trials. The program has successfully established a common set of assays harmonized across the four
CIMACs, augmented this basic set with more specialized tests that may be CIMAC-specific but are still
accessible across institutions, deployed these tools across dozens of phase I/II immunotherapy trials, and
generated a pool of standardized data to facilitate inter-trial comparisons. The CIMAC created at Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute (DFCI) built on the existing Center of Immuno-Oncology (CIO) and the long-standing
collaboration with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. The DFCI/Broad CIMAC, joining with the other
CIMACS, now proposes to continue the network mission to compare tumor and immune response features of
individual cancer types treated by multiple immunotherapeutic modalities and multiple cancer types treated by a
single immunotherapeutic modality in order to dissect common and individualized mechanisms of action. One
driving motivation for this renewal application is that the power to identify biomarkers increases with the number
of clinical trials analyzed. Thus, Aim 1 focuses on deploying the suite of assays established over the past five
years to biospecimens collected from additional innovative immunotherapy clinical trials to standardize biomarker
analysis and interpretation. To broaden the scope of parameters being examined, Aim 2 proposes to develop
and verify performance for novel and more complex assays to expand the network capabilities and advance
discovery. Of particular value will be methods that improve multiomic single cell profiling, multiomic spatial
analysis, and immunopeptidome characterization. Aim 3 addresses the challenge of integrating multiomic data
across an increasing number of clinical trials by building novel computational tools that can efficiently process
massive amounts of data and generate interpretable representations of the results. Altogether, these efforts will
support the role of immuno-oncology in the personalized treatment of cancer because only by the analyses of
large well-annotated datasets can we identify links between biology, molecular markers and clinical response."

For the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) Study renewal, we will continue to follow our existing cohort,
and will recruit children between 14 and 17 years of age to enhance the power of the study to characterize the
decline of kidney function and the development of cardiovascular disease as they transition to young adulthood.
Remote data collection will be coordinated and conducted through national laboratory contractors who can
assess vitals and obtain labs in the participant’s home. Data will be obtained between CKiD study visits by
conducting data extraction through electronic health records. The Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)
system will be leveraged to allow automated reporting for coordination and clinical activities and improve options
for harmonization with external cohorts including CureGN and NEPTUNE. Most importantly, it will enable the
study to collect data through web-based entry by computer or mobile phone directly by participants.
Important research questions will include (a) methods to identify risk factors for decline in kidney function during
childhood through young adulthood including acceleration of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline during
puberty and the effect of acute kidney injury (AKI) on chronic kidney disease (CKD); (b) statistical-based machine
learning prediction methodology to characterize the joint predictive value of clinical markers and social
determinants of disease progression for individualized inference; (c) analytic strategies to describe risk factors
for cardiovascular changes and outcomes via home blood pressure monitoring and assessing cardiac and
vascular target organ damage, including characterizing changes in biomarkers like trajectories of indicators of
metabolic bone health; (d) statistical methods to validate and refine GFR equations in young adulthood for
consistent estimates during the transition from pediatric to adult care; and (e) methods to assess effects of
therapies and exposures on outcomes including constructs of social function and emotional well-being."
10908640,"Optical monitoring of brain activities is intrinsically associated with various operational advantages,
including low-cost and portable noninvasive bedside continuous monitoring capabilities. While the preva-
lent optical brain monitoring methods are based on measuring blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)
signals from blood absorption, optical methods measuring cerebral blood flow (CBF) from the decor-
relation of coherent light when scattered by the blood flow may provide a promising alternative. CBF
measurement has higher sensitivity to the brain and is complementary to BOLD signals. Their combi-
nation can provide a more precise picture of neural activity and may be, for example, used to compute
the metabolic oxygen uptake rate in the brain. Noninvasive CBF measurement is also instrumental for
functional neuroimaging of the human brain for cerebrovascular health, cognitive aging, and neuroin-
tensive care. However, the current optical CBF detection methods, such as diffusion correlation spec-
troscopy (DCS), laser speckle-based imaging, and their variants, are prone to extracerebral contami-
nation. They are limited in depth sensitivity relying on the distribution of the photon paths. For this R21
project, we propose to develop and evaluate a novel CBF measurement method, known as ultrasonic-
tagged remote interferometric flowmetry (URIF), for the task of high sensitivity and selectivity brain activ-
ity monitoring. URIF is substantially different from current optical CBF methods. Whereas current optical
CBF methods measure an integrated signal from all optical paths in which the signal photons that have
passed through the brain activity site are overwhelmed by non-signal photons that have not, URIF se-
lects and coherently amplifies only the signal photons through ultrasonic tagging and heterodyne detec-
tion. More importantly, with a novel theoretical and experimental framework, URIF can quantify the local
CBF at the millimeter-size brain activity site at depths reaching one centimeter and beyond, removing ex-
tracerebral contamination and significantly enhancing depth sensitivity, selectivity, and spatial resolution.
Local absorption variation associated with hemodynamics can also be monitored simultaneously. We
propose first to develop URIF using single-shot off-axis holography and then numerically and experimen-
tally validate URIF on human brain phantoms. The performance metrics of URIF for measuring deep
flow will be determined in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and selectivity. If successful, the technology will
pave a novel avenue for remote flowmetry of brain activity and fill a vital measurement gap that existing
optical and non-optical methods have not been able to address."

Successful kidney transplant reverses many of the chronic abnormalities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and
has shown to improve not only quality of life but also patient survival compared to renal replacement therapy. It
is vital to identify strategies that improve and prolong organ function. APOL1 risk alleles have been shown to
explain in part the increased risk of African Americans compared to non-African American for end-stage kidney
disease. However, the association of APOL1 alleles with kidney transplant outcomes such as deterioration of
kidney function, acute rejection, and allograft loss as well as living donor health is unclear. APOL1 genotyping
has the potential to reduce the discard of good-quality kidneys from AA donors and increase the number of
transplants overall. We are responding to RFA-DK-22-506 – “APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation
Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Clinical Centers”, to continue as a clinical center that builds upon the
accomplishments of our established multidisciplinary research group in the first phase. As a successful
recruitment site with our aligned 19 transplant programs, the proposal builds upon an established infrastructure
and our experience recruiting APOLLO participants. In Phase 1 of APOLLO, we have successfully consented
156 kidney transplant recipients and 12 living donors, with DNA on hand in 151 recipients (97%) and 12 donors
(100%), across these centers.
We propose to collect long-term follow-up data on all APOLLO participants. (Aim 1); to provide detailed clinical
data and biospecimens on APOLLO participants from our CC providing unique data not available in national
registries: kidney biopsy results, acute rejection types and treatment, recurrent disease, changes in
immunosuppression, medical compliance, bacterial and viral infections, proteinuria, creatinine and donor
specific HLA antibodies, among others (Aim 2); and to facilitate return of APOL1 genotype results to
participants (Aim 3). We are committed to collaborative protocol development, sharing best practices, and
team science to achieve the APOLLO’s objectives. The APOLLO network has established a high-quality
resource (data and specimen repository of blood, urine, DNA, and RNA) for future basic, clinical and
translational research in transplantation. The proposed research plan will have future diagnostic, prognostic
and therapeutic implications. In addition, it could have policy implications as kidneys may need to be allocated
in the future taking into account the donor APOL1 genotype. The proposed research plan, by improving our
understanding of the impact of APOL1 gene in kidney transplantation, has the potential to dramatically impact
public health and diminish kidney discards for transplantation."

Mechanistic understanding of living things requires our understanding of how proteins and DNA interact
together to generate functional chromosomes. This understanding is central to preserving human health,
dealing with genetic disorders, and fighting pathogenic organisms. The proposed projects are focused on
single-molecule analyses which permit direct visualization of biomolecule interactions, and can be used to
analyze protein-DNA interactions in detail. The aims of the proposal include careful study of a facilitated
dissociation ""exchange"" mechanism for removal of proteins from DNA that suggests a major revision of
conventional descriptions of protein turnover on DNA, and which will affect a wide range of studies of gene
regulatory and chromosome structural proteins. The second and third aims are focused on study of
mechanisms of large ""Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes"" (SMC) protein complexes which mediate the
folding of chromosomes in eukaryote cells. The second aim concerns understanding the mechanics of
compaction and DNA substrate selection by the Smc5/6 complex, which plays a key role in separating
replicated chromosomes from one another during cell division, while the third aim concerns direct microscopy
observation of the mechanism by which Smc5/6 compacts DNA. The second and third aim will also include
side-by-side comparisons of Smc5/6 and the more well-understood condensin complex. The highly
mechanistic analyses of DNA processing machinery that are proposed will give us a stronger understanding of
how cells interpret, fold and change their genomes, leading to a better understanding of pathologies where
those functions are impaired, and better understanding of how to target those functions in pathogenic
organisms."

disrupt prostaglandin and angiogenic function during the critical period of ovulation. Further, rescue approaches
will be investigated to alleviate phthalate-induced inhibition of ovulation and fertility, which is crucial for
environmental and reproductive health as exposure to phthalates is unavoidable. Phthalates are incorporated in
several common consumer, medical, housing, and personal care products leading to daily human exposure.
However, little is known about the effects of environmentally relevant levels and mixtures of phthalates on
ovulation, especially in women. This is alarming because defects in ovulation are the leading cause of female
infertility. The abundant increase of prostaglandins in the ovary and the surge of new vasculature formation, via
angiogenesis, are vital for ovulation and fertility. Preliminary data for this proposal are the first to show that an
environmentally relevant phthalate mixture decreases the levels of prostaglandins and factors that drive
angiogenesis in human and mouse ovarian samples. Further, the phthalate mixture decreased ovulation rates
by 96% in mouse samples. These findings suggest that environmentally relevant phthalate exposure targets
ovulatory prostaglandin and angiogenic action, which may cause infertility. Our compelling preliminary data also
suggest that supplementation with cyclic adenosine monophosphate, a common cell signaling molecule, to
human ovarian cells may rescue the phthalate-induced decreases in ovulatory prostaglandin and angiogenic
factor levels. A major strength of this proposal is our ability to mimic human exposure to phthalates by the use
of environmentally relevant phthalate mixtures and human ovarian models. These models, as well as in vivo and
in vitro mouse models, will be used to test the hypothesis that phthalates inhibit ovulatory prostaglandin
production and function, leading to impaired angiogenesis and ovulatory failure/infertility. Specific Aim 1 will
elucidate the mechanism by which phthalates decrease ovulatory prostaglandin levels. Specific Aim 2 will
determine the deficiencies in angiogenesis, ovulation, and fertility caused by phthalates. Specific Aim 3 will define
approaches to alleviate phthalate toxicity. These findings will advance environmental health sciences by
providing mechanistic data establishing the impact of environmentally relevant phthalate mixture exposure on
prostaglandin and angiogenic function, which are essential mediators for fertility. Thus, these findings will reveal
novel actions of phthalates on infertility and reproductive dysfunction. Additionally, the use of human samples
and the establishment of rescue approaches provide a translational approach to understanding and mitigating
phthalate toxicities. Infertility in women seeking to conceive leads to a decreased quality of life, including
increased levels of stress, diminished social functioning, and mental and physical health issues. By delineating
the detrimental impacts of phthalate exposure on ovulation and fertility, the overarching goal of this proposal is
to provide a foundation to benefit women’s reproductive and general healthcare."
10738720,"Endogenous glucocorticoids are critical for normal bone physiology. However, glucocorticoid excess, due
to systemic administration or syndromes such as Cushing’s disease, causes osteopenia and metabolic
disorder. Overall, glucocorticoid receptor signaling must be tightly controlled for optimal bone health. We
identified microRNA-433 (miR-433) as negative regulator of glucocorticoid signaling in the osteoblast lineage.
In vitro, inhibition of miR-433 activity made mesenchymal cells more responsive to glucocorticoids and
increased glucocorticoid receptor residence in the nucleus, suggesting that miR-433 may target mechanisms
designed to limit the responsiveness of cells to glucocorticoid signaling.
 In addition to effects on glucocorticoid signaling, miR-433 is a negative regulator of osteoblastic
differentiation. miR-433 decreases as osteoblast differentiation progresses, and inhibition of miR-433 activity
increases osteoblastic maker gene expression. To better understand the function of miR-433 in bone, we
generated transgenic mice expressing a miR-433 competitive inhibitor (tough decoy) in osteoblastic cells.
Calvarial bone from the miR-433 decoy mice has increased mRNA for osteocalcin and the direct miR-433
target Runx2. Further, miR-433 decoy mice display increased trabecular and cortical bone thickness due to
increased bone formation, although molecular mechanisms remain to be identified.
 We propose to test the hypothesis that miR-433 targets genes and pathways critical for osteoblastogenesis
and for limiting glucocorticoid receptor signaling.
 In Aim 1, we will comprehensively characterize the skeletal phenotype of both male and female miR-433
decoy mice in maturity and aging. We will also identify miR-433 targets using a non-biased approach, to better
understand how miR-433 regulates osteoblast biology. In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanisms by which
miR-433 limits glucocorticoid responsiveness at a molecular level, as well as determining the impact of miR-
433 on the response of bone to exogenous glucocorticoids excess.
Overall Impact: miR-433 is a novel negative of both glucocorticoid responsiveness and osteoblast
differentiation. Glucocorticoid excess is the most common secondary cause of osteopenia, and tissue
sensitivity to glucocorticoids is regulated by multiple mechanisms. Understanding the interaction between
osteoblastogenesis and glucocorticoid signaling is critical for the design of novel strategies to limit the adverse
effects of glucocorticoid excess on the skeleton."
10738721,"Adverse outcomes, such as aggressive behavior, risk-taking, and suicide, associated with Posttraumatic Stress
Disorder (PTSD) are an ongoing public health concern in Veteran populations. However, PTSD-related impulsive
behavior has only recently become a major clinical research interest. Theoretical models suggest a link between
PTSD and impulsivity. Cognitive neuroscience research indicates that impulsivity can be represented by two
subdomains: cognitive impulsivity (also called choice impulsivity) or elevated sensitivity to immediate
gratification and behavioral impulsivity (also called rapid response impulsivity) or difficulties with behavioral
inhibition. Where cognitive impulsivity is associated with adverse outcomes such as risky sexual behavior and
substance abuse, behavioral impulsivity is associated with violent outbursts and intimate partner violence.
Research suggests that cognitive and behavioral impulsivity may have separate neuropathological origins. For
example, cognitive impulsivity appears to be linked to two neurofunctional abnormalities: 1) an underperforming
self-control network that extends from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) to the dorsal striatum and 2)
an oversensitive reward network, which extends from ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) to ventral
striatum. On the other hand, behavioral impulsivity appears to be associated with a reduced connectivity within
a right-lateralized inhibitory control pathway that extends from the right frontal region (right inferior frontal
cortex, right dlPFC) and passes through the right temporoparietal region.
Understanding how cognitive and behavioral impulsivity are linked to PTSD may provide a path for uncovering
the different ways impulsivity and its subdomains interact with PTSD-related adverse outcomes in Veterans.
Well validated, fMRI amenable tasks allow for the interrogation of separate cognitive and behavioral impulsivity
neurocircuit systems, which could be utilized to further understand PTSD neuropathology. For example,
temporal discounting (TD) tasks, which examine intertemporal choice between larger later reinforcers and
smaller sooner ones provide a simple yet quantifiable index of cognitive impulsivity. Similarly, go-no-go (GNG)
tasks have been shown to be effective in assessing behavioral impulsivity by examining the frequency of
commission errors (i.e. when a participant responds to no-go stimuli). However, investigations that have
examined the neuroactivation and functional connectivity that underlie PTSD – related impulsivity and its
subdomains in Veteran populations are sparse. Therefore, we aim to 1) use an fMRI TD task to examine the
functional neuroanatomical underpinnings of cognitive impulsivity in Veterans with PTSD and 2) use an fMRI
GNG task to examine the functional neuroanatomical underpinnings of behavioral impulsivity in Veterans with
elevated PTSD levels. Examining PTSD-related impulsivity within the context of broader neural network
dysfunction may lead to the development of novel, neurocircuit based, patient-centered treatments that are
tailored toward malleable cognitive and behavioral impulsivity-related targets linked to adverse health
outcomes for Veterans with PTSD."
10738754,"This application seeks support for a research-emphasis veterinarian embarking on an independent career as a
translational veterinarian-scientist. The applicant proposes to study macrophages as drivers of SARS-CoV2-
induced lung damage in humans and mouse models, and will develop novel indicator mice to report SARS-CoV2
cellular targets in mice. This multi-disciplinary approach brings together leading experts in lung biology,
macrophage biology, virology, mouse genetics and pulmonary pathology. At Cornell University College of
Veterinary Medicine, the applicant will perform research in the laboratories of Drs. David Russell and Dr. Hector
Aguilar-Carreño (Department of Microbiology and Immunology), with histopathology analyses performed in the
laboratory of Dr. Gerald Duhamel (Department of Biomedical Sciences). For specific hands-on training in lung
epithelial repair assays, the applicant will work in the laboratory of Dr. Carla Kim (Harvard Medical
School/Children’s Hospital Boston). Dr. Russell, primary mentor, is an expert in macrophage biology and their
interaction with several lung pathogens, notably M.tuberculosis and HIV. He has a proven track record in training
post-doctoral veterinarian-scientists that have gone on to tenure-track positions with federal research funding.
Dr. Aguilar-Carreño has published extensively on the entry and egress of enveloped viruses with emphasis on
paramyxoviruses, and recently has adapted his well-described mouse challenge platform for antiviral and
vaccine discovery, toward SARS-CoV2. Dr. Duhamel is a veterinary anatomic pathologist with a research focus

enthusiastic collaborators (with two practicing MD physicians), including leaders in mouse genetics and lung
injury (Drs. Kahn and Morrisey), hyaluronan biology (Dr. Hascall), and human pulmonary pathology (Dr.
Borczuk). The research environment at Cornell is exceptional in the disciplines of infectious disease and
comparative pathology, while the combined expertise of Drs. Kim and Borczuk adds a strong translational and
integrative focus on drivers of alveolar damage. The proposal will probe how resident and recruited
macrophages are dysregulated during SARS-CoV2 in mice, whether dependent on direct viral infection of
macrophages or on environmental cues. In Aim 1, reporter mice will be generated to identify SARS-CoV2-
infected cells during infection and upon asymptomatic recovery. During Aim 2, the nature of macrophage subsets
as viral targets will be studied, and their resulting functional deficits determined using assays developed by Dr.
Russell. In Aim 3, viral challenge studies in human Ace2-expressing mice will interrogate macrophages as drivers
of alveolar damage, and test whether macrophage interventions improve clinical outcomes in mice. The
candidate will begin this research as Senior Research Associate in the Department of Microbiology and
Immunology (75% research effort), with an expected junior faculty transition in the independent award phase."
10738804,"The multitude of mechanisms that lead to general break of tolerance and organ pathology in
patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have challenged both basic immunologists
and translational researchers. Infections remain one of the main causes of morbidity and
mortality among patients with SLE despite our significantly improved ability to diagnose and
treat infections early and efficiently.
Search for genes expressed in T cells from patients with SLE revealed CD38 to be associated
with more severe disease and extensive aberrant gene expression. CD8+CD38+ T cells were
found expanded in patients with SLE and to be strongly associated with increased infection
rates. CD8+CD38+ cells display compromised cytotoxic activity, less amounts of nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), decreased glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation and
decreased expression of molecules responsible for the performance of cytotoxic cell function.
In addition, inhibition of CD38 appeared to restore aspects of cytotoxic cell function.
The hypothesis which will guide the proposed studies is: increased expression of CD38 on
CD8+ cells in patients with SLE and lupus-prone mice compromises their cytotoxic activity and
predisposes to infections and drives autoimmunity. Three sets of experiments using human cells
and novel mice will be conducted to test the hypothesis. The first will determine how CD38
expression limits cytotoxicity in CD8 cells. The second will explore approaches to enhance
cytotoxic responses of SLE CD8+ cells including targeted delivery of drugs to T cells. Whereas,
in the third we will conduct a pilot prospective study to determine the value of CD38 expression
in identifying patients with SLE prone to infections.
The identification of the CD8+CD38+ T cell subset to be expanded in SLE patients and role of
CD38 in limiting their cytotoxic activity along with the design of new mice represent novel
concepts in the field of lupus. The search for approaches to restore their cytotoxic activity and
the clinical study to define them as a biomarker for SLE patients prone to infections represent
the translational value of this line of research."
10913612,"This is a continuation application for an additional 5 years of support for a comparative and prospective study of
Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), an inherited neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a trinucleotide expansion of
CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome. FXS results in significant health and functional
impairments that begin in early childhood and last a lifetime. It is the most common inherited cause of intellectual
disability and autism, with substantial family burden and public health impacts. Critically, the great majority of
knowledge about the FXS clinical phenotype derives from research on children, leaving adulthood a vast
uncharted territory. The purpose of the proposed research is to investigate how the health and behavioral
functioning of individuals with FXS change across adulthood and to identify factors that alleviate or worsen health
and behavioral functioning during the adult years. It will be the first study to robustly address these questions
beyond early adulthood. We address 3 Specific Aims. For Aim 1, we will determine profiles of health conditions
and health care utilization for adults with FXS. Using a case-control design, we propose to examine the health
of a newly ascertained cohort of 368 adults (age 18 to 80+) who have a code for FXS in their electronic health
records (EHRs) – 162 women, 206 men, 77 nonwhite, and 291 white. These adults will be drawn from 11 health
care systems comprising the Chicago Area Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (CAPriCORN). Using
EHRs, we will examine differences between adults with FXS and age- and sex-matched controls who do not
have FXS with respect to health and health care utilization. We will probe differences between sub-groups of
adults with FXS defined by age (early adulthood, midlife, older adulthood) as well as by sex and race. For Aim
2, using a longitudinal design that will span 18 years, we will define life course trajectories in health and
behavioral functioning among adults with FXS and investigate age-related risk. Building on the 5 already-
collected repeated measures, we will prospectively gather 3 additional rounds of data, resulting in up to 8
repeated measures over the 18-year period (n=182 dyads of adults with FXS and their premutation carrier
mothers). By the end of the proposed study, the adults in our existing longitudinal sample will average 37 years
of age, with 59% being age 35 or older (the oldest will be age 72). We will employ an accelerated longitudinal
design to elucidate changes in health, executive functioning, communication, behavior problems, and daily living
skills across adulthood. We will test for ages of increased risk and the effects of sex and autism on these
trajectories. For Aim 3, using the same sample as in Aim 2, we will examine how life course trajectories of adults
with FXS are associated with familial and social contextual determinants – family relationships, residential status
of the adult with FXS, educational level of parents, family income, type of health insurance, services, and
neighborhood SES. By employing multiple innovative methods and varied data sources, the proposed study will
extend knowledge about FXS beyond early adulthood and elucidate how FXS changes in midlife and beyond."
10876986,"Project Summary: Uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major health problem in the US that constitutes a
significant cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in minoritized populations who continue to suffer
disproportionately higher rates of complications. Despite the significant role primary care practices play in the
management of T2D, they were never designed nor ideally suited to capture and address the complex
psychosocial (e.g., stress) and behavioral factors (e.g., adherence to self-care) that significantly impact
glycemic control. However, without incorporating the psychosocial and behavioral impacts of T2D into clinical
decision-making, achievement of the outcomes desired by patients and primary care providers (PCP) will be
unattainable. Application of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to T2D care represents an ideal opportunity to
capture the psychosocial and behavioral impacts of living with T2D on patients' clinical outcomes. In direct
response to NOT-HS-16-015, this renewal application, which builds on our AHRQ-funded randomized control
trial (RCT) evaluating the efficacy of an innovative mHealth PRO tool, will address this gap in the literature.
Using a theory-driven and user-centered design approach, we will conduct the study in two phases: 1) a
formative phase to refine and user-test iMatter2 in real-world settings; and 2) a clinical trial phase. The
formative phase will use a mixed-methods approach to: a) integrate enhanced functionalities into our existing
tool and the electronic health record (EHR) in a diverse network of primary care practices serving minoritized
populations; and b) evaluate the usability of iMatter2 in a subset of patients with T2D and PCPs to optimize the
tool's performance and workflow integration. For the clinical trial phase, we will evaluate in a hybrid type 1
RCT, the effectiveness of iMatter2 vs usual care (UC) on HbA1c reduction at 12-months among 353 patients
with uncontrolled T2D (HbA1c>7%). Using the extended RE-AIM framework, we will apply an equity lens to
measure the reach, adoption, and implementation of iMatter2. We will also explore the associations between
patient's PRO responses and HbA1c reduction. PCPs will be the unit of randomization with all patients within
the PCP's panel in the same group. Patients randomized to iMatter2 will receive and respond to personalized
PROs via text message, receive personalized motivational and educational messages via an AI chatbot; and
have access to an interactive dashboard that visualizes their daily PRO and HbA1c data. PCPs randomized to
iMatter2 will have access to EHR-integrated clinical decision support tools to nudge PCPs to view the PRO
reports and HbA1c data. Patients randomized to UC will receive standard T2D treatment recommendations
from their PCPs; PCPs will not have access to the EHR reports. Primary outcome is mean reduction in HbA1c,
extracted from home A1c kits, from baseline to 12 months. Secondary outcomes are 1) equitable reach of
iMatter2 across settings and patients; 2) equitable adoption of iMatter2 across PCPs and patients; and 3)
equitable engagement (implementation) with iMatter2 across PCPs and patients."
10875591,"REVISED PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Complex neural circuits are accurately assembled between the approximately 80 billion neurons in the human brain during development. The mammalian clustered protocadherin (Pcdh) genes, which encode a family of highly diverse cell-surface homophilic binding proteins, provide individual neurons with a unique cell-surface identity, or barcode required for normal neural circuit assembly. Previous structural, functional, and gene expression studies of the clustered Pcdh genes and proteins have revealed complex mechanisms by which Pcdh barcodes are generated and function, as well as the impact of loss of function Pcdh mutations on neural circuit assembly and behavior in mice. A remarkable feature of the Pcdh barcode is that it consists of a cell surface protein “lattice” on the membranes of interacting neurons. The Pcdh barcode has been shown to play a critical role in neurite self-avoidance, neuronal tiling and normal behavior in mice. Dominant loss of function Pcdh mutations that disrupt cell-cell interactions have been demonstrated in cell culture studies.
Although the failure to accurately assemble neural circuits has been linked to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, the occurrence of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in individual PCDH genes across the PCDH gene cluster do not meet a genome wide statistical association criteria for genetic association in large scale DNA sequencing studies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) cohorts. However, advances in understanding the regulation and function of the PCDH gene cluster and the recent availability of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from ASD probands in the Simons Simplex cohort bearing disruptive de novo SNVs in PCDH genes presents a unique opportunity to further explore PCDH gene function in human neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells.
The aims are to conduct a systematic analysis of de novo SNVs across the PCDH gene clusters identified in ASD cases. In Aim 1 we will determine how SNVs in PCDH isoforms impact homophilic interactions and intracellular localization of PCDH proteins in cell-based in-vitro homophilic binding assays. In Aim 2, we will generate CRISPR-Cas9 edited hiPSCs bearing loss of function PCDH mutations and differentiate them into neurons to assess deficits in self-avoidance in the hiPSC-derived neurons. In Aim 3, we will investigate the impact of SNVs in PCDH isoforms on neural circuits and functional connectivity in mice, using serotonergic neurons as a model. These proposed studies should significantly advance our understanding of the functional role of the PCDH locus in neural circuit assembly during brain development."
10862752,"Project Summary / Abstract
The immune system has the powerful ability to swiftly mobilize in response to challenge, migrating between and
within tissues to locally deliver inflammatory mediators that can be anti-microbial, anti-tumor or auto destructive.
Most infected/inflamed tissues express elevated levels of many chemokines and most chemokine receptors
(CRs) can bind to multiple ligands, creating a highly redundant network of signals. The optimization of immune
cell navigation through such a complex microenvironment remains unclear. Indeed, current immunotherapies for
various cancers have exposed deficiencies in our understanding of how effector T cells (Te) access and position
themselves in inflamed tissues, with very inefficient recruitment/retention of CAR T cells into the tumor itself.
Such microanatomical positioning driven by CRs and chemoattractants exposes Te to regional antigen and
inflammatory signals that likely tune transcriptional programs to boost or restrain effector functions. Indeed,
single cell transcriptomics analyses in infected and malignant tissues point to significant functional heterogeneity
in tissue Te cells, but lack spatial and temporal information that shape such heterogeneity. We have used an
optogenetic strategy to “timestamp” Th1 cells within inflamed tissues and have found an unexpected change in
CR expression based on time from tissue entry. This proposal aims to gain new knowledge of the temporal use
of CRs that impact Th1 functional (re)programing. Such insight would enable design of targeted therapeutic
approaches that harness or manipulate Te within the target tissues of infection, inflammation or malignancy.
We have utilized in vivo optogenetic approaches combined with RNAseq to follow changes in CR expression by
Te in the inflamed skin. Our data reveal a striking temporal regulation of CR transcription by Th1 cells following
tissue entry. Disruption of this sequence of CR expression comprises Th1 function. We hypothesize that CR
gene expression modulated in a temporal fashion enables incoming effector T cells to differentially
sense chemotactic cues for correct tissue positioning. Moreover, location-specific events of tissue
entry, early activation, through to positioning at the infection foci transmit distinct signals that hone the
Th1 transcriptional program to optimize effector function. Tested in the following aims:
Specific Aim 1. Signals that dynamically regulate CR expression and Th1 intra-tissue programing.
Specific Aim 2. Stage-specific CR requirements.
Specific Aim 3. Biological impact of temporal regulation of CR expression."
10917237,"Project Summary/Abstract
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) ranks among the most lethal cancers due to a late diagnosis and
ineffective treatments. Extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs) are secreted by most cells, including tumor
cells, and package selective molecules, including proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and metabolites. EVPs are
actively released into the circulation and mounting evidence suggests that circulating EVPs can serve as
biomarkers for early cancer detection. Mass spectrometry (MS) has been extensively utilized for biomarker
discovery in liquid biopsies, including EVP protein characterization. However, the scope and depth of the
information obtained is limited by (i) the sensitivity and resolution of the analytic technologies and (ii) the
proteomic complexity resulting from highly abundant serum-derived contaminants. The objective of this study
is to apply an optimized reproducible EVP isolation method in conjunction with asymmetric-flow field-flow
fractionation (AF4) technology to isolate EVP subsets with significantly improved purity and to employ three
novel analytic technologies, including extremely sensitive timsTOF 4D proteomic MS, super-resolution
dSTORM imaging analysis of single EVPs, and photocatalytic proximity labeling-proteomics (µMap) technology,
to discover and validate novel, circulating EVP protein biomarkers for early detection of PDAC. In Aim 1, by
employing the label-free timsTOF MS and using samples (blood plasma and tumor tissues) collected from
patients with newly diagnosed PDAC, we will identify novel circulating EVP protein biomarkers that correlate
with early stage disease. Top-ranked candidates will be further validated by robust absolute quantitation assays
employing targeted parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) MS. In Aim 2, we will determine the percent
representation and structural location of specific EVP biomarker proteins identified in Aim 1 at the single EVP
level by utilizing the super-resolution dSTORM imaging analysis. The performance of single EVP analysis will
be compared to the bulk analysis of individual protein targets via western blotting and/or ELISA analysis. We
will further explore the potential to apply this analytic tool directly to plasma samples without prior EVP isolation.
Lastly, in Aim 3, we will define protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of individual biomarkers by employing our
recently developed photocatalytic proximity labeling-proteomics (µMap) technology. Three potential biomarker
candidates identified in our previous study and novel candidates discovered in this study Aim 1 and Aim 2 will
be subjected to the PPI analysis. These interactions will be further validated by super-resolution imaging
analysis at the single-EVP, single-molecule level. We will establish if the presence or absence of these
interactions provides a more robust approach for early cancer detection. We predict that combined application
of these technologies will greatly facilitate novel biomarker discovery for early detection of pancreatic cancer. It
also explores EVP PPIs as a new category of biomarkers and provide a rationale for developing therapies
targeting these interactive networks in the future."
10740888,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
An elevated level of plasma lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is an independent causal risk factor for cardiovascular
disease (CVD). Lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes, are recommended as first line therapy to
reduce CVD risk. Dietary guidelines to lower saturated fatty acids (SFA) and replace them with unsaturated
fats or complex carbohydrates target primarily low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). In the small number
of dietary studies that assessed Lp(a) level, a consistent increase was found in response to reduction in SFA
intake. As LPA gene controls Lp(a) level and very few non-genetic factors impact Lp(a), this diet-mediated
effect is notable. Importantly, the increase in Lp(a) level is a counter observation to the effect of SFA reduction
on LDL-C. The mechanism(s) underlying this paradoxical finding and furthermore how SFA reduction affects
Lp(a) atherogenic properties beyond its plasma level remains unknown. Lp(a) carries the majority of circulating
proinflammatory and proatherogenic oxidized phospholipids (OxPL) and Lp(a) atherogenicity is mediated by its
OxPL content. Despite this, little is known about what happens to OxPL when dietary SFA is reduced and its
major lipoprotein carrier is increased. This proposal will bridge these knowledge gaps and obtain a more
complete picture of CVD risk manipulation through SFA reduction consistent with current dietary guidelines.
The central hypothesis—Lp(a)-OxPL content is increased with dietary SFA replacement diminishing the
beneficial effect of LDL-C lowering on CVD risk—will be tested through a comprehensive research in the
largest and most diverse platform consisting of three NIH-funded well-controlled metabolic feeding trials
(DELTA 1, DELTA 2, and GET-READI). Specifically, the dynamics of changes in Lp(a)-OxPL in response to
SFA reduction will be assessed using quantitative (total concentration) (Aim 1) and qualitative (subspecies
composition) (Aim 3) approaches in both healthy and metabolically challenged individuals. Replacement
strategies for SFA reduction (unsaturated fats vs. complex carbohydrate) and genetic variability modelled via
the apolipoprotein(a) size polymorphism will be tested as response modulators. Specific subgroups (e.g.,
ethnic/racial, those with and without metabolic burden) who may benefit the least (or the most) from the
generalized dietary guidelines to reduce SFA intake will be identified (Aim 2). As clinical laboratory values for
LDL-C include Lp(a) cholesterol, the opposing effect of SFA reduction on these two lipoproteins, therefore,
likely results in an inaccurate estimation of the true LDL-C response. This critical issue will be mapped in more
detail. The findings originating in the largest and most diverse compilation of data will improve the
understanding of a common non-pharmacological therapy that may enhance the atherogenic potential of Lp(a)
beyond its plasma level. Ultimately, this will assist in adopting precision nutrition as part of a heart-healthy
lifestyle for an improved CVD risk prevention and management."
10914233,"Successful prevention of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia may rely on intervention at the earliest possible
point in the AD pathological cascade, hypothesized to be the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ). The standard
PET approach for Aβ detection is based on widespread cortical Aβ burden and often fails to capture early Aβ.
The proposed K01 project will develop optimized spatial extent measures that allow for robust identification of
individuals in an earlier stage of amyloidosis than previously studied. This approach should provide a more
dynamic biomarker of A localization for investigating early A‘s role in the AD pathological cascade and has
the potential to serve as a more sensitive outcome in future prevention trials. Aim 1 will use longitudinal data
from clinically normal (CN) individuals from the Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) to 1) develop an optimized
spatial extent metric based on a scientifically rigorous investigation of how different possible methods for
computing spatial extent respond to simulated noise, 2) validate the sensitivity and specificity of the optimal
spatial extent approach (EXT) to predict future A accumulation over 3-11 years, and 3) implement EXT in an
independent sample of standard PET- screen fails from the AHEAD 3-45 Study to assess the alignment
between plasma Aβ+ and EXT+ for detecting the earliest Aβ deposits. Aim 2 will use EXT to evaluate the
earliest changes in tau using plasma biomarkers (ptau217) and flortaucipir-PET and assess whether EXT may
provide a better predictive marker of those at risk for tau proliferation than standard cortical Aβ-PET
approaches. Aim 3 will evaluate whether the improved quantification of the earliest A deposits with EXT
allows for more sensitive detection of long-term and immediate cognitive changes associated with emerging
A. These findings will help provide a framework for future prevention trials to intervene earlier in the disease
process than has previously been attempted. Furthermore, the EXT approach will open a wide range of
potential future directions to study how emerging Aβ relates to other important factors in AD pathogenesis (i.e.
inflammation, synaptic function) to establish an independent research program. To help Dr. Michelle Farrell
achieve these aims, a multidisciplinary mentorship team has been assembled from the Harvard Medical School
community to complement didactic coursework in PET physics and pharmacokinetics, plasma biomarkers,
advanced statistical analysis, and clinical trials. Dr. Reisa Sperling will serve as the primary mentor overseeing
research and career progress and providing training in clinical trial design and conduct to maximize the
translational potential of the planned research. Dr. Keith Johnson and Dr. Julie Price will serve as co-mentors
to provide comprehensive training in PET research. The mentorship team will be rounded out by two research
advisors (Dr. Rob Rissman: plasma biomarkers, Dr. Brian Healy: statistics) and two contributors (Dr. J. Alex
Becker: PET simulations; Dr. Kathryn Papp: daily digital cognitive assessments). This comprehensive training
plan will facilitate Dr. Farrell’s research and growth into an independent clinical translational scientist."

10734061,"IL-17 and Th17 cells drive pathology in a variety of autoimmune and pathologic
inflammatory conditions. Recently, biologic drugs targeting the IL-17 pathway have
shown clinical efficacy in psoriasis, and are under evaluation for other autoimmune and
inflammatory disease conditions. We have a long-standing interest in understanding the
fundamental basis for IL-17 signaling, with the premise that defining the molecular
mediators of disease pathology will ultimately help lead to development of the most
effective or specific therapeutic targets, diagnostics or biomarkers. IL-17 regulates
downstream inflammatory genes by transcriptional mechanisms, mainly involving the
canonical NF-κB pathway as well as CCAAT/Enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPs). IL-17
also activates numerous post-transcriptional mechanisms that control mRNA stability
and translation. In a screen to identify new intermediates involved in IL-17-dependent
downstream signaling, we discovered that IL-17 induces a novel RNA binding protein
(RBP) that was never previously linked to IL-17 signaling, T cells or autoimmune
pathology. Strikingly, cells lacking this RBP exhibited markedly impaired in IL-17
signaling, especially activation of NF-κB and C/EBPδ. In vivo, mice lacking this RBP
were refractory to IL-17-driven inflammatory diseases, including experimental

mechanisms by which this novel RBP pathway controls IL-17-dependent signal

The proposed study will be the first to decompose how different institutional-, state- and patient-level
factors interfere with the access of elderly individuals dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid
(“duals”) to memory care and provide actionable and state-specific policy guidance on how to address
these obstacles. Duals have a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD),
given their lower income and education, as well as higher prevalence and worse management of chronic
conditions. Having partial Medicaid coverage, duals face the well-known reluctance of physicians to see
them, because of lower payment rates compared to those for Medicare-only beneficiaries, and
administrative complexity given that providers need to bill Medicaid and Medicare separately. Patient-
level factors, such as limited ability to navigate two separate benefit schemes, compound the challenge.
Consequently, duals are less likely to be diagnosed, counseled, and treated for cognitive impairment in
spite of their higher disease burden. As disease-modifying AD treatments are likely to become available
soon, understanding and addressing these obstacles becomes pressing to avoid potentially widening
existing disparities. The proposed study has three aims:
Investigate the association of disparities in receiving memory care between duals of similar predicted
risk of cognitive impairment with patient- (e.g., race/ethnicity) and state-level factors (e.g., provider
density).
Causally decompose the effects of physician payment rates, patient navigation, and administrative
complexity on access to memory care for duals compared to non-duals with similar cognitive
impairment risk. We will take advantage of differences in Medicaid rates across states and a 2022 policy
reform that aims to improve patient navigation and reduce administrative complexity for physicians.
Explore whether effects of physician payment rates, patient navigation, and administrative complexity
on access to memory care are moderated by patient- and state-level drivers of disparities, and provide
tailored and actionable policy guidance on how to effectively and efficiently improve access to memory
care for duals to all 50 states and the District of Columbia."

Kidney transplantation is the most effective modality for treating end stage kidney disease. It provides superior
quality of life and significantly improves survival over dialysis. However, the demand for kidney transplants has
surpassed the supply of usable organs. Because of this deficit, it is important to improve the outcomes of first-
time transplant recipients through intelligent management, thereby optimizing donor organ allocation and
reducing the need for secondary transplants. In assessing the health of a renal allograft, time is of critical
importance. Being able to precisely predict delayed graft dysfunction and modifying treatment strategies
accordingly would be greatly impactful in decreasing chronic rejection events. Existing clinical methods, such as
the Kidney Donor Profile Index, which are based solely on donor demographics and clinical data, are minimally
to moderately predictive of allograft outcomes. Further, current visual, semi-quantitative transplant biopsy scoring
metrics, e.g., Banff, the Maryland Aggregate Pathology Index, and Remuzzi are often not predictive of renal graft
function. Digital image analytical methods that quantify chronic changes in kidney that cannot be done visually,
may offer clues to long-term allograft outcome. Therefore, to address the unmet need of intelligent renal
transplant management, we propose a comprehensive multimodal framework, integrating high-resolution renal
transplant biopsy digital whole-slide images (WSIs), and donor and recipient clinical, demographic, and social
determinants of health data. Using this framework we will combine computer vision and explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) tools to derive autonomous diagnostic and prognostic models for data-driven, long-term
management of renal allografts. As part of their preliminary work, the investigator team has developed a
computational tool to quantify interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, a chronicity measure in renal transplant
biopsies, and demonstrated that the prediction of estimated glomerular filtration rate at a later time-point after
biopsy using machine learning (ML)-derived image features outperforms those based on routine visual
assessment. This tool will be expanded to incorporate a variety of additional analyses including robust
segmentation of renal compartments in WSIs, leveraging pathologist guided attention to train deep-learning
models, state-of-the-art transformer models for multi-task learning, and XAI to increase interoperability and
accessibility of ML-derived predictions to pathologists. The performance of this pipeline to predict renal allograft
function in a future time-point will be compared with existing methods used in a clinical setting as well as ML-
based methods used for explainable prediction of disease progression in other areas of digital pathology. The
tool will be deployed on a cloud-based platform and the usability by important stakeholders, namely, transplant
renal pathologists, nephrologists, and surgeons will be studied with a goal to eventually include the tool in clinical
workflows. The proposed work will be an invaluable asset for clinicians to take advantage of large collections of
renal transplant biopsy WSIs and inform treatment decisions towards improving renal allograft function."

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a permanent abdominal aorta expansion with high mortality but limited
treatment options. Currently, there are no effective clinical medicines to prevent, delay, or reverse the growth
or rupture of AAA, except an open or endovascular surgical repair for symptomatic aneurysms or aneurysms at
high risk for rupture. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) are crucial in maintaining vascular wall integrity
and function, while VSMC depletion is a characteristic feature of AAA. Ferroptosis is a type of programmed cell
death dependent on iron and characterized by the accumulation of lipid peroxides. Smoking is a well-
established AAA risk factor, and cigarette smoke extract induces VSMC ferroptosis. Glutathione peroxidase 4
(GPX4) has been identified as a critical inhibitor of ferroptosis and apoptosis. Human genetics and Gene
Expression Omnibus database have demonstrated that decreased GPX4 expression is associated with an
increased risk of AAA. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that GPX4 is significantly reduced in the aorta of
AAA patients and animal models. Nicotine, a well-established AAA risk factor, reduced GPX4 and SMC
contractile protein expression. We posit that AAA risk factors can result in VSMC death via an
underappreciated pathway, i.e., ferroptosis in the artery resulting in AAA formation and rupture. We generated
VSMC-specific Gpx4 knockout mice (Gpx4SMKO) by crossing Myh11-Cre with Gpx4flox/flox mice. When
subjected to aneurysm induction by angiotensin II (Ang II) coupled with hypercholesterolemia, about 50% of
Gpx4SMKO mice died due to AAA rupture. The incidence rate and maximal diameters in Gpx4SMKO mice
were larger than in Gpx4flox/flox control mice. Specific Aim 1 will define the protective effects of VSMC-specific
GPX4 in AAA using our novel VSMC-selective GPX4 transgenic mice. We will also examine the effects of
VSMC-specific Gpx4 knockout using a different murine model with perivascular application of elastase, an AAA
model that does not produce rupture. Aim 2 will determine the GPX4-dependent protective mechanisms in
VSMC using gain- and loss-of-function strategies. We will examine the effects of GPX4 on AAA-relevant
stimuli-induced cell death, VSMC phenotypic switch, and inflammatory responses in primary human and
mouse abdominal aortic smooth muscle cells. Aim 3 will define that local activation of GPX4 attenuates AAA
pathogenesis by enhancing VSMC capacity of resistance to pathologic factors. Further, we will examine
whether the GPX4 activator protects against aneurysm development and rupture. Successful completion of the
proposed studies will establish novel mechanisms regulating VSMC loss and vascular inflammation in AAA,
which are likely to advance our understanding of the AAA formation and ultimately lead to novel strategies for
treating AAA."

Older adults have a disproportionately higher prevalence of hypothyroidism compared to their younger
counterparts, with levothyroxine (the most widely used synthetic thyroid hormone) consistently one of the top
most frequently prescribed medications in the United States. Alarmingly, up to 48% of older adults aged 65
years receive a thyroid hormone dose that is too high, resulting in overtreatment. In addition, thyroid hormone
therapy is often initiated for inappropriate indications (misuse) which can also lead to overtreatment. This is
especially concerning for older adults, who comprise the fastest growing demographic group and the most
vulnerable to polypharmacy. Studies conducted by our team and others have demonstrated that thyroid hormone
overtreatment can lead to significant cardiovascular and skeletal risks, and increased mortality. Despite potential
patient harm, ~90% of patients continue lifelong thyroid hormone treatment. Thus, in the context of thyroid
hormone overtreatment, there is a critical need to deprescribe, which can be achieved either via thyroid hormone
dose de-escalation (in patients overtreated) or thyroid hormone discontinuation (in patients without an
appropriate indication). The proposed study is the first multi-site trial to evaluate a novel evidence-based adapted
multilevel intervention, D-THIO (Deprescribing Thyroid Hormone In Older Adults), consisting of evidence-based
pharmaceutical opinion letters to providers, education brochures to patients and facilitated by clinical champions,
to support thyroid hormone deprescribing in older adults. We will conduct a type 1 hybrid effectiveness-
implementation trial of D-THIO vs. enhanced usual care (American Thyroid Association [ATA] provider
abbreviated guidelines, ATA patient brochure) at 3 sites (University of Michigan, Henry Ford, University of
California San Francisco) in 150 providers (primary care, endocrinologists, geriatricians, advance practice
providers) and 750 of their patients 65 years overtreated with thyroid hormone. We will randomize 1:1 at the
provider level within each site. We propose three specific aims: 1) to assess the effectiveness of D-THIO on
thyroid hormone deprescribing by providers and on reducing overtreatment and misuse with thyroid hormone
via EMR, 2) to assess the effectiveness of D-THIO on provider and patient knowledge and attitudes regarding
thyroid hormone deprescribing via surveys, and 3) to identify factors related to the implementation of D-THIO
across diverse general care settings via post-trial interviews with key stakeholders. Ultimately, our findings will
serve as a model for deprescribing inappropriate medications for other endocrine conditions and conditions with
biochemical monitoring, and advance our understanding of de-implementation of low-value care in older adults
across the nation."

 Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of disability in adults and the quality of life of TBI survivors is
highly dependent on the adequacy of cognitive recovery. TBI is also a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
and AD-related dementias (ADRD). Mounting evidence indicates that cerebrovascular dysfunction occurs in
both TBI and AD/ADRD and can be a cross-link between the two diseases. The 2019 ADRD Summit called for
further studies to understand vascular contributions to progressive cognitive impairment/dementia associated
with TBI and develop non-invasive diagnostic approaches5,9. The following important knowledge gaps exist:
1) What is the impact of early cerebrovascular dysfunction after TBI on short and long-term cognitive outcomes
after accounting for age, sex, and pre-existing health conditions? 2) What is the temporal relationship between
the cerebrovascular function recovery and cognitive outcome after TBI? and 3) Is there a relationship between
cerebrovascular dysfunction and post-TBI neurodegeneration? The overarching goal of this proposal is to
determine whether acute cerebrovascular dysfunction and its recovery within the first year postinjury are
associated with cognitive outcomes and neurodegeneration 12 months after moderate to severe TBI (msTBI).
Our central hypothesis is that cerebrovascular function measured by dynamic cerebral autoregulation (CA)
and brain perfusion during acute stage and its recovery during the first year are inversely associated with
cognitive outcomes and brain volume loss at 12 months postinjury. We propose a longitudinal study with 100
adults who sustained a single msTBI and 30 controls with non-TBI orthopedic trauma in the first week after the
initial injury. We will follow them at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after injury. The primary outcome will
be the NIH Toolbox Cognitive battery fluid composite score supplemented with sensitive episodic memory and
processing speed measures at 12 months postinjury. To address the overarching goal, we aim to 1) determine
the association of cerebrovascular dysfunction during the acute stage of msTBI (<1-week postinjury) with
cognitive outcome at 1 year. CA will be quantified by dynamic changes in arterial blood pressure and cerebral
blood flow velocity or brain tissue oxygenation. Brain perfusion will be determined by the sum of cerebral blood
flow measured from the bilateral internal carotid artery and vertebral artery. 2) To determine the temporal
association between the recovery of cerebrovascular function and cognitive outcomes after TBI. CA and brain
perfusion will be measured at 3, 6 and 12 months postinjury. 3) To determine the temporal associations of
acute cerebrovascular dysfunction and its recovery with the imaging biomarkers of neurodegeneration after
TBI over time. Multimodal MRI studies will be performed at 3 months and 12 months postinjury. The findings
from this study will improve our understanding of cerebrovascular contributions to cognitive outcome and
neurodegeneration after TBI. The knowledge obtained will provide critical data to inform the development of
strategies based on vascular mechanisms to improve cognition and slow neurodegeneration after TBI."

 Relapse defined as the resumption of alcohol drinking following a prolonged period of abstinence,
represents a prevalent and significant public health concern in alcoholism. Relapse is a major impediment to
treatment efforts. One promising approach for reducing high propensity for relapse in subjects with moderate
to severe alcohol use disorder (AUD) is the identification of vulnerability factors in the brain that contribute to
enhanced relapse to ethanol drinking; the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is one of the key brain regions
implicated in relapse to ethanol drinking behaviors.
 We have used the chronic intermittent ethanol vapor inhalation (CIE) model of ethanol dependence to
demonstrate that increased ethanol self-administration during CIE in female rats predicts higher relapse to
ethanol drinking triggered by ethanol contextual cues during forced abstinence compared with males. In
addition, we have shown that drinking during relapse is associated with increases in endothelial cell specific
angiogenesis peptide PECAM-1 in the mPFC in both sexes, indicating blood-brain barrier (BBB) instability.
Treatment with an anti-angiogenic agent normalized PECAM-1 expression in both sexes and reduced relapse
to ethanol drinking in female rats.
 To further understand the mechanisms underlying BBB instability and dysfunction, we have begun studies
to isolate endothelial cells from the mPFC via endothelial cell enrichment assay. We have performed RNA
sequencing to initially profile endothelial transcriptome of cells isolated from ethanol naïve adult female and
male rats. Our results show that endothelial cells in females have higher expression of genes associated with
angiogenesis and endothelial cell stability, whereas cells from males have higher expression of genes
associated with immune responses. We have published findings from cytokine and chemokine multiplex
analyses to show that the mPFC in ethanol naïve adult male rats has higher expression of pro- and anti-
inflammatory cytokines and chemokines compared with females. These findings support sexual dimorphism in
the endothelial transcriptome and immune responses in the mPFC under control, ethanol naïve conditions
and open questions on how they are altered during ethanol dependence.
 In further support of BBB instability, we show that adherens junction protein cadherin5 (Cdh5, VE-
cadherin) is significantly altered in the mPFC in ethanol dependent female and male rats. Specifically we
show that Cdh5 is increased during acute withdrawal, significantly decreased during prolonged abstinence,
and increased following relapse to ethanol drinking compared to ethanol naïve controls in both sexes. In
addition to the endothelial changes in the mPFC, electrophysiological studies demonstrate altered synaptic
plasticity in ethanol dependent female and male rats. Therefore, in the renewal application we hope to define
the role of Cdh5 during abstinence in promoting relapse to ethanol drinking in both sexes via altering the
endothelial transcriptome, pro- and anti-inflammatory responses and neuronal plasticity in the mPFC. Our
hypotheses will be tested via 3 Specific Aims."

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) develops in about one-fourth of patients with ovarian cancer and is associated
with significant morbidity and mortality. Chemotherapy increases VTE risk, but administration of prophylactic
anticoagulation to all patients on chemotherapy is associated with a substantial risk of bleeding. Therefore, it is
crucial to identify patients with a higher risk of VTE. In the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center
(MDACC) Ovarian Cancer Moon Shot program, we have assembled a cohort of 354 patients who have received
neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The availability of tumor specimens, blood samples, and an extensive clinical
database from these patients provides us a unique opportunity to investigate the novel predictive biomarkers for
VTE in ovarian cancer. Most previous studies on cancer thrombosis analyzed clinical, demographic, or
hemostatic factors already known to be risk factors for VTE in cancer patients instead of identifying tumor-specific
prothrombotic factors. We will explore cancer cell products that increase VTE risk and particularly investigate
the impact of cancer cell-derived podoplanin and mitochondria on VTE. We found mitochondria in plasma
samples of cancer patients and showed that ovarian cancer cells release mitochondria (both free and
microvesicle-embedded). Injection of mitochondria caused venous thrombi in mice, rich in neutrophils and
neutrophil extracellular trap (NETs). We speculate that mitochondria-targeted antioxidants and antibiotics
blocking the synthesis of chemotactic formylmethionine(fMet)-tagged peptides reduce cancer VTE. We found
that podoplanin is expressed on ovarian cancer cells and tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), and its
expression is increased by chemotherapy. Podoplanin-expressing EVs activate platelets, and their injection into
mice causes platelet-rich venous thrombi. We propose that a small molecule blocking podoplanin interaction with
platelets reduces cancer thrombosis. We will examine whether the number of mitochondria and concentration of
podoplanin in plasma predict VTE risk in ovarian cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. We will investigate
the effect of a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, an antibiotic blocking synthesis of fMet peptides, and a
podoplanin inhibitor on venous thrombosis in a murine model of IVC ligation. Finally, we will compare the
mutation profile and mutation burden of mitochondria and nuclear genes in tumors of ovarian cancer patients
with and without VTE to identify the genetic changes in cancer cells associated with an increased VTE risk."

From the 1940s-1980s, corporate uranium (U) mines were established in the Southwestern United States,
many on Native American lands. Due to improper reclamation and poor remediation, surrounding residential
homes are subject to residual mixed-metals exposure including arsenic (As), vanadium (V), uranium (U), and
nickel (Ni) via ingestion and inhalation. Inhaled metal-based derived particulate matter (PM) has been
associated with an increase in circulating serum inflammatory potential and subsequent vascular and
neurovascular disease. The full scope of systemic health effects following inhaled mine-site derived PM has
yet to be elucidated and the role of circulating factors, such as small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) in driving
inflammatory impacts is underexplored.
 In preliminary studies, we have observed that mine-site PM is more acutely toxic to pulmonary and
vascular systems than regional ‘background’ PM. Furthermore, similar studies of inhaled particulates and
gases demonstrate endothelial dysfunction that can drive vascular dysfunction and inflammatory outcomes.
Therefore, my specific aims will serve three primary objectives 1) mechanistically delineate lung-sEV
biogenesis following PM exposure 2) mechanistically evaluate sEV endocytosis following PM exposures and 3)
assess associations between type of mining dust exposure (U-mining vs. non-U mining) and sEV vascular
biomarkers in an established human cohort of former miners (the MiDUS cohort, Mining Dust in the United
States). This proposal serves as an innovative, five-year research project to understand the mechanistic role of
sEVs in driving toxic responses following PM exposure. We shall leverage the outstanding facilities and
resources at the University of New Mexico – Health Sciences Center, including the Autophagy, Inflammation
and Metabolism (AIM) Center (P20GM121176), the University of New Mexico Center for Metals in Biology and
Medicine (P20GM130422), the UNM Mobile Epidemiology Laboratory (MEL) and our long-standing
collaborations with community partners, including the Miners’ Colfax Medical Center Mobile Outreach.
 With global extraction of metal ores surging due to increased demand for batteries, computer chips and
energy, environmental mixed-metals exposure has become an issue of concern in both an occupational and
environmental context. Data from these studies will ultimately lead to essential information pertinent to metal-
exposed populations, as well as governing agencies involved in air-quality regulations."

Human cancers are complex diseases with pathobiology driven by heritable genetics, environmental exposures,
somatic genomic and epigenomic alterations, and contributions for immunological and other responses in the
host micro- and macroenvironment. Cancer therapeutics overlay another dimension with respect to particular
vulnerabilities that underly concepts of precision medicine. Currently, integrating genome-scale data from
mechanistic ‘cause-effect’ laboratory-based studies to the pathobiology of in vivo tumors in the context of clinical
care remains challenging. This proposal is designed to provide support for a highly skilled and productive
scientist with expertise across laboratory, bioinformatics, and clinical medicine. The objectives are (i) to provide
biostatistical and bioinformatics skills for a range of program investigators that seek to bi-directional integration
for the development and testing of hypotheses involving cancer genomics; (ii) to develop new approaches
(modeling and computational tools) for the analyses and integration of genome-scale data; and (iii) apply rigor

Fast and Robust Deep Learning for Medical imaging: Segmentation and Registration methods invariant to con-
trast and resolution.
Summary
Segmentation and registration are critical tasks in a broad range of scientific studies, and have been widely
implemented in imaging analysis frameworks. Unfortunately, most existing tools suffer from two important draw-
backs: they are computationally demanding, and most often impose limiting restrictions on the type of image
data that can be accurately analyzed. While the former drawback has been recently addressed through the use
of deep neural networks that execute rapidly once trained, these systems amplify the latter, which remains a
major restriction. This typically means that tools only yield accurate results on a very limited range of scan types,
most commonly those that they were trained on and are susceptible to repeating bias present in those data. For
segmentation this is particularly burdensome as training frequently requires manually labeled representations for
different types of input data.
The constraint of image type greatly restricts image analysis and its downstream impact in an array of important
domains. For example, in research imaging, it limits multi-site and longitudinal studies that must hold acquisition
protocols constant or attempt to harmonize protocols across different acquisition platforms, and even this process
has limited success when the differences are too extreme (e.g. across field strength). Investigators often need
to adjust, redesign, or retrain the tools for their intended tasks and available images and manual labels, leading
to more barriers to analysis. There is also a wealth of knowledge to be gained from analyzing clinically-sourced
MR images, which could lead to better understanding of the biological underpinnings of many disease processes
and a more precise quantification of the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. However, scans acquired as part
of routine clinical care are often of diverse contrast, significantly lower resolution, and lower quality due to noise
or subject motion. There are few if any publicly available tools that can handle the wide range of acquisition
variability in typical clinical imaging.
We propose to design and distribute machine learning based tools to completely remove these barriers. We will
develop imaging segmentation and registration deep learning methods that retain their accuracy given unpro-
cessed scans of most contrasts or resolution without the need for training data or network fine-tuning to each
data variation. We will build on our recent work in learning-based methods for segmentation, registration, syn-
thesis, and augmentation to leverage the speed of neural networks, the richness of MR physics models, and the
generalizability of probabilistic Bayesian models. We will validate these tools on a large comprehensive multi-site
study incorporating new manual labeling of scans spanning different age, sex, and race . Finally, we will deploy
them to analyze anatomy and white matter lesions in a retrospective stroke cohort. The novel techniques will be
implemented both as standalone open source software as well as part of FreeSurfer analysis package, making
them freely available to thousands of method developers as well as science and clinical researchers."
10892286,"Project Summary
Eukaryotic genomes contain a diversity of evolutionarily “selfish” genetic elements (SGEs) that obtain
transmission advantages at the expense of their host carriers. SGEs tend to use one of two broad
strategies: over-replicate relative to the host genome (e.g., transposable elements) or distort fair Mendelian
transmission (e.g., meiotic drive elements). Sex chromosomes are especially susceptible to the invasion
and accumulation of meiotic drive elements that, by distorting X versus Y chromosome transmission via
selective sperm-killing, bias progeny sex ratios. Such “sex-ratio drive” can potentiate evolutionary conflicts
of interest between drive genes and drive-suppressors at X-linked, Y-linked, and autosomal loci. Molecular
arms races arising from recurrent bouts of such drive-mediated conflict can have far reaching
consequences for male fertility, for demography (including the potential risk of unisexual population
extinction), for genome evolution, and for speciation. Understanding the genetics, molecular mechanisms,
evolutionary dynamics, and genomic consequences of sex-ratio drive is therefore of paramount importance.
Here we propose to investigate a system of sex-ratio drive and suppression that evolved recently and then,
as expected under molecular arms race dynamics, rapidly diversified among three closely related species of
Drosophila— D. simulans, D. mauritiana, and D. sechellia. Our previous work revealed that, while these
species diverged ~250 Kya and are today reproductively isolated by numerous genetic incompatibilities,
some gene flow has nevertheless occurred among all three. We discovered that the so-called Winters sex-
ratio drive system is part of a family of X-linked, satellite DNA-associated, Dox-like (Dxl) drive genes that
amplified in copy number and diversified in sequence. These Dxl genes encode predicted DNA-binding
sperm-specific histones, which we predict differentially disrupt chromatin remodeling of X- versus Y-bearing
spermatid pronuclei during spermiogenesis. Furthermore, we found that each species possesses two
hairpin RNA-producing autosomal suppressor genes that produce endogenous small interfering RNAs
(esiRNAs) predicted to specialize in the silencing of different subsets of the Dxl gene family. Finally, we
discovered that some Dxl genes and suppressors show population genetic signatures of strong recent
selection and interspecies gene flow. Our research project aims to combine experimental genetics,
molecular biology, third-generation sequencing, and evolutionary genomics methods to dissect Dxl driver-
hpRNA suppressor interactions; to determine the genomic binding targets of the Dxl-encoded histones and
its implications for the evolution of Y chromosome sequence content; and to infer the evolutionary history
and dynamics of Dxl-mediated molecular arms races, including its implications for the evolution of hybrid
sterility and interspecific gene flow."

Ovarian cancer accounts for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system. In 2021,
there were 21,410 new cases of OC and 13,770 deaths. Remarkable progress has been made in ovarian
cancer treatment, resulting in a 33% decline in mortality in the past few decades; unfortunately, equitable
access to these therapies remains a challenge. While survival rates improved from 40% to 47% among non-
Hispanic (NH) White women, survival has stagnated at 35% for NH-Black women. A well-established predictor
of the ovarian cancer survival disparity is lack of access to quality treatment. In analysis of the SEER-Medicare
database between 2008-2015, only 14% of NH-Black ovarian cancer patients received guideline-concordant
surgery and full cycles of recommended chemotherapy, contributing to poor survival. There is also growing
recognition of the enduring impact of structural racism on health outcomes. Yet only a handful of studies have
examined structural racism in relation to OC disparities, and none have evaluated its contribution via
healthcare access (HCA) domains, or via pathways that involve chronic stress associated with discrimination.
In this R37 extension, we propose to build on the well-established ORCHiD (Ovarian Cancer Epidemiology,
Healthcare Access and Disparities) research infrastructure to examine longitudinal trajectories of HCA and
investigate the individual and joint associations of structural (residential segregation) and interpersonal
(experiences of discrimination) racism with HCA domains and ovarian cancer treatment and survival outcomes
in diverse patients. Our proposed extension substantially moves us towards translational impact by addressing
key gaps in the literature regarding the mechanisms through which healthcare access domains impact OC
disparities."

The goal of this proposal is to provide a mechanistic understanding of how cell division in bacteria is controlled
at a molecular level. Understanding these mechanisms, which are broadly conserved among the bacteria, is
important because it can reveal potential targets for new antibacterial agents that inhibit cell division and stop
cell propagation. The division process in bacteria involves two stages. In the first distinct step, FtsZ protofilament
assembly, the Z-ring, forms. In Escherichia coli, the model organism for this study, the first step occurs early in
the cell cycle. Only after a significant delay, which can last half of the cell cycle, does the second stage of cell
division start. In this later step, septal peptidoglycan synthesis begins, and the cell constricts. In this stage, more
than two dozen proteins are involved, most of them in a complex referred to as the divisome. It is not yet
understood what determines the onset of either the first or the second stage of the division, both of which are
critical for the cell's survival. This significant gap in our knowledge exists even though many proteins involved in
cell division are known and their pairwise binding interactions mapped out. The difficulty in understanding
processes controlling cell division arises from the presence of a large number of different interactions within the
divisome and of many pathways that are partially redundant. Moreover, the protein assemblies, which in most
studies are viewed as static, are highly dynamic, turning over in a matter of seconds in an energy-dependent
process such as treadmilling. The complexity of the problem requires not only further experiments but the
integration of the existing experimental results into a comprehensive modeling framework. Accordingly, we
combine state-of-the-art experimental methods with stochastic cell cycle simulations and 3D modeling of
assembly reactions of proteins involved in cell division. On the latter front, we leverage our previous work and
ongoing collaborations. In the experimental work, we use molecular biology and genetic methods alongside high
throughput and super-resolution microscopy, and we develop novel microfluidic devices for this research. These
techniques have already generated large amounts of information-rich data that, among other findings, have shed
new light on processes leading to the assembly of Z-ring from individual FtsZ protofilaments and determining the
role of DNA replication over the control of the progression of the second stage of the division. The proposed
work aims to consolidate these past findings into a single mechanistic framework. The knowledge gained will
enhance our understanding of fundamental cellular processes in bacteria and provide a basis for designing
effective antibacterial therapies that target bacterial cell division."

Dyspnea (shortness of breath) is among the most common reasons for seeking medical attention. It has a
prevalence rivaling chronic pain and accounts for 10% of emergency room visits. Dyspnea workups involve
extensive diagnostic testing, with high cost, and a slow time to diagnosis. The burden of dyspnea will further
increase as more patients present with symptoms from long COVID. 129Xe MRI provides a promising solution
with its comprehensive, non-invasive, and rapid imaging of lung function. Enabled by its solubility and tissue-
dependent chemical shift, 129Xe probes diffusive transfer from the distal airspaces through the pulmonary
interstitium (membrane) to the capillary red blood cells (RBCs); this provides a 3D decomposition of the drivers
of gas exchange. However, to fully evaluate dyspnea, we must address pulmonary hypertension (PH) and
hypoxia. We do this by quantifying cardiogenic RBC signal oscillations, which can differentiate pre- and post-
capillary PH and exploiting the 129Xe-RBC chemical shift to interrogate mean capillary blood oxygenation. But to
incorporate these powerful 129Xe-RBC biomarkers, we must know how they are affected hemoglobin, changing
alveolar oxygen tension and how they respond to changes in pulmonary vascular flow. Our long-term goal is to
develop a 5-min, comprehensive, 129Xe MRI/MRS exam that reveals all the treatable traits of dyspnea. We bring
a track-record of pioneering studies, advanced acquisition, reconstruction and analysis methods, and
experienced clinician co-investigators who can access the necessary patient populations and comparative
clinical assessments. The objective of this renewal is to demonstrate interventions that change each of the three
129Xe-RBC related biomarkers – RBC transfer, cardiogenic oscillations, and chemical shift. Our central
hypothesis is that by employing appropriate patient populations and carefully selected interventions, each of
these 129Xe-RBC markers can be modified in a way that solidifies our understanding of them for clinical decision
making. The rationale for the proposed research is to advance these biomarkers into multi-center clinical trials
to expand upon anticipated FDA approval for 129Xe ventilation MRI. This work is relevant to the NIH Mission of
improving health by developing and accelerating the application of biomedical technologies. We will pursue three
Specific Aims: 1) Establish and validate a hemoglobin correction for 129Xe MRI, 2) determine the effect of oxygen
administration on 129Xe MRI/MRS Metrics, and 3) measure longitudinal therapeutic change in acute and chronic
pulmonary embolism. Completion of these aims will 1) establish understanding of the RBC-associated 129Xe
biomarkers, 2) how they respond to therapy, and 3) set the stage for broader studies of O2 therapy. The proposed
approach is innovative because it uses novel technologies, patient groups and interventions to uncover the
physiological drivers of dyspnea. It is significant because it will enable development of a single 5-minute 129Xe
MRI/MRS exam that can efficiently assess the multiple possible etiologies of breathlessness."

important because it is actively metabolized in muscle and can function against muscle degeneration. Previously,
leucine was thought to maintain muscle mass by activating mTORC1, a protein kinase upregulating general
protein and lipid anabolism. However, as demonstrated by our recent work and the work of others, mTORC1
upregulation rather produced degenerative phenotypes and wasting of muscle mass, while modest mTORC1
suppression was found to be beneficial for maintaining muscle homeostasis during aging. Therefore, leucine’s
role in the preservation of muscle structure and function may be independent of mTORC1 activation and needs
to be clarified. Over the previous funding period, our research group has been focusing on Sestrins, a family of
highly conserved proteins that are induced upon various stress inputs. Using both biochemical and genetic
methodologies, we have shown that Sestrins are multifunctional proteins that control many metabolism-
controlling pathways including redox signaling, protein kinase signaling (AMPK, mTORC1, mTORC2 and AKT),
and autophagy. Through genetic studies in mice and flies, we have shown that Sestrins have a critical
physiological role in mediating exercise benefits. Furthermore, experiments of others have shown that Sestrins
can bind and sense leucine. Although it is quite evident that Sestrins are at the crossroads between exercise,
leucine, and muscle homeostasis, mechanisms of how these components are connected to each other are
unclear. For instance, Sestrins, which inhibit mTORC1 (muscle anabolic kinase), function to preserve muscle
function and mass during aging and disuse. Leucine was suggested to antagonize Sestrin’s mTORC1-
suppressing activities, activating mTORC1. Yet, both leucine and Sestrins are beneficial for muscle health
despite playing opposite roles in mTORC1 signaling. We propose to solve the intricate relationships between
exercise, leucine and Sestrins through innovative methodologies combining purified protein complexes, ex vivo
culture of myotubes, in vivo animal models, and Seq-Scope, the state-of-the-art ultra-high-resolution spatial
transcriptomic technology developed by our own team. With respect to the expected outcomes, the work
proposed here could clarify the critical functions of Sestrins in integrating the metabolic benefits of leucine and
exercise in muscle homeostasis. Such results would have an important positive impact, because they will provide
us with a clearer picture of how leucine and exercise can improve muscle homeostasis and provide better
preventive and therapeutic rationales for preserving muscle strength and functionality during aging and disuse
by controlling Sestrin activities."

Goals: Dr. Perlis requests K24 support to: 1) maintain and expand his mentoring of junior investigators in the
area of behavioral sleep medicine (BSM) and in the biopsychosocial approach to the study of insomnia; and 2)
expand his program of research on sleep and aging. Background: Dr. Perlis has been involved in patient-oriented
research since his late-20’s. He has been the beneficiary of exceptional mentorship and has carried forward this
tradition over the entirety of his career. His research, while narrow in focus, extends from basic to patient-oriented
to epidemiologic studies. His work includes 175 peer reviewed articles, 38 chapters, and three books. Four of the
chapters are in our field’s flagship text book, the Principles and Practice of Sleep Medicine. The work has been
highly impactful (H-Index of 68 with over 19,000 citations) and has earned him the SBSM’s Peter Hauri Lifetime
Achievement award, nominations for the SRS’s Mary Carskadon Education Award, and the SBSM’s “Champion of
BSM” Award. Environment: The University of Pennsylvania is one of the nation’s premier centers for sleep and
chronobiology research and sleep medicine / behavioral sleep medicine clinical services. As such, it has much
to offer both the PI and his trainees. Development Activities: The core activity for the mentor’s professional
development will be the implementation of a 2nd generation of monthly seminar series focused on Sleep and
Aging. This series will be co-hosted with Dr. Michael Grander as part of the University of Arizona’s Essential
Topics in Behavioral Sleep Medicine Lecture Series. Leading scientists will be invited to discuss their ideas with
respect to the effects of aging on sleep. These lectures will be offered as video conferences (open to all at no
cost) and will be archived so that they may be accessed into the foreseeable future. During the K24 time frame,
Dr. Perlis will also complete the development of an open access sleep health screener and a sleep tracker app.
Both will be setup to capture data from thousands of individuals. Both will serve as data archives. Research: The
candidate has created a collaborative network to conduct archival analysis with Jr. Investigators using his NIA
supported: 1) natural history of insomnia databases and 2) partial reinforcement of medical treatment of insomnia
databases (n=3). Additionally, his trainees and collaborators will have access to his programs’ recruitment
database (n=5000+), his ISI in psychiatry screening database (n=3,000), a risk benefit network meta-analysis
database (PI: J. Cheung), his newly established screener and tracker databases, and three industry databases
(two of which will be used to profile sleep in patients with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease; one of which will
be used to profile acute and chronic placebo response in patients with insomnia, with a focus on age effects on
placebo responding). The individuals invited to analyze one or more of the 12 databases will have specialty
areas apart from the PI, and thus will serve as an opportunity for the PI to both teach and learn. A conference
will be held in the 5th year of this award for all collaborators and trainees. Significance: This K24 will support Dr.
Perlis’ efforts to promote and mentor patient-oriented research, with a focus on aging effects on sleep continuity."

This is a Beeson K76 career development award for Dr. Lindsay Hampson, a clinician investigator with a
background in ethics, health services research, and stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Dr. Hampson is
pivoting her career towards aging, with a goal of becoming a national leader in geriatric urology research
focused on achieving goal-concordant care for older adults with urologic issues that affect quality of life (QOL)
through reducing treatment disparities and improving treatment decision-making. This proposal seeks to
improve goal-concordant management for post-prostatectomy SUI among older adults by: 1) identifying
drivers of disparities in the care of older post-prostatectomy men, 2) determining treatment preferences and
priorities of this patient population, and 3) promoting individualized evaluation and treatment decision-making
in the context of geriatric-informed health and values. Significance: Post-prostatectomy SUI significantly
impacts QOL, disproportionately impacting older men. Despite a focus on reducing treatment of prostate
cancer, one quarter of men 65-75 years of age diagnosed with prostate cancer will still undergo prostatectomy.
An estimated 25-30% of men are using pads, diapers, or complaining of bothersome incontinence beyond one
year following prostatectomy, and these rates likely represent underestimation of continence rates in older
men. SUI surgery has been shown to result in near-term QOL improvements with high satisfaction rates, yet is
severely underutilized and delayed, and men facing treatment decisions have substantial decisional regret. In
Aim 1’s national cohort study using Veterans Affairs and Medicare data, we aim to identify factors associated
with post-prostatectomy SUI under-treatment and treatment delays among older men. In Aim 2’s discrete
choice experiment survey of older post-prostatectomy men, we aim to identify patient-centered SUI treatment
priorities and understand how these preferences vary based on characteristics associated with access to care.
These data will be utilized to develop an Incontinence Post-Prostatectomy Assessment & Decision Support (I-
PADS) tool which will be evaluated in Aim 3 through a mixed methods study and feasibility/acceptability trial.
Mentoring team: Dr. Hampson’s exceptional multidisciplinary mentoring team is led by Dr. Louise Walter, an
internationally recognized expert on individualized decision making for in older adults. This award will support
Dr. Hampson’s transition to aging research through dedicated training in 1) conducting national cohort
studies of older adults, 2) developing expertise in measuring treatment preferences, 3) implementation science
theory and methods to implement interventions for older adults, and 4) leadership in geriatric urology to
become a leader in goal-concordant urologic care among older adults by reducing treatment disparities and
improving treatment decision-making. Next Steps: These results will serve as the foundation for a multicenter
hybrid implementation-effectiveness study of the I-PADS tool to test its effect on addressing disparities in SUI
surgery, decisional and treatment regret, and receipt of goal-concordant care for post-prostatectomy SUI."
10928787,"Project Summary/Abstract
 In 2014, the state of Maryland, under a federal waiver, enacted an all-payer Global Budget Revenue (GBR)
model that prospectively set limits on hospital revenue. It also required the state to limit growth in per-capita
spending and mandated reductions in preventable complications and readmissions. GBR implementation was
associated with savings to the Medicare Trust Fund and considerations are now underway to expand the
program to other regions. However, there is limited understanding of GBR’s impact on the delivery of cancer-
related services. It is possible that while GBR may incentivize reduced healthcare expenditures and care
improvements on average, it could be associated with unintended effects and poor performance for cancer
patients by limiting access to effective cancer treatments. GBR may have deleterious effects on prevailing
cancer care inequities by encouraging adverse patient selection towards racial minorities and patients with
socioeconomic vulnerability due to concerns about higher spending and worse clinical outcomes. Current
evaluations of the GBR program have not examined these impacts. We aim to address this evidence gap in
this proposal. Our research is important because acute hospital care, the focus of GBR incentives, is a key
driver of overall spending and regional variation in spending for patients with cancer.
 The objective of this proposal is to systematically examine, via a difference-in-differences design, the impact
of the GBR model on spending, quality-of-care, and utilization among fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries
and nonelderly Medicaid and commercial insurance beneficiaries with cancer in Maryland compared with
similar patients in control states. Our central hypothesis is that the financial incentives in GBR will lower
spending, improve care quality, and facilitate a shift in the site of care for chemotherapy administration across
our populations of interest. Additionally, we hypothesize that GBR implementation will lead to relatively worse
clinical outcomes and relatively greater spending for historically marginalized patients. We will test our
hypotheses and achieve our objectives with the following specific aims: Aim 1: Quantify the impact of GBR on
risk-adjusted spending for beneficiaries undergoing chemotherapy. Aim 2: Assess the impact of GBR on the
likelihood of chemotherapy receipt and on care quality for beneficiaries undergoing chemotherapy. Aim
3: Assess the impact of GBR on the type of chemotherapy (physician-administered vs. oral) and site of
physician-administered chemotherapy (hospital outpatient department vs. physician office setting). Aim 4:
Assess the differential effects of GBR implementation on care delivery for historically marginalized patients,
based on area-level deprivation, race and ethnicity, and dual-eligible status, who are undergoing
chemotherapy. Our findings will meaningfully advance our understanding of how to deliver efficient, high-
quality cancer care to adult patients. It will also provide timely information to policy-makers that would guide
updates to GBR and mitigate the risk of unintended consequences in future global budget initiatives."

 Obesity is associated with increased postmenopausal estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer (BC)
risk and a 2-4 fold increase in mortality from all BC subtypes. Mechanisms of increased resistance to therapy
and ensuing fatal BC metastasis in obesity remain unclear. Here, we study how the inflammatory state of obesity
drives ER+ BC. We study how postmenopausal estrogen, estrone (E1), which is 3-fold higher in obesity, co-
operates with NFκB and the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE) to upregulate metastasis.
 Our data indicate that BC cell:adipocyte contact activates NFκB and E1:ERα to induce pro-inflammatory
cytokine genes in both cell types, stimulating greater cancer stem cell expansion, and rapid ER+ BC growth and
metastasis. Preliminary data show NFκB and E1:ER co-stimulate genes encoding RAGE-ligands (S100A8/A9).
RAGE is a major NFκB activator in other cell types (including immune and endothelial cells), but little is known
of RAGE/NFκB signaling in BC. We showed that RAGE acts in both tumor cells and the host microenvironment
(stroma and fat) to upregulate cytokines that recruit myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) to promote
metastasis. In obese mice, E1 increases BC growth, in part by stimulating immune evasion. New data show
antiestrogen-resistant ER+BC lines, including those bearing ESR1 mutations, show increased NFκB activity and
RAGE levels. Moreover, the investigational RAGE inhibitor, TTP488, cooperates with the ER-blocker, fulvestrant,
to arrest antiestrogen-resistant ER+ BC cell growth in multiple resistant lines. Here, we test if E1-bound ER,
NFκB, and RAGE interact in ER+ BC, adipocytes and immune cells to drive gene programs of endocrine therapy
resistance and if RAGE inhibitors reverse this.
 We hypothesize that E1:ER and NFκB cooperate to induce RAGE, and RAGE activates NFκB in ER+ BC
tumor cells and peritumoral fat to drive pro-inflammatory, pro-metastatic gene expression programs of tumor
progression and acquired drug resistance. Aim 1 will identify tumor cell-intrinsic feed-forward mechanisms
mediating RAGE/ NFκB activation in an E1-rich breast cancer environment, testing if E1 and NFκB induce RAGE
to activate Rac1, and TLR4 driving feed-forward oncogenic NFκB activation in ER+ BC. Aim 2 will test if RAGE
mediates pro-oncogenic, pro-inflammatory target gene activation by E1/ER and NFκB in breast cancer cells. We
will identify E1/ER and NFκB cistromes and transcriptomes and test if these require RAGE. The relevance of
RAGE-dependent ER/κB co-target genes activation in obesity will be validated by comparing ScRNAseq in
human ER+ breast cancers from obese and lean donors. Aim 3 will identify tumor cell-extrinsic mechanisms
whereby peritumoral fat in obese hosts promotes acquired antiestrogen resistance and immune evasion in ER+
cancers. Aim 4 will test if RAGE inhibitors restore endocrine therapy responses in organoid and PDX models
derived from ER+ breast cancers. This work could identify new approaches to treating acquired endocrine
resistance in metastatic ER+BC, particularly in obese patients."
10892289,"Sudden cardiac death due to stress-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias remains the major cause of mortality
in the world. Mitochondrial metabolic output in ventricular myocytes (VMs) is tightly linked to intracellular Ca2+
cycling in a process called excitation-contraction-bioenergetics (ECB) coupling. Disturbances in this process
contribute to arrhythmias not only in acquired conditions such as heart failure (HF), hypertrophy or aging, but in
heritable arrhythmia syndromes as well. During catecholaminergic surge, i.e. stress and maximum workload,
an increase in intracellular Ca2+ transient amplitude results in increased matrix [Ca2+] influx and accelerated
ATP production to meet increased metabolic demand. However, it comes with the risk of increased generation
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the electron transport chain (ETC). This can overcome antioxidant
defenses and adversely affect Ca2+ handling machinery and the ryanodine receptor (RyR2), promoting Ca2+
dependent arrhythmia. Therefore, the main objective of current proposal is the identification of new approaches
to maintain mitochondrial ROS and Ca2+homeostasis to improve cardiac function and reduce arrhythmic risk in
diseased hearts. In the course of preliminary studies, we discovered that a reduction in the formation of
quaternary supercomplexes from the elements of ETC plays a key role in accelerated mito-ROS production in
VMs from hypertrophic rat hearts and hearts from genetic rat model of catecholaminergic polymorphic
ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). Pilot studies revealed that changes in expression levels of two proteins can
underlie less compact ETC organization, namely (1) COX7RP, a key regulator of supercomplex formation, and
(2) structural protein OPA1 which controls mitochondria cristae diameter. Importantly, we discovered that
expression levels of both these proteins are higher in healthy females vs males, suggesting fundamental
differences in ECB coupling between sexes. Accordingly, two specific aims are proposed. Aim 1: To
determine the role and mechanisms of RyR2 hyperactivity-mediated changes in mitochondria function.
We created a unique gain-of RyR2 function rat model of CPVT to test the hypothesis that RyR2 hyperactivity
contributes to activation of Ca2+-dependent protease calpain residing in mitochondria intermembrane space
leading to OPA1 proteolysis. Aim 2: To determine the mechanisms and physiological significance of
COX7RP-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiac arrhythmias linked to RyR2 hyperactivity. We
hypothesize that COX7RP downregulation is the key contributor to the deficient mitochondria electron transport
and increased mito-ROS emission in cardiac hypertrophy and failure exacerbating pro-arrhythmic Ca2+i
mishandling."
10922866,"Project Summary / Abstract
The goal of clinical management in eye care is to protect patients’ vision and consequent quality of life. Yet, the
impact of vision loss on an individual’s quality of life depends not only on its severity, but also on its location
within the visual field. Some tasks are predominantly impacted by central visual field loss, while others rely more
on differing regions of the peripheral visual field. Thus, two individuals with the same disease severity could have
very different experiences of that loss. This is particularly true for glaucoma, which causes localized loss in
locations that can differ greatly between individuals. In this project, we will determine the regions of the visual
field that most influence different aspects of quality of life. We will derive quantitative metrics of the likely real-
world effects of an individual patient’s visual field defect that can be obtained without relying on time-consuming
and variable questionnaires. These patient-centered metrics can aid clinicians in prioritizing care and choosing
appropriate management strategies; and in explaining to an individual patient what the likely consequences are
of their disease, both as motivation to maintain medication adherence and so that they can make necessary
adjustments to their activities of daily living. In Aim 1, we will derive indices predicting the effect of an individual’s
visual field loss on different patient-reported outcome measures, by parameterizing results from clinical standard
automated perimetry, to maximize correlations with results of patient questionnaires from four large studies of
ocular hypertension and glaucoma. In Aim 2, we will use similar analyses to predict the impact on visual search
as measured by a custom-written test, performed on a tablet computer in glaucoma clinic waiting rooms and
testing rooms. In Aim 3, we will predict the impact of an individual’s visual field loss on the visual contribution to
balance and subsequent risk of falling, using objective measurements of balance in both high and low ambient
light settings. Overall, the project will provide substantial advances in our understanding of the effects of localized
visual field loss as caused by glaucoma, and provide invaluable new information for clinicians and patients."
10880713,"ABSTRACT – Project 2
The overall objective of this Program project application is to generate a comprehensive understanding of the
complex host-pathogen interactions critical for HIV reservoir persistence and decay post-PD-1/PD-L1 signaling
blockade by monoclonal antibodies in HIV-cancer participants. The knowledge gap we address in Project 2 is
how the maintenance of HIV reservoirs by different systemic inflammatory mediators (circulating microbiome,
host/non-host metabolites and cytokines/chemokines) in the participants can modulate HIV reservoir persistence
and its susceptibility to the immune intervention (decay vs non-decay). We will also address how this initial
virological and inflammatory milieu can lead to a broad impact of the intervention in the immune responses. In
yet unpublished data we demonstrate that metabolites downstream of commensal bacteria can impact on the
magnitude of the HIV reservoir, and HIV integration dynamics and by modulating cell fate (innate and adaptive,
importantly CD4 T cells, the major HIV reservoir), this milieu can influence the responsiveness to the immune
intervention. We have recruited 3 cohorts of PWH also affected by cancers to help us to address these
knowledge gaps. In this proposal we will apply state of the art virological assays and integrated multi-OMICs
immunological assays to test the hypothesis that distinct microbiomes and metabolomes prevalent in HIV-
cancer participants pre-immune intervention with aPD-1/PD-L1 drive the different virological outcomes
(vDNA and vRNA) post-intervention and immunological (innate and adaptive immunity) readouts as early
as day 1 post-treatment. The specific objectives of Project 2 are to i) evaluate the quantity and the quality
of the HIV reservoir pre-immune intervention and its modulation post-immune intervention; ii) to evaluate
how the immune intervention reverse immune dysfunction (innate and adaptive); and iii) to evaluate how
the host circulating milieu pre-immune intervention, based on microbiome and metabolites composition,
is associated with the reservoir dynamics and immune responses post-immune intervention in HIV-
cancer participants from the 3 different cohorts.
The proposed research builds on our expertise with HIV-cancer cohorts and established systems immunology
approaches to deeply interrogate HIV reservoirs and immune function. The ability to immune intervene in these
cohorts with different strategies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling gives us the unique opportunity to modulate
reservoir persistence and immune function. We will work with the Bioinformatic Core to perform data analysis
and integration across all 3 projects of this program and we are confident that the research proposed in Project
2 will lead to important discoveries regarding immune regulation of HIV reservoirs and immune dysfunction in
HIV-cancer cohorts. It is our objective to turn these discoveries into better defined clinical trial protocols
to advance research towards a cure for cancer-HIV participants and also extend it to PWH without
cancer."

Immune cell-based therapies have been postulated to be able to induce HIV remission and facilitate antiretroviral
therapy (ART) discontinuation. To date, allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) with CCR5∆32/∆32
donor cells is the only medical intervention that has been able to cure HIV in up to five reported cases. Allo-
HSCT also results in a dramatic reduction in the HIV reservoir even when using non-mutated CCR5 donor cells.
Passive transfer of autologous CCR5-modified CD4 T cells has emerged as a more affordable, less-risky,
alternative to reinstate an HIV-refractory immune cell milieu. In this proposal we will define the role of the host
environment (including host/non-host metabolites) on virological and immunological outcomes. To this end we
will access PBMCs and plasma, and clinical metadata from three independent study populations: the IciStem
cohort (allo-HSCT) and 2 cohorts of subjects infused with autologous CCR5-modified CD4 T cells. We
hypothesize that a pre-intervention plasma milieu (microbiota associated metabolites and cytokines) allows for
better engraftment of both allo-HSCT and autologous CCR5-modified CD4 T cells which is associated with
reduced HIV reservoir and rejuvenation of CD4 and CD8 memory stem cells (Tscm) and effector cells and innate
cell antiviral responses that limit HIV rebound upon ATI. In aim1 we will identify the impact of the host
environment driving the heterogeneity of virological features including frequencies of cells with intact provirus
integrity of viral sequences, integration sites and translation competence prevalent during long-lasting viral
control pre-intervention and which can impact on the kinetics of viral load rebound and immune reconstitution
post engraftment. In aim 2 we will identify the impact of host environment on the magnitude of host-donor
chimerism, innate immune activation and stem-like CD4+ T-cell associated immune reconstitution. Our
preliminary data show that frequencies of HIV resistant CD4 TSCM are the best predictors of long-term control
of viral load post adoptive transfer of autologous CD4 T cells. Microbial and host metabolites are important
modulators of the differentiation and effector function of innate and adaptive immune cells. Hence selected pro-
inflammatory metabolites could impact on the development of these T cell stem cells and as well HIV resistant
myeloid cells by promoting their activation and differentiation and this will impede on BM engraftment. In aim 3
we will define parallel virological and metabolic mechanisms that are associated with viral control post autologous
CCR5 modified CD4+ T-cell therapy and all-HSCT intervention. The virological features listed above, and the
host and environmental features cited in Aims 1 and 2 will impact on adoptive transfer of autologous HIV resistant
CD4 T cells as they did for BMT. The experimental design includes virology, immunology and multiomic cutting
edge technologies which will be integrated to provide novel validated mechanistic evidence as to the role of host
factors in shaping the heterogeneity of the response to immune cell-based therapies in HIV cure strategies."

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent disorder that is primarily attributed to
smoking, and which disproportionately affects Veterans. New therapeutic approaches are needed as neither
current therapies nor smoking cessation halt the irreversible decline in lung function once initiated. The
chronic infiltration of inflammatory cells is a hallmark of COPD and results from both innate and adaptive
immune responses. Natural killer cells (NKs) are innate cells that have been shown to mediate rapid
cytotoxicity towards autologous lung epithelial cells in COPD. Our long-term goal is to understand whether we
can use an immunotherapy approach to suppress lung NK cytotoxicity against lung parenchyma without
compromising immune surveillance. To this end, regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been shown to suppress NKs
but Tregs are known to be decreased in COPD, suggesting that the loss of Tregs may be contributing to the
increased cytotoxicity of lung NKs in COPD. Our Central Hypothesis is that increasing Treg functionality will
block the cytotoxicity of lung NKs from COPD patients and will reduce NK-driven lung destruction in a murine
model of COPD. Our proposal will use human lung tissue and paired peripheral blood and an established
murine model of cigarette smoke exposure. Aim 1 will confirm the ability of circulating human Tregs to
suppress lung NK cytotoxicity in vitro and will determine whether this is limited to a specific Treg subset. After
confirming the potential for Tregs to modulate NKs, we will focus on addressing critical knowledge gaps
essential to designing trials of novel Treg therapies in COPD. The goal of Aim 2 will be to test the in vivo
effects of adoptively transferring Treg subsets into our murine model. Specifically, we will evaluate Treg
suppression of NKs and T cells and also determine how the inflammatory environment effects Treg phenotype,
stability, and migration. In Aim 3, we will focus on improving the stability of Tregs as they have been shown to
have functional plasticity when introduced to a proinflammatory environment. Increasing the stability of the
Tregs should also increase their long-term suppressive potential. We will conclude by testing the effects of our
optimized Treg therapy in a 6-month cigarette smoke exposure murine model and determine whether we can
halt progressive lung destruction. Successful completion of this project will provide crucial data, which are not
currently available, on the potential of Treg therapy to regulate NK cytotoxicity and treat COPD. There are
currently >280 ongoing clinical trials using Treg therapy for the treatment of autoimmune disease and organ
transplant, but there are no studies of Treg therapy in COPD."
10867403,"Project Summary
The relationship between chronic stress and human anxiety disorders and depression is clear from
epidemiological and clinical studies. Stress induces the release of neuromodulators that coordinate
adaptive behavioral responses, but sustained activation of stress pathways results in dysregulation of
circuits that can bias behavior toward maladaptive behavioral ensembles. Further, it is not clear why
some individuals are susceptible to long term behavioral changes induced by stress and others are not.
Acetylcholine (ACh) is released in response to stressful stimuli in multiple brain areas that govern
behavioral responses to stressors. ACh signaling is important for adaptive behaviors, but also facilitates
stress-related learning and hypervigilance and promotes stress-related avoidance. We have identified
receptor subtypes that mediate effects of ACh in the amygdala, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in
response to stressors, and have begun to identify mechanisms that may modulate transitions to
maladaptive behavioral ensembles. In the studies proposed here we will study the role of ACh in 1)
acute, and 2) experience-dependent behavioral responses to stressors, and 3) test a novel hypothesis
that prolonged ACh signaling may alter the balance in attention/encoding of aversive vs. appetitive
stimuli. A negative cognitive bias is commonly observed in patients with anxiety disorders, depression or
post-traumatic stress disorder; therefore, discovering a role for ACh in modulation of stress and reward
encoding could result in novel directions for therapeutic development based on cholinergic mechanisms."

This application is submitted in response to RFA-DK-22-502, “Limited Competition for the
Continuation of the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Clinical Centers (U01),” aka Phase 5
of CRIC, for the Hopkins/University of Maryland (Hopkins/UMB) Clinical Center. Since its inception,
CRIC has recruited and followed a racially and ethnically diverse cohort of 5,625 participants with
reduced kidney function at 7 Clinical Centers across the US. As the landmark cohort study of CKD, it
has accomplished extensive biological, physiological, and social phenotyping, longitudinal follow-up,
and ascertainment of clinical and patient-centered outcomes across multiple domains. In the
process, it has made major scientific contributions. In Phase 5, CRIC will have the following aims:
 1) ascertain clinical outcomes for all participants including those enrolled in the Phase 4 sub-
protocols,
 2) perform analyses linking the sub-protocol measurements to clinical outcomes,
 3) integrate data from multiple domains to identify sub-phenotypes underlying the heterogeneity
 in CKD progression outcomes,
 4) conduct final study visits for the full CRIC cohort eligible for Phase 5,
 5) create mechanisms for future data collection via linkages with external sources of health data,
 6) generate tools and resources to facilitate ongoing use of CRIC data and biospecimens by a
 broad group of investigators after the CRIC Study has officially ended.
Leveraging its vast expertise in the design, conduct, and dissemination of high quality observational
research, the investigative team at Hopkins/UMB contributed substantively to scientific and
operational aspects of CRIC, and ultimately its success. During Phases 1-4 of CRIC, the
Hopkins/UMB Clinical Center was a high performing center that exceeded its recruitment goals during
the Phase 1 and 3 recruitment drives; achieved high re-enrollment and follow-up rates in Phases 2-4;
collected high quality data; implemented the Phase 4 subprotocols; and contributed substantially to
the productivity of the study. Likewise, center investigators and senior staff have consistently had
prominent leadership roles (e.g. Co-Chairs of Recruitment/Retention, Ancillary Studies, and
Publications Subcommittees). In Phase 5, the Hopkins/UMB team is extremely well-positioned to
implement the Phase 5 protocol and contribute substantively as CRIC transitions from an active
cohort study to a long-lasting resource that supports ongoing and future mechanistic, epidemiologic,
and translational investigations."

Our cells are constantly exposed to mutagens that cause DNA damage, which if left unrepaired, cause mutations.
At the cellular level, the progressive accumulation of mutations in somatic tissues drives carcinogenesis and
other diseases. Despite significant advances in our understanding of mutational processes, the answer to many
fundamental questions is still a mystery. What are the genetic causes of mutations in human tissues? How
do different cell types in the human body control DNA damage and repair? Despite our large body of
knowledge in the pathways that control DNA damage and repair in model organisms, we lack a deep
understanding of this process in human tissues. This would be critical to understand how mutations lead to
human diseases including carcinogenesis.
Here we will use a highly innovative approach to build MutSensor, a set of mutation reporters to estimate
DNA mutation frequency in mammalian cells with a sensitivity >50-fold higher than that of existing
methods. The ability to build and precision deliver these MutSensors is enabled by “Genetic Writing and
Delivery” system developed in the Boeke lab. This novel method will allow large-scale functional genetic
screening at an unprecedented scale. Building on our preliminary data, we aim at comprehensively identify all
genes that regulate mutation frequency in different human cell types. To this purpose, we will utilize loss- and
gain-of-function screening libraries to determine the effect of genetic perturbations on mutation frequency across
cell types.
These studies will provide an unprecedented systematic map of genes and pathways controlling DNA damage
and mutations across different human cell types. In addition, our novel methodology will represent an important
asset for the scientific community that can have several biomedical applications in a variety of fields
providing an easy tool to study genetic factors that control mutagenesis in health and disease states,
including (but not limited to) carcinogenesis."
10925339,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The ability to detect sensorimotor contingencies between an organism's actions and changes in the
environment is essential to survival, impacting social, motor, affective, and cognitive domains. Operant
conditioning paradigms provide a direct measure of contingency learning, and are amenable for use
throughout infancy. The primary goal of this research is to determine whether individual variations in
contingency learning are consistent or correlated across tasks and/or across development, and to determine
whether these measures predict future standardized measures of cognition. To this end, we will longitudinally
test infants from 6-18 months using two established infant operant conditioning tasks—the synchronous
reinforcement paradigm and train task—each involving a different response system (looking vs. lever pressing)
and reinforcer. Despite the fact that learning is universally regarded as a fundamental component of human
behavior, after over a century of behavioral science, we simply do not know whether or to what degree
individual differences in measures of learning in infancy are consistent psychometrically, or whether they are
directly associated with broader cognitive and language outcomes. There is substantial demand for the
inclusion of measures of learning in clinical trials as potential outcomes for early interventions, but these
fundamental issues have never been previously established or investigated in infancy. This proposal features
two investigators with direct expertise in operant learning paradigms for infants and in conducting longitudinal
projects; here, they seek to establish the fundamental psychometric properties of individual differences in
classic parameters of operant conditioning within ages across tasks and across ages, and to establish the
developmental course of these parameters. We also seek to determine the predictive validity of these
individual differences, whether the indicators themselves or their developmental functions are predictive of
standardized 24-month outcomes. We propose to use two paradigms that utilize different operants (looking
and motor actions) each of which have previously been established as valid and workable in published
literature. Learning within traditional conditioning paradigms has long been neglected in the area of human
infancy; this study has the potential to resurrect learning in infant studies and developmental science. Given
that differences in contingency learning have been noted in at-risk infant samples and learning is often used in
preclinical animal work, this work would serve to provide a connection between preclinical studies and clinical
trials. Our findings will have critical implications for the use of learning in clinical trials and long-term outcome
studies."

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a progressive disease affecting around 30,000 people in the US and is caused by a
mutation in a gene affecting the CFTR protein that regulates mucus composition. In airways in the lung this leads
to mucus stasis, infection, and remodeling that result in mucus plugs, poor ventilation, and progressive airway
destruction. Highly-effective CFTR modulators, now available to >90% of patients, have revolutionized clinical
care, with increases in pulmonary function via more effective mucociliary clearance. Burdensome maintenance
therapies like airway clearance treatment (ACT) require around 2 dedicated hours per day and have been
questioned by patients, families, and medical providers. In a recent CF-community survey, airway clearance was
ranked as the most burdensome therapy. Traditional studies of therapy withdrawal pose some patient risk, since
measurement is via relatively insensitive pulmonary function testing (PFT) and lung-function reductions can have
permanent consequences. Breakthroughs in structural and hyperpolarized-gas MRI demonstrate exquisite
sensitivity to CF lung disease and can be used to monitor regional and subtle changes over time, much more
precisely than PFTs, and with regional specificity. MRI provides a unique opportunity to safely evaluate ACT.
 The overarching goal of our proposal is to determine effectiveness of ACT in the era of highly effective CFTR
modulators by studying structure-function relationships via MRI in patients of varying severity who have stopped
and restarted ACT. We will achieve this goal via three separate, hypothesis-driven Aims in this clinical trial:
Hypothesis 1: Patients who have relatively low structural defects will have fewer ventilation defects and higher
pulmonary function, and these defects will relate to frequency of ACT usage. Specific Aim 1: To perform UTE
and hyperpolarized Xe MRI in 30 CF patients aged 12-21, approximately 15 of whom have self-withdrawn ACT,
to regionally characterize obstructive severity and correlate regional structural lung abnormalities (via UTE
FLORET MRI) to functional deficits (via Xe MRI)
Hypothesis 2: Patients who have self-withdrawn ACT after initiation of effective modulators will demonstrate
increases in regional ventilation after reinitiating treatment, with greater ventilation increases in patients with a
higher level of lung abnormalities. Specific Aim 2: To perform a stepwise ACT re-initiation trial in fifteen 12-21
y.o. patients who have self-withdrawn airway clearance treatment (defined as ≤ 3x/week). UTE and Xe MRI,
spirometry, and multiple-breath washout will be performed at baseline, after increasing treatment to 7x/week for
1 week and then 14x/week for 2 weeks, with daily logging to aid compliance and study engagement.
Hypothesis 3: Patients who currently use 2x daily ACT and have few lung abnormalities on MRI can reduce to
1x daily or less, with no significant functional changes in the lung. Specific Aim 3: To perform a stepwise ACT
withdrawal trial in fifteen 12-21 y.o. patients who have low MRI abnormalities and high FEV1. Patients will be
studied at baseline, after decreasing ACT to 7x/wk for 1 week, and after decreasing ACT to 3x/wk for 1 week."
10898926,"The overall goal of this application is to define mechanisms of glycan metabolism by bacteria inhabiting the
human gut microbiome so as to establish novel therapeutic pathways to manipulating the composition of the gut
microbial community to treat myriad human diseases. The gut microbiota has a profound effect on human health
and physiology, providing the host benefits such as modulation of immune development, inhibition of pathogen
colonization, digestion of dietary fibers and absorption of nutrients. Abnormalities in microbiota composition, or
dysbiosis, however, have been implicated in numerous and diverse disease states. A critical variable that
dictates the composition and physiology of the microbiota is the influx of glycans into the intestine, mostly from
diet and host mucosal secretions. Given the broad diversity of glycans that enter and exist in the gut,
microorganisms must possess varied and efficient strategies for competing for these nutrients, on which they
depend as a critical energy source. Despite the prominence of glycans in the human intestine and its documented
role in controlling important aspects of health and disease, the molecular mechanisms of glycan breakdown and
import employed by gut microbes remain poorly understood. This severely limits our ability to build an intellectual
framework for the design of methods and molecules with which to remodel the composition of the gut microbiota
in order to improve human health – for instance, to favor commensal over pathogenic bacteria or to limit the
growth of inflammatory or antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Here, we propose mechanistic studies using biochemical,
biophysical and genetic techniques to define pathways employed by gut microbes for the degradation and import
of various glycans, and to determine the structures and functions of key enzymes that release glycans, as well
as their interactions and functional cooperation with proteins that capture these released glycans. This work is
significant because it addresses molecular mechanisms involved in the major human health burden of dysbiosis.
The proposed studies are innovative both technically and conceptually – from the development and employment
of novel mass spectrometry-based methods for measuring the specificity and kinetics of protein deglycosylation
to the hypotheses that a single bacterium can express multiple enzymes with the same glycan specificity in order
to survive in distinct environments and that glycan-hydrolyzing enzymes have evolved to become a new class of
cell surface glycan-binding proteins. The research plan will be accomplished through ongoing and new
collaborations between the Sundberg, Koval and Mallagaray labs, who bring non-overlapping, complementary
and synergistic strengths in structural glycobiology and super-resolution microscopy, resulting in a collaborative
team ideally suited to this project."

MECHANISMS OF SMOOTHENED ACTIVATION IN HEDGEHOG SIGNALING. The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling
pathway coordinates development in humans and most metazoans. In adult tissues, aberrant Hh pathway
activation drives various cancers, including basal cell carcinoma of the skin and pediatric brain
medulloblastoma. An unusual mechanism enables Hh signal transduction. In the basal state, the transporter-
like molecule Patched1 (PTCH1) represses Smoothened (SMO), a seven-transmembrane protein. Hh inhibits
PTCH1, which unleashes SMO activity causing downstream transcription. A leading mechanistic hypothesis is
that cellular sterols activate SMO, but are sequestered by PTCH1 in the absence of Hh. Connecting the
putative transport function of PTCH1 to SMO activation remains one of the central mysteries in understanding
how the Hh signal is transduced across the membrane. A critical gap is how, and which, sterols directly
influence SMO activation. This proposal will address these questions in two aims. The first aim focuses on
which sterols activate SMO. Here, we will combine biochemistry, structural biology, and signaling studies to
define which sterols can activate SMO and how they do so. In the second aim, we focus on how sterol binding
to distinct sites on SMO influences Hh pathway activity. We will use X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron
microscopy, and NMR spectroscopy to generate an integrated high-resolution perspective on where sterols
bind to SMO, and how they influence SMO activity. These studies will provide a mechanistic picture on how the
Hh signal is transduced across the membrane. Such insights may enable the design of SMO inhibitors less
susceptible to tumor resistance or Hh pathway modulators for regenerative medicine."

This proposed R01 is in response to the PAR-21-081 Addressing Health Disparities among Immigrant
Populations through Effective Interventions. Chinese immigrants are the second largest immigrant group in the
U.S., who suffer a disproportionately high type 2 diabetes (T2D) burden and have poor diabetes outcomes.
Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support (DSMES) programs are evidence-based interventions that
provide patients with important counseling and support to navigate diabetes self-management at home.
However, numerous social determinants of health (SDOH) barriers limit the access of DSMES programs to
Chinese immigrants, including high rates of poverty, limited English proficiency (LEP), and lack of access to
care and insurance. Given the high T2D burden and rapid population growth in Chinese immigrants, there is an
urgent need for research to make DSMES accessible to this minority population. High text message use
among Chinese immigrants suggests a promising mechanism for enhancing access to DSMES. Yet, this
mobile health (mhealth) intervention alone is insufficient to address many SDOH barriers reported by LEP
Chinese immigrants (e.g., lack of insurance, financial barriers). Community health worker (CHW) has been
shown as an effective model to address SDOH barriers in health disparity populations. Guided by the NIMHD
Research Framework, we argue that a mHealth intervention that is supplemented with CHW support is a novel
model for enhancing access to DSMES in Chinese immigrants. Our pilot work demonstrates the feasibility,
acceptability, and potential efficacy of a text message-delivered video-based DSMES intervention. The goal of
this R01 is to examine the efficacy of the video-based DSMES (hereafter VIDEO) or the video-based
DSMES+CHW (hereafter VIDEO+CHW) intervention compared with the wait-list control group (hereafter
CONTROL) to improve glycemic control among Chinese immigrants with uncontrolled T2D in NYC.
Participants will be randomized with equal allocation to one of the 3 groups. The VIDEO group will receive 1
DSMES brief video via text messages per week for 24 weeks. The VIDEO+CHW group will receive the same
DSMES videos plus bi-weekly support calls from a CHW for 24 weeks. The CHW will assess participants’
SDOH barriers to T2D care and link them to available resources in the community. The CONTROL group will
continue to receive their usual care and at the end of the study, they will receive DSMES videos. The primary
outcome is HbA1c at 6 months. This study will provide critical information on whether it is efficacious to use an
existing text messaging platform or text message plus CHW support to enhance access to DSMES. If either of
the intervention is proven effective, this project can provide important data for future projects to explore how we
can implement this scalable intervention in real-world settings. This study may serve as a program model for
chronic care in other high-risk immigrants such as LEP Hispanic immigrants who also bear a high T2D burden,
face similar barriers to accessing DMSES programs, and frequently use text messages."
10930873,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 In the height of the opioid crisis in our country, deaths from methamphetamine (METH) overdose are on the
rise, and there is no FDA-approved medication for METH use disorder (MUD). New drug targets are needed,
particularly for people who heavily use the drug because they have the most difficulty quitting METH use, suffer
from a variety of serious neurological problems, and are at high risk to overdose on the drug. Our work with a rat
model of heavy compulsive METH consumption (severe MUD) provided evidence that overexpression of
neuroprotective protein parkin in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key reward-mediating brain area, plays a role
in severe MUD. Parkin is a protein-ubiquitin ligase known to play a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial health
and, therefore, in maintaining generation of cellular energy - adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Our preliminary
proteomic data shows that upregulation of parkin in the NAc leads to upregulation of several Krebs cycle
enzymes whereas parkin knockout leads to their downregulation. Dysfunctional mitochondria are the known
consequence of METH use. This proposal investigates the novel hypothesis that parkin decreases METH
cravings and addictive behaviors by the Krebs cycle function in the NAc from METH neurotoxicity. This
helps to maintain ATP generation in METH-exposed NAc neurons, which otherwise would be impaired by METH-
induced oxidative stress. In other words, we will test whether dysfunctional mitochondria are a cause of MUD.
We will test the hypothesis by three independent specific aims. The specific aim 1 will establish whether and
how parkin protects Krebs cycle function in rat NAc from neurotoxicity of self-administered METH. The specific
aim 2 will determine whether parkin overexpression in the NAc of rats with developed severe MUD will decrease
METH addictive behaviors. The specific aim 3 will determine whether overexpression of oxidative stress-
sensitive Krebs cycle enzyme DLST (dihydrolipoamide S-succinyl-transferase) in the NAc of rats with developed
severe MUD will decrease METH addictive behaviors. Given that parkin may serve a dual function of decreasing
METH neurotoxicity and METH cravings, these studies will determine whether targeting parkin has a significant
therapeutic potential in severe MUD. Given the limited indirect data suggesting that METH neurotoxicity in NAc
mitochondria contributes to development of MUD, these studies will provide clarity about the role of METH-
induced oxidative stress in mediating METH use and in development of motivation to seek METH during
abstinence. Furthermore, the results will benefit opioid and alcohol use disorder research as these disorders
induce mitochondrial dysfunction. Lastly, since chronic use of METH, particularly at high doses, predisposes to
development of Parkinson’s disease and potentially also to Alzheimer’s disease, the results from this research
will add information to these research areas."

Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) causes 100 million infections per year worldwide. The pathogen infects the
gastrointestinal tract, where it triggers intestinal inflammation. Essential to NTS pathogenesis is the ability to
evade host responses and compete with the gut microbiota. Research in my laboratory has contributed to
elucidating the duality of the mucosal response to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm), a highly
prevalent NTS serovar. Particularly, we have shown that STm evades sequestration of essential metal nutrients,
a process known as “nutritional immunity”, to thrive in the inflamed gut and compete with the microbiota. We
discovered: (i) key host factors that modulate nutritional immunity in the inflamed gut, including the cytokine
interleukin-22 (IL-22) and the antimicrobial proteins lipocalin-2 and calprotectin; (ii) several mechanisms and
virulence factors that enable STm to overcome metal nutrient sequestration in the inflamed gut. We also
discovered that, during colitis, the probiotic bacterium Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) competes with STm
for iron and zinc via multiple mechanisms, including expression of high affinity iron and zinc acquisition systems,
and secretion of small antimicrobial molecules termed microcins. Building on this prior work, the primary objective
of this application is to continue to investigate host-microbe and microbe-microbe interaction in the inflamed gut,
a complex environment with unique nutritional challenges for both pathogens and the microbiota. We will
continue to investigate the role of microcins and zinc acquisition systems in the inflamed gut, and we will expand
to elucidating the role of secondary bile acids, including newly discovered microbial conjugated bile acids, in
modulating nutritional immunity. Our central hypothesis is that the host inflammatory response changes the
nutritional and metabolic landscape of the gut, triggering an environment that favors the bloom of
Enterobacteriaceae and promotes microbial competition. In Aim 1, we will elucidate mechanisms of competition
for metal nutrients in the inflamed gut between Salmonella, E. coli Nissle, and the gut microbiota. In Aim 2, we
will evaluate the impact of Salmonella infection on bile acid pool composition, and the impact of these changes
on nutritional immunity. Understanding the host and microbial factors that modulate host immunity, together with
the mechanisms by which STm thrives in this environment, is essential for developing new approaches to limit
STm replication in the inflamed gut."
10909302,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Human herpesvirus(HHV)-8-negative, idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD) is a deadly hematologic
illness involving polyclonal lymphoproliferation and multiple organ system dysfunction. iMCD is diagnosed in
approximately 1,500 individuals annually in the USA; 35% die within 5 years. Limited options exist beyond
cytotoxic chemotherapies for the 66% of patients refractory to interleukin-6 (IL-6) blockade with siltuximab;
relapse is common. The etiology, pathological cell types, and dysregulated signaling pathways are poorly
understood. Improved understanding of disease mechanisms is necessary to identify new treatments.
 In the previous funding cycle, we demonstrated that iMCD patients display increased mTOR signaling in
lymph nodes and activated T cells in circulation. Inhibiting mTOR signaling with sirolimus led to a decrease in
activated T cells and clinical improvement in a subset of patients. However, the signals leading to increased
mTOR activation and alternative pathways involved in treatment-refractory patients remain unknown. We
propose that dysregulated cytokine signaling could be responsible for the increased mTOR signaling in immune
cells and hyperinflammation in iMCD. Our recent preliminary data suggest that T cells from iMCD patients in
remission display increased pS6 expression, a read-out of mTOR activation, upon stimulation with Type I
interferon (IFN-I) and IL-6 compared to healthy controls. Given that IFN-I and IL-6 signal through JAK1 and JAK2,
we hypothesized that JAK1/2 inhibition could abrogate the increased mTOR activation induced by IL-6 and IFN-
I. Indeed, in vitro JAK1/2 inhibition by ruxolitinib abrogated the increased mTOR activation in iMCD patient T
cells. Based on these in vitro results and proteomics data indicating enrichment of JAK-STAT3 signaling across
iMCD patients, we administered ruxolitinib to a highly treatment refractory and critically ill pediatric iMCD patient,
who has been in complete remission for 24 months, 20-fold longer than her previous average remission duration.
 We hypothesize that JAK1/2 signaling is a central mediator of mTOR activation and iMCD
pathogenesis, JAK-mediated hypersensitivity to cytokine stimulation is the mechanistic basis, and ruxolitinib
interrupts iMCD by inhibiting JAK1/2, T cell activation, and mTOR. In Aim 1, we will study the activation of JAK1/2
and mTOR signaling in iMCD patient samples during flare. In Aim 2, we will rigorously evaluate how iMCD patient
T cells respond to cytokine stimulation with IFN-I and IL-6 in vitro and establish the mechanistic link between
JAK1/2 and mTOR signaling. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that IRS1 phosphorylation
downstream of JAK1/2 can lead to PI3K/AKT and mTOR activation. Aim 3 outlines a mechanistic study of
ruxolitinib in iMCD patients to investigate JAK1/2 signaling in vivo. The proposed studies will advance
understanding of dysregulated signaling pathways and cell types in iMCD and may lead to a new treatment
paradigm for iMCD and related disorders. Using clinical and discovery data to uncover a novel use for an existing
drug is critical to identify therapies for the 95% of rare diseases with no FDA-approved therapy."

The small intestine is lined with a single layer of epithelial cells that is organized into crypt-villus units. These epithelial
cells perform multiple functions, such as aiding in digestion, nutrient absorbance, and serving as a barrier, but these
processes also damage the epithelial layer. As a result, intestinal stem cell (ISCs) located near the base of crypts are
responsible for the constant renewal and rapid replenishment of all intestinal cell types, but the crypts themselves also
require maintenance through a process called fission. Crypt fission occurs when a single intestinal crypt divides and
generates a new daughter crypt, which is essential for maintaining overall crypt density and intestinal health. Despite the
important role of crypt fission in injury-induced crypt regeneration and its mis-regulation in intestinal diseases (e.g.,
inflammatory bowel disease), little is known about the mechanisms of how crypt fission is initiated, progresses through
crypt bifurcation, and is regulated under different pathophysiological conditions. Thus, the proposed research aims to use
photoresponsive hydrogels for the culture of intestinal organoids and then develop a robust and predictable in vitro model
of crypt fission events. Our innovative materials and reductionist approach will allow us to precisely tune the properties of
the ISC niche and understand how epithelial cells and ECM signaling contribute to crypt formation and fission. We will
test hypotheses related to the role of crypt cells and matricellular signaling and its effects on organoid symmetry breaking,
crypt formation, crypt fission, and the potential compensatory cellular response to local tissue damage. Specifically, we
aim to: 1. Investigate the role of spatiotemporally varying cell-matrix on real time crypt formation in intestinal organoids.
2. Iteratively pattern intestinal organoid-laden hydrogels to study the role of the ECM interactions in guiding crypt fission.
and 3. Spatiotemporally regulate crypt cell composition to investigate its role in crypt fission."

Structural variants (SVs), defined as rearrangements of ≥50 DNA nucleotides, are a major source of genetic
diversity among humans and an important component of the architecture of neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs).
Despite their etiological significance, remarkably little is known about the consequences of SV formation across
the genome as there is a dearth of accurate measures to assess the genome-wide impact of gains or losses of
DNA (‘dosage sensitivity’). In contrast, robust models of mutation intolerance in genes have been derived from
single nucleotide variants (SNVs), which occur at ~200-fold higher frequency in the genome than SVs. These
metrics of negative selection against loss-of-function mutations within genes (e.g., LOEUF from the genome
aggregation database [gnomAD]) have been critical to gene and locus discovery across NPDs and Mendelian
disorders. By contrast, the absence of equivalent measures for SVs has hindered discovery. This renewal seeks
to build on the foundational tools, maps of genomic variation, and association studies across NPDs completed
during the initial funding period to now define the landscape of SVs across diverse global populations and
determine their relative contribution to the individual and cross-disorder NPD risk. To accomplish these goals,
we will leverage the coalescence of massive-scale biobank and NPD study initiatives led by members of our
research team with the development of new tools and resources that can scale to millions of individuals. We will
first aggregate and harmonize SV callsets generated using our GATK-SV and GATK-gCNV tools across >2.6
million samples with genome and exome sequencing data to create expansive SV maps across diverse
populations. We will then apply new statistical approaches to predict SV mutation rates and develop models of
genome-wide dosage sensitivity (Aim 1). These new SV variant classes and dosage sensitivity metrics will be
integrated into family-based and case-control association studies of NPDs across 387,675 cases from ongoing
cohort collections (Aim 2). Notably, these datasets will include significant initiatives led by members of our team
to investigate the dimensions of NPDs across diverse populations that are currently under-represented in NPD
studies. Finally, we will use innovative new approaches to investigate the influence of SVs that have been cryptic
to discovery from existing technologies but are now accessible to long-read sequencing and we will apply new
analysis methods to explore their potential influence on NPDs (Aim 3). Overall, each aim addresses a current
void in neuropsychiatric genomics and success in any one area would represent an important advance for the
field. We have assembled an outstanding team of experts across all domains of computational and statistical
genomics, as well as the phenotypic dimensions of neuropsychiatric conditions, and at its conclusion this
proposal will yield novel tools and resources at an unprecedented scale to define an important component of the
currently unexplained genetic architecture of NPDs."
10925265,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Like the challenges and skepticism that faced the antibody therapeutics field over a decade ago, RNA
therapeutics is facing the same. And, like the antibody therapeutics field, we are beginning to realize the clinical
impact of RNA therapeutics amiss these challenges. This is most clearly highlighted with the recent approval of
two mRNA vaccines to prevent against SARS-CoV-2 and the first three FDA approved RNAi drugs targeted to
the liver. Unfortunately, RNA-based drugs targeted to cancer cells is lagging behind, even with countless years
of work that has revealed the power of using RNAi for treating oncological diseases. Lack of success in this
space is attributed to inability to deliver RNAi safely and effectively. We previously developed a method that can
safely deliver therapeutic microRNAs (miRNAs) to tumors that overexpress the folate receptor. However, the
anti-tumor response was short-lived due to instability of the miRNA and poor pharmacokinetics, necessitating
frequent dosing. To overcome these insufficiencies requires a stabilized miRNA that retains targeting activity.
Recently we screened a panel of fully modified versions of miR-34a (FM-miR-34a) and identified one with >400-
fold increased stability and outstanding in vivo efficacy when conjugated to folate. Treatment of mice implanted
with breast cancer xenografts with folate-FM-miR-34a resulted in complete cures in two out of six mice and
significant tumor regression in the remaining four. Based on this exciting data, here we propose to advance FM-
miR-34 forward in two ways. In Aim 1 we will evaluate the activity, efficacy, and safety profile of FM-miR-34a in
in vivo models of lung and prostate cancer. FM-miR-34a will be conjugated to: i) folate for delivery to lung cancer,
and ii) PSMA-617, a ligand that targets prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) for delivery to prostate
cancer. In Aim 2 we propose to capitalize on the stability afforded by FM-miR-34 to increase the circulation ½
time of folate-FM-miR-34 and PSMA-617-FM-miR-34a though incorporating an albumin binding moiety (ABM)
into the ligands. Using these ligands we will evaluate serum albumin binding and stability of the new ligands. We
will also verify that conjugation to ABM does not alter the activity of miR-34a nor cell binding and internalization
kinetics. Finally, we will assess in vivo distribution of ligand-ABM-miR-34a conjugates.
 At the completion of this work we expect to have an all-encompassing miRNA delivery vehicle that can
target a stabilized tumor suppressive RNAs specifically to NSCLC and prostate cancer. We will also have new
ligands with increased circulation ½ life. The data obtained will ultimately have a significant impact in cancer
treatment by providing new opportunities to advance the next phase of miRNA-based therapeutics. While
proposed for NSCLC and prostate cancer, based on the utility of miR-34a for treating other cancers and
overexpression of the folate receptor alone on many epithelial cancers, including ovary, kidney, and colon
cancers, successful completion of this study could have far-reaching positive consequences."

This project seeks to define the molecular mechanisms that stem cells use to differentiate into acid-pumping
parietal cells in the gastric epithelium. Abnormalities related to parietal cell abundance and activity are
associated with a variety of stomach conditions, including peptic ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disease,
autoimmune gastritis, and Helicobacter pylori infection with chronic atrophic gastritis and pyloric metaplasia.
Despite the array of human health conditions related to parietal cell dysfunction, little is known about how
parietal cells emerge from stem cells at homeostasis or in diseases where parietal cells are lost. During the
prior funding period for this project, we have shown that parietal cell death requires IFNγ and IL-17 signaling
and that AMPK and AMPK-regulated proteins like PGC1α and CD36 are critical for parietal cell differentiation
and function. Here, we will show preliminary data that the nuclear hormone transcription factor Estrogen-
related receptor gamma (ERRγ, encoded by the gene Esrrg) is first expressed in parietal progenitor cells as
they differentiate from induced stem cells, and deletion of Esrrg abrogates parietal cell differentiation. Thus, we
hypothesize that ERRγ is critical and sufficient for parietal cell fate choice and differentiation from stem cells.
We propose three aims to test our hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will characterize the molecular and cellular steps
involved in stem cell differentiation to parietal cells during mouse development and after parietal cell ablation
using ERRγ in combination with other gastric lineage markers, immunostaining, and electron microscopic
approaches. We will use newly generated ERRγ-RFP mice to flow sort ERRγ+ parietal cell progenitors at
various time points after ablation and identify novel molecular regulators of PC differentiation via RNA-Seq. We
will grow ERRγ+ sorted and whole-corpus organoids in 2D/3D conditions with varying growth factors, which we
have optimized for maintaining stem cells or generating parietal cells. In Aim 2, we will determine how and
when ERRγ is necessary for parietal cell differentiation using Esrrg-floxed mice crossed with strains expressing
inducible Cre recombinase in stem cells, progenitors, and mature parietal cells, including a newly generated
EsrrgCreERT2 line. We will also perform ChIP-seq to identify ERRγ genetic targets and mass spectrometry of co-
immunoprecipitated proteins to identify co-activators and modulators. In Aim 3, we will examine ERRγ and
other gastric lineage markers to reveal the unexpected presence of abundant parietal cell progenitors in
patients lacking mature parietal cells due to autoimmune gastritis. We will transduce ERRγ into mouse and
human organoids and/or treat organoids and mouse models with ERRγ activating and inhibiting drugs to
assess sufficiency of ERRγ to generate parietal cells and establish a pipeline to identify agents that can treat
parietal cell disorders by regulating parietal cell differentiation. We expect this work will generate a more robust
understanding of parietal cell differentiation and lead to novel therapeutic approaches for treating parietal cell
disorders."

 Ticks and the pathogens they transmit incur significant costs to public health and agriculture worldwide.
For instance, Ixodes scapularis, the primary vector of Lyme disease (LD) in the United States, is responsible
for over 300,000 LD cases annually. The economic losses due to Rhiphicephalus (Boophilus) microplus are
two-fold: reduced body weight and milk production in cattle and the treatment cost employed to prevent
disease and control ticks. Increased incidence and distribution of ticks and tick-borne diseases necessitates a
better understanding of vector biology to develop new approaches for tick control. Recent advances in genetic
transformation techniques, esp. CRISPR/Cas9 system has immensely facilitated functional genomics studies.
These advances now allow the elucidation of gene functions in non-model organisms such as ticks. However,
because of the unique biology of ticks, several technical hurdles have prevented gene-editing from being
applied to study tick molecular biology, most notably lack of an embryo injection protocol and understanding of
the early embryonic events. We overcame significant impediments through our R21 grant by developing
embryo injection protocols and the first proof-of-principle tick gene knockout. However, no heritable insertions
have been observed in ticks yet. It is essential to inject eggs at the right time so that introduced material can
access the nuclei of the future germ cells (before cellularization) and create stable germline transformants.
 CRISPR/Cas9 uses a guide RNA complementary to the target DNA and directs DNA cleavage by the
Cas9 endonuclease. Modification of the genome sequence occurs during double-stranded break (DSB) repair,
and the molecular pathways that come into play determine the type of sequence change. Canonical
nonhomologous end-joining (cNHEJ) and alternative end-joining pathways such as micro-homology-mediated
end-joining (MMEJ) proceed by ligation of DNA ends and result in targeted but imprecise edits (generally small
insertions or deletions) resulting in gene knockout. However, microhomologies of two or more nucleotides
exposed after DNA cleavage through resection could be used for precise editing during repair by MMEJ.
Homology-directed repair (HDR) uses an exogenous DNA repair template that supports precise genome editing.
Our previous work suggests that ticks frequently use MMEJ pathways for DSB repair. In this proposal, we will fill
our knowledge gaps by first understanding the timing and site of primordial germ cell formation using known
markers as well as utilizing the single-cell RNAseq technique to better understand the gene expression during
early embryonic development (Aim 1). We will then leverage our previous findings to generate germline-edited
ticks by developing Vasa-Cas9 lines for efficient and accessible knockout studies. We will compare the
efficiencies of MMEJ and HDR for knock-in experiments to integrate transgenes (Aim 2). The expected outcomes
of our work will provide new tools to determine the genetic basis of many tick phenotypes, including those
involved in pathogen transmission."
10740887,"Co-targeting S6 and TAM kinases in PTEN-deficient glioblastoma
Project Summary
The ribosomal S6 protein kinases (S6Ks) are activated in response to loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN in
glioblastoma and other cancers of solid and hematopoietic tissues. We previously reported that genetic
inactivation of S6K1 counteracts the metabolic and anti-apoptotic effects of PTEN loss in cancer, in agreement
with several observations in comparable settings. Recently we investigated pharmacological inhibitors that
target S6K1, which led to the identification of a PTEN-specific vulnerability to combination inhibition of S6K1
together with the TAM family of tyrosine kinases. The TAM family of tyrosine is named for its members, which
are TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK. TAM tyrosine kinases are highly targetable in oncology, as there are several
late-stage clinical trial and FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors that have activity against all three
members. In a validation phase using genetic approaches to investigate the requirements for PTEN-selective
cytotoxicity, results revealed that inactivation of TAM kinases is sufficient to sensitize PTEN-deficient cells to
inhibition of S6K1. In the present research application, we propose to extend the genetic analysis of S6 and
TAM kinases to elucidate the mechanisms that relate the kinases in the setting of PTEN-deficient glioblastoma.
Experiments will make use of CRISPR Cas9 genome editing technologies to inactivate the S6K and TAM
kinase family members, alone or in combination, while determining signaling and metabolic effects. Model
systems will employ patient-derived tumor samples to assess the generality and applicability of genetic results
to physiologic functions of glioblastoma tumors/cells. We anticipate that the results will provide the
mechanistic framework that will inform the development of targeted therapeutic strategies affecting the S6Ks
and TAMs themselves, or signaling components that are part of their pathways."

Cell migration is important in normal development, wound healing and cancer. The long-term
goal of this work is to study cell migration in the context of cancer. The most motile, and
understudied, population of cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are neutrophils, which are
primary effector cells of the innate immune response. The presence of chronic neutrophil-
mediated inflammation has been associated with the initiation and progression of cancer.
However, the role of neutrophils in the tumor microenvironment remains controversial in part
because neutrophils can play both pro- and anti-tumor roles. We aim to address this gap by
increasing our understanding of how neutrophils are recruited and regulated by the tumor
microenvironment during tumor progression. We will test the overall hypotheses that specific
signaling pathways induced by transformed cells drive neutrophil recruitment, and that
neutrophils “educated” in the tumor microenvironment alter tumor progression. To
address these hypotheses, we have developed a robust toolbox using zebrafish to enable in situ
imaging of the dynamic behavior of neutrophils, macrophages and cancer cells, in real time, in
melanoma and liver cancer models. We take advantage of a new zebrafish model of fibrolamellar
carcinoma (FLC), an aggressive early onset cancer that exhibits increased inflammation and early
progression, similar to human disease. Here, we propose to examine the role of neutrophils in
liver cancer and melanoma inflammation and progression (Aim 1). We will harness TRAPseq
findings from neutrophils, macrophages and epithelial cells to probe the role of oncogene-induced
genes on neutrophils in the tumor microenvironment and tumorigenesis, including the role of
neutrophil intrinsic genes p47phox and the phosphatase ptprja on neutrophil polarization and
tumor progression (Aim 2). Finally, we will examine neutrophil-macrophage cross talk in the tumor
microenvironment and the role of macrophage polarization on neutrophil inflammation and tumor
progression (Aim 3). While there has been substantial interest in manipulating the adaptive
immune system to treat cancer, the therapeutic possibilities of the innate immune system remain
under-studied. Understanding mechanisms that regulate neutrophils in the tumor
microenvironment will enhance basic mechanistic knowledge regarding intercellular interactions,
facilitate the design of new strategies to treat cancer and potentially improve the efficacy of cancer
immunotherapy."
10928210,"We propose to leverage recent advances in machine learning and systems biology to enable high
dimensional molecular assessment of the dynamic cell state transitions driving metastasis. We hypothesize that
the interaction between a cancer cell's intrinsic reactivation of developmental programs with its spatiotemporal
context determines its metastatic potential. We will exploit developmental changes in the mammary epithelium
to define their cell state basis and map the aberrant reuse of these transcriptional programs in metastatic disease.
 Both normal mammary epithelium and breast tumors undergo dramatic changes in differentiation and
tissue architecture, and loss of differentiation correlates with poor patient outcomes. We developed 3D culture
assays that recapitulate epithelial morphogenesis and cancer growth, invasion, and metastatic colony formation.
The key concepts arising are that: (1) a conserved process of dedifferentiation and loss of polarity accompanies
both normal and neoplastic morphogenesis and (2) the cancer cells in luminal and basal breast cancer
recapitulate basal epithelial and hybrid EMT programs. Recent advances in single cell sequencing, spatial
transcriptomics, and machine learning enable transcriptome-wide resolution of these states in tissue, quantitative
comparison of normal and cancerous cell states, and the identification of targetable cell state regulators.
Aim 1: Map cell states in space and time during development, tumor formation, and metastasis. We will
generate scRNA-seq data from normal glands, ductal carcinoma in situ, and invasive tumors collected at different
ages and also longitudinally in 3D culture. We will use our CoGAPS algorithm to infer cell states and their
temporal progression. We will then use our patternMarker2 statistic to identify cell state makers for MERSCOPE
analysis in tissue. We will map these states in normal glands, primary tumors, and metastases isolated from
genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) and patient derived xenografts (PDX).
Aim 2: Model the dynamics of differentiation state during development and cancer progression. To define
the effect of cell state on metastatic progression, we will construct an ecosystem-style multinomial diversity
model. We will initialize the model with literature-based parameter values to predict the interactions between cell
type and cell state. We will then extend the model to use the weights assigned by CoGAPS to each cell, thereby
linking gene regulatory programs to the cell state changes driving metastasis.
Aim 3: Validate candidate regulators of metastatic cell state transitions in 3D culture and in vivo.
To isolate the genes regulating metastasis, we will use our transfer learning algorithm, projectR, to score each
cancer cell for its relative utilization of scRNA-seq-defined molecular programs. We will then use our
projectionDriver statistic to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes at sites of cancer invasion, relative to the
tumor interior. DE genes will be tested genetically in 3D culture assays modeling invasion and colony formation
and then in orthotopic and tail vein metastasis assays in vivo."

 Brain connectivity plays a fundamental role in neurologic function and dysfunction, and can directly impact
substance use or be alerted by inappropriate uses of substances. However, there is a limited understanding of
the bidirectional relationship between brain connectomics and substance use, e.g., are there connections of the
brain that predispose an individual to substance use disorders (SUD), and how SUD impacts the brain and its
development. Improving this understanding is of critical importance in obtaining mechanistic insights into factors
underlying substance misuse and neuropsychiatric disorders. With the availability of large-scale and longitudinal
data sets such as ABCD, we are now at the golden time to significantly advance our understanding of the causal
or association relationship between SUD and brain connectivity.
 However, we are facing both computational and theoretical challenges in brain network data analysis,
considering the complexity and scale of the brain imaging data. It is critical to train the next-generation
neuroscience data scientists with sufficient knowledge to correctly do a full life cycle of data science (LCDS) for
brain connectomes analysis. Here, a full LCDS includes steps to collect data for the best brain connectome
analysis, reliably and robustly extract brain connectomes, and rigorously analyze variations in the data. The
proposed educational plan aims at (i) developing easy-to-use computational tools for connectome reconstruction,
visualization, and statistical analysis and training students and young investigators to use these tools; and (ii)
enhancing rigorous and reproducible statistical analysis of brain network data through short courses, summer
camps, and workshops. The success of the project relies on the unique brain imaging and machine learning
expertise of the PIs (Drs. Wu and Zhang) and their collaborative relationships with experts in biostatistics, mental
health, computer science, and psychology research faculty in the Department of Psychiatry (PSYCH), the
Department of Statistics & Operation Research (STOR), the Department of Biostatistics (BIOS), the Department

Our proposed study aims to address the function of LIN28B and follistatin in supporting cell reprogramming and
hair cell regeneration in the murine cochlea. Loss of auditory hair cells (HCs) due to disease or trauma is
permanent and is a leading cause for hearing impairments and deafness in humans. Immature auditory
supporting cells (SCs) do regenerate HCs in response to damage but their ability to regenerate lost HCs rapidly
declines as SCs undergo maturation and little to no HC regeneration is observed in adult animals. We recently
uncovered that the RNA binding protein LIN28B and its paralog LIN28A control the regenerative capacity of
cochlear SCs in neonatal cochlear organoids and explants. Whether LIN28A/B has a similar role in cochlear HC
regeneration in vivo has yet to be tested. Furthermore, our recent in vitro studies suggest that LIN28B promotes
HC regeneration through reprogramming SCs into progenitor-like cells and that such state transition can be
further enhanced by the co-activation of the Activin antagonist follistatin. However, whether SCs truly activate a
transitional progenitor-like state during HC regeneration and if so, how LIN28B and FST may influence such
state transition are still unresolved. In our proposed study we will use mouse genetic tools to address whether
LIN28A/B regulates spontaneous cochlear HC regeneration in the immature cochlea in vivo (aim1). Furthermore,
we will use single cell RNA sequencing and single molecule FISH to determine whether LIN28B reprograms
cochlear SCs into progenitor-like cells during HC regeneration (aim2). Moreover, to establish how LIN28B and
FST enhance SC reprogramming and subsequent HC regeneration we will manipulate the function of potential
LIN28B and FST effector genes using lentiviral overexpression and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout strategies
in cochlear organoids (aim3). Finally, we will determine whether co-expression of LIN28B and FST with Atoh1
enables SCs to regenerate cochlear HCs in the mature cochlea in vivo (aim4)."

Understanding immunometabolism at the systemic level is important to vaccine development
and cancer immunotherapy. While new data are coming out, methodical measurements of small
molecules using metabolomics are still limited. Our team recently reported a multi-omics study
of herpes zoster vaccine (Zostavax), which identified major metabolic influences to vaccine
induced immunity, including inositol phosphate metabolism and steroid metabolism. To fully test
the metabolite predictors of immune responses, we have acquired samples from a larger
Zostavax study, and propose to perform advanced, high-coverage metabolomics analysis.
Predictive models of immune responses will be developed on one cohort and tested on the
other. These data will also be compared to a newer and more efficacious zoster vaccine.
Together, this study will establish how metabolite profiles determine the immune responses of
individuals."
10740861,"NMDA-type ionotropic glutamate receptors mediate excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous
system (CNS) and play critical roles in brain functions. Aberrant NMDA receptor signaling is implicated in many
CNS diseases, and NMDA receptors are receiving widespread interest as therapeutic targets. Although it has
proven difficult to translate preclinical findings into clinical efficacy, the many NMDA receptor ligands from
these studies have created a valuable pharmacological toolbox that continues to support neuroscience
research. Most NMDA receptors are composed of two glycine-binding GluN1 and two glutamate-binding GluN2
subunits. There are four different GluN2 subunits (GluN2A-D) that endow NMDA receptors with distinct
functional properties and different developmental and regional expression in the CNS. Selective modulation of
NMDA receptors that contain a specific GluN2 subunit can therefore target a subset of receptor subtypes
expressed in disease-relevant neuronal populations. NMDA receptors require simultaneous binding of glycine
(or D-serine) to GluN1 and glutamate to GluN2 for activation, but mainly rely on synaptic release of glutamate
for activation in the CNS, since extracellular glycine (or D-serine) is continuously present. Thus, glutamate
binding to GluN2 primarily mediates phasic activation of synaptic NMDA receptors, while agonist occupancy at
GluN1 can modulate response amplitude. We will investigate two distinct modes of NMDA receptor
modulation, both of which display GluN2 subunit-selectivity and affect the GluN1 agonist binding site to
modulate NMDA receptor responses. In Aim 1, we will define binding contacts and mechanism of action for a
new class of GluN2A-selective negative allosteric modulators that bind the subunit interface between GluN1
and GluN2A agonist binding domains (ABDs) to negatively modulate agonist binding to GluN1. In Aim 2, we
will determine the structural basis for GluN2 subunit-specific activity of novel glycine site agonists with
remarkably high potency and unprecedented variation in agonist efficacy among NMDA receptor subtypes. By
replacing endogenous glycine or D-serine, these GluN2-dependent agonists can modulate NMDA receptors
when activated by synaptic glutamate release. In Aim 3, we will modulate neuronal NMDA receptors in acute
rodent brain slices using novel GluN2A-selective NAMs and GluN1 agonists. NMDA receptor-positive neurons
in the adult CNS express at least two different GluN2 subunits and many NMDA receptors are assembled with
two different GluN2 subunits (i.e. triheteromeric receptors). We will evaluate the activity of the novel
modulators at recombinant triheteromeric NMDA receptor subtypes (GluN1/2A/2B, GluN1/2B/2D, and
GluN1/2A/2C) and at native NMDA receptors in distinct neuronal populations with defined expression of these
GluN2 subunit combinations. These investigations will uncover previously unrecognized features of NMDA
receptor modulation and provide new avenues for basic and translational research, as well as facilitate the
development of novel therapeutic agents."

Up to now, the only available replacement therapy is to transplant islets from cadaveric donors. However, such procedures present hurdles such as the scarcity of available donors and the rejection of transplanted cells by the patient’s own immune system. Also, over time, the transplanted islets tend to die. To circumvent these effects, we and other have identified several therapeutic targets to induce beta cell proliferation. However, the realization of the therapeutic potential of these targets requires targeted release as the therapeutic window of these targets is narrow. We propose to apply chemical biology approaches to develop methods for targeted release of bioactives in beta cells in vivo.

10850685,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Depression is prevalent, debilitating, and costly, and derives from complex combinations of genetic and
environmental factors. Maternal depression is one of the most established risk factors of depression in
offspring, yet the genetic and environmental risk factors tied to intergenerational risk are complex and largely
unspecified. Dyadic research examining mother–child neural and behavioral processes is critically needed to
identify early pathways and mechanisms of increased depression risk. To this end, the current research
strategy suggests a neurobehavioral pathway of early childhood risk development such that depression in
mothers is characterized by dampened positive valence systems (PVS) neural activation, leading to decreased
engagement in co-experienced positive affect with young offspring, and resulting in dampened PVS neural
activation in the young children of mothers with depression. I will assess 125 mother−child (age=18months)
dyads. In the first laboratory visit, diagnostic interviews will assess mothers’ lifetime depression history. In the
second laboratory visit, dyads will complete a series of tasks to examine neural indicators of PVS activation
and mother−child co-experienced positive affect. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and event-related potential
(ERP) neural indicators, particularly frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) and the late positive potential (LPP),
reliable measures of approach motivation and motivated attention, respectively, will be used to measure PVS
activation at the neural level for both mothers and young children. Co-experienced positive affect will be coded
via the Dyadic Interaction Coding System. This project will allow me to examine a potential neurobehavioral
pathway from depression in mothers to the development of increased depression risk in offspring. First, I will
examine the association between mothers’ depressive symptoms and neural PVS activation in the context of
interactions with offspring (Specific Aim 1). Then, I will examine the association between mothers’ depressive
symptoms, prenatally and postpartum, and observed co-experienced positive affect in mother–child
interactions and test the moderating role of individual differences in mothers’ neural PVS activation on this
association (Specific Aim 2). Lastly, I will examine the cumulative and unique effects of co-experienced positive
affect and mothers’ neural PVS function on children’s PVS function. These aims leverage a rigorous
multimethod research design to provide foundational insight on dyadic neurobehavioral mechanisms of
depression vulnerability, crucial for developing more targeted preventions for those at highest risk for
depression. In addition, my proposed training goals are to develop advanced skills through rigorous training in:
infant and early childhood mental health, dyadic behavioral paradigms and assessment of caregiver–child
interactions, dyadic and early childhood neurophysiological assessments, and advanced quantitative methods."
10888392,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Voice behavior in daily life is assumed to be a primary factor in the development and persistence of phonotrauma
(e.g., vocal fold nodules, polyps, etc.), which is one of the most prevalent behavioral voice disorders. The
shortage of prospective, longitudinal investigations into the ambulatory voice behaviors in high-risk individuals
limits the differentiation between factors that are causative versus compensatory to phonotrauma, and therefore
impacts optimal risk-assessment, mitigation, and therapeutic decision-making. Recent work has found that
individuals with phonotrauma had higher levels of personality traits related to social dominance and impulsivity
and higher speaking vocal doses and increased speaking vocal intensity during voice use in daily life. Individuals
without current vocal pathology had strong relationships between those same personality traits and vocal
behaviors, suggesting that personality traits and speaking voice use in daily life could be robust factors in the
development of phonotrauma and could play a role in the prognosis for recovery. The primary objective of this
project is to determine the enduring role that personality traits and daily voice use have on the development of
phonotrauma, changes in vocal fold kinematics, and on the ability to change damaging vocal behavior using
prospective, longitudinal methods. Aim 1 seeks to identify personality and vocal behavior factors involved in the
development of phonotrauma. This will be achieved through initial assessment using a personality trait inventory,
ambulatory voice monitoring, and laryngeal assessment via high-speed videoendoscopy of vocally
asymptomatic singers who are freshmen in a college voice concentration music program. We will conduct these
assessment procedures bi-annually, beginning in the singer’s freshman year and ending at the conclusion of
their junior year. Aim 2 will assess which ambulatory and vocal fold kinematic parameters are the most predictive
of phonotrauma. Aim 3 will investigate the impact that personality has on compliance with therapeutic/behavioral
recommendations in daily life through personality assessment and ambulatory monitoring before and after
participation in voice therapy. These studies will be the first to use ambulatory monitoring to (1) prospectively
observe factors related to the development of phonotrauma and (2) measure the impact that personality traits
have on the ability to change individual vocal behaviors. It will also be the first to use high-speed videoendoscopy
to observe development of phonotrauma over time. This project will support advancement of the PI’s long-term
career objective, which is to implement a program that uses psychosocial and behavioral factors to improve the
prevention and treatment of phonotrauma in high-risk populations. This career objective can only be achieved
with adequate training in longitudinal research methods, advanced statistical analyses, and acquisition and
analysis of high-speed videoendoscopy. Results from this study will build a framework to ultimately improve early
identification of phonotrauma risk, develop risk mitigation strategies, and inform treatment approaches."
10769898,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Aberrant protein synthesis is associated with a variety of disease states such as cancer and
neurodegeneration. The protein output per mRNA is strongly affected by a combination of cis elements and
trans factors that together control the rate of recruitment of ribosomes to the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR).
Different 5′-UTRs are sufficient to confer a thousand-fold range of translation output both in vivo and in vitro,
but the mechanisms underlying these large effects are unknown in most cases. This proposal for an NIH
K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award seeks to understand the 5′-UTR regulatory code controlling
mRNA translation by answering two fundamental questions: (1) what are the components of the code? And
(2) what is the mechanism by which the components affect translational activity? To answer these questions
Dr. Niederer will take advantage of a cellular condition where widespread changes in 5′-UTR usage have been
observed- cancer. Using a novel technical approach Dr. Niederer will directly measure ribosome recruitment
levels to thousands of 5′-UTR sequences that are differentially expressed in cancer cells (Aim 1). While the
changes in 5′-UTR usage are well known, their affect on ribosome recruitment is more or less completely
unknown. Therefore, these studies can be used to identify functional RNA elements. Then, a combination of
biochemical and genetic studies will be used to identify the readers of these functional RNA elements (Aim 2).
The results of this work are likely to reveal novel mechanisms of translation regulation, which will not only
further our understanding of a fundamental cellular process but will also have implications for human health
and disease. To complete these studies, Dr. Niederer will continue her training as a Postdoctoral Associate in
the Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry department at Yale University. During the K99 phase Dr. Niederer
will receive invaluable training in computational methods to both identify functional RNA elements and
deconvolute their contributions to ribosome recruitment. Additionally, after working almost exclusively with the
model organism S. cerevisiae for over 10 years, she will expand her technical expertise to be able to conduct
experiments in the context of human cells. Using these skills, in the R00 phase, Dr. Niederer will characterize
the candidate readers and determine their role in supporting translational reprogramming. The Pathway to
Independence award will allow Dr. Niederer to gain the necessary technical expertise and professional skills to
become a competitive applicant for tenure track positions as a group leader."

This proposal focuses on cell division cycle 7-related protein (CDC7). The overarching goal of this proposal is
to test whether inhibition of CDC7 kinase might represent a powerful therapeutic strategy in treatment of
human cancers carrying mutated p53 protein. In our study, we will utilize human cancer cell lines as well as a
mouse cancer model. Our work may lead to a novel therapeutic approach for cancer patients, specifically
targeting p53-mutated human cancer cells. CDC7 is a cell cycle kinase that is activated through a physical
interaction with regulatory subunits, DBF4 or DRF1. DRF1 represents the activator of CDC7 during
embryogenesis, while DBF4 functions mainly during divisions of somatic cells. The DBF4-CDC7 kinase
becomes activated at the end of G1 phase and phosphorylates components of the pre-replication complexes
(pre-RCs), thereby triggering entry of cells into DNA synthesis phase (S phase). CDC7 was reported to be
essential for cell division in all organisms studied, from yeast to humans. Several reports documented that
human cancer cells with mutated p53 are particularly sensitive to CDC7 inhibition. Depletion of CDC7 protein,
or inhibition of its kinase activity in p53-mutant cancer cells was shown to trigger tumor cell apoptosis. For
these reasons, we decided to further study the CDC7 protein and its role in normal cell proliferation as well as
in tumorigenesis. Previous work by others has established that CDC7 knockout mice die very early during
gestation, thereby precluding analyses of CDC7 in an adult organism. To circumvent this limitation, and to
study CDC7 function at later stages, our laboratory developed a novel mouse strain that allows us to turn off
CDC7 protein. These mice and cells derived from them offer us tools to study the molecular functions of
CDC7. In Aim 1, we will study the molecular role of CDC7 in cell division of normal, non-transformed cells.
Our preliminary results indicate the presence of a novel, previously unanticipated molecular mechanism of cell
division, which will be examined in this Aim. In Aim 2, we will analyze additional functions of CDC7 in human
cancer cells, through which CDC7 may play important roles in tumorigenesis. In Aim 3, we will utilize a mouse
model that faithfully recapitulates p53-mutant triple-negative breast cancers. Using these mice, we will test the
requirement for CDC7 during tumorigenesis. The expected overall impact of this proposal is that it will change
our understanding of mechanisms governing cell division, will elucidate novel roles of CDC7 in tumorigenesis,
and will test the utility of targeting CDC7 in cancer treatment."
10740864,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Approximately 50 million people worldwide live with epilepsy, a syndrome characterized by repeated,
unprovoked seizures that manifest with a combination of altered behavior and abnormal electric discharges of
populations of neurons in the brain. Seizures result from impairment of excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) balance.
Enhancement of inhibitory GABAergic function is a common pharmacological strategy. Not surprisingly,
GABAergic interneurons in the cortex and hippocampus have been well studied, and their role in dampening
excitatory output from these structures is well established. GABAergic interneurons tend to be fast-spiking cells
(up to 800Hz!), which compensate for their small number by a high level of activity with each action potential
causing GABA release from their terminals. A majority of these fast-spiking neurons are surrounded by a layer
of dense extracellular matrix that Golgi termed perineuronal nets (PNNs) over 120 years ago. These are
composed of glycosaminoglycanes, negatively charged glycoproteins formed from a superfamily of proteins that
cover the cell soma, proximal dendrites and axon initial segment. Their role is not well known but believed to aid
in cell differentiation, neural protection and cortical plasticity. During the last grant cycle studying tumor-
associated epilepsy, we made an unexpected discovery suggesting that PNNs alter the neuronal membrane
capacitance, allowing them to fire at supra-physiological rates. Specially, proteolytic enzymes released from the
tumor digest PNNs, thereby increasing membrane capacitance and slowing the firing rates of inhibitory neurons,
leading to seizures. We now hypothesize that PNNs may be more generally the target of acquired epilepsy,
where proteolysis of extracellular matrix and tissue remodeling are common. Hence, we propose to study PNN
integrity and its role in epileptogenesis more broadly across different mouse models of acquired epilepsy and in
tissues from epilepsy patients. We hypothesize that PNNs define the placement of astrocytes near synapses to
aid uptake of ions and neurotransmitters; that release of matrix-degrading enzymes from reactive astrocytes
destroy PNNs, thereby slowing their firing rate. Together these changes may lead to epilepsy. These studies are
conceptually novel and may suggest a completely different treatment approach to epilepsy, namely targeting
proteolytic enzymes to ameliorate this disease."

In this revised proposal, we continue to develop an approach to repair base mutations at the level of
RNA, for attenuating symptoms in mouse models of human neurological disease. The experiments
are an outgrowth of a pilot NIH Director’s Transformative Research Award that supported both
recently published and preliminary results attesting to feasibility of this approach. Our work is
currently focused on Rett syndrome, a devastating neurological disease due to mutations in the gene
encoding the transcription factor, MECP2. We focused initially on a human patient guanosine (G) to
adenosine (A) mutation in MECP2, MECP2317G>A, which interferes severely with its ability to bind to
chromatin and results in Rett syndrome. We showed, for the first time, that endogenous Mecp2317G>A
RNA can be recoded to the wild type amino acid efficiently in non-dividing neurons cultured from a
Mecp2317G>A mouse line that exhibits severe Rett-like symptoms. The recoding occurred through site-
directed deamination by a hijacked catalytic domain of Adenosine Acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2)
(Editase), fused to a bacteriophage RNA binding peptide, which we targeted to the Mecp2 mutation
by an RNA guide. In this revised application, we present new data indicating that recoding also
occurs in vivo, in 3 different hippocampal neuronal populations, after direct hippocampal injection of
AAV encoding the hybrid ADAR2 protein and Mecp2 RNA guides. Moreover, recoding resulted in
amount of MeCP2 localization to chromatin consistent with amount of editing at the RNA level. We
have developed the tools and reagents that now place us in an ideal position to address critical
unanswered questions for reversing neurological phenotypes of Rett syndrome, and for testing
hypotheses related to site-directed repair. In Aim 1, we test the hypotheses that brain-wide repair of
Mecp2317G>A RNA, by site-directed editing, can be tuned to high efficiency and specificity in mice, and
restores proper chromatin interaction. For this purpose, we perform whole transcriptomic RNA seq
analysis across the brain after peripheral injections of an efficient brain AAV serotype virus encoding
optimized editing or control components. In Aim 2, we test new guides for the ability to recruit
endogenous ADAR2 to mutant Mecp2 RNA in vivo, circumventing potential immune responses to the
bacteriophage moiety in the hybrid ADAR2 protein and potentially minimizing off-target editing. Our
initial model is Mecp2311G>A that has the ideal nonsense codon for this approach. In Aim 3, we inject
peripherally the virus encoding our current and optimized editing components, or controls, to test our
hypothesis that site-directed RNA editing can stabilize/reverse Rett-like symptoms in both Mecp2G>A
mouse lines. In addition to Rett syndrome, our approach has the potential to cure thousands of
additional pathogenic G>A mutations."
10723576,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cytokine therapies have the potential to revolutionize treatment for immunologic diseases but are limited by their
poor pharmacokinetic profiles, off-target effects, and pleiotropic nature. Engineered cytokine platforms, on the
other hand, have the potential to target specific tissue environments and cell types to provide local
immunomodulation with minimal side effects. Since macrophages play a central role in many immune-mediated
diseases and can be polarized toward anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory phenotypes, they are promising
targets for cytokine therapies. In my preliminary work, I developed a platform technology to target metabolically
dysfunctional macrophages in the context of atherosclerosis, a paradigm chronic inflammatory disease with high
prevalence. Since macrophages that comprise atherosclerotic plaques engulf large amounts of low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) and become pro-inflammatory lipid-laden “foam cells,” I engineered a protein fusion in which
one side is an antibody fragment (Fab) that binds to LDL and the other side is the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-
10. I have shown that Fab-IL-10 constructs attach to LDL upon i.v. injection in hypercholesterolemic mice,
hitchhike a ride to inflamed regions, preferentially target macrophages, and successfully reduce inflammation.
This proposal aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of action whereby inflammation is locally suppressed
in atherosclerosis (Aim 1), engineer additional functionalities into the construct (Aim 2), and determine its
generalizability to other cytokine payloads (Aim 3). In Aim 1, we will primarily use in vitro models to dissect the
roles of different scavenger receptors involved in Fab-IL-10 binding and uptake and characterize the resulting
phenotype and transcriptome of Fab-IL-10-treated lipid-laden macrophages. We will also perform single cell RNA
sequencing on plaque-resident macrophages in an experimental mouse model of atherosclerosis to determine
the effects of treatment with Fab-IL-10 in vivo. In Aim 2, we will engineer and evaluate an LDL-binding full
antibody-IL-10 construct with enhanced avidity due to multiple binding regions, extended half-life due to neonatal
Fc receptor-mediated recycling, and higher potency due to an extra copy of IL-10 per construct. In Aim 3, we will
evaluate the generalizability of this platform to other payloads while also uncovering biological insights on the
effects of less well-studied cytokines in atherosclerosis (i.e., IL-19 and IL-33). With data generated from this
proposal, we will apply to multiple R01-level grants to expand this platform to target additional disease models
that are partially regulated by lipid-laden macrophages including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and certain
solid cancers. This research proposal combined with my individualized career development plan will enable me
to expand my scientific and professional skillsets and will enable my seamless transition to research
independence as a future tenure-track assistant professor."

constituting one of the fastest growing groups of users of the VA healthcare system. There are over 2.2 million
women Veterans and 32% are enrolled to receive VA health care. Women’s military experiences, and responses
to those experiences, are often distinct from men’s, with implications for their healthcare needs, services, quality,
and outcomes throughout the life course. Thus, understanding the unique facets of women Veterans’ health and
health care is critical to ensure that this important population receives the highest quality patient-centered care.
Female Veterans of childbearing age are seeking care at VA facilities. Premature ovarian failure, polycystic
ovary syndrome and primary amenorrhea, three major causes of female infertility, are associated with
abnormal functioning of the ovary. Considering the widespread importance of steroid hormones in health,
aging and disease, it is important to have a clear understanding of the mechanisms controlling ovarian
function in order to address disease processes afflicting Veterans. Some metabolic disorders associated with
disorders of ovarian steroidogenesis are hypertension, diabetes, hyperinsulinemia, obesity, infertility,
amenorrhea, polycystic ovary syndrome, age-related neural function and osteoporosis, and neoplasms of the
breast, ovary and uterus. The applicant’s research program will lead to new understanding of ovarian
function that informs approaches to control ovarian function that translate into approaches that improve not
only reproductive health, but overall health and longevity. Additionally, basic research such conducted in the
applicant’s laboratory improves efforts to develop safe, effective, inexpensive, reversible, and acceptable
contraceptive methods for males and females. One facet of the applicant’s research explores the role of the
recently discovered Hippo signaling pathway that controls tissue homeostasis in ovarian development,
endocrine function and pathology. This research demonstrates that this pathway is essential for normal
ovarian follicle development and reprogramming of granulosa cells by a key transcriptional regulator in this
pathway (YAP1) leads to development of cancer. YAP promotes adult granulosa cell tumors; it also regulates
high-grade serous carcinoma initiation and progression. Further VA research will provide evidence to reveal the
role of the Hippo pathway in follicle formation, proliferation and differentiation of granulosa and theca cells,
and function of luteal cells. Another thrust of the research program is to understand aspects of the aging
pituitary gonadal axis as it relates to improving health and quality-of-life. Aging is associated with a loss in
reproductive potential, which not only reflects a loss of gonadal function, but also a loss of bone density,
cardiovascular health and mental function. Basic research in reproductive health can improve diagnosis and
treatment of reproductive health conditions such as those that occur in aging Veterans. Another goal of
this research program is to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms and metabolic pathways essential for
efficient steroidogenesis, and how modulation of those pathways affect ovarian luteal function and fate. Short
term goals are to determine the time-dependent metabolic, transcriptomic, and proteomic changes induced by
hormones that control the fate of the corpus luteum. Integration of results of these “omics” analyses will allow
identification of new pathways involved in the disruption of luteal function and give us deeper insight into the
events mediated not only by trophic hormones but also by inflammatory mediators. Because the corpus luteum
is crucial for the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy in all mammalian species, these findings will
contribute new information to formulate approaches, including treatments with specific metabolites, to mitigate
the negative effects of obesity and attendant inflammatory mediators on fertility. Potential benefits are
improved quality-of-life with reduced costs and less time off due to reproductive issues/treatments. All

closely coupled to bone resorption, allowing bone renewal with the maintenance of bone mass. Uncoupling
of bone formation and bone resorption underlies the loss of bone mass seen in a variety of conditions
including aging, the menopause, and various inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
These disorders are generally associated with enhanced bone resorption accompanied by rates of bone
formation that are inadequate for the level of resorption. Anti-resorptive therapies have been the traditional
approach for treating patients with low bone mass in these conditions, but it is increasingly recognized that
anabolic therapies that enhance bone formation constitute an important alternative strategy. Previous
studies have identified that inhibitory G protein (Gi) signaling in osteoblast lineage cells suppresses bone
formation and is an important driver of age-related bone loss in females, but the factors that are upstream
of this signaling pathway are unknown. Suppression of canonical Wnt signaling in osteoblast lineage cells
is also linked to reduced bone formation. The present study will use a variety of mouse models to test the
hypothesis that progranulin (PGRN), an inflammation-associated factor produced by macrophages and
implicated in age-related bone loss, is a critical upstream regulator of inflammatory cytokine production
and that PGRN-mediated cytokine production promotes bone loss through activation of Gi signaling and
suppression of canonical Wnt signaling in osteoblast lineage cells. This hypothesis will be tested in three
specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, the role of PGRN in bone marrow macrophage (BMM)-regulated bone
formation will be explored. To accomplish this, we will determine whether alternations in the population of
BMMs accounts for promotion of bone resorption by PGRN; whether expression of PGRN reduces the pro-
osteogenic activity of BMMs; and whether transplantation of BMMs from PGRN-deficient mice can protect
or reverse bone loss in adult female mice. Specific Aim 2 will address the role of suppression of anabolic
signaling pathways in the negative effects of PGRN on bone formation. The role of the canonical Wnt
pathway will be investigated in vivo in mice with targeted deletion of Ctnnb1, the gene encoding b-catenin,
and will be investigated in vitro in osteoblast lineage cells lacking expression of PGRN. The ability of PGRN
to inhibit Gs/cyclic AMP signaling will be assessed in vitro in cultured osteocytes and in vivo in its ability to
limit the anabolic response to intermittent PTH administration. Specific Aim 3 is a translational aim in which
we will explore the role of PGRN in mediating bone loss in two disorders associated with inflammation-
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and estrogen deficiency-induced osteoporosis. We will determine whether PGRN
deficient mice are protected from bone loss after ovariectomy (OVX) and from systemic bone loss and
local joint erosion in the K/BxN serum transfer model of RA. The effect of PGRN deletion on the
inflammatory phenotype of BBMs in response to serum transfer and OVX will also be assessed. Bone
marrow transplantation studies will be carried out to determine whether PGRN-deficient BBMs can rescue
the skeletal pathology associated with OVX and RA. Successful completion of the studies in this proposal
will illuminate the pathogenesis of bone disease associated with inflammatory disorders such as RA and
postmenopausal osteoporosis. Defining the details of this relationship will lead to the identification of new
therapeutic targets for preventing or reversing bone loss in these conditions."
10898808,"AgRP neurons play a vital role in causing hunger – the desire to find and consume food. Hence, it is important
to understand how the activity of AgRP neurons is controlled. The conventional view is that feedback signals,
which track changes in energy balance, are the primary regulators of AgRP neurons. For example, the fasting-
induced increase in AgRP neuron activity is thought to be caused by falls in leptin and perhaps insulin, and an
increase in ghrelin. Conversely, recent studies using real-time in vivo monitoring of neural activity have
unexpectedly uncovered novel forms of regulation that are clearly unrelated to feedback from energy stores.
For example, detection of sensory cues related to food, and ingestion of food, both rapidly decrease AgRP
neuron activity – well before energy stores are affected. While these examples clearly document the existence
of rapid, “feedforward” inhibition of AgRP neurons, to date there have been no examples of the converse – i.e.
rapid, feedforward activation of AgRP neurons. By performing long-term in vivo recordings of AgRP neuron
activity, we have recently discovered that denial of access to food rapidly, within 30-60 minutes, activates
AgRP neurons. Importantly, this rapid activation is to a high level that does not increase further as fasting
progresses. This relatively rapid, “square wave” pattern of activation strongly indicates that it must be caused
by novel mechanisms which, importantly, are unrelated to changes in feedback signals. This discovery, which
could lead to a revision in models of AgRP neuron regulation, indicates that fasting-related activation, like
feeding-related inhibition, utilizes feedforward mechanisms. Given that AgRP neuron activity is vital for
appetite, and given that feedforward activation is not part of present models of AgRP neuron regulation, we
believe that uncovering the neural basis for this, and establishing its function, as we recently did for sensory
food cue inhibition of AgRP neurons, will provide important, previously unknown insights into the biology of
hunger. In preliminary studies, we have identified the source of this rapid feedforward activation. Remarkably,
the excitatory circuit carrying this activation to AgRP neurons shows a large degree of activity-dependent
synaptogenesis plasticity – which we believe functions to amplify and sustain feedforward activation of AgRP
neurons. Thus, the overall goal of this grant is to discover the basis for and understand the purpose of rapid,
feedforward activation of AgRP neurons. In Aim 1 we will use our single neuron transcriptomic dataset and
marker gene recombinase driver mice to establish the neural afferent basis for this regulation. In Aim 2 we will
determine the behavioral scenarios that trigger feedforward activation – we hypothesize a key role for
awareness that food is unavailable. In Aim 3 we will establish its function – this will be done by blocking the
responsible afferents and then examining consequences. Finally, in Aim 4, we will identify the molecular
mediators of and role for activity-dependent synaptogenesis / plasticity in this excitatory afferent à AgRP
neuron circuit – we hypothesize important roles for presynaptic release of Cbln2 and Bdnf."
10911277,"The majority of secreted and membrane proteins in eukaryotic cells are either translocated across or integrated into the ER membrane after the ribosome has docked at the start of the secretory pathway. This process can be selectively and reversibly blocked by a small group of macrocyclic natural products (NPs) produced by fungi, cyanobacteria and human pathogenic bacteria. These specialized NP metabolites bind directly to the Sec61 translocon channel to inhibit co-translational translocation of nascent proteins at the ER resulting in a loss of cellular proteostasis both in the ER and cytosol. Exactly how this group of NP compounds induces either selective or broad inhibition of protein biosynthesis with varying degrees of protein substrate selectivity is not clear. Maintenance of proteostasis is a highly regulated process in mammalian cells and the loss of homeostasis in the cellular secretory pathway is implicated in major human diseases such as cancer, neurodegeneration and diabetes. Thus, our discovery of new potent NP Sec61 inhibitors presents an opportunity to both understand the mechanistic basis of protein import into the ER secretory pathway and provide a reservoir of new Sec61 ligands and potential drug leads based on these complex chemical entities from Nature. We plan to utilize a multidisciplinary approach that includes NP discovery, solid-phase peptide synthesis of macrocycles, pharmacology, chemical and structural biology to pursue the following two aims: 1) Expand and define the class of nonpolar NP-derived macrocycles that target cotranslational translocation; 2) Elucidate the mechanistic basis of Sec61 inhibition using analysis of structure activity relationships (SAR) and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM). In Aim 1, existing NP libraries likely to be rich in non-polar medium-sized macrocycles will be screened for new proteostasis modulators using phenotypic and target-based assays for Sec61-dependent inhibition of ER translocation. Early determination of structural motifs using LCMS2-based metabolomics, NMR spectroscopy and cheminformatics will guide the solid phase peptide synthesis of divergent representatives of NP molecular families to provide a platform for discovery of Sec61 ligands for structural biology studies. In Aim 2 we propose to use cryo-EM to study the specific Sec61 binding of two different NP molecular families by analyzing the Sec61 binding interface of suites of closely related synthetic compounds that have different Sec61 substrate specificity. This multidimensional approach will reveal the feasibility of targeting cellular proteostasis for therapeutic needs, while avoiding toxicities due to non-specific inhibition of secretory protein biosynthesis."
10868540,"Project Summary/Abstract
The long-term objective of this proposal is to understand inductive and effector mechanisms of host
defense in the intestinal mucosa. We use as a tool the intracellular protozoan Toxoplasma gondii, an orally
acquired opportunistic pathogen inducing strong protective Th1- and IFN--based immunity and that is a
significant health hazard in immunocompromised populations. Signaling through the adaptor molecule
MyD88 is necessary for optimal initiation of immunity and resistance to this pathogen. While IL-1 family
cytokine receptors use MyD88, the primary role of this signaling adaptor during T. gondii infection is
believed to be in Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. Nevertheless, the particular TLR involved (TLR11/12)
are not expressed in humans and indeed many other species, indicating presence of MyD88-independent
pathways of immune initiation. Such pathways are also present in mice, insofar as infection of MyD88
knockout animals triggers robust, albeit delayed, Th1 responses in the intestinal mucosa. Additionally,
MyD88 knockout mice can be vaccinated against lethal challenge with orally inoculated Toxoplasma. Open
questions remain regarding the role of MyD88 in specific cell types and in the context of the intestine how
the microbiota influences MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent immunity during Toxoplasma
infection. The central hypothesis underpinning our research is that MyD88-dependent pathways and
MyD88-independent pathways work together to provide optimal immune initiation during infection. We will
address this hypothesis focusing on interactions between cells of the lamina propria, Toxoplasma and the
host microbiota. Using our hypothesis to guide us, we will pursue three specific aims. Aim 1: Determine
the role of intestinal epithelial cells in initiation of immunity and control of Toxoplasma. Using intestinal
organoids we will examine how epithelial cells respond to infection, and how this impacts responses in the
lamina propria compartment. The influence of epithelial MyD88 in immunity to T. gondii will be determined.
Aim 2: Identify how MyD88 impacts innate lymphoid cell (ILC) function during Toxoplasma infection. The
activity of ILC, with a focus on ILC1 and ILC3, will be examined using mouse strains deficient in ILC
populations and strains with deletion of MyD88 in ILC. Aim 3: Determine the influence of MyD88 expression
on generation of mucosal T cell effector and memory function. The requirement for MyD88 in lamina propria
T cells will be determined with regard to short term effector function and long-term memory function. The
importance of this research is that it will significantly extend and deepen our understanding of mechanisms
of resistance to Toxoplasma within the mucosal immune system, which is critical to understanding mucosal
host defense in humans. The ultimate impact of this research is that it can be expected to identify novel
parasite and host targets for promoting resistance and immunity during infection with Toxoplasma and other
microbial pathogens that threaten human health."
10931740,"ABSTRACT
Nigeria has a substantial number of preventable cancer deaths each year. The human papillomavirus (HPV)
vaccine and hepatitis B (HBV) vaccine are both evidence-based strategies to prevent cancer, but they have not
been widely scaled up in Nigeria. This suggests the need for innovative strategies that leverage
implementation science and tap the collective wisdom of Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country. We propose
the “US-Nigerian Cancer Control Center for Research on Implementation Science and Equity (C3-RISE).” Our
overall mission is two part: (a) use participatory implementation science strategies (i.e. crowdsourcing open
calls and apprenticeships) to expand uptake of HPV and HBV vaccines for cancer prevention; and (b) serve as
a hub for equity and capacity building in implementation science to advance the understanding of intervention
uptake and sustainment of evidence-based interventions to prevent cancer. This project brings together an
exceptional group of multi-disciplinary researchers from the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (the apex
federal health research organization, similar to the US NIH), St. Louis University, and the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill. We propose the following aims: (1) To accelerate equitable cancer control by
developing, testing, and refining participatory implementation strategies to decentralize vaccines to prevent
cancer in community settings; (2) To enhance the scientific productivity of C3-RISE by providing overarching
operational and scientific oversight; (3) To support innovative research and the development of scholars
trained to accelerate the uptake and sustainment of evidence-based cancer control interventions in Nigeria.
These aims will be accomplished by a nurturing hub of two cores (Administrative, Capacity Building) alongside
two research studies (Study 1 focused on HPV vaccination, Study 2 on HBV vaccination). Our three partner
institutions launched a participatory implementation science project four years ago that directly informed
national Nigerian health guidelines, trained 231 students, provided mentorship opportunities to 43 faculty, and
culminated in a WHO/TDR practical guide on crowdsourcing for health (UH3HD096929). This led to a recently
awarded NCI R01 grant (R01-CA271033) that uses participatory implementation science to develop innovative
strategies to enhance HPV services in Nigeria. C3-RISE will leverage this momentum to catalyze cutting-edge
cancer research, training, community engagement, and policy translation. Our project will increase health
equity, and it aligns with the Nigerian National Cancer Control Plan by focusing on participation, capacity
building, and sustainment. This U54 grant application directly responds to NIH, NCI, and NIMH strategic
priorities."
10931741,"Nigeria is at a crossroads in its cancer control response. On the one hand, the country remains an epicenter of
a growing cancer crisis. On the other hand, there are existing guidelines (e.g., the National Cancer Control
Plan2 by the Nigerian Ministry of Health, the Costing for Cervical Cancer Elimination in Nigeria by the World
Health Organization,3 a Society-wide guideline for cervical cancer elimination,4 and a recent National Strategic
Framework on vaccines for cancer control).5 These have accelerated the tempo and created new opportunities
to achieve the country's vision for reducing the incidence and mortality of cancer in Nigeria. As a result, to
support novel partnerships within and beyond traditional clinical services, including in community settings and
non-health sector organizations, we propose the US-Nigerian Cancer Control Center for Research on
Implementation Science and Equity (C3-RISE) Administration and Engagement Core (AEC). Our overarching
goal is to improve cancer control in Nigeria and exert a sustained impact on public health in partnership with
key stakeholders. Our proposed U54 Center brings together a transdisciplinary research team to meaningfully
collaborate with key stakeholders, including individuals, communities, and local and state ministries of health.
The U54 program will foster a Nigerian implementation science (IS) program to optimize the implementation of
vaccines for cancer control efforts in Nigeria. The AEC will be responsible for the overall administration,
coordination, and management of the Center and communication with the NIH. It will foster collaboration
between researchers and key stakeholders and provide critical infrastructure for equitable implementation of
evidence-based vaccines (i.e. human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines for cervical cancer and hepatitis B (HepB)
vaccines for liver cancer) for cancer control. We will also set a national and global standard for cutting-edge
participatory IS research approaches9 in a resource-constrained setting that accelerates the adoption,
adaptation, and sustainability of effective cancer control interventions in Nigeria. Our specific aims are: 1) To
coordinate project management of the center wide-activities using agile methods; 2) To serve as a community
engagement hub for IS in Nigeria using crowdsourcing methods; and 3) To evaluate Center's milestones and
overall progress. By providing an infrastructure that facilitates Center-wide communications, operations,
community outreach and evaluation, the AEC will serve as a central focal point to reinforce the overall vision of
reducing the incidence and mortality of cancer while advancing the role of IS for equitable cancer control in
Nigeria."
10904821,"ABSTRACT
Immunotherapy (IMT) has emerged as a promising treatment strategy across a broad spectrum of human
cancers, with multiple agents, particularly immune check point inhibitors, showing promising results in various
types of cancers. Its full potential has yet to be realized, due in part, to a lack of biomarkers predicting response
to treatment. Multiple immune and genomic biomarkers of response based on analysis of pre-treatment
specimens have been described but most are not very robust with significant overlap between responders and
non-responders. Therefore, there is a critical unmet need to perform comprehensive characterization of
candidate biomarkers in early phase IMT trials using standardized assays and novel methodologies. Recognizing
the need for comprehensive immune monitoring for IMT clinical trials, in 2017 NCI developed the Cancer Immune
Monitoring and Analysis Center (CIMAC) and Cancer Immunologic Data Commons (CIDC) Network, with the
goal of identifying biomarkers of response, resistance, and adverse events to optimize immunotherapy
approaches for patients with cancer. The MD Anderson Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center
(MDA-CIMAC) is one of four CIMAC sites established five years ago that has been standardizing genomic,
pathology and immunology assays and supporting profiling of tissue and blood specimens from patients treated
in IMT trials. The MDA-CIMAC will be co-led by Drs. Ignacio Wistuba, renowned cancer surgical and molecular
pathologist, Gheath Al-Atrash, well-known medical oncologist with expertise in stem cell transplantation and
immunotherapy, and Cara Haymaker, cancer immunologist with expertise in immune biomarker analysis. They
will be supported by a multidisciplinary team of world-class and highly collaborative experts on cancer and
immunotherapy. The main goals of MDA-CIMAC are to: 1) provide a centralized and harmonized platform for
sample collection, processing and quality assurance, and 2) use analytically-validated and standardized (Tiers
1 and 2) and highly innovative (Tier 3) assays to offer analyses for phenotypic, genomic, and functional
characterization of responses of patients enrolled on IMT clinical trials. In Aim 1, we will utilize Standard
Operating Procedures (SOPs) following the developed CIMAC umbrella protocol to provide services for
processing and distribution of annotated biospecimens from the NCI-sponsored early phase immunotherapy
clinical trials and to link the specimens to relevant clinical, pathological, immune and molecular data within the
CIMAC-CIDC Network. In Aim 2, we will perform routine and innovative pathological, immunological and
molecular analyses using standardized and validated and highly innovative assays to aid the completion of NCI-
sponsored early phase clinical trials and the development of novel predictive IMT biomarkers. In Aim 3, in
conjunction with the CIDC team, we will provide biostatistics and computational services for data collection and
analysis, and will perform, interpret and predict modeling of high dimensional (‘omic”) data. We envision that the
MDA-CIMAC will be indispensable as we make meaningful progress in cancer immunotherapeutic approaches."
10731356,"This is an application for a Merit Award to Dr. Alexa A. Pragman, M.D., Ph.D., a Staff Physician in Infectious
Disease at the Minneapolis VA and an Assistant Professor at the University of Minnesota. Dr. Pragman’s
current work on the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease lung microbiota is funded by a 5-year Career
Development Award-2 from the VA Office of Research and Development. Dr. Pragman has established a
record of accomplishments and publications related to her patient-oriented work on the lung microbiota in
chronic inflammatory pulmonary diseases. This Merit Award will provide the resources necessary to study the
effects of fine particle airborne pollution on the lung microbiota of veterans following deployment to southwest
Asia (Iraq, Afghanistan, or neighboring countries).
Following deployment to southwest Asia, veterans are disproportionately affected by chronic lung problems
including coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. While deployed, these veterans were exposed to
excessive concentrations of airborne particulate matter of ≤2.5 μm in size (PM2.5) as a result of seasonal dust
storms, burn pit smoke, and industrial pollution. PM2.5 exposure causes acute and chronic respiratory
problems, and may lead to diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. PM2.5
exposure has been linked to airway and gut microbiota dysbiosis in humans and rodent models, suggesting
that dysbiosis is a potential mediator for the inflammation, symptoms, and lung tissue destruction that continue
long after excessive PM2.5 exposure has stopped. Dysbiosis is defined as an imbalance or maladaptation in the
community of micro-organisms inhabiting a particular site.
In this Merit Award application, Dr. Pragman proposes a prospective case-control study to assess the
relationships between PM2.5 exposure, microbiota dysbiosis, and inflammation. This will be accomplished in
collaboration with VA Cooperative Study #595, Service and Health Among Deployed Veterans (SHADE), which
aims to understand the association between PM2.5 exposures during deployment and subsequent respiratory
symptoms. Dr. Pragman’s study will recruit 140 SHADE participants with chronic lung symptoms (coughing,
shortness of breath, or wheezing) and 140 SHADE participants without chronic lung symptoms. All subjects will
provide saliva and stool samples for microbiota analyses on an annual basis for 3 years. Sputum samples for
microbiota analysis will also be obtained from a subset of subjects on the same schedule. We will assess
microbiota dysbiosis and tissue-specific and systemic markers of inflammation. Our analysis will take into
account PM2.5 exposure levels (obtained from the SHADE study), tissue or site-specific effects, and incorporate
other risk factors for microbial dysbiosis. In Aim 1, Dr. Pragman will determine associations between
deployment-related PM2.5 exposure and site-specific dysbiosis. In Aim 2, Dr. Pragman will determine
associations between site-specific dysbiosis and respiratory symptoms. In Aim 3, Dr. Pragman will determine
site-specific associations between dysbiosis and inflammation. Our overall objective is to establish microbial
dysbiosis as a mediator between PM2.5 exposure and respiratory symptoms. Our central hypothesis is that
deployed veterans’ PM2.5 exposures place them at increased risk for dysbiosis, which in turn increases risk of
developing chronic respiratory symptoms and disease. These findings may identify veterans at high risk for
developing lung disease, and may identify a new treatment target—the microbiota—for primary and secondary
prevention of lung disease in this high-risk veteran population."
10731471,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Regulated proteolysis by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (ubiquitin system) plays essential roles in
a multitude of biological processes and has major ramifications for human health and disease, including
illnesses that range from cancer and neurodegeneration to cardiovascular syndromes and defects of
immunity. Our studies of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and ubiquitin-dependent N-degron pathways
(previously called “N-end rule pathways”) over more than three decades were made possible, to a large
extent, by the present grant (GM031530), currently in its 41st year of support. N-degron pathways recognize
proteins containing N-terminal (Nt) degradation signals called N-degrons, polyubiquitylate these proteins
and thereby cause their degradation by the proteasome or autophagy. Recognition components of
N-degron pathways, called N-recognins, are E3 ubiquitin ligases that can target N-degrons. One eukaryotic
N-degron pathway, called the Arg/N-degron pathway, targets, in particular, specific unmodified Nt-residues
of protein substrates.
 This GM031530 renewal application stems from our unpublished studies over the last ~2 years, and
focuses on new, previously unexplored aspects of the Arg/N-degron pathway. Specific proposed studies
address a coupling between a C-degron and stability of a protein’s mRNA, the new phenomenon of
superchanneling in targeting specific degrons, and a functional (as well as mechanistic) link between human
caspases and the Arg/N-degron pathway. Our studies of this universally present proteolytic system will
contribute to advances in fundamental biology and may also lead to therapies for specific human diseases."
10738802,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term objective of this project is to understand how an ion channel called Piezo1 endows
living cells with the ability to sense mechanical forces in their environment. This ability underlies a
wide range of physiological processes that are essential to life, including the control of cell size and
shape, the coalescence of cells into an organ system, and blood pressure control. The experiments are
designed on the principle that to understand we must first see what Piezo1 looks like in its various
forms. To this end the electron microscope will be used. We must also observe the functional
properties of Piezo1 under conditions in which we understand every component present. Then, by
comparing the functional properties, that is, how much the channel opens and closes under known
quantities of applied force, with the structures, we can construct a physics-based model to explain the
observable properties of Piezo1. Because we know that biology is complex, in a final stage of this
project we aim to determine structures of Piezo1 in the cell membrane. There, we cannot yet know all
the components that are present, but we hope to further understand how the more complex
environment of the cell regulates the behavior of Piezo1."
10888997,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder with dozens of highly penetrant risk
alleles and yet no effective pharmacological treatment. Mutations in the X-linked gene DDX3X are a high-risk
factor for ASD. Affected individuals are predominantly females, so studying DDX3X might offer insights into sex
differences in brain development and function. DDX3X encodes a DEAD-box RNA helicase critical for mRNA
metabolism. DDX3X is broadly expressed, and its functions in the brain are just beginning to emerge: Ddx3x
regulates cortical neurogenesis, hindbrain development, and synaptogenesis. However, we do not know the
circuit-level determinants of DDX3X mutations. There is a critical need to fill these gaps because, until we do so,
deciphering the complexity of ASD and developing effective therapeutics remain out of reach. To address this
unmet need, a mouse with construct and face validity for DDX3X mutations was generated in our laboratory
(Ddx3x+/- mice). The long-term goal is to understand the cellular and circuitry biology of ASD and identify new
targets for therapeutic intervention. The overall objective is to capture the neural mechanisms of mutations in
the ASD risk gene DDX3X with multimodal and holistic profiling. The central hypothesis is that Ddx3x regulates
the molecular identity, connectivity, and activity of corticofugal circuits subserving complex behaviors. The
rationale is that, once we identify reliable neural substrates, mechanism-based therapeutics can be developed
and tested pre-clinically. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three Specific Aims: 1) Identify the cortical
populations and the molecular signatures affected in Ddx3x+/- mice; 2) Map brain-wide neural ensembles with
altered connectivity and/or activity in Ddx3x+/- mice; and, 3) Dissect and manipulate corticofugal circuits driving
abnormal behavior in Ddx3x+/- mice. Under Aim 1, the major molecular and cellular ensembles affected by Ddx3x
mutations will be identified using single-cell transcriptomics and 3D cellular mapping. Under Aim 2, activity-based
neural substrates that are disrupted by Ddx3x mutations will be dissected using 3D mapping of immediate-early
genes expression after behavior. Under Aim 3, circuits will be manipulated with chemogenetics approaches. The
proposal is innovative because it uses cutting-edge methods to map the 3D landscape of defined neuronal
populations and whole-brain activity through the entire brain of a novel ASD mouse model. It is also innovative
because DDX3X is a high-confidence risk gene for ASD just recently discovered, and its role on shaping brain
circuits is still completely unknown. The application is significant because it will advance our understanding of
ASD complexity by reaching whole-brain, circuitry-level resolution, while propelling the development of a robust
platform to probe convergences across models and developmental stages. These results are expected to have
a positive impact because they will pave the way for novel therapeutic interventions for ASD."

 drug discovery.
PI: Darrin M. York, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854-8087 USA.
 Alchemical free energy (AFE) simulations are indispensable in various aspects of drug discovery by enabling
the prediction of ligand binding afﬁnity and selectivity. A critical barrier to progress is the current limitation in pre-
cision and accuracy of AFE simulations that restricts their predictive capability. The current proposal addresses
these barriers with new AFE methods and models that will be integrated into the GPU-accelerated AMBER soft-
ware suite used worldwide (over 30K users) in academia, government labs and industry. Speciﬁcally, we propose
to: 1. Create advanced technology for robust high-precision AFE simulations; 2. Develop accurate quantum
mechanical/deep-learning potential (QDπ) force ﬁelds for drug discovery and 3. Validate precision and accu-
racy of AFE methods and QDπ model. In Aim 1, we will develop new technologies for robust and reproducible
calculation of ligand-protein binding free energies of compound libraries. The methods work together to enable
highly precise, converged AFE simulations across thermodynamic graph networks. In Aim 2, we will develop a
highly accurate and computationally efﬁcient general quantum deep-potential interaction (QDπ) force ﬁeld model
for drug discovery. The QDπ model will be formulated as a machine learning potential correction (∆-MLP) to the
quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) energy using fast, approximate 3rd-order density-functional
tight-binding QM model and well-established AMBER MM force ﬁelds and compatible water and ions models. The
∆-MLP will leverage our recently developed range-corrected deep-learning potential (DPRc) for accurate intra-
and intermolecular interactions. In Aim 3, we will conduct in depth validation studies of the AFE methods from
Aim 1 and QDπ model of Aim 2 on a systematic set of benchmark systems, including macrophage migration
inhibitory factor (MIF), JAK2 JH2 domain, SARS-Cov2 Mpro, and sigma 1 and 2 receptors."
10867402,"Abstract
Hospital-acquired infections (HAI) resulting from the transmission of drug-resistant pathogens affect hundreds
of millions of patients worldwide. Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kpn), a gram-negative bacterium, is notorious for
causing HAI, with many of these infections difficult to treat as Kpn has become multi-drug resistant.
Epidemiological studies suggest that gastrointestinal (GI) colonization of Kpn is a major reservoir through
which Kpn can cause disease manifestations either in the colonized host or transmit from host to host. This site
of Kpn colonization has not been the focus of previous studies as a tractable model of Kpn GI colonization, and
host-to-host transmission did not exist. We have recently developed a murine model that allows for the study
of Kpn mucosal (oropharynx and GI) colonization, shedding within feces, and transmission through the fecal-oral
route. Using an oral route of inoculation and fecal shedding as a marker for GI colonization, we show
that Kpn can asymptomatically colonize the GI tract of immunocompetent mice and modifies the host GI
microbiota. We premise that specific Kpn genes contribute to its GI colonization, and the products of these genes
could serve as novel targets for the prevention of the establishment of GI colonization. More recently, we used
our murine model to screen a library of Kpn random transposon mutants (In-seq) to identify the complete set of
“GI colonization” genes from a single isolate. A metagenomics sequencing analysis further identified bacterial
species and the metabolic pathways affected by Kpn in the GI tract. Herein, we will focus on two sets of pathways
identified through In-seq whose products allow Kpn to overcome colonization resistance provided by the resident
gut microbiota. Thus, in Aim#1, we will focus on the ethanolamine utilization pathway genes (eut) of Kpn that
allow it to utilize ethanolamine (EA), a byproduct of cellular membranes and diet in the gut that can serve as an
alternative nutrient source. Unlike many other enteric pathogens that contain a single eut operon, Kpn has two
genetically distinct eut operons. We will identify the role of each eut locus in EA metabolism and determine the
underlying molecular mechanism through which EA metabolism provides Kpn with a fitness advantage against
members of the microbiome. Aim#2 will take a different approach by focusing on the contact-dependent killing
machinery of the Kpn (Type 6 secretion system [T6SS]) in overcoming colonization resistance provided by the
resident microbiota. We will focus on the unique regulatory mechanism that modulates the expression
of Kpn T6SS in the GI tract and provide it with a selective and competitive advantage against the resident gut
microbiota. Results from these studies would provide us with a fundamental understanding of the molecular
mechanisms involved in the establishment of GI colonization by an incoming pathogen. These studies will also
lay the groundwork for developing potential strategies to reduce the Kpn disease burden."

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a major cause of chronic respiratory symptoms, poor
quality of life and death for millions of people in the US and worldwide. In vulnerable people, exposure to
cigarette smoke over 2-3 decades leads to fixed, expiratory airflow obstruction, the sine qua non of COPD.
Although 30-40% of smokers will eventually develop COPD, there are no clinical, physiologic, biologic or
molecular measures that identify vulnerable people during the earliest phase of disease, i.e. before COPD can
be diagnosed by impaired lung function (Early COPD). This inability to identify vulnerable people during early
COPD drastically limits the ability of physicians to alter its course. This proposal will address this key research
gap and meet a major goal of the COPD National Action Plan, by studying the role of airway basal progenitor
dysfunction in detection, progression and pathogenesis of early COPD. Airway basal progenitor cells are
essential for lung health and repair. By virtue of their ability to replicate (self-renewal) and differentiate into all
cell types present in the epithelium (multipotentiality), airway progenitors can return an injured epithelium to
normal structure and function. Preliminary data from older (~60 years old) people showed that bronchial and
sinonasal basal progenitor function is reduced in smokers with COPD, smokers with low-normal lung function,
and in younger smokers (~40 years old) without known lung disease. These findings imply that progenitor
function has an important role in disease pathogenesis. Experiments using bulk and single cell RNA
sequencing, metabolomics, and Seahorse measurement of glycolytic flux and mitochondrial respiration
identified a strong signal for altered energy metabolism as a prime driver of progenitor dysfunction in older
smokers with COPD or low-normal lung function, and in younger smokers with low progenitor self-renewal.
Therefore, we hypothesize that sinonasal and bronchial progenitor dysfunction a marker for early and
accelerated progression of COPD, and that progenitor dysfunction during early COPD is associated with
altered cellular bio-energetics. We will test this hypothesis in 70 younger (age 30-50 years) smokers without
known lung disease stratified by progenitor self-renewal for high and low progenitor function. An additional 20
never smokers without known lung disease and 20 smokers with COPD will be enrolled as controls. Aim 1 will
use a cross-sectional design to determine whether bronchial and sinonasal progenitor dysfunction are markers
of early COPD. Aim 2 will use a longitudinal design to determine whether bronchial and sinonasal progenitor
dysfunction are markers for disease progression during early COPD. Aim 3 will determine whether bronchial
and sinonasal progenitor dysfunction are associated with altered cellular bioenergetics. Successful completion
of these aims could have a game-changing impact by focusing efforts on disease prevention before damage is
irreversible, facilitating use of treatments that slow lung function decline, and by identifying early mechanisms
of disease that together have the potential to save millions of lives."

BACKGROUND: The balance between clot formation (coagulation) and degradation (fibrinolysis) is disrupted in
patients with bleeding disorders or severe hemorrhage, resulting in increased bleeding. The extent to which
fibrinolysis contributes to bleeding from the onset of acute bleeding in these contexts is unclear, and this gap in
knowledge limits the development of therapies that inhibit fibrinolysis. Current therapeutics are often not sufficient
for patients with bleeding disorders; for example, antifibrinolytic drugs are widely used to manage acute bleeding
in these patients, but are unsuitable for long-term prophylaxis due to short half-lives that decrease efficacy.
RATIONALE: We hypothesize that fibrinolysis contributes to the incidence and severity of bleeding starting from
the onset of bleeding, and that long-acting RNA agents targeting plasminogen, the zymogen precursor of the
main fibrinolytic enzyme plasmin, can decrease fibrinolysis and help manage bleeding long-term for people
across all classes of bleeding disorders, including diagnosed and undiagnosed disorders. This knowledge will
provide insights into the mechanisms that impact outcomes in traumatic hemorrhage. These RNA agents will be
delivered using lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), a clinically approved delivery platform we have unique expertise in.
SPECIFIC AIMS: We will develop an RNA therapeutic targeting plasminogen, using small interfering RNA
(siRNA)-mediated gene silencing (siPlg). This therapy is long-acting over several weeks per dose and highly
specific for the target protein, which decreases the burden of frequent administration. The specific aims of this
proposal are to (1) Develop approaches for knockdown of plasminogen and inhibition of fibrinolysis in mice, pigs,
and dogs, and characterize the safety of this approach; (2) Determine the contribution of fibrinolysis to blood
loss at the onset and in early stages of hemorrhage in a traumatic injury model in swine; and (3) Investigate the
role of fibrinolysis in bleeding disorders by testing the effect of plasminogen knockdown in mouse and canine
models of hemophilia A, and mouse models of hemophilia B and von Willebrand disease.
INNOVATION: This work has both mechanistic and therapeutic innovation. It will immediately determine the
contribution of fibrinolysis to bleeding in early stages of severe hemorrhage and in bleeding disorders. This will
likely be the first development of RNA-LNP therapies targeting circulating proteins in large animal models of
bleeding. These findings will address a fundamental question in trauma and hemostasis research. Separately, it
will aid the development of improved, long-acting therapies for controlling bleeding in bleeding disorders. These
therapies would be particularly beneficial for women with menorrhagia caused by bleeding disorders.
EXPECTED OUTCOMES: We expect to (1) Develop species-specific siPlg that have minimal adverse health
effects; and (2-3) Demonstrate that knocking down plasminogen inhibits fibrinolysis and decreases blood loss in
swine models of traumatic hemorrhage, and in murine and canine models of bleeding disorders."

All major open-source brain modeling packages currently available (e.g., SimNIBS, DUNEuro, SciRun, ROAST)
as well as their commercial counterparts (e.g., Sim4Life, Ansys Maxwell, COMSOL) use the electric potential-
based Finite Element Method (FEM) for electromagnetic modeling. FEM has been continuously improved over
the past 60 years, is simple to implement and can model averaged tissue anisotropy. At the same time, FEM
may have some intrinsic weaknesses specifically affecting high-definition brain modeling. The present proposal
aims to develop and disseminate a novel alternative brain modeling engine. In contrast to FEM which uses the
electric potential, it operates with the primary (bio)physical quantity – surface (and volumetric) induced electric
charge density. To model charge interactions, it naturally employs the modern Fast Multipole Method (FMM)
instead of FEM. For piecewise homogeneous biological media of any complexity, only surface charges at bound-
aries are present. Their interactions are most accurately described by the boundary element method (BEM). This
combination of BEM and FMM is the new proposed BEM-FMM charge engine. The principal advantage of BEM-
FMM is its numerically unconstrained spatial field resolution. AIM 1. Improve and complete the BEM-FMM
modeling engine. Sub-aims: (i) major speed up of the BEM-FMM engine; (ii) new adaptive mesh refinement
algorithm; (iii) new volumetric anisotropic co-solver, (iv) computing activating function with unconstrained numer-
ical resolution and; (v) full-scale numerical verification against established FEM solvers SimNIBS and DUNEuro
at meso (submillimeter) scale. AIM 2. BEM-FMM testbed for non-invasive recordings and stimulation. 2A.
Develop BEM-FMM source localization stream for EEG/MEG recordings. We will construct and validate an
improvement over currently existing BEM EEG/MEG source localization software suites using BEM-FMM. We
will deliver a ready-to-use testbed with twenty head models and EEG/MEG experimental data. 2B. Develop a
BEM-FMM modeling stream with extracerebral compartments for noninvasive stimulation. For enhanced
resolution, we will automatically add fine-resolution major extracerebral compartments into existing segmenta-
tions pipelines based on anatomical rules. We will then deliver the ready-to-use BEM-FMM testbed targeting
TES and ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) where their effect might be critical for the correct dosage prediction
and correct targeting. AIM 3. BEM-FMM testbed for invasive electrical stimulation. 3A. Validate BEM-FMM
testbed for modeling activating function in animal axons. Verification for a giant inter-neuronal axon of cray-
fish Procambarus clarkia via electrical/magnetic stimulation and compound action potential generation for paral-
lel fibers in turtle Pseudemys Scripta Elegans cerebellum will be done. 3B. Verify BEM-FMM testbed for mod-
eling DBS responses. Using retrospective clinical data, we will develop a BEM-FMM algorithm for patient-
specific multipolar DBS and evaluate whether the model predictions align with clinical observations."

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence and mortality is increasing in the US and worldwide. Around ~50-
60% of HCC patients will receive systemic therapies. After a decade of primacy of sorafenib, the combination
regime of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) atezolizumab (anti-PDL1) with bevacizumab (anti-VEGFA)
demonstrated superior clinical benefits (median survival of ~19 months) and has become the standard of care.
However, the rate of objective response remains at ~30%. In parallel, our group demonstrated that 1) HCC
etiology differentially impacts outcome with patients with HCC deriving from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)
benefitting significantly less from immunotherapy; 2) Dysfunctional CD8 cells are implicated in the underlying
mechanism of resistance in NASH-HCC; 3) Newly generated gene signatures predict response to ICI; and 4)
The immune excluded class is driven by Wnt signaling/CTNNB1 mutations in HCC and, thus discovered
KIT/MAPK/Wnt inhibitors combined with ICI are adequate strategies to rescue this mechanism of immune-
evasion. Our central hypothesis is that such decreased response to ICIs in patients with NASH-HCC can be
reverted therapeutically using combinations of ICI and KIT/MAPK/Wnt signaling blockers; and candidate
biomarkers of response can be identified and validated. Thus, the overarching goal of this proposal is to gain
further insight into mechanisms of both NASH-HCC immune response and resistance via state-of-the-art single
cell technologies, so as to identify biomarkers and overcome resistance through the rational testing of
combinatorial immunotherapeutic strategies, which could eventually increase the number of HCC patients
deriving clinical benefit from immunotherapy. To accomplish this goal, we seek to achieve the following specific
aims: 1) To map the immune cell microenvironment in human NASH-HCC by using single cell-based approaches
and high-resolution spatial transcriptomics; 2) To identify biomarkers predicting response and resistance to the
combination of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in human NASH-HCC by testing identified gene signatures and
molecular markers of response (using transcriptomics and mutational profiling), as well as spatial
transcriptomics; 3) To develop therapeutic strategies to overcome ICI resistance in NASH-HCC using specific
patient-derived organoids with immune component and mouse models that recapitulate the human NASH-HCC
microenvironment. These hypothesis-driven strategies include testing drugs blocking key pathways of immune
evasion (Wnt) in combination with ICI. The pursuit of these aims will be coupled with our expertise in NASH-
related hepatocarcinogenesis, genomics and transcriptomics, single-cell based technologies, immuno-oncology,
generation of organoids reconstituted with TILs and mouse modeling. We expect that our proposal will bring
precision immune-oncology closer to the clinics, will promote clinical trials including KIT/MAPK/WNT inhibitors
with promise of significant benefit to the outcomes of HCC patients. Overall, our discoveries will create a
paradigm shift in the field of NASH-HCC."

Malignant gliomas, including the most common type glioblastoma (GBM), are histologically heterogeneous and
invasive tumors known as the most devastating neoplasms with high morbidity and mortality. Despite multimodal
treatment including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, the disease inevitably recurs and proves fatal.
Local application of carmustine implants (Gliadel® wafers) as an adjunct to surgery and radiation therapy has
been clinically proven to extend the survival time for patients with malignant gliomas, strongly suggesting that
local chemotherapy after tumor resection presents a feasible and effective strategy to treat brain tumor
patients. However, the rapid depletion of carmustine and low tissue penetration greatly limit the clinical benefits
of Gliadel® wafers, which only extend the median survival of treated patients by six months compared to those
untreated. This proposal aims to develop a novel type of self-assembling nanofiber hydrogels that use the
anticancer drug camptothecin (CPT) as the molecular building blocks and that can be locally administered to the
resection cavities after tumor removal, with the ultimate goal to achieve more effective treatments for patients
diagnosed with malignant gliomas. We hypothesize that the proposed nanofiber hydrogels will spread across
large tissue areas and sustainably release therapeutic agents for long-term cytotoxicity against glioma cells, thus
leading to significantly extended survival time in our rodent model. To test our hypothesis, we outlined the
proposed research activities in the three specific Aims, seeking to address the three key challenges in local
delivery of therapeutic drugs into resection cavities: 1) the nanofiber gelation properties. The gel form enables
prolonged retention in the delivery sites and also minimizes capillary loss of free drugs that would otherwise
occur; 2) the sustained release of free drugs over a long period of time. The release rate and period are
critical for effective elimination of glioma cells without causing devastating side effects; 3) diffusion across large
tissue areas. In Aim 1, we will identify the key molecular parameters in the design of self-assembling CPT DAs
to create CPT nanofibers of varying surface chemistries that would promote the formation of hydrogels upon
contact with body fluids. Aim 2 is focused on the evaluation and fine-tuning of the drug release rate and
mechanism, their ability to overcome the MDR mechanisms, as well as diffusion distance within organotypic
tissues. In Aim 3, we will use an animal model to evaluate the nanofibers’ ability to diffuse across large tissue
areas, pharmacokinetics, in vivo efficacy and toxicity of two already developed nanofiber hydrogels and also
those to be developed in Aim 1 and Aim 2. Our ultimate goal is to develop a nanofiber hydrogel platform
technology that will extend the survival time of rodents bearing human brain cancer, and translate this platform
to a pre-clinical approach."

Membrane Associated RING CH (MARCH) proteins are RING E3 ubiquitin ligases that are implicated in the
regulation of membrane receptors. This family of ubiquitin ligases emerged after the discovery of K3 and K5, two
viral MARCH-homologues in Kaposi’s sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV), which are critical in evading the
host’s immune response by ubiquitinating and subsequently removing the major histocompatibility complex class
II (MHC-II) receptors from the surface of the cells and therefore blocking antigen presentation. The cellular
MARCH family of proteins consists of 11 members that share structural similarity and contain a RING-CH domain
that is essential for the removal and internalization of target membrane receptors (e.g. MHC-II). Recent reports
showed that MARCH proteins can also potently restrict human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection.
MARCH1, 2 and 8 restrict HIV-1 and other retroviruses by blocking the incorporation of the viral envelope in the
budding virions. This proposal explores aspects of the MARCH-mediated antiretroviral mechanism that have
never been previously studied. Currently, there is no information concerning a viral protein that counteracts
MARCH proteins. The first aim of this research plan examines the mechanism by which an HIV encoded factor
counteracts MARCH8 during infection. The second aim examines the susceptibility of HIV-1 envelopes from
different subtypes to MARCH-mediated restriction as well as the ability of HIV-1 proteins from different subtypes
to counteract MARCH8. Preliminary studies show that HIV-1 over time becomes resistant to MARCH restriction.
The third aim will determine the changes in the HIV-1 genome that render it resistant to MARCH inhibition.
Finally, the fourth aim will address the role of the other MARCH proteins on HIV-1 infection. In summary, these
studies will shed new light on the anti-retroviral role of MARCH proteins and will address aspects of MARCH-
mediated HIV-1 inhibition that have not been previously determined. Finally, these proteins have strong potential
as clinical targets for the development of antiretroviral therapeutics."

Dysfunction of both the hippocampus and the orbitofrontal cortex have been implicated in a wide variety of
neuropsychiatric disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, mood disorders and addiction. However,
their exact contribution remains unclear. A major problem is that most research on hippocampal mechanisms
is derived from rodent work. However, the structure of the hippocampus has undergone dramatic changes
across the course of evolution, particularly in those parts associated with psychopathologies. This necessitates
the use of primate models, but there have been few studies of hippocampus in the primate. The current grant
will investigate the neuronal properties of hippocampus in the primate and determine how it interacts with
orbitofrontal cortex.
The theoretical framework that we will employ is derived from computational psychiatry, with a particular focus
on how the computational processes underlying reinforcement learning might contribute to neuropsychiatric
disease. Our hypothesis is that both hippocampus and orbitofrontal cortex make critical contributions to
model-based reinforcement learning, whereby hippocampus is responsible for constructing the cognitive map
that instantiates the neural representation of the task model, and orbitofrontal cortex is responsible for using
the cognitive map to generate reward predictions that can be used to guide decision-making. To test this
hypothesis, we will use a combination of high-channel count neuronal recordings and electrical
microstimulation.
We will record from single neurons in the hippocampus during performance of a reward-based learning task
and examine whether hippocampal neurons show value place tuning. We will then examine how hippocampus
might communicate this information to orbitofrontal cortex by recording from both structures simultaneously.
Our prediction is that this communication will be mediated via synchronization of theta rhythms. However, such
measures are correlative. Establishing a causal role for neural rhythms has proven challenging, since it is
difficult to manipulate a specific neuronal rhythm without affecting other neuronal rhythms and/or neuronal
firing rates. We have recently developed a closed-loop approach, which involves recording rhythms in real-time
and using those signals to control the application of electrical microstimulation. This allows us to disrupt a
neuronal rhythm of a specific frequency. We will use this method to examine whether there is a causal role for
the theta oscillation in reward-based learning.
Taken together, the results of this proposal will provide convergent correlative and causal evidence for the role
of hippocampus and orbitofrontal cortex in reward-based learning and the mechanism by which they
communicate. This will help lay the groundwork for future potential therapeutic approaches for frontolimbic
dysfunction based on closed-loop microstimulation."
10740869,"The proposed program is to provide a summer research experience in next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis for neurogenetics and neurogenomics for 10 undergraduate students. NGS has transformed the field of genomics and is increasingly permeating all aspects of biosciences research and medicine. Using NGS to understand the brain and neurological disease is one of the major frontiers in biomedical science and will drive advances in the field in the near future and for decades to come. There will be a huge need for researchers in neuroscience with strong data analysis skills relevant to genomics. This need is evident in the increasing emphasis on quantitative analysis skills in biosciences graduate programs as well as in biomedical professional schools. To address this need, we will establish the program called “Bruins in Genomics in Neurogenetics and Neurogenomics (BIG­NGG)”. It will leverage the infrastructure of an existing summer program “Bruins in Genomics (BIG­Summer)”, supported by the Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences (QCB) at UCLA, and the QCB Collaboratory. BIG­ Summer consists of a combination of practical workshop tutorials that focus on NGS data analysis skills, and a hands-on research experience in genomics. The proposed R25 program will allow 10 additional students to participate in BIG, and specifically to learn about the growing and cutting-edge research field of neurogenetics and neurogenomics. The students will be quantitative or biosciences majors entering their junior and senior years. We expect that many of our participants will have this research experience serve as a launching point for continuing in biomedical research in either quantitative biosciences Ph.D. programs such as a Bioinformatics Ph.D. program or a Neuroscience Ph.D. program."

The prognosis for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) patients is dismal. Unfortunately, attempts at
immunotherapy for PDAC to date using single agents have not achieved significant clinical benefits. This is likely
due to the presence of a uniquely suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Our recent data suggest that
immune priming by dendritic cells (cDCs) may ultimately a rate-liming barrier to productive anti-tumor immunity.
While the focus of research in pancreatic cancer has been on the TME during primary disease, we are only
now realizing how significant the differences in the TME are between primary and metastatic disease and/or
metastatic lesions in different organs. These differences are critical, as the majority of immunotherapeutic
approaches are being tested in refractory metastatic PDAC patients. We will address this shortcoming in
understanding metastatic PDAC biology by determining the differential impact of metastatic disease site(s) on
immune priming by cDCs. cDCs are central for generating tumor antigen-specific T-cell responses. In animal
models and human correlative studies, cDCs are crucial for responsiveness to both cytotoxic and checkpoint
immunotherapies. Our published data show that cDCs were severely dysfunctional in PDAC patients and that
this dysfunction was driven by two distinct mechanisms. First, we reported that PDAC patients had impaired cDC
development in their bone marrow, which led to a functional depletion of circulating pre-DCs, impaired cross-presentation
of tumor antigens, and poor responses to checkpoint inhibitors. Even when DC development is not
fully impaired, we've shown cDCs are dysfunctional and excluded from the PDAC TME. Overall, these
mechanisms impair the ability of conventional therapies to prime tumor antigen-specific T-cell responses and
checkpoint immunotherapy to drive efficacy. Together these data support our hypothesis that metastatic organ
site-specific drivers lead to divergent effects on local and systemic tumor immunities. We will directly
address this hypothesis with the following aims:
Aim 1. Determine the impacts of the site of metastatic disease on immune priming by cDCs.
Aim 2. Determine the impacts of the site of metastatic disease on systemic immunity and cDC
development.
Aim 3. Determine how therapy differentially shapes the TME at different metastatic sites to impact
immune priming.
Significance: These understandings are critical for the treatment of mPDAC patients."
10866529,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Legionella pneumophila (Lp) is the agent of Legionnaires disease, an oft-fatal form of pneumonia that is
increasing in incidence. In natural and man-made aquatic habitats, Lp flourishes as an intracellular parasite of
amoebae, often in biofilms. Following the inhalation of Lp-contaminated water droplets, the pathogen grows
primarily in alveolar macrophages and secondarily in lung epithelia. Relatively little is known about Lp pili or the
bases of Lp attachment to human cells and other surfaces. Early electron microscopy revealed different
filaments emanating from the Lp surface, suggesting that Lp expresses “long” and “short” pili. Genomic
analysis done by others and us gradually found that Lp has all the genes that typically encode a type IV pilus
(T4P) apparatus affirming that at least some Lp pili are T4P. Recently, we uncovered pilA2, a previously
unrecognized gene predicted to encode a protein with similarity to major building blocks (type IVa major pilins)
of other T4P-expressing bacteria. Immunofluorescence microscopy has revealed that PilA2 exists prominently
across the entire length of visualized Lp pili, affirming its role as a major pilin. Intriguingly, we discovered
adjacent to pilA2 a second type IVa major pilin gene, pilA1. From our RNA-Seq work, both pilA1 and pilA2 are
expressed by Lp growing in liquid and solid media. Moreover, based on the behavior of a pilA1 pilA2 double
mutant, pilA1 and pilA2 each promote twitching, a form of surface associated motility. However, whereas a
pilA2 mutant was impaired for DNA uptake and infection of Acanthamoeba castellanii (Ac) but hyper-
aggregative, a pilA1 mutant was impaired for auto-aggregation but normal for DNA uptake and Ac infection.
Thus, we hypothesize that i) PilA2 majorly comprises T4aP that promote competence, twitching, and infection
of Ac, but are inhibitory to Lp aggregation and ii) that PilA1 forms distinct T4aP that promote aggregation as
well as twitching motility but are not needed for DNA uptake or Ac infection. Thus, overturning long-standing
perspectives, our work provides the first genetic evidence that Lp elaborates more than one type of functional
T4P, compatible with the “old” EM data that had shown two sizes of pili on the Lp surface. This proposal aims
to i) confirm if PilA1 and PilA2 assemble, as major pilins, into distinct Lp T4aP and ii) discern if PilA1-T4aP and
PilA2-T4aP are functionally different in the context of adherence to and infection of human macrophages and
epithelia, infection of various amoebae that help transmit Lp to humans, and biofilm formation, which is another
key attribute of Lp in vivo and in the environment. This work will i) increase our knowledge of Lp, a growing
clinical problem, ii) define new forms of T4P and infection pathways, iii) have implications for other pathogens
that use T4P or are intracellular parasites, and iv) suggest new targets for disease treatment or prevention."

COVID-19 (CoV19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection of the airway epithelium resulting in extensive
damage in the lower respiratory tract. Since 2020, CoV19 has claimed over 1 million lives in the United
States surpassing the death toll of the 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Clinical studies show that the
mortality and morbidity of CoV19 is associated with secondary infection. Given a central role of the airway
epithelium as a barrier against pathogens, preliminary studies tested whether airway basal stem cells
(BSCs) are impaired in their regenerative function in CoV19 patients. Of note, BSCs are a major type of
stem cells responsible for epithelium regeneration following respiratory viral infection in humans. In
preliminary studies, we derived 6 lines of BSCs from severe cases of CoV19 using tracheal aspirate (TA)
as a source of bronchial BSCs. These CoV19-exposed BSCs were tested free of virus; however, they
show early cell cycle arrest, sustained STAT3 hyperactivity, and defective differentiation in air-liquid
interface. In contract, BSCs derived from TA of control patients with neurogenic and cardiogenic
respiratory failure have no such defects. Similar to our findings in vitro, antibody staining of fatal CoV19
lung sections revealed increased senescence and defective differentiation of BSCs. In addition, CoV19-
exposed BSCs in vitro maintained, at least partially, an inflammatory gene signature that was found in
BSCs in vivo by single cell-seq of lung samples from CoV19 patients. As such, BSCs derived from TA of
CoV19 patients provide a viable cell model to investigate how CoV19 impairs epithelial regeneration by
inducing an inflammatory memory in BSCs. Mechanistically, CoV19-exposed BSCs exhibit unique
chromatin opening at sites enriched for transcriptional factors mediating the inflammatory pathways, such
as STAT3. Based on these preliminary findings, we hypothesize that inflammation in CoV19 causes
an epigenetic memory in BSCs to impair epithelium regeneration. Leveraging our ability to derive
TA BSCs, Aim1 will test whether CoV19 uniquely reprograms BSCs compared to other acute respiratory
infections. Aim 2 will identify the molecular mediators of the inflammatory memory in CoV19-exposed
BSCs using complementary assays. The rescue assay will test whether blocking STAT3 hyperactivity
and reversing epigenetic modification in CoV19-exposed BSCs will normalize their role in epithelial
regeneration. The disease-mimicking assay will assess the activity of inflammatory signals in memory
induction in healthy control BSCs. The proposed exploratory studies will lay the foundation for future
delineation of inflammatory signals and intracellular mediators in the disease memory of BSCs using
genetic approaches and animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings will inform therapeutics to
facilitate epithelial regeneration in severe cases of CoV19."

Despite recent progress in reducing the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 687,000 HAIs occurred in U.S. acute care hospitals in 2015
and that the HAI prevalence on a given day was one in 30 patients. An estimated 72,000 patients died with
HAIs during their hospitalization. In addition, outbreaks in hospitals remain a serious problem but the vast
majority of hospitals use antiquated and ineffective methods to detect them. We established the Enhanced
Detection System for Healthcare Acquired Transmission (EDS-HAT) (R01AI127472), which combines bacterial
whole genome sequencing (WGS) surveillance (as opposed to reactive WGS) to detect outbreaks with data
mining (DM) of the electronic health record (EHR) and machine learning (ML) to identify the responsible
transmission routes. We have demonstrated that EDS-HAT detects both serious outbreaks that were otherwise
unrecognized and novel transmission routes and therefore now run the system in real time. Plasmids carried
by bacteria frequently encode genes that confer resistance to antimicrobial agents. When patients or hospital
environments are co-colonized with two bacterial species, these settings provide the opportunity for plasmid
transfer to occur from a species carrying a plasmid to one that does not. The species with the newly acquired
plasmid can then be transmitted to another patient, a combination of events we call transfer to transmission
(T2T). Importantly, T2T events are not captured by traditional WGS analysis or EDS-HAT. In this R21
application, we propose to leverage the success and infrastructure of EDS-HAT by developing methods for
detection of T2T events and determining the potential utility of incorporating surveillance for these events into
EDS-HAT. In Aim 1, we plan to develop and validate optimal laboratory and bioinformatics approaches for
real-time identification of T2T events in the hospital. In Aim 2, we will determine the feasibility and potential
impact of real-time monitoring for T2T events and determining the responsible transmission routes. Actionable
T2T events will be reported to our infection prevention team so that interventions can be developed to interrupt
transmission. These aims will be accomplished by a team with expertise in infectious diseases epidemiology,
outbreak investigation, infection prevention and control, microbial genomics and genomic epidemiology. If
successful, this research will lead to a novel infection prevention tool. The proposed research is highly
translational and will improve patient safety through incorporation of innovative genomic and computational
approaches for identifying otherwise unrecognized T2T events."

The goal of this Focused Technology R01 project is to develop technologies for rapid discovery
of inhibitors of carbohydrate-binding proteins (CBPs). Carbohydrate-protein interactions are
critical in numerous processes including host-pathogen recognition, cell adhesion and cell
signaling, cancer angiogenesis, immune suppression, heart/liver/lung/eye fibrosis,
atherosclerosis, diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis, to name a few examples. However, selective
disruption of specific CBP interactions is challenging in vivo. CBPs generally bind weakly to
individual glycans, with higher affinity (avidity) or specificity coming from multivalent interactions
to clustered glycans or interactions with nearby non-carbohydrate elements. A given CBP also
usually binds to various glycans. To untangle the complex web of CBP functions, it is important
to have a way to rapidly develop a specific and potent inhibitor of a CBP that can be used in the
relevant in vivo context. To this end, we propose two Aims: 1) to develop multivalent glyco-F-RNA
aptamers, in which a nuclease-resistant, F-RNA backbone is evolved to present simple glycans
in a manner that is selectively recognized by a CBP of interest; 2) to develop monovalent glyco-
F-RNA aptamers, in which a simple glycan provides a binding “foothold” for the CBP of interest,
which the evolved F-RNA component confers additional binding affinity and specificity through
interactions auxiliary to the glycan-binding pocket."
10843239,"Maladaptive processes of uncertainty are linked to cognitive dysfunctions in mental illness, such as
anxiety, behavioral addictions, and schizophrenia. However, it is not clear what specific computations
support this general notion of uncertainty, how they go wrong, and how these same computational
constructs transdiagnostically influence many mental illnesses. We plan to address these questions
by drawing on our recent theoretical work (Piray and Daw, 2021), which identifies specific
computational hypotheses about how uncertainty processes may go wrong when organisms are
faced with observations that are corrupted by two types of noise: moment-to-moment stochasticity of
observations and volatility, i.e., how quickly they change. Using a novel task, we will address these
questions both cross-sectionally (Aim 1) and longitudinally (Aim 2) in a large general population.
Statistical principles indicate that volatility and stochasticity have opposite effects on the learning rate,
a parameter that determines the reliance on each new outcome during learning. But earlier research
in computational neuroscience and computational psychiatry failed to consider mutual dependencies
in computing volatility and stochasticity, leaving open the question of how the brain separates these
two types of noise in the real world in which they are both unknown. In recent work, we addressed
this issue and introduced a model for the joint estimation of both factors. A key prediction of the
model is that individuals who are less sensitive to stochasticity are more likely to mistake stochasticity
for volatility, and vice versa. This situation might, in principle, arise in psychiatric conditions. Here, we
propose a behavioral task that systematically manipulates both volatility and stochasticity. The task,
together with the model, allows us to find two key parameters for each subject: sensitivity to
stochasticity and sensitivity to volatility. In Aim 1, we will use the task to characterize the cognitive
process supporting computations of volatility and stochasticity and link the process parameters to
transdiagnostic constructs of psychopathology. In Aim 2, we will determine whether model
parameters predict trajectories of clinically relevant symptoms. This project attempts to model
complicated cognitive processes that are relevant for understanding learning and decision-making
dysfunctions in mental illness by utilizing cutting-edge data collection technologies and by mapping
subject-level parameters reflecting individual variations in this process to transdiagnostic self-report
measures. This work makes it possible to study the neurophysiological underpinnings of volatility,
stochasticity, and uncertainty in the future. This project also has the potential to pave the way for the
development of biomarkers for transdiagnostic constructs related to uncertainty computations, which
are relevant to anxiety, depression, behavioral addictions, and schizophrenia."

Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) are a powerful model system to assess efficacy of anti-cancer agents and
understand molecular mechanisms of drug resistance. By applying agent combinations against patient-derived

clinical testing in defined sub-populations of cancer patients. However, integration of PDX drug response with
molecular characterization data across diverse PDX collections is needed to enable this vision. A key aspect is
the need for well-managed resources for community sharing and large-scale analysis of standardized datasets
from PDXs and other patient-derived models. The Jackson Laboratory-Seven Bridges (JAX-SB) PDX Data

approaches, our PDCCC provides administrative and computational infrastructure for PDXNet to enable PDX
method standardization, model sharing, data sharing, and massive-scale data analysis. To date, we have built
the PDXNet Portal, which currently contains PDXNet model information and data resources from 334 new
models across 33 cancer types. Our PDCCC team has both facilitated and actively guided consortium
collaborative projects, leading to several major publications and 10 Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program Letters
of Intent. Here, we propose to enhance the PDXNet Portal and refine our organizational activities to address
needs clarified by the NCI and PDX communities, including: faster translation of PDX studies to clinical trials;
precise organization and sharing of multi-omic and treatment response data; and development of predictors of
clinical treatment response. Our Specific Aims are: 1) To provide robust PDCCC support for PDXNet
stakeholders through regular committees, personnel expertise, and project tools; 2) To enhance PDXNet Portal
content, functionality, and data sharing; and 3) To develop and implement strategies that accelerate PDX
translation to clinical trials. Through these Aims, we will coordinate the activities of the PDXNet to increase the
value of patient-derived cancer model treatment studies and speed the generation of clinical trials."
10734062,"Under inflammatory conditions, bone destruction can be linked to excessive activity of bone-resorbing
osteoclasts (OCs), which results not only from the differentiation of too many OCs, but also from over-
maturation of OCs. While most current bone loss treatments prevent bone loss by reducing OC numbers, it
may be better if future therapeutic strategies focus on targeting OC maturation rather than early OC
differentiation to avoid inhibiting coupled bone formation that depends on interactions between bone-forming
osteoblasts and OCs. In an effort to target maturation, we previously identified immunoglobulin superfamily
member 11 (IgSF11) as a novel cell surface receptor that regulates OC differentiation but not new bone
formation. To characterize IgSF11 signaling, we analyzed, by mass spectrometry, proteins phosphorylated
after IgSF11 activation and identified Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), the enzyme that catalyzes the last step of
glycolysis, as a downstream target. This finding highlights a potentially greater than previously known
determinative role for metabolic regulation during OC differentiation and inflammatory bone loss. We therefore
propose the following specific aims: 1. Examine the role of IgSF11-PKM2 signaling in inflammatory bone loss.
We will investigate OC-expressed IgSF11 in the context of inflammatory bone loss by using an LPS-induced
model of bone loss. To test the contribution of PKM2-dependent effects, we will treat LPS-induced IgSF11-/-
mice with small molecule modulators (TEPP-46, shikonin) of PKM2. Our preliminary data suggests that TEPP-
46 activation of PKM2 reduces DSS-induced bone loss. To examine whether IgSF11 expression affects colitis-
associated bone loss, we will perform DSS-induced colitis experiments using IgSF11-deficient mice. We will
also perform DSS-induced colitis experiments using IgSF11-/- mice treated with TEPP-46 or shikonin. These
studies will be critical to establishing the intersection of IgSF11 and PKM2 contributions to clinically relevant
inflammatory bone loss. 2. Characterization of IgSF11-PKM2 signaling mechanisms in osteoclast
differentiation. We have formulated a four-step model of IgSF11-PKM2 function during OC differentiation,
which we will test with the aid of hCD3-iFL, a retroviral (RV) construct to directly activate intracellular IgSF11 in
differentiating OCs. We will first investigate possible crosstalk between RANK and IgSF11-PKM2, which we
speculate is mediated by TRAF6-dependent K63-linked polyubiquitination of the IgSF11 scaffold protein PSD-
95. Second, we aim to identify kinases proximal to the IgSF11-PSD-95 complex that phosphorylate PKM2.
Third, we will use RV mutants to confirm the importance of various PKM2 modifications, PKM2 allosteric
confirmation, and PKM2 subcellular localization to OC differentiation. Finally, PKM2 is a well-characterized
enzymatic regulator of glycolysis, so we will employ metabolic assays and inhibitors to confirm the significance
of this aspect of PKM2 function to OC differentiation. These studies will be critically important to initial
validation and characterization of a putative IgSF11-PKM2 pathway and its function during OC differentiation."
10909320,"Project Summary: Characterizing the Redoxome of Chlamydia and Its Host Cell
 Chlamydia is an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes a range of serious diseases in
humans. In developed countries, Chlamydia trachomatis is the primary cause of bacterial sexually transmitted
infections (STI). Indeed, recent reports from the Centers for Disease Control highlight the increasing incidence
of STIs, with chlamydia infections consistently outpacing all other types. In developing countries, C.
trachomatis is not only a significant cause of STI, but it is also responsible for the primary cause of infectious
preventable blindness, trachoma. The major concern of chlamydial infections is that they are often
asymptomatic and undiagnosed, which can lead to chronic sequelae. These include pelvic inflammatory
disease, tubal factor infertility, and reactive arthritis for C. trachomatis. Consequently, chlamydial diseases
remain a significant burden on health care systems around the world.
 In adapting to obligate intracellular growth, Chlamydia has significantly reduced its genome size and
eliminated genes from various pathways as it relies on the host cell for its metabolic needs. This pathogen
also alternates between different functional and morphological forms during its normal growth, also referred
to as its developmental cycle. These observations, combined with its obligate intracellular dependence, makes
Chlamydia a difficult organism with which to work. However, recent development of genetic tools to study
chlamydiae mechanistically have significantly enhanced our understanding of this pathogen. This proposal
applies a combination of these new genetic techniques and established mass spectrometry-based
approaches to evaluate proteins subjected to redox regulation in both the host and bacterium. The hypothesis
of the proposed work is that Chlamydia uses redox signaling to trigger secondary differentiation from the
replicative to the infectious form of the organism. The major goals of this two-year funding proposal are to
identify host and bacterial proteins subjected to redox regulation as a first step towards addressing our
hypothesis. Selected wild-type and mutant proteins will be evaluated for changes in their redox status both in
vitro and in cell culture. Results from this study will advance our understanding of this important pathogen and
lead to further work to characterize the function of identified redox-regulated proteins. This may, in turn, lead
to the design of novel therapeutic agents that are specific for Chlamydia. This will allow for minimal effects on
normal flora for patients receiving treatment for this highly prevalent disease."
10895539,"ABSTRACT
In Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), and to a lesser extent in non-demented individuals, deposition of amyloid β (Aβ)
is found around cerebral vessels, a condition called Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA). It is likely that the
development of CAA, and consequently neurovascular unit (NVU) dysfunction, in AD may result from failure of
Aβ clearance pathways. Importantly, all Aβ clearance pathways involve movement of Aβ towards the vasculature
for elimination. Cerebrovascular endothelial cells (EC), which line all brain vessels, are the gatekeepers of the
brain and are responsible for the maintenance of cerebral homeostasis through the blood-brain barrier (BBB).
The development of CAA severely impacts brain health since it results in EC death, BBB breakdown,
microhemorrhages, parenchymal Aβ accumulation, and is one of the earliest triggers for AD progression. EC
dysfunction also affects other cells of the NVU, such as astrocytes or microglia, through finely regulated
communication mechanism between these cells. Therefore, CAA-mediated EC dysfunction may also precipitate
neuroinflammation in AD. Our preliminary data suggests that EC mitochondria serve as important sensors of Aβ
damage. Previous studies have shown that mitochondria are responsible for the activation of inflammatory
pathways through the release of mitochondrial danger associated molecular patterns (mtDAMPs), including
mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), due to formation of the pathological mitochondrial permeability
transition pore (mPTP). Both cerebrovascular dysfunction and inflammation are shown early in disease
pathogenesis, suggesting that early EC (and thus, BBB) dysfunction may drive and perpetuate AD pathology
also by triggering widespread neuroinflammation. Here, we will test the hypothesis that Aβ induces mitochondrial
dysfunction in cerebral ECs through deleterious alterations in mitochondria function (mtROS and mPTP opening)
and that these alterations further contribute to neurovascular dysfunction and inflammation in CAA and AD. This
proposal seeks to understand the role of alterations in cerebral EC mitochondrial health and bioenergetics,
specifically focusing on the modulation of mtROS and mPTP, on human EC inflammatory activation due to Aβ
(Aim 1; K99: Y1 and Y2). Moreover, we want to assess how Aβ-induced cerebral EC inflammatory mediators
contribute to glial mitochondrial dysfunction and activation, through the modulation of mtDAMPs, using a human
iPSC-derived glial cell cultures (Aim 2; K99: Y2 and R00: Y1). Finally, using an animal model of amyloidosis
presenting CAA and gliosis (TgSwDI), we will test the hypothesis that Aβ-induced endothelial mtROS and mPTP
mediate neuroinflammation and cognitive decline, by treating the animals with a mtROS scavenger or depleting
their ECs of CypD, the main mPTP regulator (Aim 3; R00: Y1-Y3). The proposed experiments will provide a
novel understanding of the role of vascular mitochondria as initiators of inflammation in AD and CAA, potentially
resulting in the development of new disease modifying therapeutic strategies."
10876426,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Biocatalysis is quickly emerging a set of synthetic power tools for the direct synthesis of chemical matter. By
leveraging enzymes, Nature’s chemical palette for molecular editing, chemists have been able to readily
decorate molecules with high complexity, in a highly selective fashion. The potential of biocatalysis has been
illustrated in its growing use in the pilot scale preparation of therapeutics to treat serious human illness.
This proposal approaches chemoenzymatic synthesis using biocatalysts from two vantage points. In the first
case, the focus is on retrosynthesis guided enzyme discovery by comparison to known biosynthetic pathways.
This will be used to enable the preparation of polyhydroxylated tropolones, highly oxygenated aromatic small
molecules that have broad bioactivities that span from antimicrobial to antiviral and antineoplastic applications.
In a different vein, biocatalysts will be used to expedite the synthesis of spirocyclic tropolone natural products,
malettinins B, C and E. In both cases, enzymes are borrowed from bacterial and fungal tropolone biosynthesis.
This approach will extend into independent research into the synthesis of spiroisoxazoline small molecules,
compounds with equally potent bioactivities isolated from marine sponges, via library screening of cytochrome
P450 enzymes.
In a different lens, the proposal will also delve into investigative reaction design by searching for hidden reaction
pathways across enzyme families. This approach will first be investigated in the context of amino acid
functionalization by using a library of native pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes that perform a wide
range of reactions in Nature. Although the enzymes perform differing reactions, the presence of the PLP cofactor
drives the reactivity. This mentored research approach will be translated into independent research on terpene
cyclase enzyme libraries for the enzymatic synthesis of carbocycles via cationic rearrangement and cyclization
reaction development."
10877004,"Project Summary
 Organisms adapt to seasonal changes in environmental conditions to survive. These adaptations rely
predominantly on photoperiod (i.e., daylength), but are also influenced by temperature. Recent studies indicate
that photoperiodic changes affect the neuronal composition of brain areas involved in circadian (i.e., daily)
timekeeping and modulate the number of dopaminergic neurons, in a process known as neurotransmitter
switching. Other studies show that the brain also undergoes profound structural changes across seasons.
However, the relationship between these functional and structural changes in the brain and seasonal adaptations
remains a major gap in knowledge. Moreover, whether other relevant seasonal cues, in particular temperature,
contribute to these changes is not known. The overall goal of this project is to understand the nature and role
of neuronal plasticity in the integration of seasonal cues to promote seasonal adaptations. My hypothesis is
that seasonal adaptations are mediated by functional and structural plasticity in neurons from circadian
and aminergic circuits in response to environmental cues. To test this, I propose 3 specific aims: investigate
structural and functional plasticity of (1) the circadian clock neuronal network and of (2) aminergic circuits in
response to seasonal cues and its impact on social and locomotor behavior, and (3) determine how the plastic
changes in the circadian clock and aminergic circuits regulate brain connectivity and encode the behavioral
output of these circuits. I will accomplish this project in the genetically tractable Drosophila model and will
leverage a combination of versatile neurogenetics, high-resolution microscopy, and well-established behavioral
analysis.
 Thus far in my postdoctoral career in the Chiu lab at UC Davis, I obtained training in molecular genetics
and biochemistry, which I used to explore the role of circadian peptides in modulating seasonal adaptations in
Drosophila. Moving forward, I will build on my current research to study the neuronal mechanisms of seasonal
plasticity and behavior. During the K99 training period, I will use available tools in Drosophila to assess the
functional and structural changes in the circadian clock neurons and aminergic circuits in response to seasonal
cues. Moreover, I will test the functional consequences of these changes by using available genetically encoded
sensors and by generating new, more sensitive, sensors to assess aminergic function in vivo under the guidance
of Dr. Lin Tian. I will expand the use of these tools in the R00 stage to determine how the interaction between
these two circuit systems modulate their functions and how they affect seasonal behavior concertedly. I believe
that the mentorship of Drs. Chiu and Tian, together with the support provided by the K99/R00 award, will allow
me to build a strong foundation that will enable my success as an independent investigator. The results of the
proposed studies will elucidate the neuronal basis underlying sensory integrations in the context of seasonal
adaptations, shedding light on the mechanisms behind seasonal modulation of health physiology and disorders."

one in five birthing people. Despite effective interventions for prevention and treatment, most perinatal
depression and anxiety is unprevented and untreated, especially among marginalized communities. The
proposed research will work with doulas, perinatal people, and clinicians to co-develop and pilot test a multi-
component intervention called “Doula Link for Perinatal Mental Health (Doula Link).” Doula Link builds from a
national model of perinatal psychiatric access programs to create links to the community and direct delivery of
behavioral support. This community-based participatory research will center the experiences and voices of
marginalized communities with the goal of fostering high quality equitable care. In line with NIMH Strategic
Goal 4, the overall goal for the proposed project is to develop and test an innovative service delivery model to
reduce symptoms of perinatal depression and anxiety. This will be accomplished through three research aims:
1) To adapt and define the intervention components through iterative mixed-methods research with doulas,
mental health specialists, and perinatal people who are representative of marginalized communities; 2) To
administer and refine the intervention with doulas who will then offer the psychosocial intervention to their
pregnant clients; 3) Assess the feasibility and accessibility of Doula Link using a pilot cluster-randomized
controlled feasibility trial. This research will be conducted in tandem with advanced training and mentorship for
the candidate. Training will target four specific training goals: 1) intervention development for perinatal mental
health, 2) advanced qualitative methods for community-engaged research, 3) advanced methods for
implementation science, and 4) leadership and professional development to lead multi-site studies. At the end
of the proposed project, the candidate will have developed and piloted a version of Doula Link, which will
include the following products: 1) doula-specific toolkit for Psychiatric Access Programs, 2) training manual for
doulas to implement the psychosocial intervention, 3) fidelity measures, 4) critical data on intervention
feasibility and acceptability, 5) recruitment, retention, and assessment response rates, and 6) estimates of
intra-cluster correlation coefficient and effect size. The goal of this K01-Mentored Research Scientist
Development Award is to prepare the candidate for an independent research career dedicated to developing
and testing acceptable, feasible, scalable, equitable, and effective interventions to improve perinatal mental
health. With the research, training, and mentorship gained during this K01, the candidate will acquire the data
and advanced skills needed to develop an R01 application for a fully-powered trial and be positioned to
become a leader in perinatal mental health implementation science research."
10918216,"North Carolina is distinctly advantaged to be the home for a trio of well-established, premier academic medical
centers that already engage in collaborative and multi-institutional programs supported by world-class
researchers and mentors with internationally recognized expertise in kidney, urologic, and hematologic (KUH)

(HBCUs) in North Carolina that are all constituent institutions in the UNC 16-college system. Working with these
HBCUs enhances our ability to identify and mentor a diverse cohort of trainees and early career investigators
from high school through early faculty. We propose to develop discoverers who are representative of our diverse
KUH disease population through the North Carolina Kidney, Urology, and Hematology Training, Research,
Innovation, and Outreach Program (NC KUH TRIO Program), abbreviated as TRIO. The principal goal of TRIO
is to improve the care and outcomes for patients with KUH diseases, and we are proposing a comprehensive
roadmap that will train and mentor a multidisciplinary workforce, from engineers to entrepreneurs to physicians,
who will achieve this goal. A Training Core and linked Administrative, Networking, and Professional Development
Cores will function in concert to achieve the TRIO Specific Aims and provide a seamless experience for trainees
utilizing a platform that spans our institutions and cores. The Training Core will provide state-of-the-art training
for both pre- and post-doctoral trainees to prepare them for cutting-edge, collaborative, innovative and cross-
disciplinary research in KUH areas of interest. The Administrative Core supports TRIO to foster diverse,
integrated activities and address program goals. Through the Networking Core, TRIO will provide the
infrastructure to attract new talent from the biologic and physical science, retain students entering STEM
programs, and connect a broad and vibrant cohort of trainees. Finally, the Professional Development Core will
offer training that will expose trainees to multidisciplinary research, novel technologies, and professional
development opportunities to expand their scientific and clinical experience and in the end, accelerate KUH
research. With these Cores working in concert, TRIO is poised to grow and thrive in exciting ways as it trains a
diverse cohort of future KUH researchers, who will ultimately change the lives of patients with KUH diseases."

coordinators and the organization of virtual and in-person meeting places. This will allow TRIO to create a holistic
and fertile training substrate for KUH science and for professional and personal life skills that will help our people
become leaders and innovators who will transform KUH science and patient care. We plan to accomplish this by
(a) creating an organizational and governance structure that allows for collaborative leadership and
communication between the participating institutions and the implementing cores; (b) developing a real-world,
evidence-based, and streamlined trainee selection and evaluation system for TRIO; and (c) organizing one of
the annual face-to-face meetings for all awardees of the KUH U2C-TL1, while also working closely with the
Networking Core to facilitate the programming and platforms needed to create, train, and retain a rich and diverse
pipeline of KUH trainees. In summary, the Administrative Core aims to seamlessly facilitate the TRIO program
by optimizing operational efficiency (the cost of doing translational science) and translational efficiency (the
speed of discovery and implementation science). Indeed, if we envision TRIO as a train, with the railcars
representing the different institutions and cores, then the Administrative Core would be the greased couplings
between the railcars allowing the entire train to travel smoothly."

10881930,"Project Abstract
The PGC1a pathway has emerged as the dominant pathway for the modulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and
oxidative metabolism in most tissues. Deficiencies in this pathway have been associated with pathological
conditions such as obesity, diabetes and various neurological and neuromuscular disorders. Studies of the
regulatory mechanisms at work here is thus fundamental to our understanding of energy homeostasis and the
development of drugs to treat these and other disorders. The previous cycle of this grant illustrated that PGC1a
is subject to robust control at the level of translation of its mRNA. In this proposal we interrogate trans-acting
RNA-binding factors that might participate in the regulation of PGC1a translation and identify a little-known RNA-
binding factor, RBM43, that is dramatically regulated in opposition to PGC1a. It is expressed lower in
thermogenic fat than in energy-storing white fat, and it is suppressed by cold temperatures. Importantly,
experimental reduction of RBM43 by siRNA causes an increase in PGC1a translation and oxidative metbolism.
Conversely, increased expression of RBM43 decreases ribosome occupancy of the PGC1a mRNA, consistent
with an action on the transational machinery. Here we propose mechanistic, genetic and biological studies of
RBM43. Mice with a global mutation in Rbm43 have already been made in our lab, and show increased PGC1a
levels and activity in adipose tissues. The physiological effects of this mutation will be determined by challenging
mice with cold exposure and high fat diets. Gene expression in adipose tissues will be determined by RNA-seq,
while weight gain, body composition and glucose tolerance will be determined using standard methods, including
the use of metabolic cages. Fat-selective knockouts will be made using a Cre recombinase driven by the
adiponectin promoter. To understand the mechanism by which RBM43 acts, its direct RNA targets will be
identified by photo-crosslinking and the RBM43 protein domains and RNA sequences responsible for these
interactions will be mapped. The PGC1a pathway also affects cells and tissues distant from the site of PGC1a
expression, potentially through myokine or adipokine secretion. To more thoroughly investigate polypeptides
secreted under the influence of PGC1a, a new method for the isolation of interstitial fluids from muscle and fat
was developed. These fluids provide an excellent substrate for the application of sensitive and quantitative mass
spectrometry. Using this approach, we have identified dozens of potential new myokines and adipokines under
the control of PGC1a. Of particular interest is prosaposin (PSAP), a CNS neurotrophic factor not known to be
secreted by peripheral tissues. Recombinant PSAP has effects on iWAT cells to stimulate thermogenic gene
expression. We will characterize these effects in greater detail using RNA-seq and respirometry; the Psap gene
will also be ablated in an adipose-selective fashion to determine its roles in thermogenesis and adipose
innervation. Together, these studies will give broader insights into the regulation of the PGC1a pathway and
potentially provide “actionable” targets for therapeutic intervention in metabolic diseases and other disorders."

More than 40% of older adults (OAs) report limitations to performing tasks that are essential to maintain
independence. Weakness is an important contributor to physical impairments; indeed, weakness predisposes
OAs to a four-fold increase in physical limitations. Because strength is a vital factor for health and longevity,
more comprehensive understanding of the causes of weakness is needed to develop targeted interventions to
enhance strength and function in OAs. While age-related loss of muscle mass and quality are partly responsible
for weakness, there is increasing evidence that deficits in neural activation are critically linked to age-related
weakness. In particular, we and others have demonstrated that weakness associated with aging and other
conditions (e.g., disuse, injury, sepsis) is due, in part, to neural hypoexcitability. In this application, we seek to
fundamentally advance our understanding of the mechanisms of and treatment strategies for age-related
weakness and mobility limitations through translational human (Aim 1) and pre-clinical rodent (Aim 2)
experiments that, collectively, will provide strong data indicating a causal association between neural
hypoexcitability and age-related weakness. The first aim will test the hypothesis that indices of neural
hypoexcitability are associated with greater future (longitudinal) losses of strength in OAs. Here, we will leverage
data from a prior R01 to conduct a longitudinal study in humans where we quantify indices of neural excitability,
lean mass, strength, and mobility after ~ 8-years in older adults. These data will be used to determine the relative
contribution of indices of neural excitability and thigh lean mass on future decline in muscle strength in older
adults, with a robust design accounting for alternative mechanisms. By using a longitudinal design in humans,
this aim will provide the strongest level of evidence for neural excitability being a key predictor of age-related
strength loss, which is a paradigm shift away from the current consideration of primarily muscular factors (e.g.,
muscle mass). The second aim will consist of four experiments. Experiments 1-3 will use a 5-HT2c agonist
(lorcaserin) with a well-known mechanism of action that increases persistent inward currents and motoneuron
excitability. SA2.1 will test the hypothesis that there is an inverted U-shape relationship between 5-HT2c agonist
dose and motor function response in old mice. SA2.2 will test the hypothesis that a 5-HT2c agonist will enhance
motor function in aged mice by increasing neural excitation to demonstrate that the reduction in MN excitability
is a significant contributor to motor dysfunction in old mice. SA2.3 will test chronic effects of lorcaserin treatment
on motor unit number and function in aged mice. SA2.4 will test the impact of tamoxifen-inducible genetic deletion
of 5-HT2c receptors in MNs using Cre-Lox system. In the long-term, this proof-of-concept, proof-of-mechanism
work could serve as evidence for a neurotherapeutic agent to enhance motor function in older adults."

The interplay between microbial and genetic susceptibility factors is central to the development of
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Innate mechanisms, in particular through pattern recognition receptor
(PRR) pathways, are the initiating drivers of host responses to microbes. Of the >240 loci associated to
IBD, a number of genes modulate host PRR responses at many levels and confer some of the largest
genetic effects observed in autoimmunity. Despite the significant recent discoveries in IBD-associated
genetics, the functional consequences of the majority of the genetic loci have yet to be identified. A central
outcome of PRR activation by microbial products is induction of cytokine and microbial clearance
pathways. Further, IBD is largely characterized by dysregulated cytokines and anti-microbial responses,
and the inter-individual variation in PRR-induced outcomes influences the disease susceptibility. We
hypothesize that polymorphisms in multiple IBD-associated genes contribute to inter-individual variation
in PRR-induced cytokine and microbial clearance pathways, and that we will be able to more clearly
classify individuals in the context of this dichotomy. Systematic, well-powered studies comprehensively
defining the functional alterations driven by disease-associated human variation can provide enormous
insight into central mechanisms of IBD; leveraging naturally occurring human genetic variation to
systematically “perturb” an experimental system represents an advantageous approach for precisely
defining established and novel PRR-mediated mechanisms mediating the balance between cytokine
secretion and microbial clearance. Therefore, we will utilize a large, well-powered cohort to screen for
IBD-associated polymorphisms contributing to the variation in PRR-initiated cytokine secretion and
microbial clearance across individuals and then define the molecular mechanisms wherein the implicated
IBD-associated genes, as well as the identified polymorphisms, regulate PRR-induced outcomes.
Relevance
These combined studies will provide insight into whether those IBD-associated loci that regulate PRR-
induced cytokine secretion and bacterial clearance do so through a loss- or gain-of-function, the
mechanisms wherein the implicated genes mediate their contributions to these PRR-induced outcomes,
and the specific consequences of the polymorphisms on gene function through examination of monocyte-
derived cells from selected carriers. These comprehensive and mechanistic studies will be crucial for
future studies that will examine gene consequences in vivo and ultimately, for improved disease
classification and therapeutic targeting."

The Molecular Phenotypes of Null Alleles in Cells (MorPhiC) program is using multiple perturbation strategies to
realize the NHGRI's vision of assigning function to every human gene. Strategies include pooled and individual
gene knockouts and knockdowns (KDs), generated using CRISPR technologies and auxin-inducible degrons.
Following application of such assays, molecular phenotypes of the cells are profiled longitudinally and at
individual time points using bulk and single-cell (sc)RNA-seq. Perturbation strategies have intrinsic sources of
variability, e.g., KD penetrance, while the single-cell sequencing approaches contribute technical noise, e.g.,
`drop out.' Quantifying and controlling this variability are crucial to ensure reliable phenotypic assessment and
fulfill MorPhiC's goal to accurately catalog gene function. Given the critical role of transcription factors (TFs) in
regulating cell state, all four MorPhiC Data Production Centers (DPCs) will perturb TFs and then profile cells
using bulk or sc-RNA-seq. A wide range of other `regulatory phenotyping' data, including (bulk or single-cell)
ATAC-seq, are being generated within MorPhiC and TF ChIP-seq, HiC, and massively parallel reporter assay
(MPRA) data are available in the ENCODE and Impact of Genomic Variation on Function (IGVF) consortia. To
robustly define the regulatory impact of TF perturbation, we propose a JAX MorPhiC Data Analysis and Validation
Center (DAV) to analyze these multi-modal data. Our team is uniquely positioned to establish this TF-focused
DAV: we are co-located with the JAX MorPhiC DPC and have consortium-level collaborations with its PI, while
our own work focuses on elucidating transcriptional regulation of genes and on developing robust computational
methods through community efforts. In Aim 1, we will quantify and control variability in perturbation-based
regulatory phenotyping by using heterogeneous data generated within MorPhiC to isolate their technical noise
characteristics and to derive a set of TF-gene target pairs (TF-GTs). We will then computationally simulate large-
scale perturbation screens, through which we will perform power analysis to quantify data variability and make
recommendations that ameliorate it. In Aim 2, we will evaluate published gene regulatory network (GRN)
inference methods. We will also conduct two “crowd-sourced” DREAM Challenges, in which community
participants will develop GRN inference methods that we will objectively evaluate with MorPhiC data. Using top-
performing methods, as well as a novel approach we are developing based on dynamical systems, we will
perform in silico TF perturbation within the GRNs to prioritize TFs for experimental validation in MorPhiC. In Aim
3, we will further improve robustness of inferred TF-GTs by integrating them with TF ChIP-seq, HiC, and MPRA
data, knockout mouse phenotyping data (KOMP2), and spatial transcriptomics data from JAX and MorPhiC. We
will validate published methods for defining tissue-specific GRNs by overlapping them with relevant MorPhiC
model systems and will then use them to predict TF-GTs in systems yet to be profiled by MorPhiC. Our Aims will
bolster the field's ability to decipher the regulatory function of the ~ 1600 TF genes within the human genome."

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a common autoimmune rheumatic condition, has no cure and even with novel
treatments, is associated with significant irreversible joint damage, physical disability, and numerous
comorbidities. The appearance of serum anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) indicates RA-related
autoimmunity and defines the start of the preclinical period of RA, which is the ideal time to identify relevant
disease risk biomarkers and approaches for disease prevention. The etiology of RA has a genetic component,
which may interact with environment in the development of disease. RA is characterized by excessive chronic
inflammation, suggesting a failure in the ability to control/resolve inflammation. Mechanisms for both initiating
and resolving inflammation are important for physiological homeostasis. Lipid mediators, products of the
metabolism of omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, are involved in both initiation and resolution
of inflammation. We have shown that an elevated level of an individual omega-6 lipid mediator (5-HETE)
increased risk of progression from RA-related autoimmunity to inflammatory arthritis. However, as lipid
mediators share common pathways and enzymes, we propose that individual lipid mediators do not act in
isolation and therefore should be analyzed in combination as a profile. We propose to conduct a study in three
novel at-risk cohorts: the Targeting Immune Responses for Prevention of Rheumatoid Arthritis (TIP-RA) cohort
of 81 ACPA+ individuals, the Studies of the Etiologies of RA (SERA) cohort of 79 ACPA+ individuals, and the
StopRA cohort of 144 ACPA+ individuals in the preclinical period of RA that have been followed over time for
the development of RA. We will create lipid mediator profiles (a composite score of combinations of highly
correlated lipid mediators) indicating the ability to resolve inflammation by performing principal components
analysis of the lipid mediators and look at the trajectories of these profiles over time. Aim 1 will determine if the
association of these profiles with progression from ACPA+ to RA differs by genetic susceptibility to RA. We will
also explore whether the association is mediated by cytokine profiles or trajectories. Aim 2 will explore the
underlying mechanism by examining whether the lipid mediator profiles are associated with DNA methylation
differences or trajectories. Aim 3 will examine inflammation resolution in the lung by identifying sputum lipid
mediator profiles and cytokines associated with progression from RA-related autoimmunity to RA. Results from
this work will provide the foundation for designing prevention studies by elucidating which combinations of lipid
mediators play a role in inflammation resolution in preclinical RA. The inability to resolve inflammation can lead
to chronic inflammation; a common pathogenic element of RA. Elucidating mechanisms as well as the site (ie
lung) of inflammation resolution during the preclinical period of RA significantly contributes to the
understanding of pathogenesis and development of innovative interventions for RA."
10864024,"Invasive infections due to the “superbug” methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have poor
outcomes that are worsened by reduced susceptibility to first-line agents, vancomycin (glycopeptide; GP), and
daptomycin (lipopeptide; LP). The long-acting lipoglycopeptide (LGP), dalbavancin, is an alternative that can be
given weekly or as a single dose, which can facilitate discharge and reduce costs. However, we have shown that
its long half-life may increase its resistance selection potential and can select for cross-resistance to vancomycin
and daptomycin. Thus, there is a critical need to understand the mechanism(s) of cross-resistance among cell
envelope-targeting drugs in MRSA and to investigate strategies to mitigate or overcome such resistance. Our
work from the previous grant periods found that 75% of GP/LP/LGP non-susceptible isolates from in vitro PK/PD
models simulating dalbavancin exposures acquired mutations related to the essential two-component regulatory
system walKR. Furthermore, we recently published a case in which dalbavancin treatment selected for
GP/LP/LGP-resistant MRSA in a patient with endocarditis, via a walK mutation. These recent findings led to the
goal for this renewal: to elucidate the multiple mechanisms through which walKR mutations lead to GP/LP/LGP
cross-resistance and reveal how beta-lactams and other metabolic modulators interact with WalKR-regulated
metabolic networks to synergize with GP/LP/LGP and prevent resistance. We hypothesize that walKR mutations
underlie GP/LP/LGP cross-resistance phenotypes through modulation of both cell envelope and nucleotide
metabolism, and metabolic modulators can re-sensitize these strains to GP/LP/LGP or prevent resistance by
further altering cell envelope or nucleotide metabolism. In AIM 1, we will measure the contribution of reduced
WalKR function to cross-resistance phenotypes in MRSA using genetic, lipidomic, metabolomic, transcriptomic,
and proteomic approaches in combination with susceptibility testing and quantitative biophysical assessment of
the cell envelope properties. In AIM 2, we will test the hypothesis that beta-lactams and other metabolic
modulators can re-sensitize walK-knockdown strains to GP/LP/LGP. We will examine the synergistic effects of
cell wall inhibitors beta-lactams and fosfomycin, lipid synthesis inhibitors, and anti-folate drugs,
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, which will inform metabolic pathways that are important for walKR mutation-
caused resistance. In AIM 3, we will evaluate the potential of beta-lactams and other metabolic modulators to
prevent the selection of GP/LP/LGP resistance by dalbavancin in vitro using serial passage and PK/PD models.
This work is significant because dalbavancin exposures readily select for vancomycin and daptomycin-resistant
S. aureus and a strategy to prevent resistance and/or re-sensitize MRSA to GP/LG/LGP is critical to preserve
these drugs, especially in the current context of increasing dalbavancin use. The innovation of this proposal
includes leveraging metabolic phenotypes to inform and modulate resistance phenotypes and the application of
high-throughput lipidomics and metabolomics to characterize drug resistance and responses."

While outcomes have substantially improved for many types of cancer, endometrial cancer (EC) incidences
and deaths are on the rise, with the five-year survival rate worse today than three decades ago; owing largely
to the ineffectiveness of current treatments. As a tumor is exquisitely sensitive to the growth promoting effects
of estrogen and the growth limiting effects of progesterone, hormonal therapy for EC using progestins has
been a traditional choice for treatment. It is highly effective in the short term; however, responsiveness wanes
over time due to loss of progesterone receptor (PR) expression, and recurrences are common. There is a
critical need to identify strategies to improve or restore responsiveness to progestin therapy, and we propose
that molecularly enhanced progestin therapy will make a major positive impact on survival of patients with EC.
The objective of this application is to identify the molecular mechanisms driving the downregulation of the PR
in EC patients and identify novel strategies to further enhance the effectiveness of progestin therapy. We will
develop molecular agent combinations with progestins that will significantly enhance tumor cell differentiation
in vitro and improve survival in mouse xenograft models of human EC. Our central hypothesis is that targeting
PR repressors will enhance the expression of PR, the most important tumor suppressor in the endometrium,
thereby improving response to progestin therapy. This hypothesis stems from our strong recently published
data in EC cells that PR expression is downregulated through distinct molecular mechanisms, and epigenetic
modulators potently increase PR expression and tumor suppressor activity. We have now identified additional
PR suppressors that have the potential to more clearly define the multiple mechanisms of PR inhibition in EC,
setting the stage for new therapeutic opportunities. In Aim 1, we will determine the impact of epigenetic
modulators on PR expression and activity in EC patients from the clinical trial NRG-GY011 results. In the
extended period we will evaluate the potential new endpoint markers. In Aim 2, we will enhance PR expression
using small molecular drugs and test drug efficacy using in vitro and in vivo EC models. In the extended period,
we will identify and validate novel drug and target sites for PR regulation such as Topoisomerase II inhibitor. In
Aim 3, we will identify novel PR downregulation mechanisms using genome-wide gene silencing. In the
extended period, we will focus on novel PR repressor PHB2 and SETDB1. At the completion of these studies,
we will have better understanding of mechanisms of hormonal resistance and integrate innovative molecular
therapies into enhanced progestin therapeutic regimens in preclinical and clinical studies, and as well as
design future EC clinical trials. Therefore, these studies will have a strong impact on the treatment of EC."

The phase 1 of the Molecular Phenotypes of Null Alleles in Cells (MorPhiC) consortium will produce a catalog of
molecular and cellular phenotypes for null alleles of ~1000 human genes using in vitro cellular systems. These
rich resources will allow us to study the gene functions in several multicellular systems that often model early
human development. The impact of a gene knockout on complex human phenotypes can be highly dependent
on the corresponding cell type, cell stage, and tissue microenvironment. Therefore, to generalize the insights
from MorPhiC studies to in vivo settings, we need to harmonize MorPhiC resources and the molecular/cellular
phenotypes of appropriate cell types or tissues, by a flexible and robust computational framework. We aim to
achieve this goal by two complementary approaches. First, we will develop a dynamic gene regulatory network
named moDAG: multi-omic Directed Acyclic Graph. MoDAG combines multi-omic data from MorPhiC and other
studies and the state-of-the-art statistical methods to estimate a gene-regulatory network. MoDAG models cell
types characterized by genome-wide epigenetic or gene expression data. It also accounts for signals from tissue
microenvironment by modeling a set of signaling proteins. MoDAG can be used to predict the effect of gene
knock out in the in vitro cellular systems, and thus help prioritize the genes to be targeted in future MorPhiC
studies. Second, we propose a biologically informed deep learning method named as SDAN: Supervised Deep
learning with gene Annotation. SDAN combines molecular phenotype of gene knockout with gene annotation to
identify gene sets associated with gene knock out. Gene sets provide more robust characterization of gene
knockout than individual genes and thus are more generalizable to different cell types or tissues. The gene
annotation used by SDAN is gene-gene interaction network that can be modified according to relevant cell types
or tissues. Finally, we apply these two methods to predict the phenotypic outcomes of gene knockouts and
assess the association between gene knockouts and human phenotypes. Our computational framework bridges
MorPhiC’s resource with accumulating omic data in various human cell types and tissues and provide effective
solutions to generate new insights or hypothesis for future studies."

Flavor is associated with food selection and preference behaviors in humans. Flavor is contributed by taste,
olfaction, and somatosensory sensations such as food temperature. During food sampling, cooling sensations
frequently accompany taste experiences in the mouth due to the high resting temperature of intraoral skin. Yet
compared to taste biology, there are wide, significant gaps in our understanding of how temperature sensing
impacts ingestive preferences and behavior. A goal of the proposed studies is to begin to define how thermal
sensations and receptor mechanisms participate in orosensory-guided preference and ingestive responses in
mice. This is a mostly unexplored area of study critical to flavor neurobiology. For behavioral tests, we have
engineered an adapter that independently varies the temperatures of fluids inside multiple sipper tubes
presented individually to mice by a lickometer. When coupled with this adapter, the lickometer can perform
brief-access fluid licking tests that gauge how oral temperature sensations influence sensory/tongue control of
mouse licking behavior. Using our thermo-lickometer, Aim 1 will study how thermal sensations mediated by the
transient receptor potential (TRP) melastatin 8 (TRPM8) cold receptor found on trigeminal fibers contribute to
orobehavioral responses to cooling temperatures. To do this, we will evaluate if mice gene-deficient for TRPM8
show impaired innate and conditioned licking responses to chilled water compared to wild-type. Studies will
ask if TRPM8 input is necessary for mice to behaviorally separate oral cooling sensations from warm
temperatures that our pilot data show are avoided when sensed in the mouth. Aim 2 will study how oral thermal
sensing by TRPM8 impacts taste preferences. We will gauge if cooling temperatures that excite TRPM8
complement and counter preference and avoidance of sweet and bitter taste stimuli by comparing brief-access
licking to temperature-controlled tastes between control and TRPM8 deficient mice. Aim 3 will measure brief-
access licking of temperature-controlled fluids in mice with silenced trigeminal thermosensory afferents or
ablation of taste bud cells that express temperature-sensitive receptors. Oral temperature can also excite taste
neurons (thermogustation) albeit the function of this has been unknown. Thermosensory afferent mechanisms
will be evaluated using mice deficient for TRP vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)-lineage afferents, broadly mediating
thermosensation, and mice with conditionally silenced TRPV1-positive trigeminal ganglion neurons, which
convey orofacial thermal and nociceptive signals. Thermogustatory mechanisms will be probed using mice
deficient for a protein that regulates the development of taste bud cells with temperature-sensitive molecular
effectors. Altogether, these studies will provide an initial account of how thermosensory and thermogustatory
processes influence ingestive behaviors. Ultimately, defining the role of oral temperature sensing in intake
behavior will be critical for understanding causal relationships between flavor and ingestive conditions."

 The co-use of nicotine/tobacco products and cannabis among young adults is prevalent and varies widely in
terms of patterns and products of use. Nicotine-cannabis co-use among this age group may adversely affect
treatment and other clinical outcomes, yet little is known regarding the underlying relationship between nicotine
and cannabis and the resulting treatment implications, particularly during an attempt to quit or reduce use of one
or both substances. Prior literature on the treatment implications of co-use, including results from our group,
suggest that cannabis serves as an obstacle to nicotine cessation for a sub-set who use both products, though
the literature is mixed. Past studies also suffer from important limitations, resulting in critical gaps in our
understanding, with only 2 secondary analyses published from youth tobacco trials on the impact of co-use. To
date, there are no prospective studies that have examined the treatment implications of nicotine-cannabis co-
use or the underlying relationship between substances among young adults when engaged in a quit attempt.
[[[Therefore, the overall goal of this project is to characterize and evaluate the underlying relationship between
nicotine/tobacco and cannabis and its impact on nicotine cessation through a behavioral economics framework.
This study will determine how impactful cannabis co-use may be on nicotine cessation and which individuals
who co-use experience greater difficulty achieving cessation. To accomplish this goal, we propose a completely
remote, prospective, 12-week nicotine cessation trial among young adults (ages 18-25; N=350) from across the
United States who use nicotine (vaping, cigarettes or both) and cannabis products regularly. We will leverage
our ongoing collaboration with DynamiCare Health to administer remote contingency management (CM) as the
nicotine/tobacco treatment intervention, while cannabis use will not be addressed. Biochemical verification
(through oral fluid samples) and self-reports (mobile daily diaries) of substance use will be collected. The aims
of this proposed study are to: 1) evaluate the impact of behavioral economically derived measures of substance
substitutability on end of treatment nicotine abstinence (Aim 1); 2) determine if treatment-induced nicotine
abstinence, reduction, and/or withdrawal (a) is associated with co-occurring changes in cannabis demand and
use and (b) if substance substitutability modifies this relationship (Aim 2); and 3) assess the reciprocal
prospective relationship between patterns of nicotine and cannabis use during nicotine treatment (Aim 3).
Evaluating nicotine-cannabis co-use as part of a prospective treatment study through a behavioral economics
framework has never been conducted and will be important to informing the literature regarding individual co-
use pattern differences, compensatory cannabis use, and treatment success.]]] Nicotine cessation treatment in
young adults is a growing body of work and the role of cannabis co-use, and results from the proposed study,
will inform clinical care and guide tailored treatment recommendations to promote successful and sustained
abstinence."

Cervical cancer is among the most common cancer diagnoses among women, and treatment failure of standard
of care chemoradiation therapy (CRT) for locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) is as high as 30-50%. Since
recurrent and metastatic diseases are not curable, there is a pressing need to identify patients at risk of treatment
failure as early as possible to allow for personalized treatment, rather than after a failure and progression. While
TCGA’s molecular stratification of cervical cancer using genomic data failed to associate to patient outcomes,
we recently published on integrating genomic and imaging data to improve LACC risk stratification after CRT.
Therefore, in this study we intend to use multi-omics data to define and validate LACC risk groups and identify
group-specific treatment targets. Based on our preliminary data that indicate distinct biological mechanisms drive
CRT resistance in patients with different levels of lymph node (LN) involvement at presentation, we will stratify
patients by LN status to develop and validate novel radiogenomic biomarkers. Prognostic models will be
developed using gene expression data from pre-treatment tumor biopsy and radiomic features from pre-
treatment PET imaging data. Upstream driver and/or feature genes will be validated at the RNA and protein
levels by qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and tissue microarray (TMA). One such gene identified from our
preliminary data using a radiogenomic approach is nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (NRF2), which has
not been previously characterized in LACC, since it is not frequently mutated in cervical cancer. We will perform
functional analysis to study NRF2 biology in LACC via clonogenic survival assay and other standard assays. In
addition to pre-treatment biomarkers, we will leverage radiomic features from our time course MR images and
on-treatment gene expression data to develop novel radiogenomic biomarkers to assess a patient's evolving risk
of treatment failure over the course of CRT, informing adjustment of therapy at mid-treatment. The pre-treatment
model will be further refined by applying deep learning to identify predictive features for CRT outcome directly
from clinical PET images to inform intensified treatment from the beginning. Finally, we will apply multi-omics
approaches (scRNA-seq, proteomics, metabolomics) to characterize the biology related to LACC CRT
radiogenomic biomarkers. Taken together, we expect fulfillment of these aims will create a series of optimized,
validated recurrence biomarkers at presentation and over the course of 6 weeks of CRT treatment, and will
indicate targets for personalized alternative treatment regimens. Beyond the specific application to LACC, our
proposal will generate novel methods to integrate multi-omics data to improve hypothesis-driven cancer research."

Transcription factors act as specifying agents of cell differentiation during development by binding to DNA
enhancer sequences and activating them to control developmental gene expression. Enhancer activation is
typically associated with the removal of nucleosomes, which decorate eukaryotic genomes and normally wrap
roughly 150 base pairs of DNA in a highly stable configuration. A persistent puzzle of developmental gene
regulation is how TFs bind and activate their target enhancers when they are initially wrapped in nucleosomes,
which typically inhibit TF binding. One hypothesis posits that a special class of “pioneer factors” are able to bind
their targets in the context of nucleosomal wrapping and displace the nucleosomes they bind to activate and
expose the enhancer for downstream TF binding. However, it has been exceedingly difficult to confirm the
presence of nucleosome binding “pioneer activity” in vivo, leaving the developmental roles of pioneer factors in
question. We recently used high-resolution epigenome profiling to identify instances of nucleosome binding by
pioneer factors that were enriched at enhancers with suboptimal motif binding sequences, presenting the
intriguing possibility that pioneer activity is a mechanism to ensure the fidelity of enhancer activation at sites that
are vulnerable to natural fluctuations in the local chromatin environment. Pioneer factors often function in early
development, which maintains high fidelity despite natural variation in chromatin structure that is sensitive to the
metabolic state of the cell. Therefore, pioneer factors may play a direct role in insulating developmental
transitions against metabolic variance. However, the potential roles of pioneer factors in developmental fidelity
and buffering against metabolic heterogeneity have not been uncovered to date. In this proposal, I will use a
controlled pioneer factor expression system to study how pioneer factor-driven developmental changes are
buffered against deliberate chromatin and metabolic perturbations. In Aim 1, I will test the hypothesis that pioneer
activity facilitates developmental fidelity by observing development after genetically enforcing chromatin barriers
to pioneer factor binding and inactivating the nucleosome binding pioneer activity of a specific pioneer factor. In
Aim 2, I will use a model system of metabolic control of development to understand how pioneer factor binding
responds to metabolic changes, and how specific pioneer factor-enhancer activation events underlie different
developmental outcomes in response. These Aims will uncover mechanistic explanations for the disparity
between variance in gene regulatory processes on the molecular level and the precision of cell fate outcomes
on the developmental level, and my findings will be of direct consequence to diseases such as cancer where
extreme heterogeneity overwhelms the checks and balances on cell fate. A K99/R00 Award will be instrumental
in addressing these questions and furnishing me with high level training in new methods and biological theory
that will prepare me to continue to pursue major research avenues related to pioneer factor and chromatin control
of development in my future independent career."
10844573,"Project Summary: New approaches, such as the emergence of immune checkpoint blockade over the past
decade, hold great promise for patients with metastatic cancer. Indeed, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has enjoyed
remarkable clinical success for immunogenically “hot” tumors such as subsets of melanoma and non-small cell
lung cancer patients; however, for patients with immunologically “cold” tumors, such as most advanced
colorectal cancers, patient response rates can be as low as 5%. With the advent of whole genome sequencing
and sophisticated bioinformatics techniques, patient-specific neoantigens in tumors can now be identified and
provide the basis for many therapeutic vaccines in preclinical and clinical development. Neoantigen-based
cancer vaccines can be tailored to individual patients by identifying their unique neoantigens.
 We have pioneered the development of nanoscale coordination polymers (NCPs), which are a class of
hybrid nanoparticles formed by the self-assembly of metal ions and polydentate bridging ligands. NCPs
preferentially accumulate in tumor tissues by taking advantage of the enhanced permeability and retention
effect and possess several advantages over existing nanocarriers. The long-term goal of our collaborative
research is to establish a new treatment paradigm for metastatic colorectal cancer, through the development
and characterization of effective NCPs that can be delivered systemically.
The overall goal of the proposed studies is to develop robust NCPs, namely, ZnCDN, for the systemic
delivery of a neoantigen and hydrophilic cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) STING agonists, including CDA, ADU-S100,
and MK-1454, to potentiate the antitumor immune effect of anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy for the effective
treatment of mCRC. Increased understanding of the mechanisms involved in this combination therapy will
provide critical insights to enhance the response rates and durability of immunotherapies for mCRC.
 We have designed ZnCDN NCP with a core of CDA and Zn2+ ions and a hydrophilic shell of PEG2000 to
resist plasma protein absorption and clearance by the monocytic phagocytic system. As a result, ZnCDN can
be administered to mice via intravenous injection to significantly accumulate in the TME. We will study three
ZnCDN formulations with CDA, ADU-S100, and MK-1454 to obtain the best ZnCDN and evaluate its effects on
tumor vasculature and intratumoal retention. We will evaluate immune activation in mouse models of mCRC,
and elucidate the mechanisms of ZnCDN-mediated STING activation in the tumor microenvironment. In order
to evaluate the delivery of tumor-specific antigens, we will incorporate tumor antigen peptides into NCPs to
facilitate cross-priming of CD8+ T cells and enhance antitumor efficacy. Finally, we will elucidate the
mechanism of STING activation with ZnCDN-antigen to overcome resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade.
 Our labs have been working together on this project in the Ludwig Center for Metastasis Research for most
of the past decade. This interdisciplinary endeavor could lead to a transformation in the treatment of mCRC."

Title: Hepatic Rap1a in cholesterol homeostasis
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and lowering of proatherogenic
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C) levels is the primary target of therapy. Recent work has
identified proprotein convertase subtilisin/ kexin type 9 (PCSK9) as a promising therapeutic target that regulates
serum LDL-C. Despite its critical role as a regulator of the LDL receptor (LDLR) and attractiveness as a
pharmacological target, the mechanism(s) by which PCSK9 is regulated remain largely unknown. Interestingly,
the most widely prescribed drugs for lowering plasma cholesterol, statins, dose-dependently increase PCSK9
levels, which largely negate further statin-induced increases in hepatic LDLR and attenuate their efficacy.
However, our understanding of the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of this regulation remains
incomplete. This proposal is based on a new finding from our laboratory suggesting that activation of the small
G protein of the Ras superfamily, Rap1a, lowers PCSK9 and plasma LDL-C levels. Further, Rap1a
geranylgeranyl prenylation and activity is inhibited in statin-treated hepatocytes and human liver, and restoring
intracellular geranylgeranyl isoprenoid levels prevents statin-induced PCSK9 and further lowers LDL-C. We
propose that hepatic Rap1a is a novel regulator of PCSK9 protein, and its inhibition via lower intracellular
isoprenoid levels may provide an additional mechanism to explain how statins increase PCSK9. Based on these,
we will define the mechanisms by which Rap1a regulates PCSK9 and LDL-C metabolism (Aim 1), elucidate it’s
in role statin-mediated PCSK9 induction (Aim 2), and explore the effect of combined statin and Rap1a activation
in the prevention of atherosclerotic lesion development. (Aim 3). We will test these new ideas in vivo and ex vivo,
using a combination of mouse genetic, physiological, and biochemical approaches."

Fertility depends on successful fertilization and early development, processes that occur in the oviduct. Common therapies
for human infertility, such as in vitro fertilization and intracytoplasmic sperm injection, are expensive and increase the
risks of a variety of problems. More knowledge of how the oviduct interacts with sperm, the cumulus-oocyte complex
(COC), and the developing embryo may improve fertility and reduce the need for therapies or lead to the development of
improved therapies (i.e. improvements in IVF). The oviduct serves as a reservoir for sperm, after semen deposition and
before fertilization. Binding to the oviduct maintains sperm viability and suppresses motility. Sperm are released to move
to the upper oviduct (ampulla) to fertilize oocytes. There are many gaps in this model of sperm-oviduct interaction but our
studies have begun to fill some of these gaps. We have used a glycomic approach to screen hundreds of glycans and found
that glycans with affinity for porcine sperm have either of two motifs, sulfated Lewis X trisaccharide or branched 6-
sialylated complex glycans. We also identified two candidate receptors for both glycans on the sperm membrane,
PKDREJ and ADAM5, that were not known to bind glycans. Notably, mouse sperm deficient in PKDREJ and other
ADAMs do not accumulate beyond the utero-tubal junction, but it is not known if this is due to a problem in
binding and retention in the oviduct. Remarkably, if these glycans are immobilized on beads or microscope slides, they
can extend sperm lifespan, much like binding to oviduct cells prolongs the lifespan of sperm. Finally, we found that COCs
secrete progesterone that signals sperm release from the lower oviduct by inducing hyperactivation so sperm can move
toward the site of fertilization. The Specific Aims of this renewal will provide a mechanistic understanding of how sperm
bind the oviduct, how binding prolongs sperm lifespan, and how these results may be translated to improve IVF. Aim 1:
To determine the function of PKDREJ and ADAM5 in sperm by blocking each protein and mutating each gene in
swine. Sperm from pigs that have mutations in these genes have been produced. Sperm that are deficient in each of these
proteins will be examined to determine if their ability to bind oviduct cells and their fertility are affected. Aim 2. To
determine if sperm binding to glycans diminishes oxidative phosphorylation and the citric acid cycle to lengthen
sperm lifespan. Sperm bound to immobilized glycans will be examined to ascertain the specific metabolic changes that
are induced and the intracellular signaling that leads to these changes. Aim 3. To determine if oviduct glycans select
superior sperm for storage and in vitro fertilization. We will examine whether sperm selected by glycan adhesion have
improved characteristics themselves and also produce embryos that more closely resemble in vivo-produced embryos by
comprehensive analysis of embryo transcriptomes and methylomes. The completion of these Specific Aims will provide
important keys to resolving how sperm bind to the oviduct, are stored in the oviduct, and are released in response to the
COC. This fundamental information could be used to develop simpler, safer, and less costly assisted reproductive
technologies."

Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a highly heritable and complex neurodevelopmental disorder. Remarkable advances
have been made recently in SCZ genetic studies with an increasing number of risk loci reaching genome-wide
significance; however, gleaning biological insight from these loci has been challenging. The majority of SCZ risk
loci are located in non-coding regions. As such, it is hypothesized that they function by regulating distal gene
expression via 3D chromatin interactions. However, it has yet to be determined which loci are operational in
which cells, at what time points, and with what impact. Recent genomic analyses showed enriched SCZ
heritability in human fetal brains rather than adult brains, suggesting the role of SCZ risk loci in modulating fetal
development for increased SCZ risks. Thus, unraveling SCZ risk loci function during development will be critical
for understanding genetic influences on SCZ risks. Genetic influences on gene expression (e.g. expression
quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)) are cell-type-specific, and sometimes confer opposing effects depending on the
cell type, underscoring the importance of cell-type-specific studies using homogeneous cell populations for a
clear mechanistic understanding. Parvalbumin (PV)- or somatostatin (SST)-expressing medial ganglionic
eminence (MGE)-derived cortical interneurons (cINs) are consistently affected in SCZ brains. More importantly,
SCZ heritability is shown to be enriched in MGE cells in human fetal brains, necessitating the study of these
cells to understand the mechanisms of SCZ risk loci. Although there are no postmortem fetal SCZ tissues for
mechanistic study, in vitro differentiation of iPSC—which well recapitulates early embryonic development—
provides developmental SCZ brain cells with the same genetic makeup as patient brains. We established
methods for the efficient generation of homogeneous populations of MGE-derived cINs from healthy control
(HC) and SCZ iPSCs. We also extensively validated their functionality and authenticity both in vitro and in vivo,
including robust migration and synaptic integration into host brains that results in efficient inhibitory regulation of
host circuitry in transplanted mice. Using an unprecedentedly large number of iPSCs to provide homogeneous
populations of HC vs SCZ fetal cINs for mechanistic studies, we will address our hypothesis that SCZ risk loci
active in developmental MGE-type cINs regulate distal gene expression via 3D chromatin interactions.
Employing transcriptome analysis, PrediXcan analysis, and Micro-C analysis, we will map SCZ risk loci with
unknown functions to the risk genes they regulate in these vulnerable cell populations during development.
Developmental cIN-specific genetic influences on gene expression, identified based on multiple lines of
corroborating evidence, will be functionally validated using CRISPRi/CRISPRa approaches. This unbiased
genome-wide comprehensive data set from developmental MGE-type cINs with functional validation will provide
a road map for unravelling the genetic basis of developmental SCZ risks and help us identify mechanism-based
novel therapeutic targets."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative illness that destroys cognitive abilities causing memory
impairment, difficulties with speech and language, behavioral changes, functional decline, and significant
impairment. AD affects an estimated 13.8 million people in the United States and 50 million worldwide, imposing
a significant economic burden and global health crisis. While many researchers are working towards developing
a cure for the disease, there is currently no objective, point-of-care diagnostic test for the early diagnosis of AD,
significantly limiting screening efforts for clinical studies and delaying treatment for patients suffering from early
AD pathology. The current standard methods for AD diagnosis involve expensive PET imaging methods that
irradiate the patient and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker tests, which are invasive and require a lumbar puncture.
Recently, exosomes (30-150 nm extracellular vesicles) have been identified as a possible tool for AD diagnosis,
attributed to their ubiquitous presence in biofluids, their ability to pass through the blood-brain-barrier, and their
rich library of AD-relevant physiological information present in the molecular cargo they carry, making them prime
candidates for use as biomarkers. However, the clinical application of exosomes is hindered by slow, inefficient
techniques for exosome isolation and the absence of standardized exosomal biomarker detection and analysis.
Thus, an automated, highly sensitive, fast, and efficient system that can isolate exosomes from biofluids and
analyze the miRNAs and proteins they contain will significantly improve early-stage AD diagnosis efforts. In this
R01 project, we will develop an Automated High-purity Exosome isolation-based AD diagnostics system
(AHEADx) to address the limitations of current technologies. The proposed AHEADx platform includes two units:
(1) a rapid (<1 min), high-yield (>90%), and high-purity (>90%) acoustic Bessel beam-based separation unit to
isolate and enrich exosomes from whole blood, and (2) a rapid (<6 mins), highly sensitive photonic PCR and
immuno-PCR (~1 copy/µL for nucleic acids and ~5 copies/µL for proteins, respectively) utilizing a plasmonic
nanopillar array to enable on-chip thermocycling and multiplexed exosomal screening of combined panels of
AD-relevant biomarkers. Our rapid and precise AHEADx platform will provide a simple, minimally invasive liquid
biopsy to detect molecular AD biomarkers with ultrahigh accuracy and sensitivity in early-stage AD patients,
allowing for an effective diagnostic method of AD screening for earlier treatment before the onset of severe
symptoms of the disease and enable long-term studies on AD development and progression. Additionally, the
proposed technology will accelerate the discovery of new exosomal miRNA and protein AD biomarkers and help
to elucidate the mechanisms in which exosome trafficking and transport contribute to AD pathology. With these
advantages, our AHEADx platform can potentially exceed current clinical standards in AD diagnostics,
addressing a significant need in the field and providing a compelling platform for earlier, accurate, and sensitive
detection of AD and long-term studies on the effects of novel AD therapeutics."

Tumor metastasis remains responsible for >65% of cancer-associated mortality and nearly all
breast cancer deaths. Given the difficulties in treating metastatic disease, preventive approaches
that block the successful dissemination of tumor cells to distant organs like the lung offer an
attractive and under-researched therapeutic strategy for breast cancer patients at risk of
metastatic disease. Primary tumors increase metastatic efficiency by reprogramming the
microenvironment of distant organs before the arrival of circulating tumor cells. These tumor-
permissive sites are commonly referred to as the “pre-metastatic niche” (PMN) and undergo a
series of cellular and structural adaptations that support arriving tumor cells, including the
recruitment of inflammation-promoting and immunosuppressive cells, neoangiogenesis, and
stromal remodeling. Despite their archetypal roles in hemostasis, blood platelets are integral to
inflammatory lung diseases and regulate many of the hallmarks adopted by the PMN. I, therefore,
hypothesize that platelets promote the lung PMN. My preliminary data support this statement,
demonstrating that platelets are sequestered in pre-metastatic lungs and that lowering platelet
counts reduces immune cell recruitment to the lung PMN. To expand on these initial findings, this
research will determine the contributions of platelets to the lung PMN (Aim 1), elucidate
mechanisms by which platelets impact the lung pre-metastatic environment (Aim 2), and test if
therapeutically targeting pre-metastatic platelet number or function impairs metastasis (Aim 3).
The technical skills and scientific expertise I will obtain throughout the K99 award period will prove
instrumental in my transition into an independent researcher, with the long-term goal to develop
novel preventative and adjuvant therapeutic strategies for patients at risk of metastatic breast
cancer. To reach these long-term goals, I have outlined a detailed career development plan, which
will provide me with the technical and leadership skills to establish a successful research
laboratory. The K99 phase of research will be conducted under the excellent (co)mentorship of
Drs. Elisabeth Battinelli and Sandra McAllister at the Hematology Division of Brigham and
Women’s Hospital. My Research Advisory Committee and collaborators are leading experts in
the breast cancer PMN (Dr. Moses), platelet production (Dr. Italiano), and targeting platelets for
breast cancer therapy (Dr. Chen). This K99/R00 award will provide me unparalleled support for
my successful transition to an independent investigator studying platelet and cancer biology."

Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) has evolved the property to integrate into its host genome exploiting a unique
mechanism shared by organisms in all domains of life to process single stranded DNA during DNA replication,
bacterial conjugation and special cases of transposition. The large AAV Rep proteins Rep68/Rep78 are the
key players that carry out this process using two multifunctional domains that include an origin binding domain
(OBD) that binds DNA specifically and belongs to the family of HUH endonucleases; and a SF3 helicase
domain. Integration is contingent on the binding of Rep68/Rep78 to the integration site AAVS1, promote its
melting and perform a strand-specific transesterification reaction in the single-stranded region that has been
extruded during the melting step. Little is known about the molecular details of this process and our long-term
goal is to determine the molecular mechanism of site-specific integration mediated by AAV Rep proteins. In
this proposal we will focus on uncovering the mechanisms of Rep mediated DNA melting, nicking and
packaging using a combination of structural biology methods that include X-ray crystallography, and single-
particle reconstruction Cryo-EM coupled to biochemical, biophysical and in vivo assays."
10904963,"Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) are devastating diseases to those diagnosed and
come with a high cost to society. Reliable early identification and improved intervention is vital to treat patients
before neuronal loss is irreversible. Autophagy is strongly implicated in the progression of AD, and thus has
been an attractive therapeutic target for many years, but to reach a successful autophagy-targeting drug
requires better understanding of the molecular consequences of disrupted autophagy. I propose to investigate
how disrupted autophagy contributes to the chronic inflammation and plaque formation associated with the
progression of AD. Using two of the most common AD risk variants as models to disrupt specific aspects of
autophagy, I will investigate how the misregulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and amyloid precursor
protein (APP), autophagy cargos I identified in my postdoc, contribute to neuroinflammation, synapse loss, and
plaque deposition observed in AD. AD initiation and progression involves multiple cell types, therefore I will use
innovative iPSC models and cutting-edge techniques to model and manipulate complex interactions between
neurons and microglia in a simplified system. In the K99 phase of this award, I will confirm that the ApoE4 AD
risk variant disrupts mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum contacts, which I predict will impair the clearance of
mtDNA. I expect accumulation of mtDNA will sensitize neurons to release inflammatory factors, resulting in
sustained microglia activation, release of complement and synapse loss. In the R00 phase, I will apply similar
approaches mastered in the K99 phase to investigate the contribution of autophagy to plaque deposition. First,
based off preliminary data, I will determine whether APP is an autophagy cargo in neurons or microglia, and
whether it is normally transferred between the cell types. Second, as dysregulated Tau is a major disruptor of
microtubules and organelle trafficking, I will investigate the sensitivity of TauR317W neurons to disruptions to
autophagosome trafficking. I have found in my postdoctoral work that impaired autophagosome trafficking
decreases degradation and increases secretion of autophagy cargo, thus I expect TauR317W sensitizes neurons
to increase secretion and transfer of APP to microglia. I will then investigate the role of microglial autophagy to
prevent plaque formation, and how this may be perturbed by the accumulation of Tau aggregrates and
neurofibrillary tangles in TauR317W microglia. Completion of the independent aims will highlight the multifaceted
role of autophagy in disease progression, identify specific molecular consequences of disrupted autophagy,
and ultimately help to identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD/ADRD."

In the 21st century it has become clear that many of the major problems facing humanity will need to be addressed
by biologists carrying out biomedical research. In order for the US biomedical research community to succeed in
combating the major challenges facing our world, scientists will have to operate with high efficiency and develop
solutions to many different unique problems. A broad number of studies have now concluded that teams and
organizations that are diverse and inclusive are more successful at these endeavors. Moreover, if public funding is to
be used to support biomedical research, in order for it to be equitable, it should allow access to students from all
backgrounds and represent the diversity in the US population. Success as a scientist requires more than just skill at
a lab bench and there are special barriers facing students from underrepresented groups. Therefore, our
comprehensive approach will implement (1) enhanced educational and research outreach to minority-serving
institutions, (2) recruitment activities to help students transition to our university, (3) advanced start activities to
help students transition readily to the next stage in their training, (4) coursework and activities that are relevant
to their underserved communities and themselves, (5) faculty- AND peer-mentoring support, coupled with
culturally-aware mentor training, (6) UCI research and collaboration visit opportunities for their prior
undergraduate mentors who likely inspired them to enter graduate school, (7) funding to support an annual
”reconnection” visit to their alumni institution and community, (8) funding for them to attend conferences, such
as SACNAS, ABRCMS and SfN, and (9) training in oral and written communication and leadership skills. Taken
together, these opportunities will prepare students for careers inside and outside academia and will advance the NIH
goals of enhancing biomedical research in the context of health and human services as a whole."

Cigarette smoke (CS) is a complex mixture of toxins (e.g., nicotine, carbon monoxide) that
affects multiple tissues of the eye including the cornea, the outermost tissue of the eye. The
cornea is at high risk due to its proximity to the burning end of the cigarette and flying ash.
Corneal endothelium (CE) is the innermost layer of the cornea responsible for corneal hydration.
CS results in progressive corneal endothelial cell (CEC) loss leading to corneal edema and
vision loss if remains untreated. The severity of CS-induced corneal edema is further
compounded with preexisting morbidities such as corneal endothelial dystrophies and diabetes.
Our preliminary studies of proteome profiling have demonstrated that CS triggers CEC loss and
disruption of critical structural proteins in Descemet’s membrane (DM). We further identified
elevated levels of oxidative stress-associated indicators and decreased levels of CE-associated
markers in response to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) treatment in human induced pluripotent
stem cell (iPSC)-derived CEC monolayer cultures. In parallel, we have shown that human
embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived CECs can form a functional CE on denuded DM (DM
without CE) in rabbits and monkeys. Moreover, we have also shown that injected hESC-derived
CECs can form a functional CE on denuded stroma (stroma without CE and DM).
In this application, we will build on these datasets through large-scale screening of cellular
pathway modulators to establish a non-invasive topical eye drop approach. In parallel, we will
demonstrate the efficacy of the iPSC-derived CECs injection technique as a minimally invasive,
donor tissue-independent, treatment modality. Taken together, the combined knowledge gained
from identifying modulators and cell therapy will make a paradigm by offering an unlimited
source for the treatment of oxidative stress-induced CE disorders."

 Military suicide rates increased 61% from 2008 – 2019 and rates have increased faster in the U.S. Air
Force (USAF) compared to other branches. Currently, the predominant military suicide prevention approach is
to try to remediate suicide risk after suicidal individuals are identified. No RCT-validated universal programs
shown to reduce vulnerability to suicide are in wide use. To fill this gap, the Wingman-Connect Program is a
group-based intervention that strengthens protective relationship networks and skills for managing career and
personal challenges, to reduce vulnerability to suicide across the broad USAF population. This proposed
Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation trial tests the effectiveness of the Wingman-Connect Program on
individual suicide risk and on base-level suicide attempts. We will examine theory-driven mediators and
moderators and implementation of the program as delivered by US Air Force (not research) personnel under
real world conditions across 2 sequential early career phases. This effectiveness study is the critical next stage
in the translational pipeline toward large-scale roll-out to prevent suicide deaths. To rigorously test
effectiveness, we co-developed with USAF partners a 2-stage randomized design. (1) The first stage of
randomization will be at Initial Technical Training, in which 396 classes of USAF personnel will be
randomized to Wingman-Connect or to an active control (N=2,970 Airmen) and followed for one year. These
classes send a high proportion of graduates to 8 operational bases. (2) The second stage of randomization will
occur among these 8 operational bases, which will be randomized in pairs to start implementing WC at 4-
month intervals (stepped wedge design). Once WC has been initiated at each base, all entering first-term
Airmen will receive WC, with ~17,400 total Airmen trained across all bases. This 2-stage design will yield
robust, multi-level effectiveness findings.
Aim 1: Test effectiveness of WC on reducing (a) self-reported suicide risk and (b) base-level
rates of suicide attempts. We will evaluate (a) individual level outcomes of suicide risk, depression, and
occupational problems up to 1 yr; and (b) base-level administrative records of suicide attempts.
Aim 2: Evaluate theory-proposed network health mediators and moderators. WC is expected to
increase Airmen's positive social bonds, group cohesion, morale, and healthy coping norms in their social
networks; those changes will contribute to reduced suicide risk, depression and occupational problems.
Aim 3: Examine implementation determinants and mechanisms, and refine Implementation
Package. Key implementation outcomes will be USAF implementers' fidelity delivering WC (n=24-30) and
engagement in training/technical support. Implementer fidelity and engagement is expected to be predicted by
base implementation climate and WC embeddedness into base communications and support activities."
10909341,"Streptococcus pneumoniae (the “pneumococcus”) is an important human commensal pathogen. A key
determinant of pneumococcal fitness and virulence is its ability to produce a protective polysaccharide (PS)
capsule which can take the form of >100 biochemically distinct “serotypes”. Pneumococcal capsule PS
conjugate vaccines (PCVs) induce protective antibodies that mediate opsonophagocytic killing (OPK) of
pneumococci and have effectively reduced the global burden of disease caused by serotypes included in
vaccines. Despite this success, immunized people occasionally experience breakthrough infections by PCV
serotypes, and the cause for these cases of “vaccine failure” remains unclear. Investigation of vaccine failure
has largely focused on host factors and ineffective antibody response, while microbiological aspects have gone
largely unaddressed. Furthermore, closely-related serotypes 19A and 19F are the serotypes most commonly
implicated in vaccine failure cases, but few studies have evaluated their role in this phenomenon.
 Appreciating the breadth of capsule malleability and its impact on clinical outcomes, we are examining
a potential link between serotype 19A/19F capsule variants, evasion of anti-capsule immune responses, and
vaccine failure. Preliminary analyses identified multiple candidate mechanisms through which polymorphisms
in the 19A/19F capsule polymerase Wzy can mediate considerable capsule variability while preserving most
capsule features. We also found a strain that was serotyped as “19F” by conventional methods, but in fact
produces a novel capsule PS structure, herein called 19x. Thus, the full diversity of 19A/19F-like capsule types
is yet to be defined. As even small changes in capsule structure can abrogate cross-protective
immunity, it is possible that some variants, which are indistinguishable from 19A/19F pneumococci in
conventional serotyping methods, can nonetheless evade OPK by anti-19A/19F capsule antibodies in
vaccinated individuals and, thus, spur the vaccine failure attributed to these serotypes.
 In this R21 proposal, we will perform directed mutagenesis to test the impact of Wzy polymorphisms on
19A/19F capsules structure and test the effect of these putative capsule changes on evading anti-capsule
antibody-mediated OPK in vitro (Aim 1). We will also structurally/genetically/antigenically characterize the
novel 19x capsule type and perform bioinformatics analysis of expansive genomic databases with the goal of
identifying other putative capsule variants found among immunized populations (Aim 2). Importantly, tools and
concepts developed here will fuel future investigation of the impact capsule PS malleability has in additional
pneumococcal serotypes and other medically important bacterial pathogens that employ similar pathways for
glycan synthesis. Independent of glycobiological advances, elucidation of the molecular basis of 19A/19F Wzy
enzymatic specificity would immediately improve the precision of the molecular typing strategies."

a rich menu of professional growth opportunities that have been individualized into a tailored curriculum for our
trainees, and also to create a pipeline of skilled mentors. We plan to do this by (a) fostering diverse, interactive,
and multidisciplinary professional development programming for KUH scholars across the continuum of their
careers. This would include new KUH-specific professional development opportunities such as the biweekly
Town Halls, mini-symposia and TRIO-Track Panels (career path opportunities), and also close interactions with
our three CTSAs to leverage existing opportunities for the benefit of our KUH trainees; (b) creating an Individual
Development Plan (IDP) for each trainee that serves as a real-time training guide; and (c) building a pipeline of
mentors across the continuum of KUH scholars, using interactive learning and evidence-based mentorship
training that emphasizes the benefits of justice, equity, diversity, and inclusivity for both trainees and mentors.
In summary, the Professional Development Core will expose trainees to an array of exciting opportunities in the
broad field of KUH; provide collective and individualized training that enhances foundational skills and expands
scientific and clinical depth and breadth; and mentor the mentors since great mentors are not born great mentors,
rather they have been mentored themselves to become inspiring role model teachers and counselors. This will
collectively result in an ever-expanding array of resources that realistically inspires and propels the trainee to
“shoot for the stars.”"
10848359,"ABSTRACT
Incurable autoimmune diseases afflict millions of Americans, cause pain and persistent damage to multiple organ
systems, and have a major impact on patient health, well-being and quality of life. Increased B cell numbers,
greater B cell activation and differentiation into plasma cells, and autoantibody production often characterize
autoimmunity, signifying that dysregulated B cell survival and differentiation are critical steps in autoimmune
pathogenesis. Identification of proteins and molecular events that regulate B cell survival, activation and
differentiation is therefore critical for better mechanistic understanding of autoimmune disease
development. Myo18A is a scaffolding protein with a unique domain organization that enables assembly of
multiprotein complexes in various subcellular compartments of non-immune cells. We reported that B cells
express Myo18A, and that its conditional deletion in B cells (Myo18A BKO) leads to an increase in mature B
cells and plasma cells, splenomegaly, hypergammaglobulinemia, and development of autoantibodies.
Interestingly, this profile overlaps with autoimmune manifestations reported in transgenic mice overexpressing
the B cell survival factor BAFF, and in mice with genetic deletion of proteins involved in mRNA decay. In
preliminary data, we observed that Myo18A-deficient B cells display features of greater BAFF responsiveness,
including increased mitochondrial size and gene expression, and stronger pro-survival Akt signaling, indicating
that Myo18A negatively regulates B cell response to BAFF. Additionally, deletion of Myo18A in B cells increased
the basal expression and reduced the decay of mRNA encoding Blimp-1, a key transcription factor in B cell
differentiation. Further, Myo18A in B cells bound to Blimp1 mRNA and co-localized with subcellular mRNA
degradation sites, indicating that Myo18A is involved in post-transcriptional regulation and expression of Blimp-
1. Our published and preliminary data suggest that Myo18A is an important and previously unrecognized
determinant in B cell immunity. Our specific aims are to test the hypotheses that (1) Myo18A restricts BCR
and BAFF-R signaling to control B cell homeostasis, (2) Myo18A inhibits mRNA stability to inform B cell gene
expression, and (3) Myo18A limits B cell differentiation by controlling the B cell transcriptome. The proposed
research is innovative because it will establish a novel role for the unconventional myosin family protein Myo18A
in preventing uncontrolled B cell activation and differentiation. Specifically, our research will identify a novel
functional connection between Myo18A and B cell survival and differentiation through regulation of B cell antigen
and BAFF responsiveness and post-transcriptional mRNA stability. This research is expected to have
significant impact because it will enable better mechanistic understanding of the molecular processes that
prevent exaggerated antibody development."
10844619,"Lung cancer is the second most common malignancy and the leading cause of cancer-related death in both men
and women in the United States, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for ~85% of all cases.
Localized and regional NSCLC are frequently treated with external beam radiation therapy alone or in
combination with surgery and chemotherapy using platinum-based drugs and taxanes. Metastatic NSCLC is
typically treated with systemic therapies such as chemotherapy, targeted molecular therapies, immune
checkpoint inhibitors alone or in combination. Chemotherapy and targeted molecular therapies do not offer
durable complete responses for metastatic disease, which can be achieved only in the minority of patients with
immune checkpoint inhibitors. Also, recurrence is common for localized and regional NSCLC treated with
radiation therapy (RT). RT has cytotoxic activity by causing DNA damage in NSCLC cells but is limited by intrinsic
cellular mechanisms that repair DNA damage and confer resistance to RT. Thus, there is a need for novel agents
to overcome DNA repair mechanisms and enhance the therapeutic efficacy of RT in NSCLC and increase the
response rates for immune checkpoint inhibitors. We propose that the inhibition of the ATPases RUVBL1 and
RUVBL2 with an orally available inhibitor is an effective and cancer-selective strategy for radiosensitization that
efficiently blocks DNA repair pathways by reducing protein levels of three key DNA damage repair factors, DNA-
PKcs and ATM/AR, in NSCLC cells but not in normal cells. Because of that unique activity, we expect that the
RUVBL1/2 inhibitor will be more effectively enhance the antitumor effects of IR than specific DNA-PKcs/ATM/AR
in vitro and in vivo and elicit less radiotoxicity. Also, we propose that the RUVBL1/2 inhibition elicits immune
stimulation, and therefore will therapeutically synergize with IR and immune checkpoint inhibitors. This project
will (1) determine the efficacy, specificity and determinants of radiosensitization by RUVBL1/2 inhibition, (2)
characterize immune stimulatory effects of RUVBL1/2 inhibition alone and in combination with radiation, and (3)
study the therapeutic potential of RUVBL1/2 inhibition in combination with IR and immune checkpoint inhibition.
If our project is successfully completed, it may provide the framework for a new therapeutic strategy for NSCLC
patients, which could improve clinical outcomes for this hard-to-treat disease."

The proposed work will combine experiments and theory to advance quantitative understanding of animal
gametogenesis. We use Drosophila as a genetic model organism that is highly suitable for quantitative
interdisciplinary research and focus on two evolutionarily conserved aspects of reproductive biology. First, eggs
and early embryos of large volumes require efficient means for coordinating cytoplasmic processes. Studies in
multiple experimental systems indicate that such coordination in large cells relies on large-scale hydrodynamic
flows, which reach the speeds of 100s nm/s and can mediate rapid mixing and transport of cytoplasmic
components. Our Aim 1 investigates such flows at a critical point in Drosophila oogenesis, where cytoplasmic
streaming is driven by cargo-loaded kinesin motors walking on arrays of cortically anchored microtubules. We
will use computational modeling and live imaging to systematically test a recent theory according to which
cytoplasmic streaming emerges spontaneously, through hydrodynamic coupling of cortically anchored
microtubules. Second, gametogenesis in both Drosophila and humans starts with the formation of cell-cycle
arrested primordial germ cells (PCSs). Quantitative control of PGC numbers is essential for organismal fertility
and for avoiding germline tumors. Aim 2 will investigate quantitative control of PGCs numbers in Drosophila
embryos, where PGCs are formed by limited divisions of the pole cells, the first true cells to form in the embryo.
We will use live imaging to characterize statistics of pole cell lineages and test the hypothesis that control of
PGC numbers can be explained using a model in which a mitotic clock slowly drifts out of an oscillatory regime.
Given the ubiquitous nature of cytoplasmic flows and conserved mechanisms of PGC regulation, our results will
have broad impact by providing answers to fundamental questions of developmental and reproduction biology."

RORgt+ ILC3s are abundant in the intestinal mucosa and play critical roles in gut tissue homeostasis and host-
microbiome interactions under the steady state, and also contribute to host immunity during infection and
inflammation. As a fundamental element for normal development of the immune system, iron is important for
the proliferation and activation of T cells, and participates in the complex interplays among host, commensals,
and pathogens. Our preliminary data suggest that iron metabolism is important for ILC3 maintenance and
function. Ahr together with other transcription factors regulate the transcription of CD71, a key iron transporter
that is crucial for maintaining a functional ILC3 compartment in the gut. Based on the premise and our
preliminary data, we hypothesize that iron metabolism regulated by the Ahr-CD71 axis is important for
intestinal ILC3 maintenance and function. Specifically, we will investigate 1) the iron impact on ILC3
maintenance and function, 2) the regulation of CD71 expression by Ahr-mediated pathway in ILC3s, and 3) the
functional role of Ahr-mediated CD71 pathway in ILC3s during infection. The study represents an emerging
paradigm of immune metabolism and nutrition immunology in health and disease, Successful completion of

There has been a significant decline in cancer related mortality, partly due to the emergence of molecular
targeted therapies. Unfortunately, the success of these drugs including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has been
tempered by a concomitant rise in the prevalence of cancer therapies-related cardiotoxicity. Ponatinib, a currently
FDA-approved third-generation TKI, is used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients carrying the
gatekeeper mutation breakpoint cluster region-Abelson (BCR-ABL) T315I. Despite its effectiveness, a
considerable number of patients receiving ponatinib suffers from various cardiac complications. Several studies
have linked ponatinib-induced cardiotoxicity to impaired pro-survival signaling pathways leading to cell death.
However, the molecular signaling pathways leading to these events remain obscure and a better understanding
of how cardiomyocytes respond to ponatinib may provide new insights into novel mitigation therapies. The heart
must adapt to stress conditions that occur as a result of intracellular or extracellular factors. The integrated stress
response (ISR) is one of the circuits responding to stress and serving to restore proteostasis by regulating protein
synthesis, although prolonged ISR activation leads to cell death. Whether the ISR is activated and plays a
protective or detrimental role in ponatinib-induced cardiotoxicity are largely unknown and may represent an
amenable therapeutic target which will be the focus of my current proposal. My preliminary data suggests that
ponatinib causes mitochondrial dysfunction in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes
(hiPSC-CMs). Interestingly, mitochondrial damage appears to trigger activation of the ISR and is mediated by a
kinase called general control non-repressed 2 (GCN2). I also found that inhibition of the ISR using a novel small
molecule called ISR inhibitor (ISRIB) successfully blunted the cardiotoxic effects of ponatinib both in vitro and in
vivo. Hence, the central hypothesis of my proposal is that the ISR pathway which is activated upon sensing
mitochondrial damage plays a pivotal role in mediating ponatinib-induced cardiotoxicity. Aim 1 will investigate
whether activation of GCN2 couples mitochondrial damage to ISR activation upon impaired mitochondrial
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level. Aim 2 will assess whether ponatinib
induces apoptosis and cardiac dysfunction through the GCN2/eIF2α/ATF4 axis. Lastly, aim 3 will explore whether
pharmacological suppression of the ISR even after the onset of ponatinib-induced cardiotoxicity remains
cardioprotective without compromising the efficacy of ponatinib against tumor cells. Taken together, at the
conclusion of these studies, we will have significantly expanded our knowledge by which how ponatinib-induced
mitochondrial dysfunction is sensed to trigger the ISR; whether this activation contributes to cardiac pathology;
and if crosstalk between these two pathways can be targeted as a therapeutic avenue to mitigate ponatinib-
induced cardiotoxicity clinically."

Preterm infants born at < 32 weeks and <1500 g (very low birth weight, VLBW) suffer from increased mortality
(10-15%) and less than 70% survive without major morbidity. Microbial dysbiosis has been associated with
major preterm morbidities but the microbial metabolites or the mechanisms by which they impact
pathophysiology, survival and morbidity is not known. The purpose of this proposal is to develop holistic
prediction models integrating clinical data and multi-omic signatures, aid biomarker discovery and advance the
paradigm in Neonatal Medicine from traditional to targeted precision medicine. The overarching hypothesis is
that integrating metabolic and multi-omic signatures with clinical data will reliably predict survival and major
morbidity in preterm, VLBW infants. The long-term goal of this research is to establish causal association
between identified microbial metabolites and disease in preterm infants, contribute to the knowledgebase of
microbial metabolites and improve preterm outcomes. We will test our hypothesis using the following Specific
Aims; Aim 1) Leverage machine learning techniques to develop clinical prediction models for mortality and
specific morbidities in preterm, VLBW infants: We will test the hypothesis, that a model integrating clinical
variables in the first 2 wks. of age, will accurately predict mortality, and morbidities of late-onset sepsis, NEC,
BPD, severe ROP and severe IVH. We will employ a retrospective cohort from the Vermont Oxford Database
(VON) from Texas Children’s Hospital, (n= 3385 VLBW infants). We will validate the clinical predictive models
derived from aim 1A with the prospective clinical data from the first 2 weeks, from Aim 2 (n=300), Aim 2)
Delineate microbial metabolites and multi-omic signatures that differentiate preterm VLBW infants with
mortality and morbidity, refine predictive models and enhance biomarker discovery: We will test the hypothesis
that integrating multi-omics signatures with clinical data using machine learning techniques will refine our
predictive models (mortality and specific morbidities of late-onset sepsis, NEC, BPD, ROP and IVH/PVL) for
better accuracy and enhance biomarker discovery. We will accomplish this in a prospective study design of
enrolled preterm (< 32weeks), VLBW infants (n= 300) and collect stool, urine and blood samples, longitudinally
twice a week for 2 weeks of age. We anticipate identifying known and novel metabolites and delineating
metabolic pathways hitherto unidentified that influence preterm pathophysiology and outcomes. Holistic
prediction models using information from the first 2 weeks of life will enable us to introduce interventions early
to improve health trajectories and patient outcomes, thereby facilitating the paradigm of proactive precision
medicine in Neonatology. The impact of our results extend beyond the field of neonatology, to other patients
and diseases where microbial dysbiosis and altered metabolome are key factors in the pathogenesis."

or low levels of novelty throughout early adolescence and through adulthood. Rats exposed to high levels of
novelty (enriched rats) are consistently found to be less sensitive to low doses of various drugs of abuse
compared to rats exposed to low levels of novelty (impoverished rats) when tested in young adulthood. When
using this model, the altered sensitivity to drugs of abuse is traditionally not tested until the animals reach
adulthood. A more systematic investigation on when during adolescence exposure to high- or low-novelty
environments induces these altered behavioral phenotypes is warranted. This may be particularly important as
the peak of when people initiate cannabis use is during adolescence. Given the popularity of cannabinoid
drugs, it is surprising that there is little to no research investigating whether environmental enrichment can alter
sensitivity to marijuana. While delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC) is considered the major
psychoactive ingredient of marijuana, the passage of the 2018 “Farm Bill” has led to the rise in the popularity of
minor cannabinoids of the hemp plant including delta-8-Tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-8-THC) and cannabidiol
(CBD). Products containing delta-8-THC have recently skyrocketed in popularity, particularly in states where
delta-9-THC remains fully illegal. A main goal of the proposed research is to combine new research from our
lab looking at the abuse liability of vaped or pulmonary administration of delta-8-THC and CBD and
combinations of these compounds using a conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure and determine when
and if adolescent environmental enrichment exposure can alter the sensitivity to these cannabis drugs. A
second goal is to determine when and if adolescent environmental enrichment exposure may alter brain
cannabinoid receptor densities in key brain structures involved in the rewarding and behavioral effects of
cannabinoid drugs."

Despite the prevalence of obesity in the United States, how obesity strengthens brain circuits that reinforce
feeding is not known. This K01 proposal will identify specific neural circuits and subcircuit mechanisms that
enhance feeding and are co-opted in obesity. While prior research has focused on obesity-linked adaptations
in brain regions that drive homeostatic feeding, adaptations in brain regions involved in hedonic, motivated
feeding may be dysregulated in obesity and contribute to ongoing food seeking and weight gain. For instance,
the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a brain region that regulates feeding and reward, and human and rodent
literature have revealed alterations in NAc activity in obesity, along with disrupted NAc synaptic plasticity
mechanisms. Preliminary data in this proposal demonstrates that NAc activity was selectively increased in a
subpopulation of neurons known to invigorate reward, D1-receptor expressing neurons (D1SPNs), in obese mice
during food seeking. Further, inhibiting NAc D1SPNs output decreased food seeking and prevented diet-induced
weight gain. Enhanced D1SPN activity was driven by increased intrinsic excitability and pre-synaptic
glutamatergic drive. Together these data suggest a model in which enhanced excitatory NAc inputs drive food
seeking in obesity. Yet it remains unclear which input(s) is/are responsible for increased NAc activity in obese
mice, whether all NAc D1SPNs are aberrantly activated or if select ensembles drive food seeking, and lastly,
what synaptic mechanisms underlie these adaptations. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that
enhanced excitatory input to NAc D1SPNs drives food seeking and obesity through attenuated synaptic
depression of glutamatergic inputs. The experiments outlined here will use in vivo optogenetics,
electrophysiology, genetic manipulations, novel operant behavioral paradigms, and a mouse model of diet-
induced obesity to test this hypothesis in the following Aims: Aim 1 will determine which NAc input(s) drive food
seeking and weight gain in obese mice. Aim 2 will investigate how select ensembles of NAc D1SPNs that are
activated during food seeking drive enhanced feeding in obesity. Aim 3 will define a potential mechanism
underlying changes in NAc plasticity in obese mice, and determine how such plasticity underlies food seeking
and weight gain. Together, these experiments represent a major step forward towards understanding how
obesity alters brain circuits, and why it so difficult for people to lose weight and keep it off."

Campylobacter jejuni is the most common cause of food-born diarrhea in the United States. Although it is most
often associated with self-limiting diarrheal disease, a small proportion of infected patients develop a more
serious neuro-degenerative complication known as Guillain-Barré Syndrome. Despite many important
advances in the field, still remarkably little is known about its mechanisms of pathogenicity. C. jejuni has the
ability to efficiently colonize the intestine of a broad range of hosts, which allows this pathogen to gain access
to the food chain thus presenting major challenges to the food industry. It has been widely observed that the
attack rate of C. jejuni during well-documented point-source outbreaks or controlled human infections is under
50%, and that even under conditions of heavy exposure, only a subset of individuals developed symptomatic
infections. It is well established that under physiological conditions, the resident microbiota exerts a restricting
effect over bacterial enteropathogens. We therefore hypothesize that some of the documented differences in
susceptibility to C. jejuni infection is due to differences in the composition of the intestinal microbiota. We
intend to conduct experiments to better understand the mechanisms by which the resident intestinal microbiota
restricts C. jejuni colonization. To achieve this objective we plan to leverage a germ-free chicken gut
colonization model that we have recently established in our laboratory along with our long-standing expertise in
the study of C. jejuni. These studies will provide the foundation for the understanding of the role of the resident
microbiota in C. jejuni intestinal colonization, which may serve as the bases for the development of novel
strategies to combat C. jejuni infections."
10897929,"Project Summary:
Synovial Sarcoma (SS) is driven by the SS18-SSX oncofusion, and SS18-SSX is the only reoccurring mutation
in SS. SS normally metastasizes, resulting in a 15-year overall survival rate of less than 50%. This presents a
particular problem as 1/3 of the patients that are diagnosed are under the age of 30. Polychemotherapy has a
modest and variable effect on patients, immunotherapy activity is unremarkable, and there are currently no
targeted therapy options to combat SS. SS18-SSX remains undruggable despite clearly being the driving event
in these cancers. Thus, SS requires entirely new therapeutic approaches. In light of this, we tried to identify
potential novel therapies by assessment of full genome short-interfering (si)-RNA screen data deposited into the
DepMap database and subsequent cell culture experiments with SS cell lines and patient-derived xenograft cell
cultures. Through these efforts, we have identified a clinically actionable synthetic lethality with SSX-SS18 in SS,
namely disruption of the post-translational modification, SUMOylation. We find SS18-SSX activates the
SUMOylation, and disruption of this pathway with the in-clinic SUMOylation inhibitor, TAK-981, disrupts SS18-
SSX function, induces DNA damage and shrinks SS tumors in mice.
Specific Aims
Specific Aim 1: Test a diverse set of synovial sarcoma mouse models for efficacy and safety of SUMOylation
inhibition
Specific Aim 2: Investigate the relationship between SS18-SSX and the SUMOylated proteome in synovial
sarcoma
Study Design: We will further characterize the sensitivity of TAK-981 (alone and with chemotherapy and BRD9
degrader) in SS cell culture models including patient-derived organoids, and in vivo, in orthotopic patient-derived
xenograft (PDX) models and genetic mouse models of SS. Through a series of proteomic and biochemical
experiments, we will further categorize the mechanism of SS18-SSX-dependent toxicity stemming from
disruption of the SUMOylation pathway. We will further examine the role of SS18-SSX in activating the
SUMOylation pathway and the mechanism of action of TAK-981 in SS, which involves disrupting the SS18-SSX-
ncBAF transcriptome. In all, we will attempt to gather the preclinical evidence supporting the translation of
SUMOylation inhibitors to treat SS."
10909283,"Glycolipid biointerface to decipher disease-implicated ganglioside-protein interactions
 All cells in the human body, including neurons, immune cells, epithelial cells, and blood cells, are
coated with a dense layer of glycoproteins and glycolipids known as the glycocalyx. The extraordinary
complexity in structural organization and biosynthesis of the glycocalyx has made it very difficult to
comprehend the precise roles it plays in various cellular processes and thus limited its potential as
therapeutic target. An important family of molecules of the glycocalyx is gangliosides, which participate
in a wide array of intercellular events such as modulating killer cell toxicity, controlling neural regeneration,
and promoting cell adhesion during inflammation. Gangliosides are found to play important roles in
altering and mediating affinity properties of the membrane proteins in certain cancers, and are clearly
implicated in insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes. However, the biochemical mechanisms of gangliosides’
effect on tumor and type 2 diabetes appear to be extremely complex, and a major portion of ganglioside
pathology remains elusive. Lack of suitable techniques is a main obstacle that has principally limited the
research on gangliosides and restricted our ability to understand their roles on protein function.
 We propose to build a highly effective, glyco-diverse, biomimetic membrane interface system and
a new bioanalytical platform to study the ganglioside-protein interactions implicated in several diseases
at the molecular level. A ganglioside library will be created for construction of interface mimics with
precisely controlled glycan moiety, composition and packing biophysics as observed in those disease
states. The proposed approach bypasses complex endogenous synthesis of gangliosides, and creates
a novel hosting environment with programmed tuning in ganglioside makeups for elucidating structure-
function relationships with the membrane proteins. The effect of gangliosides on protein interactions will
be primarily investigated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, which quantifies molecular
binding and affinity changes under systematically varied composition and headgroup moiety (Aim 1). We
will then study and understand the inhibitory/promoting function of gangliosides on proteins EGFR and
VEGFR, angiogenic activators linked to progression of cancer (Aim 2), and on interactions of insulin,
insulin receptor and caveolin-1 (Aim 3), a key system implicated in insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes."
10874747,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Malaria is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, responsible for the deaths of hundreds of
thousands of individuals per year, primarily children and pregnant women. Effective control is hampered by the
lack of a vaccine and continually emerging drug resistance. Most cases of severe malaria are caused by
Plasmodium falciparum, which is an obligate intracellular parasite of human red blood cells (RBCs). Therefore,
critical host factors may provide an untapped source of new therapeutic targets. Red blood cell invasion is a
complex process that involves interactions between several parasite ligands and host receptors, but there
remains a fundamental gap in knowledge regarding the functional role(s) of RBC host factors for P. falciparum.
This gap in our knowledge is, in part, due to RBCs being terminally differentiated and lacking DNA, thereby
precluding conventional genetic experimentation. To surmount this roadblock, we have recently developed
CRISPR-Cas9-based methods to generate null mutants in primary human hematopoietic stem cells and
efficiently differentiate them ex-vivo to mature cultured RBCs (cRBCs), opening new opportunities for functional
analysis of these important cells. Our objective in this proposal is to comprehensively determine the specific
roles and functions of two novel RBC host factors required for P. falciparum invasion, CD44 and CD55, which
were recently identified from a forward genetic screen. Our central hypothesis, supported by strong preliminary
data, is that these critical surface receptors play distinct yet synergistic roles to facilitate P. falciparum invasion
through their interactions with parasite ligands and subsequent signaling to the host cell. In the first aim, we will
determine the precise steps involving CD44 and CD55 in P. falciparum invasion of human RBCs using live cell
imaging and advanced microscopy. In the second aim, avidity-based and proximity labeling proteomic
approaches will be used to identify P. falciparum and RBC binding partners for CD44 and CD55. In the final aim,
we will define host RBC signaling pathways activated by P. falciparum invasion, and test their dependence on
CD44 and CD55. Together, these studies will generate a comparative understanding of the mechanistic roles of
two novel host factors crucial for P. falciparum invasion. In addition to revealing new insights into the fundamental
cell biology of Plasmodium invasion and human RBCs, this work will stimulate new therapeutic and vaccine
approaches to treat one of the most important infectious diseases of humankind."
10872160,"Abstract
GABAergic cortical interneurons (cINs) play critical roles in balancing, synchronizing, and gating brain activity
by inhibiting other neurons. Their malfunction, especially those of medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-derived
cINs, has been associated with various neurodevelopmental brain disorders, such as schizophrenia (SCZ) and
autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Considering the fact that the divergence between human brains and rodent
brains has resulted in the failure of many central nervous system (CNS) therapeutics validated in rodent
models, it is critical to study human neurons to better understand the mechanisms of these cIN-associated
brain disorders. Human fetal brain tissues are not accessible for mechanistic studies, but we have developed a
method to efficiently generate homogeneous populations of MGE-type human cINs from pluripotent stem cells
(PSCs) of healthy or diseased subjects. We have extensively characterized them and demonstrated their
authenticity and functionality, making it possible to study the converging functional consequences of complex
genetics in real patient neurons, which cannot be studied in mouse neurons due to a lack of conservation of
non-coding regions, where most of risk loci are present. However, in vitro cultured neurons lack other critical
components of the brain environment, such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia and blood vessels,
which can significantly impact their function. There have been efforts to optimize in vitro culture systems to
better recapitulate in vivo physiological environments by adding other brain cellular components, but there are
still limitations as to how closely they can simulate in vivo situations. To resolve this issue, in our previous
study, we pioneered human neuron-mouse brain chimeras to study the function of human SCZ neurons in
physiological environments. Although we were able to successfully identify SCZ cIN-intrinsic connectivity
deficits in mouse brains, we were not able to analyze the impacts of grafted neurons on brain circuits and
behaviors due to the presence of healthy mouse neurons in the grafted mice. Thus, in this proposed study, we
will perform brain-region-specific cIN-ablation in NodScid gamma (NSG) mice, followed by the replacement of
ablated host cINs with human cINs to generate region-specific humanized cIN chimeras. Based on previous
studies, including ours, that show successful restoration of compromised mouse inhibition by grafted human
cINs, these mice will allow us to analyze the functional impacts of grafted human cINs on the brain circuits and
behaviors in physiological in vivo environments. This novel physiological model system will help us tease apart
cell-type- and brain-region-specific disease mechanisms for complex brain disorders, and aid in developing
novel therapeutics."
10918215,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Current recommendations indicate that rapid whole genome sequencing should be the standard of care for
critically ill newborns. The disconnect between these guidelines and the adoption of whole genome sequencing
in the neonatal intensive care unit delays diagnoses and life-saving therapies. The effects are greater in rural
Level 3 settings where healthcare inequities exist. Translational science strategies to implement genomic
medicine into clinical care are sorely needed, but currently lacking. This proposal is a dissemination and
implementation science project addressing the lack of use of rapid whole genome sequencing in Level 4
(tertiary, metropolitan, higher resourced) and Level 3 (non-tertiary, rural, lower resourced) neonatal intensive
care units by developing Level-specific logic models outlining specific barriers and facilitators, developing and
leveraging strategies that address these barriers, and test these strategies in a small-scale demonstration
project.
The overall goal of the integrated career development plan is to prepare the candidate to become an expert in
dissemination and implementation science and improve the clinical application of personalized medicine in
neonatal critical care settings. The training and research will be conducted at an institution with a strong record
of providing excellent support and robust training and educational resources. The candidate’s department is
committed to the success of this early career physician-scientist, providing protected research time, resources,
and support needed to complete the proposed research and training aims. The career development aims focus
on needed skills in dissemination and implementation science providing the candidate with the necessary tools
as an independent investigator to integrate technology into the neonatal intensive care unit that will aid in
better diagnosis and improve human health. These aims will be overseen by an experienced multidisciplinary
mentoring team who ensure the candidate’s success."
10876365,"Project Summary
Chronic psychosocial stress is a major risk factor for functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable
bowel syndrome (IBS). Notably, there is high co-morbidity between IBS and stress-related psychiatric
disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD), with IBS and MDD representing two of the most prevalent
and debilitating illnesses worldwide. Potentially underlying this co-morbidity is the recent finding that chronic
stress elicits low-grade inflammation, which has been associated with both IBS and MDD. Moreover,
increasing evidence suggests that the gut-brain axis, or connections between the central and enteric nervous
systems, contributes to the etiology of IBS. However, the mechanisms through which an emotional state such
as chronic stress influences gut pathophysiology, including inflammation, remain poorly understood. In
preliminary experiments using the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) model in mice, we find that intestinal
inflammation and barrier permeability become elevated following CSDS in both male and female mice, and
these phenomena correlate with depression-like behaviors such as social avoidance. In this project, I will
investigate how psychosocial stress causes this gut pathophysiology. Using retrograde viral tracing strategies
from the gut to the brain, and whole-brain imaging, I have generated a list of candidate stress-activated brain
regions that directly innervate the gut. In the first aim of this proposal, I will use integrated neuroscience and
immunology techniques, such as chemogenetics and flow cytometry, to determine if activation of these brain
regions can trigger gut inflammation and barrier permeability. Moreover, I aim to identify subsets of enteric
neurons in the intestine that receive signals from the brain during stress to propagate IBS-like symptoms. In
the second aim, I will then assess how inflammatory signals in the gut are conveyed to the brain to influence
stress-relevant behaviors. As the brain can detect the inflammatory state of peripheral tissues through sensory
afferent nerves, I will first identify which stress-responsive brain regions receive input from gut. I will then use
fiber photometry to evaluate how gut inflammation modulates neuronal activity in these brain regions and its
consequences on behavior. In parallel, I will investigate if a compromised intestinal barrier allows bacterial
toxin translocation from the gut lumen into circulation to promote systemic inflammation and depression-like
behaviors. Collectively, this project aims to define bi-directional stress-activated gut-brain circuits that
contribute to IBS- and MDD-related symptoms."
10912052,"Abstract: Periodontitis is the second most prevalent but preventable dental disease affecting over 64 million
Americans and responsible for tooth loss, functionality limitations, pain, and poor quality of life. Thus, early
diagnosis and preventive therapeutics are imperative in clinical practice to prevent disease initiation and
progression. However, by the time dentists can observe the first bone loss patterns in radiographs to diagnose
periodontitis, 30-50% deterioration (periodontal bone damage) has already occurred, which is not visible to
human eyes. Clinical decision support systems are designed to identify high-risk periodontitis patients for
prevention; however, they are not widely used in clinical practice because of the suboptimal prediction
performance and lack of diverse predictive features (early bone loss lesions) for prediction. Therefore, there is
an unmet need for a tool that can detect early bone loss patterns invisible to human eyes to alert dentists for
early diagnosis and preventive care. Dr. Patel has developed an artificial intelligence (AI) empowered prediction
model for periodontitis that utilizes more than 150 distinct variables (e.g., social determinants of health, medical
records, lab reports, CDC census data, financial data, etc.) for prediction, which aren't well understood in the
existing literature. However, this model lacks dental imaging data such as bone pattern, bone density, pixel
intensity, and other imaging predictive features, which have a high potential to improve prediction accuracy. The
early bone mineral changes in alveolar bone for early diagnosis have been studied in biological studies; however,
the transition of these findings at the chairside is limited. AI and computer vision can bridge this gap and help
identify early bone loss patterns from radiographs invisible to human eyes. Therefore, the objective of this project
is to develop three automated computer vision algorithms: 1) to improve the extraction of diagnostically
meaningful information from periapical radiographs, 2) to determine the extent of bone loss information from
radiographs, and 3) build a prediction model to identify early bone loss patterns from radiographs before disease
initiation and progression. Enhanced and consistent radiographs will improve diagnostic accuracy & reduce
radiographic exposure, automatic bone loss measurement will reduce diagnostic discrepancies, and early bone
loss detection will identify high-risk patients to take preventive approaches. The candidate, Dr. Patel's goal is to
become an independent PI in dental informatics and develop cutting-edge technologies to generate practice-
based evidence (using data-driven methods) to improve patient care and outcomes. A funded K08 proposal will
allow Dr. Patel to develop the skills necessary to complete the proposed research (training in computer vision &
radiology) and become an independent research scientist (training in didactic mentoring, lecturing, &
grantsmanship). Dr. Patel has formed a team of five mentors with expertise in clinical dentistry, computer vision,
radiology, and periodontology to provide high-quality, diverse scientific, collegial support and state-of-the-art
facilities to ensure the successful completion of this proposed career development goals and research program."
10868720,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In 2017, ~750K Americans were diagnosed with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), which rises 3% yearly. 87% will
have renal replacement therapy with hemodialysis (HD), with preferred vascular access through arteriovenous fistula
(AVF). AVFs have ~62% year patency due to venous stenosis (VS) and neointimal hyperplasia (VNH) causing
reduced blood flow and suboptimal HD which is treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) at >$3B/yr.
Monocyte and macrophage recruitment occurs to the injured vessel wall after PTA of stenotic arteriovenous fistulas
(AVF) through increased expression of MCP-1 leading to VS/VNH. Bindarit is an oral selective inhibitor of MCP-1, -
2, and -3 and we encapsulated it in polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles embedded in a thermosensitive
Pluronic F127 hydrogel (BN NP) for periadventitial delivery to the outflow vein to test in this proposal. Scanning
electron microscope and dynamic light scattering were used to characterize the BN NP and control nanoparticles (NP
C). Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to study drug release kinetics.
Immediately after PTA, in a murine model of AVF stenosis, BN NP or NP C was administrated to the periadventitia
of outflow veins. Animals were sacrificed 3 and 21 days later for gene expression, histomorphometric, and
immunohistochemical analyses. Doppler ultrasound was performed weekly. There was no difference in the size and
storage modulus of BN NP compared controls. Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated increased drug release from
BN NP when compared to controls. BN NP treated vessels had reduced MCP-1, MCP-2 and MCP-3 gene and protein
levels, reduced CCR2, increased FABP4/IL8, macrophage/monocyte abundance, proinflammatory cytokines,
reduced CD4 (+) cells, reduced endothelial inflammation, and venous fibrosis resulting in positive vascular remodeling
and improved patency with reduced VS/VNH. There was increased peak velocity 21 days after PTA in the BN NP
group. Periadventitial administration of BN NP to the outflow vein after PTA results in decreased VS/VNH.
Central Hypothesis. Periadventitial delivery of Bindarit NPs to AVF outflow vein after PTA decreases Mcp-1, -2, -3,
CCR2 expression with increased FABP4/IL8 leading to less immune, macrophage cell infiltration with reduction in
smooth muscle cells, fibrosis, and VS/VNH. We propose three specific aims:
Aim 1: Determine how Bindarit NPs reduce MCP-1, -2, and -3 leading to decreased monocyte to macrophage
differentiation, migration, proliferation, leukocyte chemoattraction by endothelial cells and inflammatory
cytokine expression.
Aim 2: Assess the role(s) of Bindarit NPs on CCR2 and FABP4/IL8 on reducing VS/VNH after PTA of stenotic AVFs.
Aim 3: Ascertain the safety and efficacy of Bindarit NPs on reducing VS/VNH after PTA in pigs with CKD."

Single cell technologies, in particular single cell transcriptomics, have been applied to numerous areas in
biological and biomedical research and become a powerful tool for complex tissue characterization. Despite its
ever-growing throughput and complexity, the development of analytical tools for single cell genomics has fallen
behind the technological advances. The overarching goal of this proposal is to address some of the most
pressing analytic challenges facing profiling and interpreting single cell genomics data, including: 1) lack of
differential expression analysis methods that properly account for within-sample cellular heterogeneity; 2) lack
of cis-regulatory inference methods that leverage multi-omics data; and 3) lack of proper methods to perform
eQTL mapping in population-scale scRNA-seq studies. In the proposal, we will work on the following aims: Aim
1. Develop a differential expression analysis framework that better resolves sample heterogeneity and combats
false discoveries for single cell data. Aim 2. Develop Bayesian model selection methods that infer cis-
regulatory relationships from multi-omics data. Aim 3. Develop eQTL mapping methods that accommodate
multiple cell types and experimental conditions in population-scale scRNA-seq studies. All methods will be
implemented in user-friendly software and disseminated to the scientific community. Successful achievement
of Aims 1 and 2 will dramatically increase the power of routine single cell genomics analysis, facilitating the
application of these cutting-edge technologies to translational and clinical studies. Successful achievement of
Aim 3 will provide new ways to comprehensively characterize the genetic architecture underlying gene
expression that is specific to both cell-type and experimental-condition, ultimately facilitating the understanding
of common diseases and disease-related complex traits."
10883642,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder affecting 1 in 3500 individuals worldwide
due to inactivating mutations in the NF1 gene. Cognitive symptoms in NF1 include impaired executive
functioning, autistic features, speech and language delays, attention deficits, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.
Disease manifestations are due to reduced expression of functional neurofibromin, the protein product of NF1
that inhibits Ras-MAPK (Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK) signaling cascades by accelerating Ras-GTP hydrolysis. Using a
heterozygous knockout (Nf1+/-) mouse model of NF1, we previously discovered that Nf1 haploinsufficiency
causes hypersensitivity to salient visual stimuli, such as a looming disc that promotes rapid escape to an
available shelter by simulating predator approach from above. These phenotypes are likely controlled by the
superior colliculus (SC), which receives direct visual input from retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and coordinates
behavioral responses to looming visual threats. Recently, it has been shown that cultured Nf1+/- RGCs are
more excitable in vitro. These results raise the possibility that Nf1 haploinsufficiency enhances the sensitivity of
SC-projecting RGCs to light; however, no study to date has examined RGC firing in an intact Nf1+/- retina or
recorded neuronal responses in the superior colliculus in Nf1+/- mice. In this proposal we will test the
hypothesis that a MAPK-dependent increase in the sensitivity of Nf1+/- RGCs to light produces visual
hypersensitivity phenotypes via the downstream superior colliculus. In Aim 1, we will directly measure RGC
responses to visual stimuli ex vivo and in vivo in NF1 model mice. In Aim 2, we will use calcium imaging and
optogenetics to define the contribution of ventral SC glutamatergic neurons to phenotypic expression. Finally,
in Specific Aim 3, we will test the role of activated MAPK signaling in NF1-associated phenotypes by
determining if visual hypersensitivity is recapitulated in a novel knock-in mouse model of Noonan syndrome. If
successful, these experiments will identify a new role for retinotectal visual processing circuits in NF1 and may
paradigmatically shift how attentional and visuospatial deficits are conceptualized in this disease."
10895454,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Billions of base pairs of DNA must be replicated trillions of times during a human lifetime. Adding to the difficulty,
replication is challenged by stresses including DNA template lesions, difficult to replicate sequences, and
conflicts with transcription. Multiple repair and tolerance responses to replication stress act to complete DNA
synthesis while minimizing errors. In this project we seek to understand these mechanisms with a focus on
replication fork reversal. Replication fork reversal is thought to stabilize stalled forks, to place DNA lesions back
into the context of duplex DNA where it can be removed through excision repair, and to provide an opportunity
for template switching. Reversal is catalyzed by ATP-dependent DNA translocases and the RAD51 recombinase.
It is also highly regulated, which is needed to prevent inappropriate slowing of replication and nuclease-
dependent processing of replication forks. For example, we recently discovered RADX as a single-stranded DNA
binding protein that regulates reversal by directly binding RAD51. In this funding period we seek to understand
how RADX functions, how replication resumes following a challenge, and to rigorously test the hypothesis that
fork reversal is an error-free mechanism of DNA damage tolerance. We will test and refine new conceptual
models utilizing a combination of biochemical, genetic, and cell biological approaches. Our many years of
accumulated knowledge and reagents and strong team of collaborators uniquely position us to complete these
studies. Given the importance of replication stress responses to preventing diseases including cancer, these
studies will generate discoveries that could be translated in the future to benefit human health."
10870007,"Summary:On July 26, 2021, the FDA approved the anti-PD1 immunotherapy pembrolizumab (Keytruda®,
Merck) for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. Although significant progress has been made in
breast cancer immunotherapy, resistance to immunotherapy remains a major obstacle to lasting survival
benefit in breast cancer patients. Targetable mechanisms to overcome therapeutic resistance are urgently
needed. Emerging evidence have shown that long noncoding RNA genes (lncRNAs) play essential roles in the
tumor immunity. In our recent publication, we have identified a lncRNA, EPIC1, that is specifically expressed
in tumor cells and suppresses the antitumor immune response through activating EZH2 protein. Based on our
preliminary data, we hypothesize that (a) EPIC1 induces immunotherapy resistance by activating EZH2 in
breast cancer; and (b) EZH2 inhibitor, tazemetostat (TAZVERIK®), may enhance responses to anti-PD1
therapy for EPIC1 overexpressed breast cancer. We have designed three aims to test our hypotheses. Aim 1
will determine the association of the EPIC1-EZH2 axis with tumor immune suppression in human breast
cancer samples. Aim 2 will dissect the mechanism by which the EPIC1-EZH2 axis regulates tumor immunity.
Aim 3 will test the efficacy of tazemetostat, alone or combined with anti-PD1, in humanized breast cancer
mouse models. We have formed a team including basic, translational and clinical investigators, who have
deep experience in breast cancer pathology, RNA biology, and immunotherapy to conduct the proposed
research. Our project will provide key preclinical data and biomarkers for the combination of two FDA-
approved cancer drugs for breast cancer patients."

Malaria is an ongoing global health burden, and the spread of drug resistance threatens progress made to
eradicate the disease. The liver stage of the Plasmodium lifecycle is a promising target for drug and vaccine
development as its inhibition would prevent disease manifestation and transmission. Previously, we mapped
transcriptional changes throughout Plasmodium infection of hepatocytes and identified host processes critical to
parasite viability. The chemical inhibition and genetic disruption of specific host proteins, such as aquaporin 3
(AQP3), were found to hinder liver stage parasite development. In mammalian cells, AQP3 transports water,
glycerol, and other small solutes across cell membranes. Interestingly, we demonstrated that AQP3 localizes to
the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM), the interface between the host and pathogen, in multiple
Plasmodium species and stages. Our goal is to better understand host-parasite dynamics that support infection
by determining how and why Plasmodium repurposes AQP3. In Aim 1, we plan to elucidate the recruitment of
AQP3 to the host-pathogen interface using live-cell imaging with chemical and genetic tools. We will delineate
the dynamics of AQP3 interactions with the tubulovesicular network, a membranous system that extends from
the PVM. We will further probe the role of known trafficking motifs and the host endomembrane system to
understand how AQP3 associates to the PVM and observe this association at an ultrastructural level with
immuno-electron microscopy. In Aim 2, we will investigate AQP3 function during Plasmodium infection using a
suite of imaging tools combined with AQP3 mutants to identify molecules affected by the host protein. In Aim 3,
we will develop AQP3-targeting chemical probes to explore protein dynamics in the Plasmodium liver stages,
including human-infective P. vivax and P. falciparum, where genetic approaches are currently unavailable.
Fragment-based probe discovery will be used to identify covalent AQP3-binding molecules to label and study
AQP3 in cells. Together, this work will provide insights into AQP3 recruitment and function during Plasmodium
infection, thereby uncovering mechanisms that may be ubiquitously used by Plasmodium parasites to hijack host
proteins. Our small molecule approach offers a route to complete fundamental biological studies probing host-
parasite dynamics throughout different stages of the Plasmodium lifecycle and lays a foundation for future host-

the United States are affected per year. Delayed wound healing increases aged patients’ risk of chronic wounds,
wound infections, and tissue necrosis, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Wound care is also a rising
economic problem with an estimated $10 billion annually spent on wound care for older adults. The various
causes for delayed healing of aging ultimately result in perturbations of normal wound healing processes. This
includes a recently discovered wound healing response incorporating cellular senescence, a biologically active
state of permanent growth arrest caused by various stressors like tissue injury. Senescent cells (SnC) that arise
acutely in cutaneous wounds have beneficial effects in wound healing when they are transiently present,
however, specific SnC identities and their associated functions during wound healing have still not been
thoroughly characterized. My preliminary data generated during my GEMSSTAR award confirm a robust and
transient increase in beneficial senescence during excisional wound healing in young (2 month) mice, required
for timely wound resolution. However, my data also demonstrates that in aged (24 month) mice with delayed
wound healing, this acute wound senescence response is significantly attenuated. A similar diminished acute
senescence-like response occurs during aged human wound healing suggesting that attenuation is conserved
between species. To gain better understanding of wound SnCs that benefit wound healing and which are
diminished in aging, my lab has isolated high-expressing p16Ink4a (a common senescence marker) cells from
the wounds of young p16tdTom mice. Preliminary single-cell RNAseq analysis reveals multiple wound cell types
with high p16+ expression during wound healing. A majority are within distinct clusters of fibroblasts (Fb) and
macrophages (Mϕ) with p16+ expression associated with positive regulation of wound healing: p16+ wound Fbs
upregulate genes for protein synthesis and certain collagens while p16+ wound Mϕs are more anti-inflammatory
and promote extracellular matrix deposition with both cell types being more apoptosis-resistant compared to their
respective p16-negative counterparts. As transient senescence is important for optimal wound healing in
younger organisms this project’s goals are to uncover the cellular mechanisms by which specific wound SnCs
positively influence wound healing and determine their roles in delayed healing of aging. I will test the overall
hypothesis that age-related attenuation of beneficial wound SnCs contributes to delayed wound healing in aged
mammals and that restoration of these key wound SnCs can promote more timely wound resolution. The
following Aims are designed to elucidate changes in wound SnCs throughout aging, define their beneficial impact
on wound healing, and provide the therapeutic framework for treatment of delayed healing of aging with
senescence modification."
10869986,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Suicide rates have exponentially increased, and it is now the 2nd leading cause of death in adolescence,
accounting for over 1.2 million annual emergency department (ED) visits. After an ED visit or attempt, up to
20% of adolescents will have a second attempt within 12 months, and almost half will have a repeat ED visit.
My long-term goal is to be an independent, federally-funded physician-scientist with a research program in
adolescent suicidality. This proposal's overall objectives are to investigate physiologic parameters and
biometric data from wearable technology that is temporally related to suicidal behavior and develop a
personalized, predictive tool that can improve outpatient identification of adolescent patients with suicidality
before a crisis develops requiring an ED visit. The central hypothesis is that biometric data can continuously
monitor and allow for early identification/intervention of escalating suicidal symptoms. The rationale is that
improved outpatient monitoring through wearable technology can create a more objective platform to provide
the ability to identify a worsening condition and utilize patient-specific just-in-time therapeutics developed with
mental health providers for suicidal adolescents. To attain the overall objectives, I will pursue the following
specific aims: (i) To evaluate whether HRV, combined with patient-specific risk factors, can be used to detect
dynamic changes in suicide severity among a prospective cohort of acutely suicidal adolescents, (ii) To utilize
machine learning to determine whether there is a temporal relationship/signature in the raw PPG signal before
or immediately after changes in suicide severity reporting combined with patient-specific risk factors to develop
a prediction tool for suicidality risk. These aims will be accomplished in three years through a prospective
observational study enrolling acutely suicidal adolescents in the ED and an inpatient psychiatric unit. In
addition, the following career development aims will be accomplished to position myself as an independent
physician-scientist following completion of this K23: (i) formal training in clinical suicidality assessment and
monitoring outside the ED, including developmental psychology/youth suicidology; (ii) Machine learning and
data analysis techniques for large longitudinal datasets integral to clinical research translation from digital
monitors; (iii) K-to-R transition that will include the methodology for clinical trials and adaptive design. This
proposal is significant because it aligns with the NIMH mission of improved preventative research, assessing
mental health trajectories over time, and research with an extensive public health reach. The research
proposed in this application is innovative because researchers can use this platform in future studies as a new
physiologic approach to adolescent suicidality. Ultimately, such knowledge can offer unique opportunities for
early detection, just-in-time interventions, and support over 1.2 million suicidal adolescents presenting to EDs
nationally."
10915581,"The pathogenic bacterium responsible for Legionnaires’ disease, Legionella pneumophila, uses SidE family
of effectors (such as SdeA) to target several host proteins through a noncanonical ubiquitination mechanism
radically different from the ATP-driven, E1-E2-E3 ubiquitination of eukaryotes. This mechanism involves an all-
in-one ubiquitination machinery in SdeA which employs, first, mono-ADP-ribosylation (mART) of ubiquitin (Ub)
at Arg42, catalyzed by its mART domain, to produce ADP-ribosylated ubiquitin (ADPR-Ub), which is then
subjected an additional catalytic step, executed by the phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity embedded in a separate
domain, resulting in phosphoribosyl (PR) ubiquitination of serine residues of host targets. Essential to the
pathogen’s intracellular life cycle, SdeA and its orthologs target numerous host proteins involved in a range of
processes, from vesicular trafficking to nutrient acquisition and autophagy. While resistant to host
deubiquitinases, the PR ubiquitination is regulated at multiple levels at the hands of other effectors: the SidJ
effector (and its paralog SdjA) can shut off mART activity by modifying a key catalytic residue though a
pseudokinase-based polyglutamylation activity; whereas the DupA and DupB effectors can reverse PR-
ubiquitination by restoring host targets (such as Rab33) to their native form. This sort of deubiquitination activity,
while releasing the native host target, still leaves Ub as a modified derivative, with a phosphoribosyl appendage
at Arg42 (PR-Ub). Accumulation of such a Ub derivative, that cannot be used in host ubiquitination pathways,
has the effect of poisoning the cellular Ub pool which could be detrimental to Legionella’s replication.
 In this proposal we explore regeneration of free, functional Ub from PR-Ub through a two-step process
involving an unusual AMPylation reaction catalyzed by a novel S-HxxxE motif-containing, actin-activated
AMPylator, called LnaB, producing ADPR-Ub, which is then further processed by a macrodomain (ADP-
ribosyl)hydrolase, MavL, returning Ub to its native form. Using single particle cryo-EM we will provide structural
basis of actin activation, PR-Ub recognition and the ATP binding site of LnaB. The EM studies will be
complemented with x-ray crystallography of apo LnaB and its ATP-bound form. Together with biochemical
studies aimed at capturing enzyme intermediates, our work will provide key insights into the novel AMPylation
reaction. The MavL effector, while using macrodomain for deADP-ribosylation, features a unique motif which we
found was shared by a group of previously uncharacterized proteins in the DUF4804 family of the Pfam database.
Such a motif appears to confer residue-level selectivity for arginine de-ADP ribosylation, a novel aspect of
macrodomain function. We seek to provide structural basis of ADPR-Ub recognition, while elucidating the basis
of arginine selectivity across the newly found MavL-like enzymes. Collectively, our study will reveal a novel
mechanism for AMPylation, that appears to be employed by a large family of toxins of unknown function from
diverse pathogens, while expanding the scope of macrodomain hydrolases."
10898801,"ABSTRACT
Modern immunotherapies have had a broad impact in clinical oncology. CAR T cell therapy has been dramatically
successful against certain hematologic malignancies, and ‘immune checkpoint blockade’ targeting the PD-1/PD-
L1 pathway or other T cell inhibitory pathways has proven to be an effective treatment for advanced solid tumors
in a subset of patients. On the other hand, CAR T cell therapy has had only limited success against solid tumors,
and many patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade either do not respond or experience tumor
recurrence. One shared factor limiting the ability of these treatments to control cancer is that tumor-infiltrating T
cells become ‘exhausted’. We need to understand immune cell exhaustion at a molecular level, both in mouse
models and in humans, in order to design therapies that will be more effective at eradicating the original tumor
and in fostering the development of tumor-specific memory cells that will prevent a recurrence.
We discovered some years ago that the transcription factor NFAT— classically a main driver of T cell effector
responses— also initiates T cell exhaustion. T cell receptor stimulation paired with effective costimulation
activates NFAT and its transcriptional partner AP1, and drives the effector response. However, NFAT
simultaneously activates a separate cell-intrinsic program that damps down T cell responses, with the relative
strength of the two transcriptional programs depending on the context. In tumors, the hyporesponsiveness
program is favored, leading to T cell exhaustion. We recently identified TOX- and NR4A-family transcription
factors as genes induced by NFAT that cooperate with NFAT to further the exhaustion program. It has been
thought that exhaustion is a gradual process, but in fact we have demonstrated that TOX mRNA and TOX
protein— along with other markers of exhaustion— are sharply induced in tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells
almost immediately when they encounter a tumor. This means that CAR T cells or expanded tumor antigen-
specific T cells are immediately at risk when they are infused into a patient, perhaps explaining the requirement
for transferring large numbers of cells, and accounting in part for the limited success of the therapies.
Here, we plan to address the fundamental transcriptional mechanisms controlling the onset of exhaustion, as a
background for eventually circumventing this problem in the clinic. In Aim 1, we will define the ensemble of
transcription factors and, by extension, the cellular signalling pathways that drive TOX expression and lead to
exhaustion. In Aim 2, we will probe how TOX then furthers the exhaustion program by directly controlling key
exhaustion-specific genes. In Aim 3, we will address the very practical question whether TOX protein levels in
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes can be titrated to prevent or reverse exhaustion, taking an approach that could in
principle be developed further for clinical use.
Our results will contribute to a broad mechanistic understanding of key transcriptional mechanisms operating in
mouse and human tumor-infiltrating T cells."
10901939,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Recombinant interferon-alpha (IFN) remains a highly effective therapy for patients with myeloproliferative
neoplasms (MPN). We recently identified that patients with CALR-mutated MPN frequently exhibit normalization
of blood counts (i.e. clinical response), but often do not exhibit a decrease in tumor burden (i.e. molecular
response), providing an informative model to decipher the mechanisms of therapy-resistance to IFN.
Interrogating the molecular impact of IFN on human MPN stem cells may reveal critical insights into mechanisms
of therapy-resistance. Thus, we applied our innovative Genotyping of Transcriptomes (GoT) platform – that
captures the mutation status and single-cell whole transcriptomes (scRNA-seq) within the same cells – CD34+
cells from serial bone marrow (BM) aspirates from patients with CALR-mutated MPN treated with IFN. Strikingly,
we observed that IFN caused major shifts in the differentiation landscapes, distinctly in the mutated and wildtype
progenitors: IFN exposure on wildtype cells resulted in a large expansion of lymphoid progenitors, while the
mutated cells, in contrast, displayed an expansion of the granulo-monocytic (GM) progenitors (with a less striking
expansion of the lymphoid compartment). Our preliminary data indicate that (1) the GM differentiation bias of
CALR-mutated stem cells may underlie therapy-resistance, and that (2) the CALR-mutation induced UPR may
prime the mutated stem cells toward the GM lineage and play a role in therapy-resistance. To interrogate these
hypotheses, we will determine the transcription factor (TF) networks that govern the IFN-induced differentiation
shifts by applying a novel single-cell multi-omics platform that captures RNA-seq, chromatin accessibility and
somatic genotyping within the same thousands of single cells (GoT-ATAC) to the same IFN-treated cohort (Aim
1a), and by targeting these TF networks in mouse models (Aim 1b). We will define the role of UPR in therapy-
resistance in treated CALR-mutated cells through GoT-ATAC and chromatin binding assays (Aim 2a) and by
assessing perturbations to the UPR pathways in mouse models (Aim 2b). Finally, we will determine the impact
of co-mutations in DNMT3A or ASXL1 in therapy-resistance to IFN in CALR-mutated MPN via application of
single-cell multi-omics platforms to clinical samples (Aim 3a) and interrogation of IFN effects on novel mouse
models with double mutations (Aim 3b). The project is centered on a conceptually innovative framework in which
we superimpose neoplastic and normal hematopoietic development within the same individuals to define how
therapy reshapes differentiation topographies, as a function of mutation status and cell identity. This conceptual
innovation is enabled by technical innovations in single-cell multi-omics platforms applied to compelling clinical
cohorts, coupled with functional assessments in novel mouse models. These studies have the potential to
uncover new insights into the mechanisms of molecular resistance to IFN in MPN, resulting in novel therapeutic
approaches."
10865031,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Rotavirus (RV) is the leading cause of diarrhea-associated morbidity and mortality in children younger
than five worldwide. While RV vaccines have substantially decreased RV deaths, children in low- and middle-
income countries remain at risk of life-threatening RV disease because of significantly lower vaccine
effectiveness compared to high-income countries. We recently identified a potential role for Enterovirus B (EV-
B) infection in reducing oral RV vaccine (ORV) performance. Specifically, EV-B infection at the time of
vaccination is associated with a lack of seroconversion to ORV in a cohort of infants from Ghana. However, the
signaling pathways and mechanisms associated with this interference have not yet been defined. We
hypothesize that EV-Bs induce epithelial-derived antiviral cytokines to limit both ORV replication and anti-RV
immune responses.
 Determination of the mechanisms underlying EV-B-mediated interference with ORV will leverage
complementary analyses in ex vivo human intestinal organoids, in vivo mouse models, and non-invasive fecal
analyses from a human clinical trial cohort of infants receiving RV vaccines. Representative EV-B strains
consistent with those identified in the Ghanaian infant cohort and which are prevalent in countries with reduced
vaccine efficacy have been selected for these studies. We will interrogate the innate antiviral signaling pathways
induced by EV-B infection, as well as test whether they are required to limit ORV or RV replication, in both
pediatric human organoids, including isogenic lines where key innate immune genes are knocked-out, and wild-
type, transgenic or knock-out mouse lines. EV-B co-infection effects on development of adaptive immune
responses to RV will also be evaluated in murine models. Additionally, fecal samples from an ongoing clinical
trial evaluating ORV and non-replicating RV vaccine clinical efficacy will be used to validate EV-B interference
with ORV, define EV-B-associated antiviral cytokines, and assess whether EV-B also interferes with non-
replicating RV vaccines. We have assembled a team of investigators with extensive expertise in the experimental
RV systems, clinical vaccinology, and virome analyses required to define the molecular mechanisms underlying
the important and persistent clinical challenge of low ORV performance in low- and middle-income countries.
 Completion of this proposal will provide key insights into EV-B-mediated interference with ORV, as well
as broadly into virus-virus interactions in the intestinal environment and their consequences for development of
immune responses. By identifying key factors that regulate vaccine responsiveness, we aim to facilitate
development and testing of evidence-based interventions to improve RV vaccine performance."

Hedgehog (Hh) signaling specifies the embryonic tissue pattern of many metazoan organs and maintains this
tissue pattern post-embryonically by regulating the expression of proliferation- or differentiation-inducing signals
that target adult tissue stem or progenitor cells. Drugs developed to block Hh pathway activity, based on our
previous work, have received FDA approval for treatment of ectodermally-derived cancers, such as basal cell
carcinoma. In pancreatic, bladder, and other cancers of endodermal origin, Hh pathway activity in tumor-
associated stroma presents a barrier to tumor growth and progression, thus suggesting pathway activation rather
than inhibition as a therapeutic approach. In addition, pathway activation has a beneficial regenerative role in
bone and muscle repair, in reducing pathology associated with inflammatory bowel disease, and in preventing
or ameliorating injury and breach of the blood-brain-barrier, among other emerging biological activities. On the
other hand, chronic low-level elevation of pathway activity in the lung, as is associated with reduced expression
of the Hh pathway inhibitor Hhip (Hh-interacting protein), is genetically linked to chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD), the third leading cause of death worldwide.
 During the previous funding period for this project we utilized protein structure determination and biochemical
and cell biological approaches to establish the molecular mechanism of Hh signaling, in which Hh binding to its
receptor Patched1 (Ptch1) activates the pathway by alleviating Ptch1-mediated suppression of the essential
transducer and GPCR family member, Smoothened (Smo). We found that cholesterol is the crucial link between
Ptch1 and Smo, that cholesterol in the inner leaflet of the membrane is decreased by Ptch1 transport activity,
and that Hh binding to Ptch1 blocks this transport activity. These events critically regulate pathway activity, as
conformational switching of Smo to its active state requires entry and binding of a sterol from the inner leaflet of
the membrane into a central cavity within the Smoothened seven-transmembrane bundle. We also showed how
the Dispatched1 (Disp1) transporter, structurally related to Ptch1, uses Na+ flux to power its export and packaging
of the dually lipid modified Sonic hedgehog protein signal (ShhNp), enabling it to move through tissues as a
soluble morphogen in complex with its carrier Scube2. We propose here to deepen our understanding of Hh
signal transduction and pathway regulation by establishing the energy sources and the step-by-step lipid-
handling mechanisms of the Ptch1 and Disp1 transporters. We will determine the structure of the ShhNp:Scube2
morphogen, and the mechanism of its release from Disp1. Finally we plan to elucidate the mechanism of Hh
signal antagonism by Hhip, using cryo-EM to determine the high-resolution structure and functionally dissect a
membrane-associated tent-like Hhip multimeric complex that occludes all receptor-interacting surfaces of the Hh
protein. Our findings may provide a basis for new approaches to therapeutic modulation of Hh pathway activity."

In the clinic, primary breast tumors are usually surgically removed soon after diagnosis, often leaving patients
“tumor-free”. However, 20-40% of breast cancer survivors will eventually suffer metastasis to distant organs,
sometimes years after surgeries. Bone metastasis is the most frequently occurring metastasis of breast cancer.
Our long-term goals are to elucidate the biology underlying the survival and progression of bone metastases,
which will inform the design of therapeutic strategies against these latent tumor cells, through a fruitful
collaboration between labs at Rice University and Baylor College of Medicine. The overall goal of this proposal
is to develop bone tumor-targeting epigenetic inhibitors and demonstrate their efficacy against bone
micrometastases as well as further multi-organ metastases seeding from bone lesions. Our preliminary data
establish that: (1) epigenetic inhibitors modified with bisphosphonates, have superb binding affinity for bone, and
exhibit enhanced bone metastasis sites targeting in vivo; and (2) epigenetic inhibitors modified with
bisphosphonates exhibited improved activities for inhibiting metastatic seeding from bone lesions to other
organs; and (3) an intra-iliac artery (IIA) injection, developed in our lab, can be used to effectively model the
bone metastatic niche, providing a powerful platform for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy against bone
metastatic cancers and “metastasis-to-metastasis” seeding from bone lesions. Based on these results, the first
research direction will focus on engineering current epigenetic inhibitors for breast cancer therapy with bone-
homing moiety. Next, we will study their effects on the survival and progression of breast cancer bone metastases
using both syngeneic and xenograft nude mouse models. Furthermore, we will dissect the molecular
mechanisms underlying the benefits of bone tumor-targeting epigenetic inhibitors. An enhanced therapeutic
profile for these bone-specific epigenetic inhibitors on breast cancer will inform the extension of these treatments
to other bone cancers and diseases."
10917297,"Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a deadly disease with the median survival of DIPG patients less than
one year after diagnosis. DIPG tumors initiate from the pons and midline of brain, and spread to other brain
regions where they mingle with normal cells such as neurons. Recently, it has been shown that neurons promote
proliferation and invasion of DIPG cells. However, it is largely unknown how the intrinsic gene expression
program of DIPG cells is regulated for their interactions with neurons. Furthermore, currently there are no
effective treatments for DIPG patients. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the molecular basis of
pathogenesis of DIPG and to identify novel drug targets for this deadly disease. About 80% DIPG tumors contain
somatic mutations at genes encoding canonical histone H3 (H3.1) or its variant (H3.3), resulting in replacement
of histone H3 lysine 27 with methionine (H3K27M). We found that expression of either H3.1K27M or H3.3K27M
proteins leads to a global reduction of di- and tri-methylation (H3K27me2/me3) on wild type histone H3.
H3K27me2/me3 marks are catalyzed by the PRC2 complex with Ezh2 as the catalytic subunit, and play important
roles in gene silencing. However, H3.1K27M and H3.3K27M DIPG tumors show distinct gene expression
signatures and are associated with distinct driver genetic mutations. We hypothesize that epigenome
reprograming by H3.1K27M and H3.3K27M creates a dependence of DIPG tumor cells on other chromatin
regulators. To test this hypothesis, we performed CRISPR/Cas9 screens and found that Brg1(brahma-related
gene 1 or called SMACAR4), the catalytic subunit of mammalian SWI/SNF (mSWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling
complexes, and Ezh2, are among top hits. The identification of Ezh2 is expected as we and others have shown
that Ezh2 and H3K27me2/me3 are needed to silence tumor suppressor genes in DIPG cells. However, it was
not known whether Brg1 has any roles in DIPG. Our results support the hypothesis that Brg1 functions as the
catalytic subunit of DIPG-specific mSWI/SNF complexes to control the gene expression and fitness of DIPG
cells. Furthermore, in H3.3K27M DIPG cells, transcription factor SOX10 recruits Brg1 to regulate the expression
of genes involved in cell growth, extracellular matrix and neural development. Based on these exciting
observations, we will 1) identify genes whose expression is regulated by Brg1 directly H3.1K27M DIPG cells; 2)
evaluate genetic and epigenetic changes in H3.1K27M DIPG cells that render these cells depends on Brg1; 3)
test the hypothesis that Brg1 and its target genes involved in neural development contribute to the neuron-glioma
interactions of H3.3K27M DIPG cells; 4) identify other subunits of mSWI/SNF complexes that work with Brg1 to
control gene expression and fitness of DIPG cells; and 5) test the hypothesis that inhibition of Brg1 alone and in
combination with Ezh2 inhibition impede the growth of DIPG tumors using patient derived xenograft mouse
models. Together, these studies will not only provide molecular insight into how epigenomic re-writing by
H3K27M mutant proteins promotes tumorigenesis, but also identify drug targets for this deadly disease."

Lissencephaly is a rare developmental disorder characterized by absence or simplification of brain convolutions. With no
available cure, it leads to significant health burden of developmental delay, intellectual disability, and seizures. While
introduction of next-generation DNA sequencing offered unprecedented opportunities for gene discovery in human
disorders, leading to the identification of an array of lissencephaly-associated genes, approximately a fifth of patients
with lissencephaly still lack genetic diagnosis. Gene discovery in Mendelian disorders is hampered by locus and
phenotypic heterogeneity and thus, a systems-level analysis complemented with mechanistic characterization of
candidate variants is warranted. In the past decade and a half, we have identified and functionally characterized multiple
genes whose disruption is associated with malformations of the human cerebral cortex. We propose to utilize patient-
derived stem cell and embryonic mouse models to characterize the role of the PIDDosome protein complex in human
brain development and understand how its malfunction can cause lissencephaly. We also propose to perform gene-
burden and co-expression analyses to inform characterization of novel genes and pathways involved in lissencephaly
through modeling in organoids. We will use patient and control keratinocytes to generate induced pluripotent stem cells
and 2D and 3D neural derivatives to define the molecular and cellular consequences of PIDD1 mutations, accompanied
by in vivo mouse models of PIDD1 loss during neurodevelopment. We will perform gene network-based analysis of
human brain development and mutation burden analysis at the gene and pathway level of 120 lissencephaly patients
with available whole-exome sequencing data to identify and prioritize novel causal genes for lissencephaly. Our multi-
faceted approach is expected to reveal shared molecular pathways and affected cell types that are perturbed during
human fetal neurodevelopment leading to the onset of lissencephaly in a genetically heterogenous background, also
providing an analytical framework for variant prioritization in large-scale genomic investigation of human disorders."

tissue in the body, MYC is the only Yamanaka factor induced by exercise. MYC also becomes less responsive
to exercise with advancing age. The purpose of this proposal is to examine the role that MYC plays in skeletal
muscle functional, metabolic, cellular, and molecular plasticity throughout the lifespan. To answer our research
questions, we developed a mouse model that allows for pulsatile control of MYC specifically in skeletal muscle
fibers simultaneous with fluorescent labeling of muscle fiber nuclei (myonuclei) for purification and downstream
analyses. We also developed a novel murine model of voluntary exercise for aged mice. We will perform: 1)
functional, bioenergetic, and cellular analyses, 2) single myonuclear RNA-sequencing, and 3) global DNA
methylation and methylation clock analyses in myonuclei after weekly pulsatile MYC induction and exercise
throughout the lifespan. We hypothesize that MYC induction in muscle will mimic functional and cellular
aspects of exercise adaptation throughout the lifespan and amplify the effects of exercise training. MYC will
mediate youthfulness at several molecular levels, including biological aging determined by DNA methylation
“clock” age. Furthemore, we hypothesize that MYC induction late in life is sufficient to reverse molecular and
cellular aspects of muscle aging. Our experiments will provide fundamental information on the role of MYC in
skeletal muscle and its capacity for epigenetic and transcriptional age reversal in myonuclei. We expect that
our innovative approaches and comprehensive hypothesis-driven -omics analyses will serve as a foundation
for understanding skeletal muscle mass regulation with aging, and provide new directions for exploring what
mediates the age-defying effects of exercise."

Cancers require metabolic adaptations to support the unbridled proliferation that drives tumor growth. Mutations
in the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) are observed in many cancers, but the role of these mutations in shaping
cellular metabolism and tumor growth is incompletely understood. mtDNA mutations that impair components of
the electron transport chain (ETC) appear to be selected against in most forms of cancer. Hürthle cell carcinoma
of the thyroid (HTC) is clinically aggressive cancer uniquely enriched for loss-of-function mtDNA mutations in
components of complex I of the ETC. We propose that HTC represents an ideal disease outlier in which to
interrogate the role of mtDNA alterations and ETC function in cancer. In this proposal, we employ unique and
highly complementary approaches to characterize the metabolic impact of mtDNA mutations in HTC and other
forms of thyroid and kidney cancer. First, we have developed a clinical protocol to monitor central carbon directly
in surgical patients using stable isotope tracing (Aim 1). Second, we have identified a synthetic lethal interaction
encoded by complex I mutation and identified a promising small molecule therapeutic using patient-derived
models (Aim 2). Finally, we have developed novel GEMMs from which to interrogate the role of complex I
function in thyroid tumorigenesis (Aim 3). These approaches are highly complementary and synergistic, yet
each is independently poised to bridge key knowledge gaps and lead to new insights into metabolic regulation
in cancer. The overall goals of this proposal are to characterize the metabolic adaptations necessitated by
complex I loss in HTC directly in patients undergoing thyroid surgery, to identify and target metabolic liabilities
as a result of metabolic re-wiring downstream of complex I loss, and to determine whether complex I loss acts
to promote or alter thyroid tumor formation in mice. These findings will be of immediate and direct relevance to
thyroid cancer patients, provide new insights relevant to other tumors harboring mtDNA mutations and have
broad implications across cancer types by providing new insights into ETC function in cancer."
10898068,"Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare, chronic, inflammatory disorder that presents with painful skin ulcers. It
causes disfiguration, negatively impacts quality of life, and increases mortality. Despite being a disease with
significant physical and psychological impact, it remains understudied. The paucity of clinical research in the
field is likely due to challenges in diagnosis and unknown treatment outcomes. Misdiagnosis, which is reported
in up to 39% of patients, has been one of the main obstacles to proper implementation and enrollment in clinical
trials. Because molecular diagnostics remain years away, researchers rely on clinical criteria for diagnosis. Three
diagnostic frameworks exist based on clinical findings, however they are not widely applied or accepted.
Moreover, the mainstay of treatment for PG is immunosuppression. Monotherapy with systemic corticosteroids
or cyclosporine is the classical initial treatment, and only a few clinical trials have evaluated the effectiveness
and safety of new therapeutic alternatives such as biologics. Further, combination or concomitant therapy of
classic immunosuppression and biologics has been adopted as a new standard of care without high-quality data.
Current therapeutic approaches are based on expert opinion guidelines creating additional difficulty in
implementing clinical trials and hampering the FDA approval process of potential drugs.
Our proposal aligns with the overall long-term goals of our research group: to drive diagnostic and therapeutic
innovation in the field of PG – a significantly understudied disease with an increased healthcare burden. Our
short-term goals include: 1) to establish which diagnostic framework best performs in a multi-institutional
collaborative study, supporting its applicability in medical practice and clinical trials, and 2) to analyze current
treatment outcomes in clinical practice. We seek to accomplish our short-term goals utilizing the following specific
aims: Aim 1) compare and assess the three diagnostic frameworks in a multi-center prospective study of a well-
defined cohort of patients diagnosed with PG and PG-like conditions to determine their performance in diagnosis,
and Aim 2) determine the effectiveness of real-world therapeutic approaches currently used as standard of care
in a multi-center cohort of patients with PG.
Our established PG research team at OHSU has the ability to implement a multi-institutional collaborative effort
to ensure the success of this proposal. Collectively, the results of this project will fill the diagnostic and therapeutic
gaps in knowledge and define the current landscape of PG in the United States."
10888413,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The extensive changes in phenotype and function observed in T cells upon activation are intimately linked to
changes in cellular metabolism. The failure to engage specific and appropriate metabolic programs can impair
or alter T cells, and thus lead to ineffective, or even overexuberant, immune responses. Central to metabolism
are mitochondria, which serve as central hubs of energy generation and biosynthetic activity. Work from our
group and others has provided mechanistic insights into how mitochondrial metabolism is critical to T cell
differentiation and function. However, knowledge about why these organelles change shape to maintain
metabolism, biosynthetic capacity, and function, and in what ways mitochondrial remodeling influences T cell
activation, differentiation, or effector molecule expression is lacking. Investigating how dynamic changes in
mitochondria regulate metabolism to impact CD4+ T cells will enhance our fundamental understanding of
immunobiology and of how to manipulate these cells for disease therapy in the context of cancer, infection, and
autoimmunity. In our initial experiments we found that unlike other Th cell subsets, Th17 cells, a cell type
necessary for maintaining gut homeostasis and implicated in certain types of autoimmunity and inflammation,
had elongated mitochondria in a fused network, as well as tight cristae morphology. These results suggested a
differential role for mitochondrial fusion and the protein OPA1, which mediates both membrane fusion and cristae
morphology, in these cells. OPA1 deletion had no discernible effect on Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation or cytokine
production in vitro, and while Th17 cell differentiation was also unimpaired, IL-17 expression was drastically
reduced. Further, mice with a T cell-specific OPA1 deletion were resistant to developing pathology in
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a Th17 cell-mediated autoimmune disease of the central
nervous system. Finally, our data revealed a role for liver kinase B1 (LKB1) in regulating the cellular response
to OPA1-deficiency, and in restraining Th17 cell IL-17 expression when mitochondrial fusion is perturbed. In this
proposal we now seek to understand how mitochondrial dynamics influence the function of diverse CD4+ T cell
subsets. Our overall goal is to dissect the function of OPA1 in Th17 cell effector function, as well as probe its
potential role other CD4+ T cell subsets, and to determine how MM fusion interfaces with LKB1 signaling to
modulate cellular metabolism to limit IL-17 expression in settings of mitochondrial disruption or stress in vitro
and in vivo. To this end, we propose to 1) explore the role of mitochondrial dynamics in CD4+ Th cells, 2)
determine the extent to which LKB1 controls the cellular response to OPA1-deficiency in Th17 cells, and 3)
investigate how metabolic changes upon disrupting mitochondrial fusion lead to dampened Th17 cell function."
10841719,"Sudden cardiac arrest (CA) is a leading cause of death. Despite advances in cardiopulmonary resuscitation
(CPR) methods, only 10-20% of adult CA victims survive to hospital discharge. Neurologic injury is the main
cause of death and reason to withdraw care in patients who initially achieve return of spontaneous circulation
(ROSC) after CA. Although mild hypothermia has been widely adopted to improve neurologic recovery after
ROSC, recent evidence refuted its efficacy leading to a new guideline that does not recommend hypothermia
any longer. Because majority of comatose post-CA patients are sedated regardless of temperature management,
precise impact of sedation on post-CA neurologic recovery is unknown. Studies excluding post-CA patients
suggest that sedation provides very poor sleep quality, leading to a significant push to minimize sedation in ICU.
On the other hand, post-CA sedation may exert neuroprotective effects. Cerebrovascular dysregulation is a
common feature of post-CA encephalopathy and associated with poor outcomes. Sedation may normalize
cerebral metabolism by concurrently modulating energy demand and cerebral blood flow (CBF) after CA. Further
studies are needed to elucidate the role of sedation on neurologic recovery after CA. Quantitative
electroencephalogram (EEG) is widely used for post-CA neuroprognostication. Recent studies showed that
induction of slow-wave activities on EEG by propofol early after ROSC is associated with favorable neurologic
outcomes in post-CA patients. Anesthesia-activated neurons (AANs) in hypothalamus are activated by diverse
classes of anesthetic agents to produce slow-delta oscillations. However, physiological role of slow-wave
oscillation, especially in post-ischemic brain, is unknown. In recently published studies related to this proposal,
we evaluated the effects of sedation on outcomes after CA in hypothermia (33°C)-treated mice. We observed
that, compared to hypothermia without sedation after CA, hypothermia with sedation with an intravenous infusion
of propofol or dexmedetomidine (DEX) attenuated cerebral hyperemia, induced higher slow wave EEG power
after ROSC, and improved neurological outcomes and survival in male and female mice. In new preliminary
studies, post-CA sedation with ketamine infusion failed to improve survival, whereas chemogenetic activation of
AANs after ROSC induced slow wave sleep and tended to improve survival rates in mice. Based on these results,
we hypothesize that post-CA sedation during hypothermia improves neurological recovery after CA by promoting
electrophysiological recovery and preventing dysregulation of cerebrovascular function and metabolism. To
address this hypothesis, specifically, we propose to determine the effects of post-CA sedation with propofol or
dexmedetomidine during normothermia, to characterize the effects of post-CA sedation with ketamine on
neurologic outcomes, and to elucidate the role of slow-wave oscillation in the neuroprotective effects of post-CA
sedation. While most post-CA patients are sedated, how sedation alters neurologic outcomes remains largely
unknown. The proposed studies will fill the knowledge gap and seek to optimize sedation in post-CA care."
10920416,"Background: People diagnosed with diabetes are initially advised on lifestyle changes and started on
metformin, but often require the addition of 2nd line antihyperglycemic medications. The choice of 2nd line
antihyperglycemic therapy is complex because the multiple available drugs, distributed across several drug
classes, have different benefits and risks. Newer 2nd line antihyperglycemics (sodium-glucose co-transporter-2
inhibitor (SGLT2i), and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP1)) have been shown to reduce risk of
cardiovascular events compared to placebo in individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease. Evidence also
suggests that these newer agents may reduce risk of kidney disease in people with relatively preserved kidney
function. Whether the newer agents offer benefits in cardiovascular and kidney outcomes compared to older
(less costly) 2nd line agents including dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4) and sulfonylureas, and whether
these benefits extend to individuals with intermediate or low cardiovascular risk and people with reduced
kidney function is not known.
Significance/Impact: Results will provide real-world evidence to guide the selection of antihyperglycemic
agents by cardiovascular risk status, kidney function category, and will provide evidence on the risk of adverse
events. The proposal falls under several Health Services Research priorities including Primary Care
Practice (diabetes is highly prevalent in veterans) and Health Care Informatics (using big data to advance
care of veterans); and Office of Research & Development priorities as our approach will highlight VA data
as a national resource and the results will have direct and substantial real-world impact in informing care.
Innovation: The proposal will leverage the power of the VA’s large-scale electronic health records and recent
methodologic innovations in causal inference and pharmacoepidemiology — specifically in the use of real-
world observational data to emulate a target randomized trial — to provide much needed evidence of the
comparative effectiveness and safety of newer vs. older antihyperglycemic agents.
Specific Aims: To use observational healthcare data from the Department of Veterans Affairs to emulate four-
arm randomized trials of the comparative effectiveness of incident use of newer (SGLT2i, GLP1) and older
(DPP4, sulfonylureas) 2nd line antihyperglycemics—among metformin users—on cardiovascular
outcomes (aim 1), kidney outcomes (aim 2), and evaluate the risk of adverse events associated with these
drug classes (aim 3).
Methodologies: For each specific aim we will define a target randomized trial protocol, including eligibility
criteria, treatment assignment, treatment initiation, treatment strategy follow-up, outcome assessment, and
analytic plan. We then will use electronic medical record data from the VA to construct aim-specific cohorts to
emulate the specifications of the target trial for the related aim, estimating the differences in risk of
cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and adverse events between the studied antihyperglycemics.
Randomization will be emulated by inverse probability of treatment weighting based on predefined variables
and a high dimensional variable selection algorithm. Intention-to-treat effects will be estimated using discrete
time survival analyses, and adjusted intention-to-treat-effects will be estimated after accounting for loss to
follow-up. Per-protocol effects (of a specified treatment strategy) will be estimated after accounting for non-
adherence to assigned treatment strategies. Differences in risk of outcomes between the second-line
antihyperglycemics will be reported as hazard ratios and adjusted incidence rates.
Implementation/Next Steps: The results from this proposal will inform clinical practice guidelines for the
treatment of diabetes. Future studies will leverage advances in machine learning to create unique
individualized precision care plans for each person with diabetes."
10739822,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Infection with non-typhoidal Salmonella is a significant cause of diarrheal disease worldwide, causing
approximately 150 million illnesses and 60,000 deaths each year. In the gastrointestinal tract, S. Tm encounters
the resident commensal bacteria (gut microbiota). The gut microbiota protects the host against invading
pathogens (colonization resistance) and limits pathogen expansion. Propionate, a short-chain fatty acid
produced by members of the gut microbiota, is predicted to mediate colonization resistance against S. Tm by
down-regulating invasion and inhibiting growth. As a successful pathogen, S. Tm may possess mechanisms to
mitigate the toxic effects of propionate. Discovery of the prpBCDE operon, which enables S. Tm to metabolize
propionate into pyruvate, provided initial insight into the ability of S. Tm to overcome propionate inhibition.
However, it remains unknown under what conditions S. Tm uses the prpBCDE operon to eliminate intracellular
propionate. During infection, the host's inflammatory response provides electron acceptors that allow S. Tm to
metabolize diverse nutrients into carbon sources to support pathogen growth. My data suggests that propionate
serves as a carbon source for S. Tm, specifically during anaerobic respiration when inflammation-derived
electron acceptors are present. In preliminary experiments, I determined that inflammation-derived electron
acceptors also alter propionate-dependent changes in expression of S. Tm invasion machinery. Thus,
inflammation-derived electron acceptors may provide S. Tm with the opportunity to eliminate the inhibitory effects
of propionate and fuel growth during infection. Indeed, my pilot studies demonstrate that propionate metabolism
benefits S. Tm in vivo as a wildtype strain of S. Tm had a growth advantage over a prpC mutant strain in mouse
models of S. Tm gastroenteritis. Therefore, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that S. Tm metabolizes
propionate in the inflamed gut to regulate its invasion and support its luminal growth, ultimately allowing this
pathogen to overcome propionate-dependent colonization resistance. To test this hypothesis, I will use an
innovative combination of commensal members of the gut microbiota and S. Tm mutant strains along with germ-
free and conventional mouse models to explore how S. Tm contends with propionate during infection.
Experiments proposed in Aim 1 will determine if propionate serves as a carbon source to fuel S. Tm growth in
vitro and in vivo. In Aim 2, I will identify if gut inflammation and anaerobic respiration are required for propionate
metabolism to be beneficial to S. Tm during infection. Aim 3 will investigate if propionate metabolism not only
fuels growth by providing a carbon source during respiration but by signaling to S. Tm to decrease invasion. If
successful, this research will challenge the dogma that short-chain fatty acids inhibit Salmonella growth in the
gut. This project will describe how S. Tm mitigates the detrimental effects of propionate by metabolizing this
metabolite into a usable carbon source to fuel growth. Expected findings will provide a deeper understanding of
a novel mechanism used by this bacterial pathogen to evade the intestinal microbiota and establish infection."

This proposal describes a five-year career development program to prepare Dr. Ilanit Itzhaki for a career as an
independent investigator. This program will build on Dr. Itzhaki's background as a stem cell biologist and
experimental electrophysiologist by enhancing her knowledge base in sex hormones in cardiovascular health
and disease and providing her expertise in molecular cardiology and medicinal chemistry for translational
research in drug discovery and sex-specific therapeutics. Dr. Itzhaki will be mentored by Dr. Joseph Wu,
Director of the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute. The proposed mentor is an expert in stem cell biology,
pharmacogenomics, and drug discovery utilizing iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). To complement
Dr. Wu's mentorship, Dr. Itzhaki will be co-mentored by Dr. Marcia Stefanick, Director of the Stanford Women
& Sex Differences in Medicine Center, and an expert in the field of sex hormones and cardiovascular health
and disease. The K99 phase of Dr. Itzhaki's training will consist of structured mentorship by the primary mentor
and co-mentor, complementary meetings with the advisory committee, formal coursework, a provocative
research project, and a program for career transition. For symptomatic long QT syndrome (LQTS) patients
prone to life threatening cardiac arrhythmia, pregnancy can facilitate a unique period of anti-arrhythmic
protection, when estrogen hormone level is at its highest. Deciphering the anti-arrhythmic contribution of
estrogen can lead to the identification of much-needed new anti-arrhythmic therapeutic targets and the design
of novel therapeutic entities. In the K99 phase of this proposal, Dr. Itzhaki will assess the effect of estrogen on
arrhythmic propensity using female and male LQT patient-specific iPSC-CMs at the single cell and multicellular
levels (Aim 1). Dr. Itzhaki will then identify mechanistic intracellular targets that facilitate estrogen's anti-
arrhythmic benefit (Aim 2). The identified beneficial antiarrhythmic targets, will help guide Dr. Itzhaki in the R00
phase, in the design of an estrogen analogue, which will be assessed for sustained anti-arrhythmic benefits
and absence of cardiotoxicity (Aim 3), with the intention of proposing new therapeutic entities that take
advantage of hormone-based anti-arrhythmic benefits, yet at the same time allow the treatment of both male
and female patients at all ages. Collectively, the insights acquired from Dr. Itzhaki's proposal can contribute
significantly to the treatment of LQTS patients, specifically, and arrhythmia-susceptible congenital disease
patients, in general, and promote the growing field of sex-specific therapeutics. Furthermore, using iPSC-CMs
as a ""dish-to-bedside"" approach, to aid in the design of anti-arrhythmic therapeutic analogues and to serve as
a high-throughput analogue-screening platform, will greatly contribute to the prospect of translational medicine.
Finally, this work will provide a foundation for future studies using iPSC-CMs, as a human based patient- and
disease-specific model, to interrogate the effect of sex hormones on cardiac arrhythmic propensity, to be
eventually carried out by Dr. Itzhaki as an independent investigator.

10778589,"Project Summary / Abstract
Decision-making requires populations of neurons in the brain to collectively process sensory evidence and select
appropriate behavioral responses. Neural population dynamics (NPDs), which describe how the responses of a
population of individual neurons unfold over time, can provide an insightful view into these decision processes.
Much is known about how individual neurons respond in select decision making tasks. However, little is known
about how populations of neurons dynamically perform decision computations, and how resulting NPDs within a
brain area are structured across many decision-making tasks. Shared features in NPDs across many tasks could
indicate unifying neural mechanisms of computation that underlie the multi-functionality of a given neural circuit.
This proposal aims to uncover the details and structure of these decision-related NPDs in human and nonhuman
primate dorsal premotor cortex, an area tightly linked to both the function and dysfunction of decision making.
Particular attention will be devoted to examining how NPDs are organized across multiple decision-making tasks
and how those NPDs emerge during learning of new tasks. During the K99 phase, novel analytical tools will be
developed for extracting NPDs from simultaneously recorded neural population activity and, importantly, for
providing interpretable links between NPDs and their role in decision-related neural computation. With the goal
of identifying unifying principles of decision-related computation, large-scale analyses will then integrate existing
and newly collected neurophysiological datasets involving multiple decision-making tasks performed by humans
and nonhuman primates. During the R00 phase, the proposed research will pivot toward understanding how
NPDs emerge during learning to make new types of decisions. The proposal postulates that the ease, speed,
and efficacy of learning all hinge on the extent by which critical neural circuits can leverage pre-existing neural
mechanisms of computation. These concepts will be tested in collaborative human and nonhuman primate neu-
rophysiological experiments, with guidance provided by interrogations of artificial neural networks posed with
similar decision-related learning tasks. Upon completion, the proposed research will provide new fundamental
knowledge concerning i) the multi-functional and adaptive role of premotor cortex across many decision-making
tasks and ii) unifying principles of neural computation that support this flexibility. Better understanding decision-
related circuits and their neural mechanisms could ultimately elucidate the basis for the numerous psychiatric
disorders that impair decision making, which could eventually lead to improved diagnosis and treatment of these
debilitating conditions."

Risk-stratified breast cancer screening strategies are a paradigm shift from the one-size-fits-all screening
approach. Previous age-based screening strategies proved to be disadvantageous to specific high-risk
populations, particularly BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers and individuals of African ancestry at high risk for
aggressive young onset interval breast cancers. There is an unmet clinical need to identify women who are at
high risk of aggressive interval breast cancer that would have a poorer outcome without intensive surveillance.
Since joining the Women informed to screen based on measures of risk (Wisdom) Study (clinicaltrials.gov:
NCT02620852) in 2020, the UChicago site has enrolled 1691 participants; 64.7% White, 23.5% Black and 6.8%
Hispanic because of our location on the south side of Chicago and highly effective recruitment efforts in
communities of Color. A growing number of studies have demonstrated the diagnostic equivalency of
abbreviated MRI to the full MRI protocol. We launched the Chicago Alternative Prevention Study
for BReast CAncer (CAPSBRACA; clinicaltrials.gov:NCT00989638) as a P20 Breast Cancer Disparities SPORE
population science project to test the hypothesis that state-of-the-art genomic testing to identify women at
increased risk, combined with state-of-the-art MRI techniques, could effectively detect and downstage
aggressive interval breast cancers, and provide a personalized approach for management of high-risk women
in diverse populations. At our single Institution, 130 genomically defined high-risk participants (mean age 42
SD+12) have been enrolled including 44 BRCA1, 42 BRCA2, 7 PALB2 and 25 with PRS >30%, suggesting
common genetic variants can identify extremely high-risk women in practice. We have demonstrated the
feasibility of our approach and the proposed study will test that it is clinically effective, adaptable, and can scale
to optimize a comprehensive surveillance program for high-risk women using the Wisdom platform. Our overall
objective is to expand to three additional sites in California to broaden the diversity of study sites and participants.
The specific aims are to: 1) Implement biannual abbreviated MRI that includes ultrafast- DCE-MRI, with
multicenter standardization; refine and expand our high-risk biannual abbreviated protocol to be fast, while both
clinically accurate and generalizable across imaging facilities; 2) perform correlative science and quantitative
analysis of MRI images and build an analysis package that can be disseminated to other centers; and 3) Develop
and evaluate self-supervised deep learning (SSL) methods using UF DCE-MRI to enable fast and accurate
computational biomarkers of breast cancer risk. CAPSBRACA translates innovative genomics and imaging
research from the laboratory into meaningful clinical interventions and has the potential to address an unmet
clinical need for early and accurate detection of aggressive young-onset breast cancers in mutation carriers. It
will impact the nearly 10,000 unscreened women in the US diagnosed each year with symptomatic breast cancer
under 40 years of age, and the thousands of screened women at high risk of aggressive interval cancers."

Stroke is a major public health problem in the United States. It is the fifth leading cause of death and a leading
cause of serious disability in adults. There are an estimated 800,000 strokes in the United States each year,
with more than 7.6 million stroke survivors. Twenty percent of stroke survivors require institutional care after 3
months and 15%-30% are permanently disabled. Stroke in adults is strongly age dependent, and the rate of
adverse outcomes and complications associated with stroke increases with advanced age. Because the United
States population is aging, the population at risk for stroke, recurrent stroke events, and other post-stroke
outcomes will increase over the coming decades. Its high prevalence, associated deficits, and adverse
outcomes impose a large burden on patients, their families, and the healthcare system. Stroke survivors are at
high risk of new diseases due to their functional disability, neurological deficits, and pre-existing cardiovascular
risk factors and comorbidities. The proposed renewal application builds on the Original R01 (Disparities in
Patterns of Recurrent Stroke in the Elderly study) to expand our extensive patient-linked surveillance database
to provide invaluable information on patterns and trends of 1-, 5-, and 10-year outcomes after ischemic stroke.
We will combine Medicare fee-for-service and Medicare Advantage administrative data for 2017 to 2024 to
accomplish the following specific aims: 1) to assess national and county-level rates and trends in 1-year
outcomes for Medicare Advantage and fee-for-service beneficiaries with ischemic stroke and describe
disparities by sociodemographic factors from 2017 to 2024; 2) to assess 5-year outcomes for Medicare
Advantage and fee-for-service beneficiaries with ischemic stroke and describe disparities by sociodemographic
factors, clinical characteristics, and geographic location from 2017 to 2024; and 3) to assess 5-year and 10-
year outcomes for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries with ischemic stroke and describe disparities by
sociodemographic factors and region from 2001 to 2024. Clinical practice, public policy, and reimbursement
decisions are increasingly informed by data obtained from administrative datasets. The proposed study will be
the largest contemporary investigation of recurrent stroke rates, post-stroke events, and long-term follow-up of
Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with ischemic stroke in the United States. Results from this project will
identify geographic areas and subgroups that have distinctive health profiles that put them at high risk for
adverse outcomes after stroke. Such information will inform care providers, insurers, public health agencies,
and policy makers about communities that may derive the greatest benefit from targeted programs and
community-based interventions."

 The study of primary atopic disorders (PADs) has provided important and surprising knowledge about
specific genes that control the function of white blood cells involved in driving allergic responses. Over the last
several years, our groups have played a leading role in the discovery and characterization of human immune
disorders linked to mutations in CARD11, which encodes a critical signaling protein in lymphocytes. CARD11
partners with two other proteins (BCL10 and MALT1) to form the “CBM complex”, which communicates key
signals that dictate lymphocyte activation, differentiation and function. Most recently, we described numerous
patients with severe eczema, asthma/food allergies, and skin/respiratory infections that carried debilitating
CARD11 mutations that disrupt normal CBM function. These variants attenuate CBM signaling in patient
lymphocytes and cause them to differentiate abnormally into effector cells associated with allergy/atopy. The
long-term objective of this project is to precisely define which cell signaling processes are disrupted
by mutations in CBM complex genes, and elucidate how these defects adversely affect B and T cell
function to ultimately manifest as in atopy, including assessment of glutamine as a potential treatment
strategy. We will also define the broader scope and burden of pathogenic CBM complex mutations that
influence atopic predisposition in both rare PADs and common cohorts of allergy disease patients.
 Built upon an extensive panel of atopy-associated, damaging mutations spanning the CARD11 gene,
and extending to other CBM gene mutations identified from allergic patient cohorts, our studies will better
define how these mutations disrupt normal CBM-dependent signaling pathways in lymphocytes. Using well-
established cell transfection systems AND primary murine and patient cells, we will elucidate the molecular and
cellular mechanisms through which impaired CARD11 signaling drives the preferential production of allergy-
associated cytokines and IgE. Based on compelling preliminary data, our analyses will pinpoint specific
biochemical and metabolic pathways that are disrupted by defective CARD11 signaling directly in primary cells
from affected patients, an invaluable resource that we have unique access to. Defining these molecular
abnormalities will enhance our understanding of disease pathogenesis and illuminate mechanisms by which
simple interventions, such as supplementation with the essential amino acid glutamine, can restore the proper
function of T and B cells harboring CBM mutations. Our innovative approach has the potential to significantly
revise our understanding of how the CBM complex regulates adaptive immune responses. Insights gleaned
from a more thorough investigation of CBM gene mutations, derived from both rare and common allergy
patient cohorts, will better define their contribution to atopic susceptibility and inform new targeted therapeutic
approaches for treating a broader spectrum of patients suffering from allergic disease."

Resident memory (Trm) cells are a long-lived tissue localized CD8 T cell compartment that serves as a critical
immune barrier against cancer progression and metastasis. Our work on the prior cycle of this R01 has shown
that melanoma-specific Trm populations become distributed across skin and tumor-draining lymph nodes
(TDLNs) where they provide protection against primary and metastatic melanoma in mice. In humans, we found
that Trm populations with similar characteristics are sustained for years in the skin of melanoma survivors.
However, the field lacks a clear understanding of mechanisms governing the establishment, function, and
interconversion of Trm populations across different tissue locations. The overarching goal of this renewal
application is to define the programming requirements, trafficking requirements, and potential clinical benefit of
tumor-specific Trm cells that localize to tumor-draining lymph nodes. Based on our preliminary data that Trm
populations in lymph nodes (LNs) uniquely require type-1 interferon (IFN) signals for their generation, Specific
Aim 1 will define the mechanisms and timing of type-1 IFN production that are crucial for LN Trm formation. We
will define the critical window of type-1 IFN sensing, and the cellular interactions that govern this sensing during
Trm cell programming and maintenance. We will also determine the importance of the cGAS/STING pathway in
providing IFN signals to Trm cells in TDLNs. Thus, we expect to reveal type-1 IFN as a key cytokine for promoting
LN-restricted Trm generation. Second, based on our finding that Trm cells traffic from skin to draining LNs during
primary and recall responses to melanoma, Specific Aim 2 will define the dynamics between these tissue-
restricted compartments. By limiting T cell homing to peripheral tissue we will define a role for tissue access in
supporting Trm seeding in LNs. We will also determine the relative contribution of skin vs. tumor egress to Trm
generation in LNs. Then we will define Trm cell fate and differentiation trajectory between skin and LNs to test
the provocative hypothesis that skin serves as a reservoir for functional T cell responses against melanoma.
Finally, Specific Aim 3 will define the function and prognostic significance of LN Trm populations in patients with
melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These studies will test the hypothesis that regional LN Trm
populations correlate with resistance to metastasis to LNs. Our studies will define the function, stemness, and
plasticity of human LN Trm populations that associate with protection from metastasis. By defining mechanisms
underlying tissue-specific Trm generation, this work will support our overarching goal of generating Trm
responses throughout tissues where cancers grow and metastasize."

ongoing, a shift to using EEG data as a source-resolved, relatively high-resolution 3D cortical source imaging modality.
The EEGLAB signal processing environment is a readily extensible open-source software project of the Swartz Center for
Computational Neuroscience (SCCN) of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). EEGLAB began as a set of
EEG data analysis running on MATLAB (The Mathworks, Inc.), released by Makeig on the World Wide Web in 1997.
EEGLAB was first released from SCCN in 2001. Now 21 years later, its reference paper {Delorme, 2004 #1} has over
18,450 citations (increasing by 6.8 per day), its opt-in EEGLAB discussion email list links over 6,000 researchers, its
EEGLAB news reaches over 15,000, and an independent 2011 survey of 687 research respondents reported EEGLAB to
be the software environment most widely used for electrophysiological data analysis in cognitive neuroscience. EEGLAB
citations and other metrics show that EEGLAB adoption is still growing steadily. Here, we will greatly augment the power
of the EEGLAB environment by providing support for processing both intracranial (iEEG, sEEG) and mobile brain/body
imaging (MoBI) data (EEG and behavior), and will further integrate tools for performing high-resolution source imaging
from EEG (or iEEG) data. Its suitability for multi-modal brain/behavioral recording is one of the strengths of EEG
recording compared to other imaging modalities. Multimodal data review and processing tools will be incorporated into
EEGLAB, to further support the development of tools for processing mobile brain imaging data. We will develop a
framework for source connectivity analysis using (1) a hierarchical Bayesian framework for clustering effective source
processes identified by independent component analysis on multiple measures across subjects and studies and (2) region
of interest (ROI) dynamics estimation by beamforming. We will further revise the EEGLAB architecture to use a file and
metadata organization compatible with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) specifications. These tools will integrate
the Hierarchical Event Descriptor (HED) event annotation system to enable innovative meta-analyses across data from
multiple studies. These continuing developments will further the use of non-invasive and (as per clinical need) invasive
human electrophysiology for 3-D functional cortical brain imaging, thereby accelerating progress in noninvasive basic and
clinical human brain research using highly time- and space-resolved measures of brain electrophysiological dynamics."
10846799,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Abnormalities in genome maintenance pathways offer an opportunity to develop therapeutic approaches that
selectively target cancer cells. Furthermore, because of their proliferative nature, cancer cells are susceptible
to replication-associated DNA damage and more dependent upon the pathways that deal with this type of
damage. In a recent collaborative study, we found that the levels of DNA ligase I (LigI), the major enzyme joining
Okazaki fragments at the replication fork, correlates with outcome and therapy resistance in ovarian cancer.
Further, we found that ovarian cancer cells, which have a defect in homology-dependent repair (HDR), are
sensitive to LigI inhibition. In preliminary studies we compared the effects of LIG1 deletion with chemical
inhibition. In LIG1 null cells, there were elevated levels of XRCC1, the partner protein of LigIII, and PARP2
associated with newly synthesized DNA, consistent with the PARP- and LigIII-dependent back-up pathway that
joins Okazaki fragments and enables cells to replicated in the absence of LigI. In contrast, incubation with the
LigI inhibitor did not result in increased levels of XRCC1 or PARP2. Instead, there were elevated levels of the
Mre11Rad50Nbs1 complex, that initiates the resection step of homology-dependent repair (HDR). In aim 1, we
will use a combination of genetic, cell biological and biochemical approaches to determine the mechanism of the
HDR pathway induced by LigI inhibition. Since HDR deficiency occurs in both inherited and sporadic forms of
ovarian cancer and we have identified LIG1 as a biomarker of outcome and therapy resistance in ovarian cancer,
we will examine the activity of the LigI inhibitor alone and in combination with DNA repair inhibitors and/or
genotoxic chemotherapeutics in genetically-defined ovarian cancer cell lines. Building upon our existing LigI
inhibitors in aim 2, we will use a combination of molecular modeling and medicinal chemistry to design and
synthesize putative LigI inhibitors that are predicted to have enhanced potency and selectivity as well as
improved pharmacological properties. The activity of the putative LigI inhibitors will be evaluated in parallel
biochemical assays with purified human DNA ligases and cell-based assays with genetically-defined ovarian
cancer cell lines. In aim 3, we will first examine the activity of existing and new LigI inhibitors for activity in
genetically-characterized patient-derived organoids alone and in combination with DNA repair inhibitors and
chemotherapeutics used to treat ovarian cancer. Subsequently, combinations with the highest activity will
evaluated in mouse xenograft models of ovarian, including patient-derived xenografts. Together, the proposed
studies will provide mechanistic insights into replication-associated PARP-dependent and HDR pathways that
are critical in LigI deficient cells, develop improved LigI inhibitors and identify specific DNA alterations that confer
sensitivity to the LigI inhibitor alone or in combination with DNA damaging agents and/or DNA repair inhibitors
in preclinical ovarian cancer models, providing the rationale for the further development of LigI inhibitors as a
novel therapeutic for ovarian cancer."

 Project Summary
The ability of cancer cells to adapt to a wide variety of stress conditions plays a critical role in various
physiological facets of tumorigenesis. We recently reported the discovery of stress-induced low complexity
noncoding RNA derived from stimuli-specific loci of the ribosomal intergenic spacer (rIGSRNA); an enigmatic
region of the human genome historically dismissed as “junk” DNA. We showed that low complexity rIGSRNA
activate a physiological amyloidogenic program that converts nucleoli into Amyloid-bodies: reversible nuclear
membrane-less compartments composed of immobilized proteins in an amyloid-like state. While many cellular
bodies have been described as liquid-like (e.g., stress granules, P-bodies, germ cell granules), the discovery of
Amyloid-bodies provided evidence of an amyloidogenic program that can physiologically transition biological
matter to a solid state. Amyloid-bodies are found in sub-populations of cells in normal tissues, the core of low-
grade human tumors and cells responding to various stimuli highlighting their ubiquitous nature. Proteomic
analysis revealed that Amyloid-bodies immobilize participants of the DNA synthesis machinery and cell cycle
control, amongst many other metabolic regulators. Intriguingly, Amyloid-bodies share many biophysical
properties with the amyloidogenic, solid-like Balbiani-bodies involved in metabolic suppression in Xenopus.
Likewise, yeast solidify elements of their proteome to sporulate and arrest growth in non-permissive conditions.
This raises the fascinating possibility that stressed cancer cells assemble Amyloid-bodies to enter a spore-like
state of extreme metabolic depression. In this grant proposal, we will show preliminary data that low complexity
rIGSRNA coordinate unusual RNA tailing programs to drive system-wide amyloidogenic phase transition. This
post-translational pathway enables cancer cells to immobilize elements of the DNA synthesis machinery and halt
oncogenic signaling in an adaptive response to severe environmental insults. Based on these preliminary and
published results, we hypothesize that “Nucleolar phase transition programs temporarily suspend oncogenicity”.
We plan to test this hypothesis by: 1- Uncovering mechanisms of physiological phase transition; 2- Examining
how low complexity rIGSRNA activate RNA tailing programs; 3- Demonstrating a role for RNA tailing-mediated
phase transition in tumorigenesis. The discovery of dedicated enzymatic programs that drive physiological
amyloidogenesis provides a unique opportunity to study the role of liquid-to-solid phase transition in human
clinical samples and in vivo tumor assays. By studying clinical samples, in culture and orthotopic animal models,
we will test if phase transition induces a unique and yet uncharacterized cancer cell state of extreme metabolic
depression, while highlighting biochemical functions for low complexity RNA typically discarded as useless
nucleic acids."
10930060,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Although anti-VEGF therapies have shown impressive benefits for patients with wet form age-related
macular degeneration (AMD), there is no effective treatment for dry AMD, a major unmet clinical need. Retinal
pigment epithelium (RPE) and retina dysfunction and degeneration are the major pathological features in dry
AMD. Deficient mitochondrial function and disturbed lipid metabolism in the RPE are believed to play key
pathogenic roles in these pathologies of dry AMD. However, the molecular mechanism for the dysregulation of
lipid metabolism in the RPE with AMD is elusive. Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor α (PPARα) is a
transcription factor. It regulates lipid metabolism, and thus, PPARα agonists are used clinically to treat
dyslipidemia. Although our recent study showed that PPARα has a protective role in the retina, the association
of PPARα with the pathogenesis of AMD remains unknown. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that PPARα
levels are down-regulated in the retina and RPE of human donors with dry AMD and in two animal models with
partial AMD phenotypes. Furthermore, activation or expression of PPARα in the RPE partially protected the
retina and RPE against oxidative stress-induced RPE and retina damage. We have demonstrated that PPARα
knockout (KO) alone resulted in age-related ERG decline, retinal degeneration, abnormal RPE cell morphology,
enlarged RPE cell size, impaired RPE barrier, and increased microglia/macrophage adherence to the RPE.
PPARα KO also induced lipid accumulation in the RPE and Bruch’s membrane. Thus, we hypothesize that
PPARα is a major regulator of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and lipid homeostasis in the RPE, and essential for
maintaining normal structure and function of the RPE and retina. In this project, we will use our newly generated
RPE-specific PPARα conditional KO (PPARα-CKO) mice and transgenic (PPARα-Tg) mice expressing PPARα
in the RPE for the proposed studies. We will analyze changes in RPE barrier function, RPE cell morphology and
cell size, ERG, retinal and photoreceptor cell layer thicknesses, subretinal inflammation, and lipid accumulation
in the RPE and Bruch’s membrane of PPARα-CKO mice under a regular diet or high-fat, cholesterol-rich (HFC)
diet, to reveal if PPARα ablation in the RPE alone will induce retina and RPE pathologies, which will be
accelerated and exacerbated by the HFC diet. We will also determine if PPARα ablation will decrease FAO and
increase glycolysis in the RPE. Proteomic analysis of PPARα-CKO RPE will be performed to identify enzymes
and lipid-binding proteins with changed levels in the RPE of PPARα-CKO mice. Further, we will investigate if
PPARα-Tg mice will show alleviated, while PPARα-CKO mice will show more severe, RPE and retinal injury by
oxidative stress. We will also explore the therapeutic potential of PPARα agonist fenofibrate against RPE and
retinal dysfunction and degeneration in two genetic mouse models with some AMD phenotypes. The proposed
studies will identify a new regulation mechanism for lipid metabolism in the RPE and has the potential to lead to
the repurposing of an oral lipid-lowering drug for the treatment of dry AMD."
10724255,"Abstract
Background: Care coordination is essential to improve patients’ access to healthcare, clinical outcomes,
enhancing patients experience, increasing provider satisfaction, and decreasing or maintaining costs, yet
appears to be most successful for those with complex care needs. While the VA’s established primary care
model, the Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT) has proven effective in increasing Veterans’ experience and
trust while decreasing costs, many high need, high risk Veterans lack support for their complex clinical
and psychosocial needs that impacts their health care use, outcomes and costs. Two major VA
initiatives led by the Offices of Nursing Service (ONS) and Care Management and Social Work (SW), and the
Office of Community Care (OCC) intend to address this gap with initiation of new care coordination needs
assessment (CCNA) tools to match Veterans with the right level of care coordination and services in 2019. Yet,
the CCNA tools and organizational processes have not been evaluated.
Significance: Evaluation and implementation of effective care coordination practices are a high priority for the
VA and is the focus of two major national initiatives to address MISSION Act access to care goals.
Innovation/Impact: We will leverage ongoing initiatives, using routinely collected CCNA data, supplemented
with health care use data, and Veteran and provider perspectives to systematically evaluate care coordination
needs assessment tools, practices, and impacts on Veterans’ services received, outcomes and costs.
Specific Aims: We will build evidence about the CCNA, processes, and outcomes for high need, high risk
Veterans seeking VA covered healthcare at VA facilities and community sites. Our aims are to:
1. Characterize and compare the relationship between Veteran needs assessment, services received, health
outcomes and costs for Veterans exposed to CCNA with a matched comparison group.
2. Survey and compare Veterans about their experience with care coordination services, integration with other
healthcare services, and perceived health impacts.
3. Conduct formative evaluation to assess provider perceptions at early adoption VA sites about CCNA tools
and processes related to determinants of innovation diffusion, care integration, and to inform and conduct a
broader survey of providers.
Methodology: We will use an organizational theoretical approach including care coordination and innovation
diffusion frameworks to guide our research and employ an observational design using quantitative and
qualitative methods. Veterans treated at early adopter sites beginning in 2019 and categorized as needing
complex care based on the CCNA will be compared to matched Veterans using multiple data sources. Data
sources will include Veteran CCNA from the CC/ICM and OCC sites; CDW, VA Community Care, Consult
Toolbox, Medicare, vital status, and cost data. Survey data will be collected from Veterans and providers.
Quantitative analyses will describe and compare Veterans’ health services use, mortality and costs. Qualitative
analyses will focus on understanding how perceived attributes of the CCNA tools, as well the perceived
organizational context and implementation, influence uptake and adoption. The results of these analyses will
inform ongoing CCNA adaptation, build the evidence for the utility of the innovation attributes for real-life
implementation, and ensure evaluation of CCNA tools captures the most important elements.
Next Steps/Implementation/Sustainability: Building the evidence for care coordination processes will inform
best practices and implementation. With the VA’s electronic health record migration, this study may inform how
to adapt new CCNA electronic tools to facilitate and sustain implementation of evidenced-based practices."
10724256,"My research investigates signal transduction, molecular structures, and pathophysiological actions of the
extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) and its associated signaling molecules in controls of systemic
mineral and skeletal homeostasis and more recently in the induction of brain diseases and explores the
therapeutic potential of the receptor to treat several prevalent diseases afflicting VA patients. I also serve as
the Co-Director of the UCSF/SF-VAMC Skeletal Biology and Biomechanics Core to provide comprehensive
skeletal phenotyping services to more than 50 VA, NIH, and DOD projects. During this RCS award period I will
continue to: (1) Determine the therapeutic potential of the CaSR in treating osteoporosis and facilitating
bone fracture repair and underlying mechanisms: We demonstrated previously an essential role of the
CaSR in prenatal skeletal development and postnatal bone accrual by regulating parathyroid cell (PTC)
functions and cell-autonomous activities in chondrocytes and osteoblasts. Based on those studies, we
developed a new regimen to enhance the FDA-approved parathyroid hormone (PTH) therapy by targeting the
CaSR in bone for osteoporosis without producing hypercalcemic side-effects. Promising results of our
preclinical animal studies have led to a VA Merit Review proposal to initiate a clinical trial on VA patients with
this new regimen. (2) Assess the role of CaSR in inducing neurodegeneration and its therapeutic
potential to treat acute and chronic brain diseases: My lab was the first to uncover physical and functional
interactions of CaSR with the type B γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) receptor type 1 (GABA-B-R1), which is a
critical receptor producing inhibitory neurotransmission to prevent neuronal overactivity and subsequent cell
death in the brain. Based on our recent findings that CaSR overexpression is closely associated with neuronal
death in brains of mice subjected to ischemia (i.e., oxygen and nutrient deprivation) and mouse models of early-
onset familial Alzheimer's Disease, we have begun to test the hypothesis that CaSR overexpression/overactivity
critically promotes neuronal death and brain degeneration in those diseases by interfering with GABA-B-R1
signaling. Our comprehensive in vivo and in vitro experiments strongly support this concept. I will continue to
pursue this line of research, aiming to provide strongest scientific bases to guide future clinical trials to treat
multiple devastating brain diseases. (3) Determine the role of CaSR-associated signaling molecules in
mediating parathyroid functions: My group studied different genetically manipulated mouse models to
delineate CaSR-mediated signaling mechanisms in parathyroid gland (PTG), which is the major producer of
PTH that critically controls mineral balance. We found that mice with CaSR deficiency in their PTGs (PTCCaSR+/-
) acquire hyperparathyroidism (HPT), a prevalent metabolic disease afflicting >1% of aging adults. Interestingly,
in the background of PTCCaSR+/- mice, concurrent removal of GABA-B-R1 in PTGs prevents the development
of HPT, suggesting that GABA-B-R1 is a critical mediator of PTH hypersecretion in those diseases. I will
continue this line of research to determine if aberrant expression and/or activity of CaSR and GABA-B-R1 also
play a fundamental role in causing PTH overproduction and subsequent mineral imbalance in lieu of Ca2+ and/or
vitamin D deficiency or kidney failure. (4) Define actions of CaSR and FGF23 in other vital organs through
collaborative research: We generated novel floxed-CaSR and floxed-FGF23 mice that permits assessments
of tissue-specific actions of CaSR and FGF23, which is another critical factor mediating mineral and hormonal
homeostasis in physiological and disease states. We have provided those mice as well as essential consultation
and technical assistance to >20 local and international renown laboratories conducting skin, cardiovascular,
gastrointestinal, pulmonary, mammary glands, brain, and cancer research. Our collaborative studies have
revealed diverse actions of CaSR and FGF23 in those systems, as demonstrated in numerous high-impact
publications."

Significance: Black relative to White young adults engage in heavier cannabis use and are more likely to
experience cannabis use disorder. The reasons for these inequities, including the role of stress caused by
systemic racism, are poorly understood and in critical need of empirical study. The proposed community-
engaged R01 examines the dynamic transactions between stressors, reactivity (physiological and emotional),
and cannabis cognitions (craving, motives) to identify the processes that contribute to inequities in cannabis
use outcomes for Black young adults. Aims: Aim 1 will examine differences between Black and White young
adults in cannabis cognitions and cannabis problems in relation to acute stressors. Aim 2 will test reactivity as
a between- and within- person characteristic that tightens the effect of experiencing a stressor on cannabis
cognitions and cannabis outcomes. Aim 3 will examine the transaction among cannabis use, cannabis
cognitions, and reactivity from BL through 12-month follow-up. Hypotheses: We hypothesize that Black
relative to White young adults will report higher cannabis craving, coping motives, and cannabis problems.
These differences will be partially driven by acute stressors, including discrimination events. Additionally, as a
function of systemic racism, Black relative to White young adults will have heightened reactivity to acute
stressors, which will tighten the association between acute stress exposure and cannabis cognitions. Black
more than White young adults will increase their cannabis use and problems through the 6- and 12-month
follow-ups and this increase will be driven by higher baseline cannabis cognitions. Increases in cannabis use
from baseline to 6-month follow-up will be associated with increased reactivity at 12-month follow-up. In turn,
increased reactivity will relate to tightened associations between acute stress exposure and cannabis
cognitions during the 12-month ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Approach: Young adults who use
cannabis (weekly+ freq.; N=350; 18-25 years of age; 60% self-identifying as Black, 50% assigned female at
birth; matched across race on past 30-day cannabis use freq.) will be recruited. Participants will complete an
interview/questionnaires and a standardized stress task to assess reactivity (subjective, physiological: HF-
HRV) and craving. Next, participants will complete a 17-day EMA protocol to record stress and discrimination
events, reactivity (subjective and physiological), cannabis cognitions, and cannabis use/problems. Parallel lab
and EMA protocols will be completed at a 12-month follow-up with a brief survey of cannabis use and problems
at 6 months. This proposal is directly in line with NIDA’s strategic priorities on increasing health equity through
community-engaged research and NIDA’s focus on addressing real-world complexities that contribute to
substance use problems. This research takes a critical step towards identifying proximal points of intervention
to reduce and ultimately eliminate the growing health inequities in cannabis use outcomes."

This K08 proposal will expedite the principal investigator’s progress towards her goal of becoming an
independent physician-scientist with a focus on increasing our understanding of mechanisms of immune
related adverse events (irAEs) induced by checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) immunotherapies and identifying
therapeutic targets of these complications. Candidate: Dr. Ana Perdigoto is a physician-scientist at Yale
University School of Medicine. She completed clinical fellowship in Endocrinology and postdoctoral training in
Immunology. She is developing an expertise at the crossroads of immuno-endocrinology and immuno-
oncology through her work on investigating mechanisms of CPI-induced diabetes (CPI-DM), a complication
that arises in cancer patients treated with immunotherapies targeting checkpoint inhibitors. Under the
mentorship of Dr. Kevan Herold, a world-renowned Endocrinologist and Immunologist with authority on the
immunology of type 1 diabetes and CPI-DM, Dr. Perdigoto investigated how immune cells modify pancreatic
islets to cause CPI-DM. She will leverage the skills gained during her training to further analyze mechanisms of
these irAEs. Career Development Plan: Dr. Perdigoto will pursue the research in this proposal under the
primary mentorship of Dr. Herold. She will also have the guidance of an intramural and extramural advisory
team with various areas of expertise and experience in nurturing independent investigators. Yale University
provides a collaborative environment with state-of-the-art facilities and resources and excellent training
environment and opportunities. The proposed 5-year plan builds on Dr. Perdigoto’s prior experience and
further enriches her training to provide the tools needed for establishing independence, such as proficiency in
bioinformatics and analysis of genomic data, knowledge in mouse genetics, and productive collaborations.
Research Plan: The overall premises addressed in this proposal are that interactions of immune and islet cells
in the tissue microenvironment lead to the development of CPI-DM (investigated in Specific Aim 1) and that
tumor can impact autoimmunity, potentially through presentation of shared antigens (investigated in Specific
Aim 2). Upon completion of the research proposed, Dr. Perdigoto will be able to: 1) characterize immune-target
cell interactions that lead to autoimmunity 2) analyze novel tumor models with regards to the impact of
immunotherapies and tumor on autoimmunity and 3) identify potential therapeutic targets to prevent adverse
events without impacting tumor responses. The findings will enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of
CPI-DM as well as other irAEs arising from CPI treatment. After completing the proposed training, Dr.
Perdigoto will have acquired the expertise required to become an independent investigator poised to continue
translational studies that can lead to the development of diagnostic or therapeutic tools to protect target cells
from the effects of inflammatory mediators both in the field of immuno-oncology and potentially autoimmunity."
10887631,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Diet is an established etiologic factor for colorectal cancer (CRC) and is estimated to account for more than 40%
of CRC cases and deaths. Despite several healthy dietary indices were suggested to be CRC-preventive, their
associations with CRC risk remain moderate. A dietary index guiding dietary modulation for an efficacious CRC
prevention remains lacking so far. One important reason is that all those dietary indices were developed based
on their associations with cardiometabolic risk or certain general biological pathways, rather than mechanisms
specifically targeting the colon. Growing evidence indicates an important role of gut microbial metabolites in
mediating dietary effects on CRC risk. Among the metabolites, secondary bile acids (SBA) are suggested by
extensive evidence to trigger a plethora of tumorigenic effects in colon, pointing to the gut microbiome-SBA axis
as an emerging colon-specific pathway for CRC prevention. High-fat intake increases SBA production, but its
SBA-stimulating property depends on fat type. Also, carbohydrates, proteins, and some other nutrients/foods
also influence SBA but remain understudied. These data support the hypothesis that a dietary index specifically
targeting the gut microbiome-SBA axis improves the currently weak CRC dietary prevention. To test this
hypothesis, we will conduct an observational study in Aim 1 by leveraging the blood metabolomics and repeatedly
measured diet and CRC diagnosis over 30 years in a racially/ethnically diverse population from four large cohorts:
the Nurses’ Health Study I and II, Health Professionals Follow-up Study, and Southern Community Cohort Study.
In Aim 2, we will conduct a single-arm intervention study among 40 patients who have recently undergone
resection of colorectal adenoma and consume a habitual Western diet to assess the effect of a dietary
intervention for more plant-based and less animal-based food over 4 weeks on SBA production, gut microbiota,
and colonic gene expression via detailed food diary and repeated stool, blood, and colonic tissue collection. We
will also guide patients to consume more foods, if there is any, that are found to substantially reduce SBA in Aim
1. I am well suited to perform this research based on 1) my expertise in epidemiology, quantitative methods, and
biomarker research; 2) the exceptional multidisciplinary mentoring team comprised of leaders in their respective
fields; and 3) the unparalleled research environment to support my career development. A team of outstanding
scientists will mentor me to help me achieve this goal: Dr. Andrew Chan, a leader in clinical intervention and
colorectal cancer prevention; Dr. Curtis Huttenhower, a leader in gut microbiome and bioinformatics; Dr.
Mingyang Song, a leader in clinical epidemiology and nutritional intervention; and Dr. Edward Giovannucci, a
leader in dietary effects on cancer. Through this study, I will expand my expertise in several new areas, including
nutritional strategy for cancer prevention, the gut microbiome and bioinformatics, and clinical trial. The proposed
research and training will help achieve my long-term career goal to become an independent investigator and
develop a transdisciplinary research program in human nutrition and the gut microbiome for cancer prevention."

While the clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy ranges from asymptomatic to critical disease,
pregnancy itself augments the risk of severe and critical COVID-19. The leading obstetrical societies in the U.S.
recommend COVID-19 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccination in pregnancy to prevent severe disease.
Furthermore, passive immunity to the neonate via transplacental transfer of immunoglobulin G (IgG) is critically
important during the first six months of life, particularly as the COVID-19 vaccines are approved only for children
>six months of age. Hybrid immunity, defined as vaccine-induced immunity before or after natural infection with
SARS-CoV-2, produces a more robust response in non-pregnant populations than either type in isolation. The
long-term inflammatory and immunologic responses to SARS-CoV-2 hybrid immunity in pregnancy, a state
marked by tightly regulated T cell control and immune modulation, compared to natural infection are unknown.
As SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic, this proposal will address a gap in the literature that has focused primarily
on natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy compared to vaccine-induced immunity. Leveraging the existing
COVID-19 Outcomes in Mother-Infant Pairs (COMP) study, a longitudinal cohort that follows 225 mother-infant
dyads diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy, the proposal seeks to better understand the long-
term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 hybrid immunity in pregnancy. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 hybrid
immunity compared to natural infection in pregnancy confers protection against postpartum complications, leads
to less maternal systemic inflammation, and results in more robust immune responses in mother-infant pairs.
The study aims are: 1) to estimate the prevalence and risk factors of peripartum and delayed postpartum
complications of COVID-19 in pregnancy between those with SARS-CoV-2 hybrid immunity, and those with
natural infection; 2) to compare the systemic inflammatory landscapes, as measured by cytokine profiles, of
pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 hybrid immunity and natural infection at delivery and one year postpartum;
and 3) to evaluate cellular and humoral immune responses to the ancestral and Omicron (BA.5) strains following
COVID-19 in pregnancy at delivery and six months postpartum in mother-infant dyads with SARS-CoV-2 hybrid
immunity compared to natural infection. The K23 will support Dr. Cambou to develop advanced skills in 1) applied
immunology, 2) perinatal infections, and 3) cytokine analysis, in order to become an effective translational
physician-scientist. Dr. Karin Nielsen, a world-renowned pediatric infectious diseases (ID) expert in perinatal
infections, will serve as the primary mentor. Co-mentors Drs. Otto O. Yang and Grace Aldrovandi, experts in
viral immunology, have over 20 years of continuous NIH funding and proven track records of successful
mentorship. Co-mentor Dr. Debika Bhattacharya will offer guidance as an adult ID clinical researcher in perinatal
viral infections. The K23 will allow Dr. Cambou to carve out a unique niche of multidisciplinary research blending
immunology with viral infections in pregnancy, in order to launch her career as an independent investigator."
10918212,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The brain does not simply passively process visual information about the objects in the world. It is charged
with placing this information about objects in the context of their environment relative to us in a way that helps
us interact with them. To forage for food in the wild, an animal recognizes distant fruits, weighs the effort to get
to each fruit against its perceived ripeness, makes and executes a route plan, and learns from the experience.
This is possible because our vision enables two remarkable abilities – filtering out irrelevant information like
inedible branches and leaves to focus on the fruit and creating flexible plans to reach the goal that can be
altered on the fly. To study the neural basis of these abilities, I will use new conceptual and technological
advances to study object vision in the context of cognition and naturalistic interactions like navigation and
foraging to formulate a unified theory of how vision enables flexible behavior.
 Several computations in brain areas, like the prefrontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, etc., have been thought to
mediate flexible behavior in various cognitive contexts like attention, working memory, and navigation. In this
proposal, I will test the central hypothesis that signals in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) related to
those different forms of flexibility reflect computations that guide how object properties are read out of visual
area V4. To encourage the combination of several sources of visual information and interaction with objects in
the task, I have designed a virtual reality foraging platform to test the following hypotheses about how object
vision enables flexible behavior. In aim 1, I will test whether and how computations in dlPFC (previously
identified in the context of attention) mediate the foraging of objects that have a narrow range of learned
desirable properties by affecting the readout of relevant and irrelevant properties from V4. In aim 2, I will study
how object familiarity is encoded in a viewpoint-invariant fashion and how interactions between V4 and dlPFC
guide foraging behavior. In aim 3, I will explore how visual processing enables learned associations between
objects and sequential actions by comparing the changes in neural activity in V4 and dlPFC that lead to the
execution of sequential choices.
 The results of these studies will have broad scientific implications for models of visual perception that
explain behavior and clinical implications for how object interaction, association, and action execution can be
impaired in stroke and Alzheimer’s disease patients while visual processing is spared. Skills gained in the
mentored portion – developing a visual foraging VR task and measuring and manipulating attention-like signals
in dlPFC – along with my experience in generating visual scenes to analyze neural coding, will set the stage for
future studies of the cognitive processes that shape visually guided experiences and actions in health and
disease."
10914243,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Appropriately recognizing and responding to social partners is a fundamental principle guiding every social
interaction from single cells to humans. Social environment is known to interact with development to give rise
to typical behavioral responses, however the mechanisms by which social experience shapes the development
and tuning features of the nervous system to give rise to these behaviors remains poorly understood. How
does the social environment throughout development interact to shape how the brain encodes and
discriminates social information? The proposed research addresses these questions in a novel experimentally
tractable system for investigating social development of a neural circuit, the northern paper wasp, Polistes
fuscatus. P. fuscatus females have highly diverse color markings on their face which they use to discriminate
social partners via vision alone. Like humans, P. fuscatus wasps treat faces as special visual objects and the
development of this specialized recognition ability is dependent on social experience. The social lives of these
wasps are rich and complex, allowing for highly refined social memory and even transitive inference of social
relationships. Conveniently, wasps do not possess image forming eyes prior to adult emergence. This key
feature allows for the ability to precisely control both the timing and diversity of social experience, while
maintaining normal larval development. Further, we have recently discovered a common population of socially
responsive neurons in the central brain of P. fuscatus, which show selective tuning to visual stimuli of forward-
facing wasps above other visual objects, analogous to the ‘face cells’ in the primate brain. These cells encode
both social detection and identity discrimination, providing a clear neural target to study how social experience
shapes the tuning features of a socially selective circuits. The proposed experiments take advantage of the
unique strengths of this system to address this question at three levels. First, we will assess how these circuits
are impacted by long-term social isolation. Second, we will track the developmental tuning trajectory of these
circuits to identify how these circuits develop and are refined through maturity to give rise to the highly
selective features found in mature adult wasps. Third, we will investigate how both individual neural and
population-level tuning features are affected by the diversity of social experiences wasps have, via
manipulation of facial diversity among groups. These experiments will aid in discovering fundamental features
of how social circuits are tuned via social experience and guide future experiments to identify shared principles
guiding social cognition. Further this award will also support the awardee’s transition to an independent

Research: Children exposed to indoor air pollution are known to more likely develop asthma, and in those with
asthma, indoor air pollution can worsen asthma symptoms. Radon (Rn), a radioactive gas known for its lung
cancer effects, decays into radiation-emitting progeny which has potential to induce cellular damage once
inhaled. While residential Rn exposure is common, less is known about the non-cancer health effects of Rn
decay products. Current health regulations and priorities are based solely on its carcinogenic effects in the lung.
Indoor exposure to radon has been recently associated with COPD morbidity and mortality and an increased
risk for hospital admissions. Given the association linking residential Rn exposure to COPD morbidity, in this
exploratory application, we propose adverse health effects associated with Rn decay products via particle
radioactivity in asthma morbidity, a common condition of obstructive lung disease in the pediatric population.
Candidate: Dr. Banzon’s long-term goal is to become an independent NIH-funded investigator focused on the
role of assessing the physical environment with a specific focus on air pollution and asthma morbidity in inner-
city children. This proposal details a five-year project to provide Dr. Banzon the training and expertise necessary
to study the effects of radon progeny and particle radioactivity in asthma by measuring its health effects in an
established cohort of inner-city children with asthma enrolled in the School Inner-City Asthma Study (PI:
Phipatanakul). Her aim is to identify a novel and modifiable environmental exposure that contributes to asthma
morbidity in children. The findings have potential to aid in the design of public health intervention trials, directly
inform activities regarding radon mitigation as an intervention to alleviate disability from asthma, and identify
biomarkers associated with particle radioactivity which may help phenotype patients and help predict those who
may have a more favorable response to personalized asthma treatment based on biomarkers.
Environment: Dr. Banzon will be mentored by Dr. Phipatanakul, an expert in epidemiology, clinical trials, and
clinical investigation in asthma and allergic diseases. She has assembled an extraordinary team of advisors,
including Drs. Petros Koutrakis, Jonathan Gaffin, and Brett Coull, who have committed their time, resources,
and expertise to facilitate Dr. Banzon’s career development and successful completion of the proposed project.
During this award period, Dr. Banzon will complete complementary coursework through the Harvard School of
Public Health and Harvard Catalyst Program, with a focus to hone on her skills in environmental epidemiology
targeted toward air pollution and childhood asthma. The academic environment created by the mentor, institution,
Harvard University, and its affiliates provides fertile ground for learning and collaborating specific to her research.
Dr. Banzon will emerge an expert in the field of environmental epidemiology, with a unique understanding of the
physical environmental that will shape her into a successful independent investigator."

Akkermansia muciniphila is a bacterial resident of the human intestine that is associated with protection from
chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases, colorectal cancers, and type-2 diabetes.
The molecular mechanisms that determine how A. muciniphila inhabits the intestine and how it promotes host
health are not known. A. muciniphila grows in dense aggregates in tight association with the glycan-rich mucin
lining of the intestine. When cultured in mucin medium, A. muciniphila produces anti-inflammatory compounds
and stimulates other glycan-coated gut microbes like Ruminococcus gnavus to produce butyrate, a fermentation
byproduct with therapeutic properties. The board and long-term objective of this project is to learn how the
glycan environment of the intestine shapes A. muciniphila’s anti-inflammatory activities and decode species-
level mechanisms that drive variability among clinical isolates. This work has wide-reaching implications in fields
such as probiotic and therapeutic development aimed at treating inflammatory diseases. The focus of this
proposal is to develop a molecular understanding of how A. muciniphila strains regulate a diverse group of
glycan-binding cell surface adhesins referred to as PbH1-containing adhesins (PbHAs) to engage with the mucin
environment of the intestine, to interact with and manipulate butyrate fermentation in other symbionts, and to
modulate innate immune pathways in the host. In Specific Aim 1 I will engineer a zebrafish bacterial symbiont
to express each of the seven diverse PbHAs encoded by two A. muciniphila species of interest (MucT and
AKK2750) and test how expression shapes their aggregation properties in culture and influences their spatial
organization in the larval zebrafish gut. Further, I will use experimental evolution to uncover the genetic pathways
that drive MucT and AKK2750 aggregation in mucin medium. Specific Aim 2 will investigate the role of PbHAs
in co-aggregation with R. gnavus and determine how MucT and AKK2750 mucin-sensing and co-aggregation
with R. gnavus influence butyrate fermentation. Lastly, Specific Aim 3 will use a zebrafish model of microbe-
induced intestinal inflammation to identify PbHAs and other species-specific factors that reduce inflammation
and promote intestinal health. I will use a pathogen-targeting PbHA to design therapeutic beads that bind and
deplete an intestinal pathogen and restores gut health. The molecular insights I will discover, research reagents
I will generate, and skills I will acquire through these studies will position me to establish my own independent
research laboratory investigating the molecular mechanisms of microbiome-mediated human health."
10918323,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Whereas peanut (PN) allergy is the most common cause of fatal and near-fatal food-allergic reactions in older
children and adults, egg and cow’s milk are the most common food triggers of anaphylaxis in infancy. Egg allergy
is the most common childhood IgE-mediated food allergy with prevalence rates ranging from 1.3-1.6% in general
population up to 20% in high-risk infants. Egg sensitization is a significant risk factor for PN allergy and early
aeroallergen sensitization, which can lead to the “atopic march”. Black children are over-represented among
children with egg allergy and asthma is more prevalent in children with allergy to egg than any other food. Only
50% develop tolerance to egg by school-age; PN allergy is rarely outgrown. There is a critical “window of
opportunity” for the introduction of allergenic solids around 4-6 months in decreasing the risk of food allergy as
shown in randomized controlled trials with egg and PN. However, 36% of infants were already sensitized to egg
at enrollment and about 9% to PN, excluding them from early introduction; 20% infants were clinically allergic,
even anaphylactic, on their first introduction of egg. To be more effective, primary prevention strategies must
begin much earlier before sensitization is established, possibly even during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
 Prior studies are conflicting in the effect of maternal diet including or excluding egg or PN on development of
food allergy in infancy. Per the American Academy of Pediatrics, “Current evidence does not support a role for
maternal dietary restrictions during pregnancy or lactation”, but randomized controlled trials are lacking.
Thus, there is an urgent need to provide mothers with concrete advice on feeding practices based on good
quality evidence. The overall objective of this application is to define the role for egg and PN exposure during
pregnancy and via human milk in food sensitization and to identify the biomarkers of sensitization or tolerance.
 We will conduct a nationally-enrolled, randomized controlled, four-arm parallel trial. Mothers pregnant with
infants at high risk (with first degree relative with an atopic disease) who intend to breastfeed >3 months will be
enrolled utilizing social media and referrals and randomized to either consumption or avoidance of egg and PN
containing foods throughout pregnancy and lactation to assess the risk of sensitization to egg and PN at 4
months before introduction of solid foods. In Aim 1, we will determine the effect of maternal dietary egg and PN
avoidance during pregnancy and lactation on the risk of egg and PN sensitization in high-risk infants. In Aim 2,
we will assess the level of infant oral and environmental exposure to egg and PN. In Aim 3, we will identify the
immune responses elicited by maternal diet including or excluding egg and PN during pregnancy and lactation.
Knowledge gained from these studies will uncover mechanisms of early-life sensitization necessary to establish
maternal dietary guidelines in prevention of food allergy and the atopic march.

10913581,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In systemic sclerosis (SSc), fibrosis causes permanent functional damage in multiple organs. While
non-resolving fibrosis in SSc has lethal consequences, its mechanisms are poorly understood and there is no
effective treatment. Based on our exciting findings, we now propose the very novel hypothesis that fibrosis results
from dysregulation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide (NAM) metabolism mediated
by the enzymes CD38 (which breaks down NAD to NAM), and nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT), which
couples cellular metabolic states to methylome changes and cellular reprogramming. Moreover, we propose that
this multicellular CD38-NNMT metabolic axis represents a novel target for SSc therapy. Our preliminary results
show that 1) expression of CD38 and NNMT are elevated in SSc patient biopsies, with these two NAD-
metabolizing enzymes mapping predominantly to immune (CD38) or stromal (NNMT) cells, respectively; 2)
genetic or pharmacological blockade of CD38 in mice is protective from fibrosis; 3) NAM, the main enzymatic
substrate of NNMT that fuels its activity, is generated via CD38; and 4) NNMT is TGF-ß-inducible, and its
inhibition abrogates fibrotic responses. Our novel paradigm, built upon these observations, implicates
dysregulated NAD metabolism mediated via CD38 and NNMT in the pathogenesis of SSc. Specifically, we
propose that elevated CD38 activity in SSc reduces NAD while generating NAM, both of which then drive
fibroblast reprogramming via fueling NNMT activity and other mechanisms. This metabolic interplay between
CD38-expressing and NNMT-expressing cells might be selectively targeted for fibrosis treatment. Despite our
compelling observations, alterations in the key NAD metabolizing enzymes CD38 and NNMT, and their
pathogenic roles, cellular sources and reciprocal interaction in a metabolic cellular network in SSc have never
been investigated. We will therefore address these critical gaps in this proposal using a comprehensive
experimental strategy deploying patient samples, novel engineered mice and disease models and
pharmacological agents. In Aim 1 we will map CD38 expression in SSc patients and determine CD38's cell
type-specific roles and mechanisms in fibrosis. In Aim 2 we will map NNMT expression in SSc patient biopsies
and determine its cell type-specific pathogenic roles, mechanisms and interplay with CD38. The premise of our
highly innovative proposal is that by elucidating the pathogenic roles and mechanistic links between CD38 and
NNMT underlying dysregulated NAD metabolism in SSc, we will generate fundamental mechanistic
understanding to guide discovery of entirely new treatments to reduce severity of SSc or delay onset of its deadly
complications."
10930097,"Hispanics/Latinos, the largest and fastest-growing minority group in the US, are disproportionately affected by
type 2 diabetes (T2D). Sociocultural, psychosocial, and behavioral factors [collectively called
“socioenvironmental factors” hereafter] are believed to contribute to T2D disparity in Hispanics/Latinos, but the
mechanisms through which they get under the skin are unclear. DNA methylation (DNAm), one of the most
studied epigenetic modifications, is responsive to various socioenvironmental exposures across an individual’s
life course, and aberrant DNAm has been associated with aging and age-related diseases including T2D. To
date, little is known about the genomewide DNAm patterns associated with socioenvironmental exposures [in
totality named “socioenvironmental exposome”]. The mechanisms through which socioenvironmental
exposome becomes biologically embedded into aging and risk of T2D have not been well studied in a
nationally representative sample of Hispanics/Latinos. Building on our prior work, we hypothesize that altered
DNAm evoked by socioenvironmental risk and protective factors contributes to risk for T2D in
Hispanics/Latinos. Our objectives here are to characterize the socioenvironmental exposome in relation to risk
of T2D, and identify key biological pathways through which socioenvironmental exposome affects risk of
diabetes, independent of known risk factors. To achieve this, we leverage a wealth of deep clinical phenotypes
and socioenvironmental factors collected by the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos
(HCHS/SOL) and its ancillary study - the Sociocultural Ancillary Study (SCAS). Using peripheral blood genomic
DNA collected at baseline (2008-2011) from 3,323 non-diabetic Hispanics/Latinos (aged 18-74) followed
through 2024, we will first identify unique latent constructs using a unified theoretical framework and then
conduct epigenomewide association studies (EWAS) to identify methylated genes/regions in response to each
unique socioenvironmental construct (Aim 1). Findings from Hispanics/Latinos will be replicated in non-
Hispanic Whites, African Americans, and American Indians (total N=7,184). In Aim 2, we will prospectively
determine whether socioenvironment-induced DNAm predict the onset and progression of T2D, independent of
standard clinical factors. In Aim 3, we will perform integrated genetic and epigenetic analyses to identify causal
epigenetic mediators and molecular pathways through which socioenvironmental exposome become
biologically embedded into diabetes risk in Hispanics/Latinos. Successful completion of this project will identify
modifiable genes and causal pathways through which socioenvironmental factors become biologically
embedded in Hispanic cardiometabolic health. Such results may provide novel mechanistic insights into
disease pathology, and are likely to lead to culturally tailored precision strategies for diabetes prevention and
intervention, thereby reducing diabetes disparity in this minority population."
10918321,"Revised ABSTRACT:

The onset of insulin resistance is a hallmark of metabolic syndrome and its complications. Together with other tissues (the adipose and the muscle) liver also becomes insulin resistant, thus contributing to the onset of hyperglycemia and type II diabetes. The mechanisms of hepatic insulin resistance are not well understood; but ceramide, a bioactive lipid metabolite is considered one of the main culprits. Drugs targeting pathways for ceramide de novo synthesis have shown effectiveness in ameliorating aspects of metabolic syndrome in the mouse. These approaches however typically exert a very broad effect on all sphingolipids, both structural and bioactive, instead on ceramide alone.  Due to the diverse roles that ceramide play in metabolic “health” of hepatocytes, the range of subcellular locations where it resides, and the variety of metabolic pathways for its generation, specific approaches to target distinct ceramide effects are needed for successful translation to the clinic, but are not available at the moment. The hypothesis to be tested in this proposal is that an enzyme called Neutral Sphingomyelinase-2 (nSMase-2, gene name smpd3), one of four distinct enzymes that can generates ceramide by the turnover of sphingomyelin, plays an unique role in the regulation of the insulin response of hepatocytes. This hypothesis is supported by strong preliminary data documenting its key aspects. The proposed plan will identify the underlying mechanisms of this novel signaling axis in cellular response to insulin. Aim 1 will decipher the impact of nSMase-2 at the plasma membrane on ceramide homeostasis and insulin signaling in vitro. Aim 2 is to test the cause-effect relationship between nSMase-2 and insulin resistance in vivo, and examine the impact of ceramide generated at the plasma membrane on de novo lipogenesis, lipid secretion, lipotoxicity and gluconeogenesis in vivo. A recently developed liver specific knockout mouse will be used in these studies."
10764331,"As humans age, levels of proinflammatory cytokines increase, leading to a chronic inflammatory state, known as inflammaging. Inflammation is a hallmark of age-related diseases and increases mortality among the elderly. The molecular mechanisms that underlie inflammaging have not yet been elucidated. Therefore, there is an urgent need to elucidate the molecular mechanisms causing persistent proinflammatory signals, as doing so will accelerate efforts to prevent and treat age-related and autoinflammatory diseases. The overall goal of this proposal is to determine if a specific molecular mechanism contributes to the proinflammatory phenotype of aged monocytes. The data gathered so far reveals that multiple Death Domain proteins that function as key nodes downstream of pathogen recognition receptors are activated through a nucleation-limited assembly mechanism. The self-sustaining nature of this form of assembly should in principle allow them to persist indefinitely and continuously induce monocytes for proinflammatory signaling. The proposed aims will address two important questions: 1) Do protein self-assemblies suffice to establish and maintain a proinflammatory state in monocytes? 2) Are protein self-assemblies involved in the declining production and function of innate immune cells at the hematopoiesis level? In the F99-phase of this proposed research, the researcher aims to identify the molecular substrate that drives a persistent proinflammatory state in monocytes. The implementation of novel tools to measure functionality of protein self-assemblies in vivo, will address whether the assembled states of certain Death Domain proteins are functionally establishing a proinflammatory state in monocytes. In the K00-phase of this proposed research, the researcher will identify a potential mechanism of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) decay and impaired self-renewal caused by signalosome formation. Specifically, the proposed experiments will determine whether Death Domain protein self-assemblies functionally reprogram HSC to skew the production of myeloid cells preloaded with a proinflammatory signature. To achieve these goals, the researcher will develop and implement novel approaches using cytological, biochemical and gene editing techniques. Completion of these aims will identify molecular substrates of inflammaging and reveal an unexplored role of ordered protein self-assemblies in signaling and cell differentiation. The proposed work is innovative and brings emerging biophysical concepts to the aging and immune senescence fields."

10919805,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
The number of children with medical complexity is increasing as medical advances reduce mortality from
serious illnesses like prematurity, cardiac anomalies, and genetic syndromes. Some of these children have
respiratory insufficiency and their families face decisions about tracheostomy and home ventilation. These
children utilize the most pediatric healthcare resources, have recurrent, prolonged hospitalizations and limited
life expectancies. They and their families are at risk of reduced quality of life including limited mobility, social
isolation, financial instability, and mental strain. Families and clinicians alike feel unprepared to weigh the
benefits and burdens of home ventilation for such children. Consistent, intentional approaches to decision-
making are uncommon, with nearly half of families not even recognizing there is a choice.
HomeVENT (Home Values & Experiences Navigation Track) is a deliberative decision-support process for
families and clinicians. First, HomeVENT uses a structured family deliberation for families to integrate their
home life context and values into decisions about home ventilation. This intervention is anchored in a novel
web-based tool that meets a key counseling gap: family-to-family information. Second, HomeVENT includes a
novel structured team deliberation tool to help large, multidisciplinary clinical teams jointly assess a child's
treatment options in light of the family's home context and values. Preliminary data from 30 families suggests
families and clinicians engaged in HomeVENT felt more prepared to make decisions about home ventilation.
We will recruit 150 English- or Spanish-speaking families (n=300 parents) and two clinicians per family (n=300
clinicians) in a pre/ post cluster design at 4 geographically diverse institutions. Eligibility is triggered by a child's
need for a tracheostomy/ home ventilation decision within a month. Outcomes will be assessed at 1, 6 and 12
months. The primary outcome is family preparedness for decision-making (via PrepDM); secondary outcomes
include family and clinician perception of shared decision-making, and long-term family regret and quality of
life. We will do an exploratory analysis of cases where there was conflict or challenges with the home
ventilation decision, examining child and family outcomes in these scenarios. All Aims include analysis for role
of health equity (race/ ethnicity, income, rural vs. urban) in decision-making about Pediatric home ventilation.
The impact of this proposed research will be to improve the quality of family and clinician decision-making
about pediatric medical technology—decisions needed more frequently as pediatric medical care advances.
This research, focused on home ventilation, has far-reaching potential to transform decision processes and
outcomes for children with complex illness. Findings will inform development of similar decision supports for
other technologies, from home dialysis to feeding tubes."
10886808,"Abstract
In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are a leading cause of
preventable death among young children (< 5 years of age). Severe RTIs, usually involving the lower
respiratory tract, constitute a potentially life-threatening medical problem that requires effective diagnosis
and management, including evaluation for antibacterials. At the same time, the vast majority of RTIs in young
children are non-severe and often caused by viruses. For these exceedingly common, non-severe viral RTI
cases, antibacterials are not appropriate and could cause harm. Yet in LMICs of Africa and Asia, research
studies have shown that antibacterials are prescribed for over 75% of outpatient pediatric RTI visits. RTI
management is thus highly problematic: on the one hand, a common syndrome that is grossly over-treated
with inappropriate antibacterials; on the other hand, clinicians in low-resourced LMIC settings can
understandably be concerned that withholding antibacterials could run the risk of a pediatric RTI progressing
to a severe, life-threatening condition. This K43 application presents a career development program to 1)
develop a clinical prediction rule that uses a parsimonious composite of clinical covariates and novel
biomarkers to accurately differentiate viral from bacterial RTI and to provide prognostic risk stratification of
disease severity in young children presenting to health facilities in Kilimanjaro Region, Tanzania; 2) conduct
formative social science research to understand caregiver and healthcare provider expectations, attitudes
and acceptability thresholds for withholding antibacterials in uncomplicated viral RTI; 3) use human-centered
design methodology to package the prediction rule and the attitudes, expectations and needs of caregivers
and healthcare providers into a user-friendly, effective clinical decision support algorithm that could be tested
in future studies for feasibility, safety, and efficacy. The candidate for this career development award is a
Tanzanian medical doctor with advanced training in clinical research, public health, and epidemiology. He
has conducted clinical research on RTI in Tanzania since 2016. For this mentored research award, the
candidate has assembled an exceptional team of mentors with expertise in clinical-epidemiologic research
of infectious diseases in Tanzania, clinical prediction analysis, human-centered intervention design in
Tanzania and other LMICs, as well as a collaborator with expertise in algorithm development for innovative
approaches to RTI management in LMICs. At the conclusion of this award, the candidate will have developed
unique expertise 1) in clinical prediction for infectious disease management in sub-Saharan Africa and 2)
in human-centered design of clinical decision support algorithms. He will emerge as a global leader in
intervention design for management of infectious diseases—a highly-skilled independent investigator
focused on implementation of strategies that will confront early childhood mortality and the growing threat
of antimicrobial resistance."
10887650,"MmpL3 (Mycobacterium membrane protein Large 3) is a common target of inhibitors of mycobacterial growth
identified by whole cell, phenotypic, high throughput screens. MmpL3 is a mycolate flippase that moves trehalose
monomycolate (TMM) to the pseudoperiplasmic space, from where TMM is modified to trehalose dimycolate
(TDM) and incorporated into the mycomembrane. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and M. smegmatis mmpL3
knockdown strains show that mmpL3 is essential for survival both in vitro and in mice. This phenotype makes
MmpL3 an attractive therapeutic target and supports efforts to characterize molecules targeting MmpL3. Multiple
MmpL3 inhibitors exhibit synergistic interactions with TB drugs, further supporting interest in this target.
Using an innovative combination of untargeted and targeted mutant screens, we have identified ten new and
distinct scaffolds that inhibit MmpL3 function. These compounds are bactericidal both in vitro and against
intracellular Mtb in primary murine macrophages. The inhibitors are mycobacteria specific with several showing
activity against the non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) species M. abscessus (Mab), including the HC2099
and HC2091 series. Pilot structure activity relationship (SAR) studies involving the synthesis of over 100 analogs
of HC2099 and HC2091 have identified analogs with whole cell Mtb half-maximal efficacies of ~80 nM and ~280
nM, respectively. Several analogs exhibited high solubility, stability in microsomes and no cytotoxicity in
macrophages, supporting their further development. For example, MSU-43085, an analog of HC2099, is orally
bioavailable, active against Mtb in an acute murine model of infection and has activity comparable to standard
of care drugs against Mab in vitro and in macrophages. Therefore, these series will be valuable tools to
understand inhibitor-MmpL3 structure-function interactions and as leads for new TB drug development.
Our library of MmpL3 inhibitors and mutants also will enable our team to define mechanisms of resistance in
MmpL3. Cluster analysis of cross resistance profiles, generated by dose response experiments for each
combination of 13 MmpL3 inhibitors against 24 different mmpL3 mutants, defined two clades of inhibitors and
two clades of resistant mutants. Pairwise combination studies of the inhibitors revealed antagonistic, synergistic
and additive interactions that were specific to the identified clades. Modeling of resistance substitutions to the
MmpL3 crystal structure revealed clade specific localization of the residues to specific domains of MmpL3. These
findings support our hypothesis that combinations of MmpL3 inhibitors or rationally designed molecules can be
employed to reduce the frequency of resistance.
The overall goals of this study are to: 1) optimize new MmpL3 inhibitors to define inhibitor MmpL3 interactions
and generate proof-of-concept data showing efficacy in vivo (Aim 1); and 2) define mechanisms of resistance in
MmpL3 to devise strategies to reduce the evolution of resistance and design more durable drugs (Aim 2)."

Alterations in striatal cAMP signal transduction contribute to the progression of movement disorders, whose
increasing prevalence present a significant public health concern. Therapeutic options for movement disorders
are limited in part by a deficient understanding of the molecular control of cAMP signaling in striatal neurons.
Although tremendous progress has been made in unraveling the cAMP pathway, complexity of cAMP
regulation in the striatum coupled with the large number of players with pivotal roles not yet fully elucidated has
slowed progress towards more effective care strategies. To overcome this barrier, our long-term goal is to
better understand the mechanisms and principles that control striatal cAMP signaling. The proposed work
focuses on the role of Potassium Channel Tetramerization (KCTD) proteins in modulation of striatal signaling
through G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). KCTD proteins were recently implicated in GPCR signaling
both directly by engaging with G proteins and indirectly by influencing zinc influx through zinc transporters.
However, the details of KCTD regulation of G protein signaling and consequences of zinc on striatal signaling
are only beginning to emerge. The goal of this proposal is elucidation of the KCTD-Zinc-cAMP signaling axis in
the native neuronal environment. In Aim 1, we will use biochemical assays to study negative feedback
pressure that dynamically adjusts KCTD expression in the striatum followed by optical assays to study how
KCTD regulate interaction of G proteins with effectors. Aim 2 will utilize biochemical assays and optical
sensors in live neurons to delineate precise mechanistic details of KCTD and zinc on striatal cAMP signaling.
In Aim 3, we will address how KCTDs shape native physiological signal interrogation by optically stimulating
neuromodulatory release with concurrent 2-photon imaging of signal integration across intact circuits in
genetically defined striatal neurons expressing optical sensors. In total, the proposed research is expected to
be significant in that it will provide essential mechanistic and physiological insight into the KCTD-Zinc-cAMP
impact on signaling processes critical for motor physiology."
10731369,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Thymic development is highly responsible for shaping a healthy and balanced T cell immunity. Like other
developmental processes it involves coordinated changes in the linear and three-dimensional chromatin
organization that allow stage specific transcription events. A central regulator at nearly every stage of T cell
differentiation is the DNA binding protein Tcf-1. Studies proposed here will elucidate how Tcf-1 coordinates the
action of epigenetic and transcription regulators to instruct the differentiation of CD4+CD8+ DP thymocytes. Tcf-
1 modulates the chromatin landscapes and transcription profiles directly through binding to its conserved DNA
sequence, or indirectly in association with other regulatory proteins. DP thymocytes express two forms of Tcf-
1, the full length Tcf-1p45 protein that binds β-catenin, and a short Tcf-1p38 isoform that does not. Lef-1, another
member of the Tcf/Lef family of regulators, also expressed in thymocytes has overlapping functions with Tcf-1.
In addition Tcf-1 cooperates with the HLH domain DNA binding protein HEB at the DP thymocyte stages
through the sharing of ~7000 DNA binding sites genome wide. The presence of both Tcf-1 and HEB at the
shared sites is necessary to promote chromatin accessibility and regulate gene transcription. The direct Tcf-1-
HEB binding to their conserved motifs in enhancer regions of T cell differentiation genes promotes their
expression. By contrast Tcf-1-HEB recruitment to sites lacking conserved motifs, in promoter regions of cell-
cycle genes reduces their expression and cell proliferation. Such opposing transcription outcomes likely involve
Tcf-1-HEB recruitment to DNA in the context of distinct regulatory complexes. The composition of complexes
containing Tcf-1 and HEB, the specific Tcf-1 isoform involved in each complex, and which functions are
redundant between Tcf-1 and Lef-1, still remain to be elucidated. The intricate functional co-operation between
these factors likely also involves the ability of Tcf-1 and Lef-1 to bend the DNA helix at their binding site which
may modulate the 3D chromatin conformation, and define the proximity between co-operating factors and
regulatory elements. These findings and the existing literature provide strong premise for the hypothesis that
DP thymocyte development is enabled by the cooperation of Tcf-1 isoforms with protein complexes that shape
the 3D chromatin structure to differentially regulate gene expression. Two specific aims are proposed. Aim 1
will determine the how Tcf-1p45 and, Tcf-1p33, co-operate with Lef-1 and HEB in the context of distinct regulatory
complexes to establish the epigenetic and transcription profile of DP thymocytes and control their
developmental progression. Aim 2: will elucidate the roles of Tcf-1p45, Tcf-1p33, Lef-1 with HEB shaping the
chromatin conformation, and how this function promotes DP thymocyte development. The proposed studies
are expected to highlight a completely new layer in the molecular regulation of DP thymocytes."
10731371,"A major hurdle to studying traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been disentangling the many complicating
and compounding factors that influence outcome and recovery. While extensive efforts have been placed on
delineating the impact of various environmental contributions (e.g., combat exposure, mechanism of injury,
etc.) on TBI outcome, the literature pertaining to the neurobiological underpinnings of poor clinical outcome in
the aftermath of TBI is comparatively limited. In particular, our understanding of the influence of genetic factors
on outcome and recovery following TBI is incomplete. Notably, among the studies that have examined these
relationships, findings are considerably disparate, likely due to inadequate sample sizes and therefore low
power to detect meaningful differences in TBI samples. Additionally, existing genetics studies have largely
adopted a “candidate gene” approach, focusing on a specific gene of interest, thereby downplaying the
possibility that genetic predisposition to complex traits is highly polygenic—that is, the individual contribution of
a specific gene may be slight, but the effects of multiple genes could be quite significant. Thus, not only are
adequately powered studies needed to better understand the influence of genetic markers on TBI clinical
outcome, but a crucial next step is to apply the concept of polygenic risk to TBI and conceptualize post-injury
clinical outcome as a complex polygenic phenotype. Moreover, there is accumulating evidence to suggest that
the presence of neuroendocrine abnormalities may also contribute to the heterogeneous outcomes observed
following TBI, yet these associations are also poorly understood. With this in mind, the present study is an
observational cohort study proposing to use data available from the Million Veteran Program to examine the
influence of genetic factors and neuroendocrine abnormalities on cognitive and psychiatric outcomes in
Veterans with TBI histories in order to increase understanding of the extent to which neurobiological factors
influence these important clinical outcomes post-TBI. Strengths of this proposal include (1) the use of large-
scale genetic data to expand our understanding of neurobiological factors associated with TBI outcome, (2) the
application of polygenic risk to TBI, and (3) a focus on the long-term health care outcomes of Veterans with TBI
histories. Findings from this study may have particular relevance to treatments that are currently being
developed and optimized within a precision medicine approach to target those most at risk of poor outcome.
 The applicant is currently a neuropsychology postdoctoral fellow completing the TBI/Polytrauma
Fellowship at the VA San Diego Healthcare System. Successful completion of this VA Career Development
Award-2 (CDA-2) will allow the candidate to advance toward a long-term career goal of being an independent

 Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most prevalent form of acquired epilepsy. 30% of the patients are
refractory to therapy and new treatments are urgently needed. Viral infection of the central nervous system (CNS)
is a significant cause of TLE, and, while encephalitis is an important contributor, the mechanisms of how
inflammation leads to seizures is unclear. Using the first mouse model of viral-induced TLE, which was developed
by our laboratory, we found that induction of acute seizures is associated with blood peripheral macrophage
infiltration into the brain and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, primarily IL-6.
 Through RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of infiltrating macrophages isolated from the brains of TMEV-infected
mice at the peak of seizure activity, I found that a population of CNS-infiltrating macrophages expresses high
levels of the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM1). Activation of TREM1 leads to the
secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Increased TREM1 expression is associated with inflammatory
conditions, and inhibition of TREM1 function ameliorates inflammation and disease severity in several animal
models of inflammatory diseases. However, the involvement of TREM1 in the development of acute seizures is
unknown. In Aim 1 I will determine the time course of TREM1 expression in brain-infiltrating macrophages, and
address whether genetic and pharmacological inhibition of TREM1 decreases the development of acute seizures
in TMEV-infected mice, via videoEEG. The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, which is mainly produced by brain
infiltrating macrophages during TMEV infection, plays a pivotal role in inducing seizures; however how IL-6 does
it is unknown. In Aim 2, I will determine whether IL-6 induces downregulation of neuronal GABA receptors, via
biotinylation assay, and address which IL-6 pathway (classical or trans-signaling) is involved in acute seizures.
Since inflammatory macrophages in the brain are associated with generation of acute seizures in TMEV-infected
mice, in Aim 3 I will determine whether skewing macrophages towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype will affect
the development of acute seizures, via videoEEG. I will also identify microRNAs in brain-infiltrating macrophages
that are driving inflammation during the course of acute seizure generation in TMEV-infected mice. VideoEEG
and receptor biotinylation assay are critical techniques I will learn during my mentored phase (Aim1/Aim2a), that
will be essential to carry out experiments in Phase II (Aim2b/Aim3). These new skills, combined to my previous
training, will put me in a unique position to address crucial questions related to neuroinflammation and epilepsy
in my own laboratory using cutting edge approaches, and will substantially impact my research and career.
 These aims will improve the knowledge of the relationship between inflammation and seizures, and has the
great potential of revealing inflammatory macrophages as a novel therapeutic target of neuroinflammation,
allowing for the development of novel intervention to prevent and treat the development of acquired epilepsy."
10865039,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In this proposed work, we seek to understand the cellular identity of macrophages, the main immune cells in the
cochlea, in noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Our previous studies have shown that macrophages in the brain
have different developmental origins and their origin is associated with differences in their cellular identity and
functions depending on each disease condition. At present, the cellular identities and functional properties of
macrophages after noise damage are not well understood. Combining macrophage fate-mapping analysis with
single-cell RNA sequencing, our preliminary data revealed that cochlea macrophages during embryonic
development and in healthy adult are from two distinct origins. In-depth transcriptional analysis of cochlea
macrophages at single-cell resolution in steady state demonstrated the presence of several transcriptionally
distinct clusters of macrophages with specific biological functions. Based on this data and our previous work on
brain macrophages, we hypothesize that macrophages from different origins are involved in NIHL depending on
the age of the animal and stage of the disease (acute, recovery or recovered). Their distinct developmental origin
results in transcriptional diversity and differential responses to noise damage. Our findings will contribute to the
understanding of cochlea macrophage heterogeneity and functions in relation to their ontogeny after noise
damage. Defining the origins and differential gene expression and functions of cochlea macrophage populations
will help us to refine our understanding of the role of these cells in different stage after noise damage and enable
us to design new molecular and cellular therapies based on targeting inflammation.
Specific Aim 1: Identifying the cellular origin of cochlea macrophages in young adult and aged mice exposed
to noise damage.
Specific Aim 2: Identifying mechanisms by which macrophages contribute to NIHL through single-cell RNA
sequencing of macrophage populations present in cochlea."

We hypothesize that patient-derived models can be used to identify more effective treatments for metastatic breast
cancer that can be predicted using molecular biomarkers, and that these models can be used to accurately predict
and interrogate treatment resistance. We will use our large collection of PDX, organoid, and tissue slice culture
models established from patients at different stages of treatment (including longitudinal samples and
primary:metastatic pairs from the same patient) to investigate new therapies. We will capitalize on our new, very
extensive dataset of NCI-IND drug responses in tumor organoids isolated from PDX (PDxOs): We have screened
nearly 100 PDxO models comprising all breast cancer subtypes, each with 40-50 drugs. Effective “lead” therapies
have been validated in vivo in PDX models; there is high concordance between organoid and PDX data. Omics
data are available on all of the models, and are being used to identify biomarkers associated with responders or
non-responders, for each lead therapy. We will apply new computational algorithms to this rich dataset to
prioritize drugs that can be used in combination with standard therapy, or in combination with each other. The
primary outcome of this study will be new NCI-IND treatment regimens for metastatic breast cancer, using
patient-derived models as a preclinical tool to (1) evaluate the efficacy of many drugs and drug combinations
across a large number of different patients’ tumor models, and (2) identify the biomarkers of responding and non-
responding breast cancers for new therapies, in order to better inform clinical trial design."

 Although significant progress has been made treating melanoma, less than 30% of patients achieve long-term
responses and almost 70% of patients are resistant to any approved therapies including immunotherapies and targeted
therapies. Therefore, novel strategies to overcome intrinsic and acquired drug resistance are sorely needed.
This Patient Derived Xenograft (PDX) Development and Trial Center (T-PDTC) research project will capitalize
on our extensive collection of >500 clinically annotated and molecularly characterized PDXs to develop functional
precision therapies to offset melanoma drug resistance. Our working hypothesis is that the tumor’s genomic,
molecular and drug response profiles in organoids and PDXs can be leveraged to develop clinically
translatable precision therapies. We also posit that our pre-clinical pipeline will identify markers to select tumors that
are most likely to respond to a given treatment, offsetting drug resistance and achieving long-term responses, with no
overt toxicity. We expect that our pre-clinical studies will help prioritize the clinical testing of targeted agents for
the treatment of melanoma.
 Our melanoma PDX collection has been extensively characterized for growth properties, metastasis
formation, somatic mutations through targeted and whole exome sequencing, RNA expression and expression
of ~500 proteins related to signal transduction. Our models are superbly suited to investigate combination
therapies to overcome or prevent drug resistance as they represent the heterogeneity of melanoma. To do this,
two Specific Aims are proposed: Aim 1, will test the hypothesis that drug resistant melanomas harboring a
transcriptional signature termed ‘innate anti–PD-1 resistance signature’ (IPRES+), which is associated with resistance
to anti-PD1 and MAPK inhibitors, will respond to the combination of BET and MEK inhibitors. We will optimize this
treatment regimen and further define markers of response and resistance. For IPRESNeg tumors, we will integrate
genomic, transcriptional and proteomic analyses to pair tumors with drugs matching their molecular profile; this
will allow for establishing optimal combination and dosing strategies. In aim 2, we will conduct temporal and
spatial transcriptomic and proteomic analysis to identify and profile drug tolerant subpopulations. Our goal is to monitor
treatment response and intervene with combinations aimed at killing both the bulk of the tumor and rare drug
tolerant/persister subpopulations preventing the emergence of resistance. We anticipate that our studies will provide
critical information needed to translate effective and long-lasting precision therapies from the bench to bedside and
improve the outcomes of melanoma patients."
10911354,"Project Summary – Project 2
 Melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer and is only second in the number of life-years lost per cancer-
related death in the US. Although targeted therapies with combinations of BRAF and MEK inhibitors
(BRAFi+MEKi) achieve very high clinical response rates in BRAFV600-mutant melanoma, ultimately ~80% of
patients develop resistance. Notably, there are no approved targeted therapies for BRAFWT melanoma patients.
Further, only ~40% of metastatic melanomas achieve durable responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Thus,
there is a significant unmet clinical need to identify novel strategies to prevent/counteract resistance to clinically
approved targeted therapies in BRAFV600-mutant melanoma patients, and to develop effective therapeutic
approaches for BRAFWT cutaneous and non-cutaneous melanomas like acral melanomas which are under-
represented in clinical studies. Therapeutic resistance in melanoma is mostly mediated by proteins that prevent
apoptosis of the tumor cells and promote their survival. Therefore, to address the unmet needs for melanoma
therapy, we will develop personalized therapeutic approaches targeting aberrant anti-apoptotic pathways driving
drug resistance. We hypothesize that inhibiting survival mechanisms in targeted therapy-resistant
melanoma will sensitize them to undergo apoptosis, leading to tumor regression. We will test this
hypothesis with two aims. Aim 1, is based on our preliminary results showing that BRAFV600-mutant melanoma
PDXs with high MCL1 are resistant to BRAFi+MEKi. Our preliminary studies also show that MCL1Hi tumors are
sensitive to MCL1 inhibition. We will optimize MCL1 inhibition in combination with MAPKi to overcome drug
resistance. In Aim 2, we will exploit the presence of somatic mutations in DNA damage repair (DDR) genes in
BRAFWT melanomas and will determine the efficacy of DDR inhibitors in PDXs selected based on alterations in
DDR genes. Importantly, as a large percentage of acral melanomas are BRAFWT and are resistant to current
therapies, we will include acral melanoma PDXs in this study and determine the therapeutic value of DDR
inhibitors. For both aims, we will use a novel in vitro MicroOrganoSphere platform (Xilis Inc.) and in vivo tumor
growth inhibition studies in our large collection of molecularly characterized PDXs, to identify the most effective
treatments that can be translated into future clinical trials. We will then perform whole tumor/spatial/single cell
molecular analyses on responders and non-responders to identify biomarkers of response and resistance. To
achieve these goals, we have assembled an outstanding team of investigators with diverse and complementary
expertise. Together, our expertise and resources will facilitate optimization and prioritization of the best
combination treatments to effectively address the two urgent unmet needs for melanoma patients."
10732762,"Project Summary/Abstract
The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans relies on small-molecule signals to control its development, metabolism,
physiology, and behavior, and these signals play conserved roles in many parasitic nematode species. This
MIRA application outlines our ongoing efforts to understand the structures, biosynthesis, and mechanisms of
several important classes of small-molecule signals, including (1) the ascarosides – a broad family of
pheromones secreted by C. elegans that the worm uses to induce the stress-resistant dauer larval stage and to
coordinate various behaviors, (2) the N-acyl glutamine nacq#1 – a pheromone that males preferentially secrete
to counter the effects of dauer-inducing ascarosides on hermaphrodites and promote reproductive development,
and (3) the nemamides – a family of hybrid polyketide-nonribosomal peptides that serve as hormones in the
worm and promote starvation survival through a poorly understood mechanism. We target the biosynthetic
pathways to these signaling molecules in vivo by generating precise mutations in the worm genome using
CRISPR-Cas9 and analyzing the effects of these mutations on the primary and secondary metabolome of the
worm using comparative metabolomics. This approach enables us to map the biosynthetic pathways to these
natural products, to identify additional signaling molecules produced by these pathways, and to determine how
these pathways intersect with other metabolic pathways in the worm. We rigorously confirm the role of specific
enzymes in the pathways by reconstituting the pathways using in vitro enzymatic assays, organic synthesis of
biosynthetic intermediates, and structural studies. With the support of this award, we will investigate the
biosynthesis and mechanism of the nemamides, as well as the biological roles of the two essential and enigmatic
neurons where the nemamides are produced, the canal-associated neurons (CANs). We will use nemamide
biosynthesis, which requires genes that are distributed throughout the worm genome, to understand how the
biosynthesis of complex secondary metabolites is controlled in the context of an animal system. Furthermore,
we will investigate how this biosynthetic pathway intersects with the biosynthetic pathways of other secondary
metabolites, including the ascarosides and nacq#1. A central focus will be how the worm regulates the
production and trafficking of these different small-molecule signals in response to different factors and
environmental conditions in order to coordinate its development, metabolism, and physiology. This work will
provide insights into how C. elegans and other nematode species use small-molecule signals to control important
conserved downstream signaling pathways, such as the insulin pathway. Furthermore, given the conservation
of these small-molecule signals in parasitic nematode species, this work will provide new chemical tools and
strategies to interfere with the life cycles of those nematodes."

Glioblastomas (GBMs), neoplasms composed of glial cells and their precursors, are among the deadliest primary
brain cancers, and are incurable with current therapies. There is an urgent unmet clinical need for new treatments
for GBM and related high-grade malignant gliomas. GBM tumorigenicity is often driven by genetic aberrations in
receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as EGFR, and the Pi-3 kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. Through our
team’s collaborative translational research efforts, we discovered that the YAP and TAZ transcription co-
activators, effectors of the Hippo pathway that promote gene expression via TEAD co-factors, as key drivers of
GBM tumorigenicity downstream of oncogenic EGFR signaling. In testing YAP/TAZ function, our team
discovered that pharmacologic inhibition of YAP/TAZ with the FDA-approved drug verteporfin (VP) potently and
specifically provokes growth arrest and cell death of EGFR-mutant/amplified GBM cells, but spares normal
neural stem cells. VP inhibits YAP and TAZ by blocking their association with TEAD co-activators, which bind to
DNA. We found that VP specifically suppressed expression of YAP/TAZ transcriptional targets, including EGFR,
and that VP treatment conferred significant survival benefits in an orthotopic GBM xenograft model and a mouse
genetic GBM model. Our results led us to perform a phase 0 clinical trial of VP in patients with recurrent GBM,
which showed that VP is absorbed in GBM tumor cells and that VP induced changes consistent with inhibition
of YAP/TAZ function. Based on our results, we have initiated a phase 1/2 clinical trial of VP to determine optimal
dosing of VP in GBM patients. Here, we propose to investigate the therapeutic potential of YAP/TAZ inhibition
and to capitalize our VP clinical trials, we propose to Aim 1) Identify YAP/TAZ target genes that underlie the
epigenetic basis of YAP/TAZ dependency in GBM progression, Aim 2) Determine mechanisms of adaptation to
YAP/TAZ inhibition and verteporfin resistance in pre-clinical GBM models in order to identify epigenomic
adaptations specific that allow GBM stem cells to escape therapeutic targeting, and Aim 3) Evaluate the impact
of verteporfin combined with anti-angiogenic therapies on GBM stem cells and the tumor microenvironment in
immunocompetent mouse models and in specimens from human patients on our clinical trial of VP. The broader
goals of this project are to establish a basis and strategies for therapeutic targeting YAP/TAZ activity in GBM
using repurposed VP as a treatment for GBM."

Impaired tendon biomechanical function reduces mobility and quality of life for the majority of the ~30 million
Americans with diabetes, resulting in a substantial economic burden to these individuals and society. Any new
approach to enhancing tendon function in people with diabetes is hindered by a poor understanding of the
underlying etiology of impaired tendon biomechanical properties. Critically, the role that various serum factors
play in the development of tendon complications in individuals with diabetes remains unclear. Our
multidisciplinary research team hypothesizes that increased serum advanced glycation end-products (AGEs),
with subsequent activation of receptors for AGEs (RAGE), is a principal mechanism driving tendon
complications with diabetes. Specifically, activation of RAGE impairs tenocyte function resulting in loss of
collagen fibril organization and subsequent impairment of biomechanical function. AGEs accumulate in the
serum of patients with diabetes. Our preliminary cell culture work shows that treating tendon-derived cells with
AGEs, which cannot form collagen crosslinks, adversely affects critical aspects of tendon ECM maintenance.
We have also found that AGEs promote an environment favoring tendon ECM degradation. Utilizing human
subjects, we demonstrate that increasing serum AGE concentrations are associated with declining tendon
biomechanical properties (e.g., modulus). Serum AGEs can interact with RAGE to promote inflammation and
oxidative stress, but such a connection to changes in tendon ECM organization and biomechanical function
impairment has not been established. This project aims to 1) delineate the role of serum AGEs and activation
of RAGE in promoting tendon ECM disorganization and impairment of biomechanical properties and 2)
determine the relationship of serum AGEs to in vivo tendon biomechanical properties and in vivo indicators of
tendon collagen fibril organization. Filling these gaps will promote new approaches for improving tendon
function and reducing this challenging clinical condition's economic and social burden. Using a mouse model
with an inducible RAGE deletion and a model of type 2 diabetes, we will assess the effects of chronically
elevated serum AGEs on tendon ECM organization and biomechanical function and the involvement of RAGE
in this process. We will use novel ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods to determine the
relationships between serum AGE concentrations, in vivo tendon modulus, and MRI indicators of tendon ECM
organization. We expect this work to show that AGEs via RAGE signaling are a principal mechanism driving
changes in tendon ECM and subsequent reduction in biomechanical function in patients with diabetes.
Defining the role of serum AGEs and RAGE signaling in the development of the diabetic tendon phenotype will
provide an avenue to evaluate novel treatment approaches to reduce the impact of tendon complications in
patients with diabetes. Our proposal fits NIAMS's mission of developing treatment strategies for tendon-related
injuries. Our project addresses NIDDK’s mission of developing strategies to prevent and treat complications of
diabetes."

The importance of understanding the neurobiology of social behavior is underscored by the fact that social
interactions permeate nearly every aspect of human life. How we are raised, our interactions with peers,
romantic relationships, parenting our own children. All these relationships impact our quality of life, and atypical
social interactions can have devastating consequences both for individuals and their social networks. The
negative impact of disrupted social behavior can lead to and exacerbate health problems, whereas positive
social interactions and supportive environments can improve health outcomes. Better understanding of neural
mechanisms underlying social behavior, a key objective of strategic goals laid out by the National Institute of
Mental Health, will help identify targets for treatment of underlying causes that disrupt behavior and motivate
new ways of using social interaction itself as a therapeutic intervention to improve health outcomes. Decades
of research have shown unequivocally that the neuropeptide arginine vasopressin (Avp) impacts both pro-
social (e.g., parental care, juvenile play, pair-bonding, and social memory) and anti-social (e.g., aggression and
territorial flank-marking) behaviors in numerous mammalian species, but mechanisms by which Avp impacts
social behavior are not fully understood creating a critical gap in knowledge. Anatomical studies of Avp neuron
projections suggest that Avp producing neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and medial
amygdala are likely to be involved in the regulation of prosocial behavior given that their targets include brain
regions associated with motivated behavior, emotional state, and reward (e.g., the mediodorsal thalamus, the
target of proposed studies). A central hypothesis is that activation of Avp-responsive (i.e., Avp 1A receptor-
expressing, Avpr1a) neurons in brain regions controlling motivation and emotion promote pro-social behavior
(i.e., increase interest in social stimuli and engagement in non-aggressive behaviors) and decrease anti-social
behavior (i.e., social avoidance and display of aggressive behaviors). To test this hypothesis and discover
underlying mechanisms, 3 Aims are proposed. Proposed experiments make use of a newly characterized
mouse model that allows genetic access to Avpr1a-expressing cells enabling selective targeting and
differentiation between Avpr1a and non-Avpr1a neurons. In Aim 1, electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and
viral tracing strategies will be used to identify the fundamental electrical behavior, gene expression patterns,
and connectivity of mediodorsal thalamus Avpr1a neurons, a previously unexplored neuronal subtype. The
mediodorsal thalamus is a down stream target of the dopamine reward system, is innervated by the BNST Avp
system, and through its projections to the medial prefrontal cortex influences memory, cognitive flexibility, and
decision-making, all critical to the expression of social behaviors. Then, a chemogenetic loss-of-function
strategy will be used to directly assess the role of the mediodorsal thalamus Avpr1a neuron subtype during
social interactions (Aim 2) and tests of cognitive behavior (Aim 3)."
10875588,"Fungal pathogens cause a tremendous health burden worldwide and are associated with over 1.5 million deaths
per year globally, eclipsing or equaling malaria, TB, or HIV. The last several decades have seen a shift in the
epidemiology of Candida infections, with a decreased incidence of pan-sensitive C. albicans and a concomitant
increase in non-albicans Candida species, such as C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis, which either have reduced
intrinsic sensitivity to commonly used antifungals or can rapidly acquire drug-resistant mutations. Echinocandins
are inhibitors of b-glucan synthase (GS) that are cidal in Candida and well tolerated by patients and are thus
used as first-line agents for invasive Candida infections, especially in light of increasing insensitivity to azoles in
species such as C. glabrata. However, resistance to echinocandins is also increasing, and in C. glabrata it is the
highest among major Candida pathogens (including C. auris). Clinical echinocandin resistance (ECHR) is
associated with mutations in genes encoding GS, FKS1 and FKS2, and C. glabrata can rapidly evolve ECHR
mutations both in vitro and during patient treatment. However, the cellular mechanisms underpinning this rapid
emergence of resistance are not well understood. Previously, we described a universal paradigm for fungi, in
which drug exposure by a cidal agent effectively kills susceptible cells but leaves a sub-population of viable non-
growing cells that are drug-tolerant. Ultimately, some drug-tolerant cells escape drug action by forming heritable
drug resistant mutations. We have identified the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and macrophages as important in-host
niches of echinocandin-tolerant C. glabrata, in which ECHR mutants form. We have also shown that the evolution
of resistance to the echinocandin caspofungin in the GI tract is more complex than was previously appreciated,
involving formation of mutations in FEN1, a sphingolipid biosynthesis gene. Importantly, we also identified fen1
mutations in multiple clinical isolates, where they contribute to reduced caspofungin susceptibility. Finally, we
discovered that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are formed in C. glabrata cells during echinocandin treatment.
However, genes involved in ROS detoxification are downregulated, and deletion of several such genes greatly
induces the formation of ECHR mutations, suggesting that ROS induction is a programmed C. glabrata response
that may promote the emergence of resistance. In this grant we propose to use transposon insertion screening
to comprehensively identify C. glabrata vulnerabilities specific to the host niches where echinocandin tolerance
and resistance occur (Aim 1), to comprehensively define the clinically relevant mutational routes to tolerance
and resistance against multiple echinocandins in the gut (Aim 2), and to use accurate multidisciplinary
complementary approaches, including electron paramagnetic/spin resonance (EPR/ESR) and in vivo ROS
reporters, to clearly identify the type(s) of ROS, their role(s), and their source(s) in C. glabrata during
echinocandin treatment (Aim 3). By identifying and validating cellular vulnerabilities important for drug tolerance,
it will be possible to devise intervention strategies downstream that prevent resistance."
10928819,"Significant progress in subcutaneous insulin administration (SIA) technology has been realized over the
past two decades. Nonetheless, SIA technology failure and underlying tissue damage caused by insulin
phenolic preservatives (IPP) present in all commercial insulin formulations could impede the progress of
SIA technology. Limited wear time accompanied by SIA device site rotation are the current solutions to
minimizing tissue damage and maintaining infusion or injection site integrity over time. These practices,
while ultimately beneficial, will not allow for drug delivery devices to perform beyond the current
recommended wear time of three days. Extending SIA technology to align with current continuous
glucose monitoring sensors, approved for 10-14 days of wear, is a significant unmet need. Challenges
to extending the lifespan of infusion pumps or injection ports involve surmounting the IPP-induced tissue
reactions of inflammation and fibrosis at these devices’ location. Insulin formulations are also susceptible
to mechanical and chemical stressors that lead to non-functional insulin molecules through
polymerization designated as insulin fibril formation (IDF), even in the presence of IPP. Our published
and preliminary data indicate that both, IPP and IDF, are pro-inflammatory. This pro-inflammatory
response leads to cumulative cell/tissue toxicity, inflammation, and maladaptive wound healing. To
overcome this challenge, we opine that optimum IPP reduction and IDF removal at the time of insulin
dosing, in-line and just in time, rather than focusing on the preparation of new insulin formulations
provides a more elegant solution. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to design, fabricate and
validate an in-line ß-cyclodextrin-based adsorbents platform that 1) can reduce IPP levels in
commercial insulin formulations, and 2) remove any IDF formation in-line and in a “just in time” mode,
i.e., just before SIA. Commercial insulin formulations passed through this platform are able to mitigate
blood glucose levels without triggering acute and chronic SIA-induced inflammation and fibrosis. This
would achieve physiological euglycemia, while preserving long-term tissue integrity at SIA site. To
achieve these goals, we have developed the following three specific aims: 1) Design and evaluate ß-
cyclodextrin-based adsorbents in insulin phenolic preservative removal platforms, 2) Design and evaluate
micro/ultrafiltration-based membranes (MFM) as IDF removal platforms, and 3) Preserve long-term tissue
integrity and bioactivity during SIA through usage of ß-cyclodextrin-based adsorbent (beads and MFM
filtration) platforms in a pre-clinical porcine model. Ultimately, the successful accomplishment of this
project could result in transforming current diabetes management practices that would achieve the goals
of increasing the lifespan of insulin infusion devices and most importantly, sustaining tissue site viability
for future recurrent insulin administrations."
10873281,"Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are class C G protein coupled receptors that function as dimers.
While mGluRs are known to form homodimers, more recent work has shown that they can also heterodimerize,
but not promiscuously. Because mGluRs exhibit widespread expression in the brain and regulate excitability
and plasticity, they have become candidates as druggable targets for a variety of pathologies. To date
however, excitement generated by preclinical data has not resulted in mGluR-targeting therapies in the clinic,
despite a wealth of available ligands with good selectivity targeting these receptors. Our recent work examining
mGluR2/4 heterodimers provides a possible explanation: ligands that are highly efficacious when targeting
homodimeric receptors are often without effect when the same receptor is expressed as a heterodimer with
another mGluR. Further complicating matters, these changes in pharmacological responses observed in
mGluR2/4 heterodimers are not generalizable to all mGluR heterodimers, or even all mGluR2 containing
heterodimers. Thus, to understand how any mGluR ligand will function in the brain, we must examine the
pharmacological responses of each possible heterodimer pair in isolation. But this is complicated because
every mGluR can also form homodimers, so any pair of expressed mGluR will have an unknown propensity to
homo- and heterodimerize. To solve this problem, we have designed a novel dimer composition control system
using a combination of ER retention sequences paired with orthogonal, split inteins, self-excising protein
sequences, that will allow expression of pure populations of nearly wild type mGluR dimers of known
composition. We plan to generate a comprehensive ligand vs. mGluR dimer atlas to be used to not only aid in
interpretation of experimental data but also to improve therapeutic strategies targeting mGluRs for a range of
pathologies. To accomplish these goals, we will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1, T To build and
characterize the full complement of tagged mGluRs using the split intein-ER retention strategy, 2, To
employ an adapted CODA-RET approach to obtain parallel heterodimer specific G protein recruitment data,
and 3, To systematically assess the pharmacological responses of each probable mGluR dimer pair to
selective agonists, competitive antagonists, PAMs and NAMs."
10931621,"Metastasis is the primary cause of cancer death, yet therapeutic strategies to inhibit metastatic invasion do not
exist. The long-term goal of our research program is to define the molecular mechanisms driving metastatic
invasion, with the goal of identifying novel therapeutic targets and strategies to improve cancer survival. While
tumor cells are known to undergo metabolic reprogramming to support tumor growth, the metabolic drivers of
metastasis are poorly understood. This proposed research will define how stored lipids are used as a fuel
source to power metastatic invasion in pancreatic cancer. We have preliminary data that pancreatic tumor cells
undergo a shift towards lipid storage, and that this is required for invasion. This occurs through a suppression
of the hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) by the oncogene KRAS, leading to lipid accumulation and priming tumor
cells for metastasis. These stored lipid droplets are then catabolized during the process of invasion via the
action of lipases. This results in increased oxidative metabolism in the most migratory cells, thereby
coordinating lipid droplet breakdown and fatty acid oxidation with cell migration. These data lead to the
hypothesis for this proposed research that PDAC cells undergo a metabolic shift to favor the accumulation
and storage of lipid droplets, which are catabolized during invasive migration to fuel oxidative phosphorylation
to power metastasis. Using a combination of cell biology, biochemistry, and in vivo models, we will test this
hypothesis by defining the mechanisms of lipase suppression leading to lipid droplet storage (Aim 1), and the
coordinated and localized activation of lipolysis to drive tumor cell invasion (Aim 2). Successful completion of
this research will provide fundamental advances in defining the metabolic pathways regulating invasive
migration, with a focus on lipid droplets, and with the goal of identifying metabolic vulnerabilities in tumor cells
that will provide targets for therapy to block metastasis and improve survival."

invariably to acquired resistance. Similarly, colorectal and thyroid cancers with BRAFV600E are largely
resistant to RAF inhibitor treatment. Several studies have demonstrated that intrinsic or inhibitor-induced
BRAFV600E dimerization plays a key role in the resistance mechanism. In melanoma, BRAFV600E usually
acts as an active monomer, however, in a significant subset of tumors active spliced BRAFV600E dimers
mediate primary resistance. Likewise, in large portions of upstream RAS-activated cancers like colorectal and
thyroid, BRAFV600E dimers are promoted and the above drugs are ineffective. In light of the clinical relevance
of BRAFV600E dimers to drive resistance in several tumors, we are currently in pressing need to develop
novel inhibitors that target potently and specifically active BRAF dimers. We recently demonstrated the
correlation of structural and biochemical effects of RAF inhibitors with their clinical manifestations. Using this
knowledge, we initiated a systematic quest for novel inhibitors that specifically recognize BRAFV600E dimers.
We discovered that Ponatinib, an FDA-approved drug, is such an inhibitor. In extensive preliminary studies, we
characterized the effect of Ponatinib in melanoma, colorectal and other cancers and obtained its co-crystal
structure with BRAFV600E and BRAFWT. Remarkably, the BRAF/Ponatinib structures demonstrated a
perfectly symmetrical BRAF dimer and an allosteric inhibitor-binding mode, unprecedented for any BRAF
inhibitor to date. Our observations generate an exceptional opportunity for drug design towards next-
generation allosteric BRAF inhibitors that specifically inhibit BRAF dimers. Based on these observations, we
created a ponatinib-hybrid compound, determined its co-crystal structure and validated its biochemical and
cellular activity. Our results demonstrate excellent potency and specificity for BRAFV600E dimers compared to
BRAFV600E monomers and provide a solid basis for the development of such first-in-class allosteric BRAF
inhibitors. In this proposal, we will 1) design and synthesize ponatinib-hybrid compounds that bind to the novel
allosteric pocket of BRAF and display improved binding and specificity to BRAFV600E dimers and desirable
ADME properties, 2) robustly validate and optimize the potency and specificity of allosteric BRAF inhibitors in
biochemical, biophysical and cellular experiments and 3) investigate the cellular mechanism of action of
improved allosteric BRAFV600E inhibitors and their therapeutic potential in mouse tumor models. This project
will investigate a broadly unmet therapeutic opportunity, namely the pharmacological targeting of BRAFV600E-
dimerization dependent tumors that are resistant to current treatments."

Chronic neurologic injuries and diseases such as spinal cord injury (SCI), multiple sclerosis (MS), and
Parkinson's disease (PD) often cause chronic bladder dysfunction termed `neurogenic bladder' (NB). Over
400,000 people are estimated to be living with NB in the U.S. The VA provides a significant amount of services
for these patient populations, due to its unique focus on coordinated, lifelong care for Veterans with complex,
chronic disabling conditions. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common complications in patients with NB and
can cause pyelonephritis, sepsis, kidney stones, and, rarely, death. UTI management is challenging because
bacteria frequently colonize a neurogenic bladder without infection, a situation called “asymptomatic
bacteriuria” (ASB). Furthermore, UTI symptoms are often atypical in patients with NB due to impaired bladder
sensation. Antibiotic treatment of UTIs is critical, however routine treatment of ASB is not beneficial and may
lead to harm. Despite this, many patients with NB due to SCI, MS, and PD are managed improperly with high
rates of unnecessary and/or inappropriate antibiotic use. [Improper UTI management directly impacts patient
rehabilitative health, functioning, and quality of life via the long-term and profound adverse consequences of
antibiotic resistance and antibiotic overuse.] However, the association of UTI management with patient-
reported rehabilitation outcomes has not been well-studied or clearly delineated.
 Support from the CDA2 will provide Dr. Fitzpatrick with the necessary foundation for a successful career as
a VA [rehabilitation researcher focused on implementing interventions to improve Veteran rehabilitative health
by optimizing infectious diseases management and antibiotic use in patients with NB due to complex, chronic
neurologic injuries and diseases.] Appropriate UTI management and avoidance of unnecessary antibiotics is
critical to ensure the delivery of high quality, safe care for these high-priority patients. This innovative project
will study a cohort of patients with NB [due to SCI, MS, and PD] cared for at a range of VA hospitals of varying
geographic locations and sizes. It aims to characterize variations in care provided for ASB and UTI and
associate them with key provider and patient characteristics using a retrospective cohort study with electronic
health record data. It further aims to use qualitative methods to assess patient knowledge, attitudes, beliefs,
and expectations regarding ASB and UTI and measure UTI-related patient-reported rehabilitation outcomes. In
this way, the project represents a critical step forward in developing a patient-centered approach to ASB and
UTI management. Results from this project will be used to support Dr. Fitzpatrick's VA Merit Review
application to develop a multimodal patient-centered intervention to [improve functional and patient-reported
rehabilitation outcomes via improved ASB and UTI management in patients with NB.] The specific components
of the intervention will be informed by data acquired in this project and targeted to key patients and care
settings associated with high rates of inappropriate management. Results from this study will also inform future
efforts to use electronic health record data to [develop computable phenotypes for ASB and UTI in patients
with NB] which will aid future research and quality improvement projects related to improved ASB and UTI
management. Therefore, completion of this CDA2 project is expected to provide the critical groundwork leading
to successful interventions for ASB and UTI management that improve health, functioning, and quality of life of
for Veterans with NB due to chronic neurologic injuries and diseases."
10738273,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by the presence
of circulating autoantibodies to nucleic acids and to proteins with which they associate. Signaling through the
nucleic acid sensing TLRs, TLR7 and TLR9, is critical in SLE pathogenesis, and dysregulated TLR signaling
can promote lupus in humans and in mouse models. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) and B cells both
express these nucleic acid sensing TLR and are important in SLE pathogenesis. Autoreactive B cells produce
pathogenic autoantibodies in SLE, and B cell antibody production is promoted by TLR7 and TLR9 signaling.
pDC use TLR7 and TLR9 to respond to nucleic acids in immune complexes resulting in the secretion of large
quantities of type I IFN cytokines, which have pleiotropic effects on the immune response, including enhancing
dendritic cell (DC) maturation, plasma cell formation, and T cell responses, all of which can promote a feed
forward loop of immune activation. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which TLR7 and TLR9
signaling are regulated in these two critical cell types is important for understanding the pathogenesis of SLE
and in defining therapeutic targets for this disease. We have identified the signaling adapter B cell adapter for
PI3-kinase (BCAP) as a key modulator of TLR signaling in multiple immune lineages. First, we found that in
macrophages BCAP inhibits TLR-induced inflammatory cytokine production via activation of PI3-kinase. We
recently showed that BCAP promotes pDC IFNα, but not IL-6, secretion. We have also begun to examine how
BCAP regulates B cell TLR7/9 responses, an understudied area. Our preliminary data show that BCAP is a
key regulator of B cell TLR7/9 responses in all B cell subsets, with a particularly striking decrease in
proliferation and IgG secretion from splenic marginal zone B cells. Additionally, we have found that BCAP-
deficiency protects the TLR7.1 mouse lupus model from disease. Together, our findings show an important
role of BCAP in endosomal TLR signaling in pDC and B cells, both important in SLE pathogenesis. Given the
importance of TLR7 and TLR9 signaling in both B cells and pDC in SLE, the premise of this application is that
BCAP regulation of pDC and B cell TLR7/9 signaling is critical in the development of lupus-like disease.
Specifically, we will 1) determine the mechanism by which BCAP regulates TLR7/9-induced IFNα production in
pDCs, 2) determine the mechanism by which BCAP regulates B cell TLR7/9 responses, and 3) determine the
relative contribution of BCAP in pDCs and B cells to lupus-like disease using two mouse models."

Immune system dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several age-related lung diseases.
Interestingly, multiple recent studies have identified the tissue microenvironment as playing a critical role in the
pathogenesis of some of these age-related immune system changes. The lung mesenchyme provides a
supportive niche for the resident immune system. Therefore, to identify aging-related changes in the lung
mesenchyme that might contribute to immune system dysfunction, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing
of lung mesenchyme from aged versus young mice, identifying evidence of nuclear-factor kappa-B (NF-kB)
activation in aged relative to young adventitial fibroblasts. NF-kB is an important regulator of inflammation and
cellular senescence, a multifaceted cellular stress response characterized by several features including
permanent cell cycle arrest, expression of the cell cycle inhibitor 16INK4a, and a complex secretory profile known
as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Using a novel p16INK4a reporter mouse to identify cells with
senescent features in vivo, we found that p16INK4a+ lung fibroblasts were enriched for NF-kB activation and
accumulated in the parenchyma with age. Therefore, to study the effects of mesenchymal NF-kB activation in
regulating the immune system, we used a genetic model to conditionally delete Tnfaip3, which encodes an
important negative regulator of NF-kB signaling, from the mesenchyme. Preliminary data in this proposal
demonstrates that mesenchymal deletion of Tnfaip3 leads to the accumulation of CD8+ T cells within the lung
adventitial mesenchyme of young mice, and that these T cells transcriptionally resemble an aging-associated
CD8+ T cell population (Taa). Therefore, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that NF-kB activation
within senescent fibroblasts plays a direct role in driving lung Taa accumulation. Aim 1 is to identify the
contribution of lung fibroblast senescence to Taa formation using our novel p16INK4a+ reporter mouse. Aim 2
focuses on identifying the mechanism by which mesenchymal NF-kB drives Taa formation, and Aim 3 will
determine the functional consequences of Taa formation in the setting of viral pneumonia.
 The training plan for this proposal has been developed to achieve Dr. Allen’s goal of becoming an
independent physician-scientist studying the interactions between the lung mesenchyme and immune system
in health and disease. The plan involves formal didactics, conferences, mentorship, and hands-on experience
though which Dr. Allen will develop expertise in cellular senescence, adaptive immunity, mouse models of
pulmonary infection, the lung mesenchyme and associated epithelial stem cell nice, as well as responsible and
effective research practices. She will be supported by a strong mentorship team with expertise spanning lung
biology, cellular senescence, tissue resident lymphocytes, and NF-kB signaling. With completion of this Career
Development Award Dr. Allen will have made valuable contributions to the understanding of lung immune
system aging, and will be well-prepared to launch her independent career."
10734064,"ABSTRACT
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonize the nasopharynx and GI tract of healthy
individuals and of patients admitted to hospitals. Colonization is the key risk factor for community-acquired and
hospital-acquired MRSA invasive diseases. MRSA infection is associated with treatment failure, increased
morbidity, and increased mortality. Prior attempts to develop vaccines or immune therapeutics that can prevent
MRSA colonization or invasive disease or that improve the outcome of MRSA infections have failed. Infected
individuals cannot develop protective antibody responses (immunity), which enables MRSA to persist within
host tissues and to cause recurrent disease. MRSA immune escape is based on immunoglobulinbinding
proteins, specifically staphylococcal protein A (SpA) and staphylococcal binder of immunoglobulin (Sbi). SpA
and Sbi block effector functions of human IgG by binding to the Fcγ domain of antibodies. SpA also binds to
the variant heavy chains of VH3-idiotypic immunoglobulin and crosslinks IgM B cell receptors, thereby
activating B cell proliferation and the secretion of VH3-clonal antibodies that fail to recognize MRSA. This B cell
superantigen activity (BCSA) of SpA is essential for the diversion of antibody responses during MRSA
colonization and invasive disease. Here we describe a monoclonal antibody, MAb 3F6, that binds and
neutralizes SpA and Sbi. We show that MAb 3F6 galactosylation at Fcγ promotes C1q binding, MAb 3F6-
dependent opsonophagocytic killing (OPK) of MRSA and protection of mice against MRSA bloodstream
infection. Further, we isolated amino acid substitutions in Fcγ that abolish SpA and Sbi binding and enhance
the OPK activity of variant MAb 3F6. We also report that SpA is essential for suppression of antibody
responses (BCSA) against bacterial colonization factors, thereby enabling S. aureus persistence in the
nasopharynx and GI tract. Intravenous administration of MAb 3F6 into mice neutralizes circulating SpA and
blocks its BCSA, thereby promoting antibody responses against bacterial surface antigens and the removal of
S. aureus from the nasopharynx and GI tract. Here, we will test the hypotheses that intravenous administration
of glyco- and Fcγ-engineered human 3F6-IgG1 in preclinical models a) elicits broad spectrum antibody
responses against S. aureus, b) promotes decolonization of MSSA and MRSA, c) induces immunity to prevent
re-colonization as well as invasive MSSA and MRSA disease, and d) improves the outcome of MRSA
bloodstream infections. Glyco- and Fcγengineered 3F6 antibodies that achieve such product profile can be
developed further for clinical testing to prevent and treat MRSA infections in American hospitals."

Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are an essential part of peripheral tissues by regulating tissue homeostasis,
immunity and inflammation. Peripheral ILC populations undergo spontaneous and induced attrition over time
and should be replenished to maintain their normal numbers and subset composition. Bone marrow (BM) is the
major site that produces ILC progenitors for peripheral tissues. The first step to deliver ILC progenitors into
peripheral tissues is the mobilization of ILC progenitors from the BM, and this presumably requires regulated
emigration of ILC progenitors from the BM and their ultimate trafficking into various peripheral tissues.
Unfortunately, we hardly understand how various ILC progenitors are mobilized from the BM and
characteristically distributed to various peripheral tissues in steady state and how these processes are
altered in inflammatory conditions. The overarching objective of this project is to understand the
mobilization and trafficking of BM ILC progenitors.
 Several important questions arise in terms of the mobilization and migration of central ILC progenitors:
Which progenitors dominantly emigrate from BM to generate peripheral ILC subsets? Are they multi-potential
and/or committed progenitors? What are the mechanisms and signals that trigger their emigration? How do
these progenitor cells in the blood circulation enter distinct peripheral tissues? Is the migration mechanism
universal or specific for each progenitor subset or tissue site? How do inflammatory signals alter the
mobilization and migration patterns of ILC progenitors, and can we control tissue ILC activity in pathogenic
conditions by utilizing mobilized BM ILC progenitors or targeting their mobilization and migration?
 We devised the following specific aims to investigate these questions regarding the mobilization and
trafficking of ILC progenitors. Aim 1. Identify the underlying mechanism for the retention vs. emigration of
BM ILC progenitors; Aim 2. Investigate how the retention vs. emigration of BM ILC progenitors is
regulated by the circadian rhythm; Aim 3. Identify inflammatory signals that regulate the retention vs.
emigration of BM ILC progenitors; Aim 4. Identify the homing behavior and trafficking receptors of
emigrated ILC progenitors. The project will generate fundamental knowledge on how the peripheral ILC
system is regulated by the mobilization and potentially selective trafficking of ILC progenitors into peripheral
tissues. The outcomes will greatly enhance our understanding of the maintenance and regulation of
peripheral ILCs and will provide novel insights into therapeutic utilization and control of ILC
progenitors."

Genome-wide studies have now identified hundreds of thousands of associations between genes or genetic
loci and human phenotypes, each of which could reveal mechanistic insights about disease biology. Yet, the
cell-type specific functions of most of these genes remain unknown, and we currently lack the ability to connect
these genes into cellular programs and thereby reveal the pathways important for disease. To address this
limitation, our proposed Data Analysis and Validation Center aims to work together with the MorPhiC
Consortium to build a Catalog of Cellular Programs — i.e. a map of which genes work together in biological
pathways and their corresponding multimodal molecular and cellular phenotypes, in defined cell types or
states.
Our team brings a diverse set of expertise in computational genomics, methods and technology development,
experimental design, interdisciplinary collaboration, consortium organization; and includes new junior
investigators who will bring new forward-thinking ideas and tools to MorPhiC. We have developed a wave of
innovative methods integrating CRISPR, single-cell, imaging, and human genetics data that will enable building
such a Catalog of Cellular Programs and applying this Catalog to understand the genetics of human disease.
The goals of our Center are to: (i) Define single-layer phenotypes, by applying a suite of computational
state-of-the-art approaches for analysis and modeling of RNA, ATAC, and imaging data; (ii) define a
multi-modal representation of molecular and cellular phenotypes, by identifying modules of features that
co-vary across perturbations and single cells; (iii) build a Catalog of Cellular Programs that links genes to the
molecular and cellular phenotypes they control, by inferring causal gene regulatory networks from perturbation
data; (iv) apply the Catalog of Cellular Programs to demonstrate its utility identifying causal genes and
programs for human diseases; and (v) participate in Collaborative Activities with MorPhiC, including to guide
experimental design and ensure utility, robustness, and interoperability of Phase 1 datasets.
Together, these aims will develop novel computational toolkits to infer causal gene regulatory networks from
multi-modal perturbation data; construct a Catalog of Cellular Programs as a foundational resource for
MorPhiC and the broader community; and demonstrate the utility of this Catalog through application to
understand the genetics of human diseases."
10912788,"In the US, more than 15,600 nursing homes (NHs) provide long-term care to more than 1.3 million elderly
adults, of whom about 20% are racial and ethnic minorities. About 40% of NH residents have advanced
illness, and prior to the pandemic more than 27% of all deaths in those ages 65 years or older occurred in
NHs, making high-quality end-of-life (EOL) care critical. Prior research has found racial and ethnic disparities
in NH EOL care. Hospice, a government benefit, allows for EOL care to be provided by a specialist
interdisciplinary team. Timely hospice enrollment is a best practice and is recommended for NH residents with
advanced illness. However, of those dying in NHs only 1/3 enroll in hospice, and 30% of the enrolled residents
receive hospice care for less than a week. Concerns about disparities in NHs related to implicit bias, systemic
racism, and structural racism increased with the pandemic. During 2020, racial and ethnic minority NH
residents were disproportionately affected by COVID-19 as mortality rose by 32%, yet hospice use decreased
in most states. There are gaps in knowledge about racial and ethnic disparities in NH hospice enrollment, the
quality of hospice care provided, and related EOL outcomes. How the pandemic impacted hospice use and if
any related changes were long lasting is also unknown. To address these gaps, we propose a sequential
explanatory mixed methods study guided by Donabedian's Structure, Process, and Outcomes Quality
Framework and the NIMHD Minority Health and Health Disparities Framework. Our aims are to: 1) Identify
racial and ethnic differences in hospice enrollment and the quality of hospice care provided over time, factors
that influence these differences, and how COVID-19 changed these differences; 2) Identify racial and ethnic
differences in NH EOL outcomes over time, factors that influence these differences including hospice
enrollment and the quality of hospice care, and how COVID-19 changed these differences; and 3) Describe
perceived facilitators and barriers that contribute to hospice use and quality of hospice care in racial and
ethnic minority NH residents. To achieve Aims 1 and 2, we will use administrative and publicly available data
from 2015 to 2024, including the Minimum Data Set and Medicare hospice and inpatient claims (n ≈ 8 million)
of NH residents who died and a subset of this sample who enrolled in hospice (n ≈ 2 million). We will include
all available racial and ethnic categories and comprehensive measures of hospice enrollment, hospice quality
of care, and EOL outcomes. To meet Aim 3, we will purposively sample 16 NHs that vary in location, are
either high or low users of hospice, and ≥ 30% of residents are racial or ethnic minorities. We will conduct
semi-structured interviews with an administrator, hospice care planner, and 2 family caregivers of racial/ethnic
minority decedents (i.e., one that used hospice and one that did not) from each NH. Results from this study
will inform evidence-based policies at the national, state, and NH level and influence practice-based initiatives
that can promote equitable access to high-quality hospice for diverse Americans living and dying in NHs."

Thiol isomerases (TIs) represent a previously unrecognized layer of regulation of thrombus formation. The role
of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family TIs in thrombosis has now been shown in animal studies using
genetically modified mice, antibodies that block TI activity, and small molecule antagonists of TIs. We have used
a PDI inhibitor prophylactically in a phase II study of patients with advanced malignancy to reduce cancer-
associated thrombosis. Yet despite the rapid progress in the therapeutic development of PDI antagonists, a
comprehensive explanation of how TIs promote clot formation has yet to emerge. TIs are fundamentally
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) redox sensors. Fueled by the oxidative environment of the ER, they use oxidants to
generate disulfides in nascent proteins. The studies described in this application will evaluate whether this
fundamental property of PDI family TIs powers their prothrombotic potential by translating vascular oxidants into
a thrombotic response. We will evaluate the hypothesis that oxidants generated in disease states promote
PDI sulfenylation and formation of oxidized PDI (oxPDI), which promotes thrombus formation through
disulfide formation in extracellular substrates. How the redox environment induces oxidative cysteine
modifications in PDI, which in turn control PDI function and enables PDI to oxidize thrombotic targets, will be
assessed using novel probes of cysteine modifications and chemical-proteomic approaches (Aim 1). These
experiments will define the cysteine modifications that PDI undergoes in the circulation and identify substrates
oxidized by oxPDI during platelet activation. Approaches described in Aim 2 will use structure-function studies
of PDI mutants and smFRET to define the molecular determinants of oxidant-induced disulfide formation in PDI.
PDI mutants deficient in oxidant-induced disulfide formation will be used in murine models of thrombus formation
to determine the role of oxidant-induced PDI disulfide formation in thrombosis. How oxPDI is released into the
extracellular environment to interact with the thrombotic machinery will be determined by evaluating the role of
the unfolded protein response (UPR) in promoting thrombus formation in an alveolus-on-chip model of pulmonary
inflammation (Aim 3). These studies will define specific UPR and TI pathways that activate coagulation and
determine how their activation causes a prothrombotic transformation of endothelium that results in
microvascular occlusion. The premise that inhibition of UPR receptors such as IRE1a, PERK, and ATF6 impairs
thrombus formation will be tested. Similarly, PDI and ERp46 will be evaluated as antithrombotic targets. This
program will test a new model by which to conceptualize the function of TIs in thrombus formation based on
understanding of determinants of redox environment and TI cysteine modifications. Validation of this model will
lead to the identification of new biomarkers and therapeutic targets for managing thrombotic disease in the
context of oxidant stress."
10896445,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Drug-resistant epilepsy is seriously debilitating and very common, affecting about one-third of the 1-2% of people
who experience epilepsy during their lifetime. One of the most effective treatments for drug-resistant epilepsy is
dietary therapy, in the form of a very-low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet. Despite its effectiveness, this diet is not
very widely used because of the stringency of the diet and the high commitment required of clinicians and other
caregivers. It would be very valuable to understand the mechanism by which altered metabolism produces
resistance to epileptic seizures, to “reverse-engineer” it, and to discover alternative pharmacologic ways of
tapping into this potent and apparently unique anti-seizure mechanism.
We have identified a mouse model that recapitulates the seizure resistance seen in ketogenic diet, but that
involves a mutation in a single gene, Bad. The seizure resistance in this genetic model is due to alteration in
brain cell metabolism, with less glucose utilization and better utilization of alternative fuels such as ketone bodies,
similar to the metabolic changes on a ketogenic diet. We have also discovered a downstream mechanism that
is altered both by Bad alteration and by ketogenic diet: a metabolically sensitive class of ion channels, the ATP-
sensitive potassium channels (KATP channels), become more activated in response to metabolic changes. These
channels are critical for seizure resistance of the Bad-altered mice, and we have also found that they are
responsible for anti-seizure effects of BAD knockout in a brain slice model of seizure.
Recent findings reveal that BAD knockout produces specific changes in core carbon metabolism – specifically
in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) – and that direct manipulation of the PPP can recapitulate the cellular
changes in KATP channel activity that underlie the metabolic seizure resistance in BAD knockout. We propose
to test two complementary hypotheses of how altered PPP activity can signal to KATP channels, and distinguishing
these hypotheses is important because they make opposite predictions for how antioxidants, alternative neuronal
fuels, and oxidative signaling may alter the antiseizure effects both in BAD knockout and in dietary treatment.
One hypothesis focuses on the reduced ability in BAD knockout for the neuronal PPP to produce NADPH, which
is central to cellular antioxidant function; this could make native reactive oxygen signaling more effective. The
second hypothesis is that it is not the reduced ability to produce the NADPH byproduct, but rather the reduced
substrate flux through the PPP that alters downstream energy metabolism. We will also expand our in vivo
studies, testing the ability of BAD and PPP manipulation to affect seizures in a chronic mouse model of epilepsy,
Together these studies will reveal the mechanistic basis of metabolic seizure resistance, and will point toward
new therapeutic avenues for drug-resistant epilepsy."
10877769,"CD4 T cells are essential for protection against tuberculosis (TB). But current approaches to TB therapy have
not harnessed their potential benefit, and the mechanisms they use to control Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)
have not been completely defined. At the peak of adaptive immunity to TB, millions of Mtb-specific CD4 T cells
traffic to the lungs, but very few of them re-encounter their cognate antigen to become activated. The ability to
clearly discriminate and isolate these few activated cells from the greater population of inactive CD4 T cells could
enable the discovery of important new markers, effector functions, and clonally expanded T cell receptor (TCR)
sequences closely associated with protective immunity. To study activated CD4 T cells from Mtb-infected lungs,
we used a new approach that combines: (i) a reporter mouse to identify cells actively receiving TCR stimulation
in vivo (Nur77-GFP); (ii) BSL3-contained fluorescence cell sorting to isolate them live from tissues; and (iii) single
cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) with CITE-Seq and TCR immune-profiling to interrogate their function and
antigen-specificity. In our preliminary work, we discovered that Nur77-GFPHI CD4 T cells express an array of
activation markers and costimulatory receptors including OX40. This population was enriched for T regulatory
cells and effector T cells with TCR clonotypes localizing to lung parenchyma. Using adoptive transfer, we found
that Nur77-GFPHI cells are more protective than their Nur77-GFPLO counterparts. To therapeutically harness
activated CD4 T cells in vivo, we treated Mtb-infected mice with a monoclonal antibody that agonizes OX40 and
found that this treatment reduced the lung bacterial burden, prolonged survival of infected mice by >100 days
and did not cause toxicity. Immunotherapy specifically targeting activated CD4 T cells is a novel approach to TB
treatment that has not been thoroughly investigated. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will define the function of
activated CD4 T cells in the lungs of Mtb-infected mice using scRNA-Seq and CITE-Seq. With adoptive transfer
and scTCR-Seq, we will uncover how antigen specificity shapes the function and fate of different CD4 T cell TCR
clonotypes throughout chronic infection. We will use TCR sequences we generate to develop TCR retrogenic
mice that can identify protective Mtb antigens and test the hypothesis that antigen specificity shapes T cell
phenotype in TB In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanisms underlying activation marker immunotherapy
mediated CD4 T cell control of TB. We will test the hypothesis that OX40 agonist treatment provides protection
by selectively modulating the function of both activated T conventional and T regulatory cells. Finally, we will
determine how OX40 agonism impacts activated CD4 T cell survival through chronic infection. The studies
proposed here represent the first high-definition characterization of the small population of activated CD4 T cells
at the site of Mtb infection and the first study exploring the potential of OX40 activation marker targeted
immunotherapy in the mouse model of TB. This project will elucidate new mechanisms that may inform the
development of more effective TB vaccines and lead to new therapeutic approaches to improve TB treatment."

Schizophrenia is a debilitating disorder whose treatment has stagnated over the last several decades. Despite
some success in treating its positive symptoms (hallucinations and delusions), ~40% of patients are
treatment-resistant and almost all exhibit cognitive dysfunction. Targeting cognition in schizophrenia is a huge
unmet public health need, with a potential to restore around 1% of global population to the workforce.
Abnormal prefrontal cortex (PFC) function is known to be central for the cognitive deficits in schizophrenia,
but recent evidence suggests additional abnormalities in the interactions between the PFC and its major
subcortical partner, the mediodorsal thalamus (MD). This idea is supported by studies showing reduced
structural and functional connectivity between these two structures in patients and in relevant animal models.
This proposal aims to build a basic science and translational foundation around the idea that rescuing MD-
PFC interactions is a viable strategy for cognitive enhancement in schizophrenia. We are motivated by our
generation of new mouse models based on the SCHEMA study, which offer a strong genetic link to the illness,
and with the development of new tasks that can selectively access different funcitonal features of this circuitry
in intact animals. In Aim I, we will characterize one SCHEMA model, the Grin2a halpoinsufficiency in two
distinct switching tasks that rely on MD-PFC interactions, identifying funcitonal signatures of this networks
dysfunction that can be targeted by rescue methodology. In Aim II, we will ask whether the preliminary deficits
observed in Grin2a mice generalize to two other models, Gria3 and Setd1A, along with a broader
characterization of structural and functional features of their MD-PFC network. In Aim III, we will perform deep
molecular characterization of the MD, identifying novel cell types using scRNA sequencing and validation with
MERFISH. Lastly, in Aim IV, we will use CELLREADR technology to drive opsins in promising cell types to
identify future targets of intervention in these animal models."
10897951,"Alkaline diets and alkalemia have a profound impact on potassium homeostasis, but the underlying
mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we propose an innovative plan to close this significant
knowledge gap, building on our recent discovery of a long sought-after electroneutral potassium transport
pathway. Our data reveal that dietary alkaline loading stimulates the expression of the electroneutral KCl
cotransporter, KCC3a (Slc12a6), in parallel with the Cl-/HCO3- exchanger, pendrin (Slc26a4), on the B-
type intercalated cell apical membrane and the activation of the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride, NCC
(Slc12a3), in the Distal Convoluted Tubule. Here we advance the overarching hypothesis that KCC3a is
the long sought-after electroneutral potassium secretory pathway and propose the novel idea that coupling
between KCC3a, pendrin, and NCC maintains potassium and acid-base balance in response to the
consumption of alkaline and potassium-rich foods but drives potassium wasting in alkalosis. This new
model will be rigorously tested by a multidisciplinary team of experts, combining state-of-the-art cellular
biology and physiological phenotyping in novel genetically engineered mouse models. Aim 1 will test the
hypothesis that KCC3a is activated in response to the consumption of alkaline diets and alkalosis to drive
urinary potassium excretion. Intercalated-cell-specific KCC3 knockout mice will be investigated to a) test
the contribution of KCC3 to potassium balance and b) to pendrin-mediated HCO3- secretion; c) elucidate
the molecular mechanisms that underlie the regulation of KCC3 expression; c) test if KCC-specific
inhibitors prevent the loss of K+ in alkalemia. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that pendrin is co-activated with
KCC3a to increase KHCO3 secretion. Pendrin knockout mice will be studied to determine: a) the
contribution of pendrin to the regulation of KCC3a; and b) the physiologic consequences of uncoupling the
transporters. We will also explore if KCC3a regulates pendrin through changes in pendrin transcription that
involve changes in intracellular chloride. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that alkalosis drives WNK-SPAK
mediated phospho-activation of NCC to ensure electroneutral potassium bicarbonate secretion prevails
over electrogenic potassium secretion. Newly developed DCT-specific loss and gain of SPAK mice and in
vitro cell models will be examined to rigorously test this idea and explore the mechanism. In summary, this

preserved with the consumption of alkaline and potassium-rich foods, typical of the paleolithic and

potassium wasting in alkalosis, opening a new therapeutic horizon."

The intestinal epithelium regulates the development of adaptive immunity to gut microorganisms, yet little is
known about the underlying mechanisms. Filling this knowledge gap is crucial, as many human intestinal
diseases arise from dysregulated intestinal immunity. Dietary vitamin A absorbed by the intestinal epithelium is
essential for key intestinal adaptive immune responses, including the homing of T and B cells to the intestine
and immunoglobulin A production. These vitamin A-dependent immune responses depend on specialized
intestinal myeloid cells that enzymatically convert the vitamin A derivative retinol to retinoic acid (RA). In the
previous project period we unraveled a molecular mechanism by which intestinal myeloid cells acquire retinol.
We discovered that serum amyloid A (SAA) proteins – microbiota-inducible epithelial cell proteins – are retinol
chaperones that deliver retinol to myeloid cells via the endocytic receptor LRP1 (low density lipoprotein-related
receptor 1). We found that this mechanism is essential for the development of intestinal adaptive immunity and
for immune protection against pathogenic bacterial infection. This R01 renewal application will build on these
findings to further define the biochemical, cell biological, and microbiological mechanisms that regulate retinol
delivery to intestinal myeloid cells and thus promote vitamin A-dependent immunity. In Aim 1, we will determine
how SAA-retinol complexes are assembled and secreted from intestinal epithelial cells. In Aim 2, we will identify
the SAA-LRP1 interface and determine its importance for myeloid cell retinol uptake and vitamin A-dependent
immunity. In Aim 3, we will define the role of the intestinal microbiota in regulating myeloid cell retinol acquisition
and vitamin A-dependent immunity. These studies will provide mechanistic insight into how vitamin A is mobilized
to intestinal immune cells and advance our understanding of how the gut microbiota regulates the intestinal
adaptive immune system. Our findings will help identify new strategies for inhibiting or enhancing vitamin A
mobilization to the intestinal immune system in order to treat infection and inflammation."
10857213,"Project Summary
T helper type 2 (Th2) cells play a crucial role in allergies, humoral immunity and host protection against
parasitic infections, but our understanding of the mechanism of their differentiation remains incomplete. Upon
encountering a cognate antigen presented by dendritic cells (DCs), naive CD4T cells make a fate decision to
become one of the effector cell types such as Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells. However, unlike their differentiation
into Th1 or Th17 cells, in which IL-12 and IL-23 play a crucial role, respectively, the DC-derived fate
instruction signal universally required for Th2 differentiation has not been identified.
CD301b (Mgl2) and its human homolog CLEC10A are selectively expressed by a major subset of type 2
conventional DCs in the dermis and other peripheral organs. We previously developed mouse models in
which CD301b+ DCs are depleted, enriched or genetically manipulated and demonstrated that CD301b+DCs
are both necessary and sufficient for the Th2 cell differentiation upon exposure to a protease allergen papain
in the skin as well as after infection with a hookworm Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. Interestingly, the depletion
of CD301b+DCs results in a shift of the effector CD4T cell phonotype from Th2 to Th1 and Th17 phenotype,
suggesting that CD301b+ DCs regulate the effector cell fate at the clonal level. The molecular mechanism for
the Th2 fate instruction by CD301b+DCs still remains unclear, but our data indicate the requirement of
cognate interactions between CD301b+DCs and antigen-specific CD4T cells. Thus, we hypothesize that
CD301b+ DCs imprint the Th2 fate on CD4T cells mainly through a contact-dependent, rather than soluble,
mechanisms.
In this application, we aim to address the following two questions by vigorously characterizing the CD4T cell
differentiation kinetics in our unique mouse models: (1) What is the CD4T cell-intrinsic, Th2-skewing signal(s)
imprinted by CD301b+ DCs?; and (2) How do CD301b+ DCs instruct antigen-specific CD4T cells to become
Th2 cells? Answering these questions will deepen our basic understanding of the in vivo mechanism of the
initiation of a Th2 response and help us to develop a unified model that comprehensively explains the role of
DC subsets in CD4T cell differentiation. Understanding such mechanism would help us to improve our
strategies for treating allergic diseases and developing effective vaccines for infectious diseases."
10880703,"In spite of antiretroviral (ART) drugs which effectively control plasma viremia, a pool of HIV latently infected cells
form a persistent reservoir that prevents clearance of virally infected cells. Upon cessation of ART treatment,
this reservoir leads to a rapid rebound in plasma viremia, even if ART is initiated early during acute infection.
Eradicating or permanently silencing this reservoir is the focus of many HIV cure strategies. Immune dysfunction
including impaired T cell responses are a hallmark of HIV disease. Immune directed cure strategies seek to
overcome this dysregulation to restore normal immune function and promote killing of HIV infected cells. The
limited clinical efficacy of immune-based cure strategies to date suggests that there may be more to restoring
immune function than targeting T and B cells. We hypothesize that cure strategies which activate and
restore normal innate and adaptive immune function will more effectively reduce the HIV reservoir and
limit viral rebound after cessation of ART. To test this hypothesis, we will employ an expansive multi-Omic
platform consisting of virological, immunological and molecular assays to define the role of simultaneous re-
invigoration of the innate and adaptive immune systems by 3 distinct cure strategies on HIV reservoir dynamics
and viral rebound after discontinuing ART. The first strategy (Project 1) will investigate how co-treatment with
Lefitolimod (innate immune TLR9 agonist) and broadly neutralizing antibodies promotes clearance of the HIV
reservoir by priming innate immune responses and providing the antibodies to target infected cells using Fc-
mediated innate immune effector functions. The second strategy (Project 2) will test how blockade of the PD-
1/PD-L1 signaling axis by monoclonal antibody therapy leads to enhanced inflammatory monocyte/macrophage
responses and restored CD4 and CD8 T cell function. The third strategy (Project 3) will study how engraftment
with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells expressing the CCR5D32 mutation or autologous infusion of CCR5
deleted CD4+ T cells repopulate the immune compartment with functional effector cells that are refractory to HIV
infection leading to killing of the HIV reservoir and a lack of viral rebound. For all Projects, we will define how
differences in the host environment resulting from host and microbial metabolites modulate the immunological
mechanisms identified to mediate clearance of the HIV reservoir and/or limit viral rebound. Analysis of results
will be performed by a dedicated Machine Learning and Modeling Core. This core will ultimately be responsible
for generating integrated multi-Omic network models which predict the microbiome/metabolite features which
directly regulate the immune mechanisms associated with reduction in either the HIV reservoir or viral rebound;
both within each cohort/Project and across Projects to identify common features to multiple strategies. Our team
of experts have collaborated extensively and are uniquely positioned to complete the goals of this program."

Since 2002, the NIDDK has sponsored four phases of the prospective Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort
(CRIC) Study, which enrolled a combined cohort of >5400 adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) at seven
Clinical Centers across the U.S. to address the overarching goals of identifying risk factors for CKD
progression and clarifying the relationship between kidney dysfunction and the risks of subclinical and clinical
cardiovascular events, death, resource utilization and other patient-centered outcomes. The most recent
Phase 4 (ending June 2023) has further innovated on remote data collection methods and more granular
investigation of kidney function trajectories and cardiovascular sub-phenotypes across the spectrum of CKD
severity. The proposed CRIC Phase 5 will leverage the cumulative experience, expertise and success of the
CRIC Study network by creating mechanisms for future data collection and analyses and generating tools and
resources for ongoing use of the extensive longitudinal CRIC data and biospecimens. CRIC Phase 5 will
strengthen the existing unparalleled resource for the broader research community that will enhance the
science related to CKD to achieve the ultimate goal of improving clinical and patient-centered outcomes. The
Kaiser Permanente Northern California/University of California, San Francisco (KPNC/UCSF) Clinical Center
has been a leader within the CRIC Study and the Specific Aims to be addressed in CRIC Phase 5 by the
KPNC/UCSF Clinical Center are:
1. To complete clinical outcome ascertainment for the CRIC participants enrolled in the sub-protocols initiated
during Phase 4, including in-home testing of kidney function and damage and ambulatory measures of cardiac
arrhythmias and cardiovascular reserve
2. To complete follow-up of eligible CRIC participants
3. To conduct analyses that integrate the data collected through the Phase 4 sub-protocols with previously
collected data and outcomes to identify novel risk factors and sub-phenotypes for CKD progression,
cardiovascular and other outcomes
4. To facilitate linkages with external data sources to allow acquisition of additional data for future
investigations
5. To transfer data and collect and ship biological specimens to the CRIC Scientific and Data Coordinating
Center for transfer to NIDDK Central Repository to support future research
6. To promote dissemination of tools to facilitate the use of CRIC resources by investigators in the broader
scientific community during and beyond the end of the CRIC Study"

10930918,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome (UCPPS) represents the most common type of chronic visceral pain
disorder. Although dysregulation of peripheral inputs from the viscera likely account for a number of the
symptoms UCPPS, a failure to understand and treat central nervous system (CNS) changes likely prevents
complete recovery for affected patients. The long-term goal of our lab is to understand the extent to which
areas in the brain are responsible for the development and maintenance of persistent pain and accompanying
affective disturbances that exist within urologic conditions. Recent evidence has suggested that the central
amygdala in the CNS may be an important locus for the interaction between visceral pain and anxiety,
potentially serving as a driver for chronic conditions like UCPPS. By determining the role of the amygdala in
animal models of bladder pain, insight will be provided into the underlying physiology of the human condition.
Evidence from human and animal models has shown that the left and right amygdala may differentially
regulate pain. Variances in left and right hemisphere activation are well described in human language
production, visual processing, and complex planning tasks. Functional lateralization exists in emotional
processing areas of the brain, including the amygdala, across multiple taxa where the right brain serves as a
reactive center to stress and injury. This conservation suggests that lateralization of limbic circuits is an
evolutionarily important phenomenon. The idea that dysregulation in lateralization might also play a significant
role in disease is a novel concept with clinical relevance. UCPPS patients show lateralized changes in
amygdala gray matter and lateralized amygdala functional connectivity to other areas in the CNS. We recently
identified a key molecular mediator through which lateralization of the amygdala modulates bladder pain bi-
directionally in mice depending on the side of the brain this neuropeptide is applied. The objective of this
proposal is to dissect the impact of this neuropeptide during the transition of acute to persistent bladder pain in
a rodent model including exploring the efferent circuits from the amygdala that mediate brain-induced
analgesia or hyperalgesia for bladder pain. This objective will be met through three distinct but complementary
specific aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the extent to which the development of persistent bladder pain alters
left versus right amygdala lateralization. In Aim 2, we will manipulate specific efferent outputs from the
amygdala to identify the unique analgesic versus hyperalgesic pathways. In Aim 3, we will incorporate new and
existing physiology data to develop a realistic 3-dimensional computational model of the amygdala that can be
used to predict laboratory results to progress bladder pain studies and therapies. Overall, this proposal will
help determine the extent and mechanisms of amygdala activation during painful bladder stimulation and the
mechanisms by which an overactive amygdala may contribute to bladder pain as seen in UCPPS."
10861876,"Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Ap) is an obligate intracellular bacterium that causes the emerging and potentially
fatal infection, human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA). The microbial-host interactions that facilitate Ap
intracellular proliferation and dissemination have remained poorly characterized. We uncovered a novel role for
the host bioactive sphingolipid, ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P), as a regulator of Golgi fragmentation. Specifically,
C1P activates a PKC/Cdc42/JNK signaling axis that phosphorylates GRASP55 (Golgi reassembly stacking
protein 55 kDa) to destabilize the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and amplify TGN anterograde traffic. We determined
that Ap infection upregulates C1P synthesis and induces Golgi fragmentation in a C1P signaling-dependent
manner. Multivesicular bodies (MVBs) are endosomal sorting stations that receive Golgi traffic. MVB limiting
membrane invagination and scission deliver cargo into the MVB in intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). ILV membranes
are enriched in cholesterol, sphingolipids, and sphingolipid metabolic enzymes that promote cholesterol release
from ILVs. MVB fusion with the plasma membrane releases ILVs as exosomes, which induce a battery of
responses in recipient cells including signaling, immunity, and inflammation. The importance of exosome-
mediated cell-to-cell communication in infectious disease is just beginning to be appreciated. We discovered that
Ap resides in a pathogen-modified MVB that receives sphingomyelin-rich TGN cargo as ILVs. The bacterium
coopts MVB lipid metabolic machinery to parasitize sphingolipids and cholesterol, which is essential for its growth
and conversion from its replicative to infectious form. Consistent with MVB exosome release, the Ap vacuole
fuses with the plasma membrane in a Rab27a-dependent manner to disperse infectious progeny to naïve cells.
We also found that Ap alters exosome content. In this competitive renewal, we will interrogate our hypothesis
that Ap induces C1P to destabilize the Golgi and promote TGN-to-ApV trafficking of SM-rich vesicles that enables
Ap to parasitize host lipids for proliferation and dissemination. We will also test our hypothesis that Ap modulates
the proteomic and lipidomic content of ILVs that, when released as exosomes together with progeny bacteria,
synergistically benefit infection of naïve cells and/or contributes to immunopathology associated with HGA.
Completing the Aims herein will yield one of the most refined models for intracellular bacterial pathogenesis,
further illuminate our newly discovered roles of C1P as both a regulator of Golgi stability and microbial target for
host modulation, and further understanding of how exosomes contribute to pathogenic processes."
10930052,"Abstract
Opiates are the cornerstone of analgesic therapy, but also produce numerous side effects.
Besides their high propensity for addiction, repeated opioid administration leads to progressive
sleep disorders, expressed as worsening insomnia and daytime sleepiness/sleeping. Opioid-
induced sleep disorders (OISDs) are strong predictors of multi-substance use disorders, and
psychiatric comorbidities including suicidal ideation. The primary target of opioid analgesic
drugs is the µ-opioid receptor (MOR). MORs are widely expressed within the sleep/wake
circuitry, therefore systemically delivered opioids might interfere with sleep at multiple sites of
action. Importantly, no consensus has been reached on which specific CNS sites
therapeutic or abused opioids act upon to trigger OISD, nor do current therapies
specifically address OISD.
Melanopsin-expressing, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) synchronize
the sleep/wake schedule to environmental cycles of light/darkness (“photoentrainment”) by
sending light-evoked spike trains to the brain in humans and most mammals. Our recent work
demonstrated that ipRGCs express MORs by which MOR-selective agonists directly inhibit the
light responses of ipRGCs. Furthermore, we have shown that upon chronic, systemic delivery,
morphine accumulates in the eye, and acts on MORs expressed by ipRGCs to alter the
regular rhythm of sleep/wake while contributing to the chronic morphine-triggered
behavioral sensitization.
The objectives of the current proposal are to analyze whether kinetics of opioid deposition in the
eye along with specifics of MOR signaling in ipRGCs directly contribute to the gradually
worsening OISD. We will also test if antagonist of MORs delivered in engineered nanoparticles
into the eye can reduce OISDs. The results will provide a mechanistic description of a novel
neural pathway by which systemically administered opioids alter sleep/wake cycle. Additionally,
the results will show the feasibility of using intravitreal MOR selective antagonists to reduce the
severity and inherent comorbidities of sleep disorders in patients receiving long-term opioid
therapies."
10867415,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global public health concern. Despite effective vaccines to prevent this
disease, current approved treatment rarely leads to a complete cure. There is an unmet medical need for
developing new therapeutics for HBV infection that can lead to a sustained response. Targeting HBV capsid
assembly process has become an emerging strategy for developing new antiviral treatment for HBV. However,
many efforts have been made by using different capsid protein (Cp) constructs expressed in Escherichia coli to
mimic or reconstitute native-like viral particles. Yet, these structures cannot correctly represent the native HBV
conformations due to the lacks of nucleic acid binding domain of the Cp, viral genome, and viral enzymes, all of
which are required for viral replication. Furthermore, the lack of post translational modifications of the Cp also
hampers the interpretation between observed Cp structures to the biomedical data obtained from the mammalian
cell culture system or experimental animals. To date there is no available high-resolution native HBV structures,
which is a major gap in knowledge of the HBV field.
In this proposal, we aim to use cryo-electron microscope (cryo-EM) to directly characterize the structures of
native HBV capsids and virions from human cells. In Aim 1, we will determine the high-resolution structures of
purified intracellular HBV capsids with different types of viral genome. We will address the key questions
concerning the structural dynamics of HBV capsids during genome maturation. We will also determine the
structure of the HBV reverse transcriptase (RT) and its location during reverse transcription to help understand
its mode of action (whether the RT is static or moves). In Aim 2, we will investigate the high-resolution structures
of secreted HBV virions. This aim will address the questions concerning how HBV capsids interact with the viral
envelop proteins. Finally, experimental findings from these two Aims will be integrated to elucidate capsid
dynamics during HBV replication and illuminate the molecular determinant(s) of HBV envelopment.
This proposal is expected to solve 4 types of intracellular HBV capsid structures (empty, RNA-filled, single-
stranded DNA-filled, and mature partially double-stranded DNA-filled capsids) and 3 secreted enveloped HBV
virion structures (empty, mature, and prematurely secreted virions) using cryo-EM to define the conformational
changes of the capsid during viral replication, particularly in the context of different viral genome forms and
interactions between the capsid and surface proteins. The methodology exploits appropriate mutations of Cp
and RT to ensure obtaining homogenous particles of the various types as described above, which can be further
computationally classified to minimize cross-contamination.
Understanding the native HBV structures will provide valuable new information for HBV biology and guide the
design of novel antiviral drugs in the future. The project is anticipated to impact fields ranging from HBV,
molecular virology, antiviral drug development, and macromolecular structure and function."
10930058,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a joint disease and the major cause of disability in the adult population. Joint pathology
includes disruption of normal cartilage morphology, changes in the underlying subchondral bone properties,
and induction of osteophyte formation at the joint margins. Traumatic joint injuries such as meniscus and
ligament tears or articular cartilage damage increase the susceptibility of developing a specific type of OA,
post-traumatic arthritis (PTOA). The association of PTOA with a joint injury provides a well-defined event after
which to intervene and attenuate or inhibit subsequent OA initiation and development. In addition to cartilage
damage with PTOA, progressive changes to subchondral bone develop that initiate with bone resorption and
loss, suggesting that targeting bone could prevent early-stage PTOA. We have developed a non-invasive
model that induces OA with repetitive loading and PTOA with a single dose of loading applied to the mouse
knee. In our preliminary data with this OA model, intermittent parathyroid hormone (iPTH) was beneficial to
joint tissue health in adult male mice, even when iPTH treatment was followed by 6 weeks of damaging daily
loading. Using the PTOA model, we found that load-induced joint damage was attenuated when bone
remodeling was inhibited immediately after traumatic loading.
 Based on these intriguing results, we hypothesize that intermittent PTH treatment will inhibit the
development of PTOA pathology in the joint. We propose to test this hypothesis using our load-induced PTOA
model in three specific aims:
(Aim 1) To attenuate load-induced tissue morphological damage and cellular responses after a single bout of
damaging in vivo loading with delayed iPTH treatment in adult male and female mice;
(Aim 2) To demonstrate that pain is reduced, joint function maintained and neuroimmune mechanisms
modulated with iPTH treatment immediately or delayed 2 wks after a single bout of damaging in vivo loading to
initiate PTOA in adult male and female mice
(Aim 3) To identify altered neuroimmune gene expression is correlated with reduced tissue damage in
cartilage, synovium and bone from adult male and female mice treated with iPTH immediately after a single
bout of in vivo loading to initiate PTOA
 We expect that the beneficial effects of iPTH will be able to overcome existing tissue damage and
modify PTOA disease progression with delayed treatment through bone anabolism and chondrogenesis. Our
preliminary data demonstrate a role for specifically targeting the subchondral bone and cartilage using FDA-
approved osteoporosis treatments in slowing OA progression. iPTH inhibition of cartilage and bone pathology
following joint trauma will transform clinical practice."

This proposal aims to continue the National Neuropsychology Network (NNN, R01MH118514). The NNN has
exceeded its original ambitious recruitment goals, already has enrolled more than 9,400 individuals, and is on
track to include more than 12,000 participants during the current funding period. With core infrastructure in
place, the NNN has gathered item-level data on representative neuropsychological (NP) instruments and
deposited these data in the NIMH Data Archive (NDA). We created digital history forms and the System for
Acquisition of Item-Level Observations and Responses (SAILOR) and an application programming interface with
Pearson’s Q-interactive platform to enable point-of-testing data acquisition for more than 50 NP tests using
iPads, along with automated scoring and enhanced score reporting features. Data analyses already have tested
measurement invariance between NNN and the original standardization samples, specifying the core latent
constructs that are identified across tests, and generated computerized adaptive test models to show how some
tests can be dramatically shortened without loss of key information. The NNN has further harmonized history-
taking and self-report methods across sites by creating the Structured History Protocol for Neuropsychology
(SHiP-NP) that is now freely available nationwide.
Following aspirations as stated in the original application, the NNN now aims to expand from the four original
clinical research sites in California, Florida, Georgia, and Wisconsin to add a new site in Texas, to include both
English and Spanish speaking (bilingual and monolingual) participants, and to add widely used Spanish
language NP tests. This continuation project further enhances recruitment of participants who report Black or
African American ancestry. The proposed expansion is critically needed to address current disparities in
understanding NP function in racial and ethnic groups that have been underrepresented in biomedical research
despite representing increasingly large proportions of the U.S. population. To increase the scalability of the NNN
and increase integration with healthcare informatics research, the proposal further aims to synchronize data
across electronic medical record (EMR) and NNN databases, thereby automating retrieval of important common
data elements (CDEs) and establishing standards for CDEs that are most important for NP assessment. The
data acquired during the continuation phase will enable analyses to: (a) test measurement invariance across
diverse groups defined by individual, cultural and linguistic differences; (b) create regression-based predictions
of NP performance in clinically-relevant groups based on demographic and social determinants of health (SDOH)
that go beyond race- and ethnicity stratified norms; (c) develop proposals for new more efficient adaptive tests
and test batteries; and (d) create a scalable network structure that can dynamically incorporate novel test content
and generate normative data that are current with shifting population trends and emerging scientific evidence."
10891656,"Summary
Translation of mRNA is a central cellular process, but the mechanisms that control it are not fully understood.
Up to 50% of eukaryotic mRNAs contain predicted upstream open reading frames (uORFs), but the roles of the
vast majority of these uORFs remain undetermined. In some cases, we know that this additional translational
capacity is evolutionarily conserved and serves critical functions in controlling gene expression. A special class
of these conserved uORFs encodes peptides that stall protein synthesis in response to the presence of small
metabolites. These nascent regulatory peptides act within the ribosome tunnel to arrest translation; by doing so,
they control the production of enzymes important in metabolism. However, there remain important gaps in
knowledge of the functions of uORFs. First, the mechanisms by which uORF-encoded peptides recognize small
molecules and stall eukaryotic ribosomes to control gene expression remain unclear. Second, the extent to which
uORFs are translated in cells under different conditions, the extent to which uORFs are evolutionarily conserved,
and how and why the translation of particular uORFs controls gene expression, or if their translation serves other
functions, is not known. To help bridge these gaps, we will determine the functions of a newly discovered
conserved fungal uORF peptide named the inositol regulatory peptide (IRP). Our data indicate that the IRP
regulates the expression of the first enzyme necessary for the synthesis of the important molecule inositol. We
know that the IRP, while fungal in origin, can regulate reporter genes in mammalian cells as well as the fungus
Neurospora crassa, in which we first discovered it. Using fungal and mammalian cell-free translation systems,
we obtained direct evidence for translational control by the IRP. We will use both in vivo and in vitro approaches
to determine the mechanism of action and physiological consequences of IRP function. In Aim 1, we will perform
functional analyses to determine the mechanism of action of the IRP. In Aim 2, we will perform structural analyses
to determine the mechanism of action of the IRP. Successful completion of the proposed work will provide
mechanistic information that should significantly increase our understanding of translational control mechanisms
that are generally important. It will provide new insights into regulatory and metabolic pathways that could be
important for developing strategies to manipulate metabolism to improve human health and welfare."
10918327,"Obesity in adults and children is associated with severe disease and poor quality of life, and disproportionately
impacts rural communities and historically marginalized groups. Increased access to quality obesity care is an
important strategy for reducing obesity-related inequities. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)
recommends primary care providers (PCPs) screen children and adults for obesity and offer or refer to
comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions (IBTs); however, these recommendations are rarely
implemented. Lack of training for both PCPs and behavioral health providers (BHPs) is a major barrier to
implementation of USPSTF-care. Other key barriers include workforce challenges, care fragmentation, clinician
weight bias, limited clinic-community linkages, and patient-level socioeconomic barriers. Harnessing an
upcoming Medicaid policy change, our team developed a scalable implementation strategy, Comprehensive
Multidisciplinary Obesity Care (CMOC). We propose to train a collaborative team (i.e., PCPs, BHPs, Registered
Dietitian Nutritionists, and community health workers) to implement USPSTF-care in Federally Qualified Health
Centers (FQHCs). CMOC is an innovative approach that leverages policy supports, clinic-community linkages,
and digital technology, and employs a comprehensive, multi-level training program addressing structural and
systemic contributors (e.g., clinician weight bias) to health inequities to improve weight-related outcomes and
sustain impact. Using an effectiveness-implementation design with a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT)
phase and a one-way crossover phase, 20 FQHCs in urban and rural areas of Missouri including ~100 PCPs
and ~6,000 benefit-eligible patients (i.e., Medicaid recipients with obesity) will be assigned to CMOC or an
implementation as usual control (IAUC) condition. CMOC includes provider training in obesity care competencies
(e.g., weight bias reduction, structural competency), discipline-specific USPSTF-care, and learning
collaboratives over 12 months, followed by a 12-month sustainability period. The one-way crossover phase
implements CMOC in the control arm (following their participation in IAUC) over 12 months. Both phases include
evaluations at 12- and 24-months post-training. To improve health outcomes among historically marginalized
groups, our proposed study evaluates short- and long-term clinical and implementation outcomes of CMOC
compared to IAUC using RE-AIM. Four aims will guide this work. Aim 1 compares patient-level effectiveness
(i.e., patient relative weight change (1a) and the proportion of patients who achieve clinically significant weight
loss (1b)). Aim 2 compares reach (patient treatment utilization). Aim 3 compares PCP referrals to care at 12
(adoption; 3a) and 24 months (maintenance; 3b), and short- and long-term changes in provider obesity care
competencies (3c). Aim 4 compares implementation and service costs. In line with NIDDK Strategic Priorities,
our project seeks to advance implementation of evidence-based care in communities, ultimately expanding
access to promote equity and the right to a future without disability and disease for those most in need."

cellular processes in cancer, and how these affect the interplay between tumor, stromal and immune cells. Our
research program combines a multi-pronged approach to advance basic scientific discoveries to pre-clinical,
translational research and, ultimately, to clinical development. Our major goal is to develop safe and effective
therapies for treating patients with cancer. Specifically, our research program will i) investigate the role of
PI3K/PTEN signaling in shaping immune response in breast and prostate cancer, ii) investigate cellular and
molecular mechanisms by which the immune system affects response to targeted therapies in breast cancer,
and iii) investigate mechanisms of metastatic spread to the brain and treatment strategies against breast cancer
brain metastasis (BCBM). To this end, we will capitalize on our expertise on signal transduction and
pharmacology applied to genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs) and patient-derived xenografts
(PDXs) to conduct multi-omics studies, as well as detailed mechanistic studies aimed to significantly advance
our understanding of tumorigenesis, immune evasion and therapeutic resistance. For each of these aims, we
will carry out studies focused on cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying biological functions and response
to therapies, and will also evaluate rational combinations of targeted therapies and immune modulators in
clinically relevant mouse models. We will focus on how distinct oncogenic alterations differentially affect the anti-
tumor immune response, and will place a particular emphasis on understanding how the interplay between tumor
and immune cells affects therapeutic outcome. We have and will continue to develop novel GEMMs and PXD
models suitable for these studies, in addition to incorporating powerful new technologies to maximize the
potential impact of our research. We have the experience, expertise and support to carry out these studies, and
we are confident that we can continue to make significant contributions to the fields of cancer biology and
immuno-oncology, and to the many patients and families afflicted by this disease."

Abstract
Cerebrovascular dysfunction in aging increases risk for the development of cognitive decline and
Alzheimer’s disease. Adult hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSCs) play an important role in
maintaining vascular homeostasis. Our novel preliminary studies identified that exosomes,
nanovesicles, derived from HSCs of Older subjects (Old-HSC-Exos) induced dysfunction the
human brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) characterized by impaired mitochondrial
bioenergetics and attenuated angiogenesis. In agreement with these findings, brain microvessels
(BMVs) from Old mice showed imbalance in mitochondrial bioenergetics compared to the Young-
BMVs. Furthermore, we have discovered that activation of Mas-related G-protein coupled
receptor, D (MrgD) reversed age-associated impairment in bioenergetics in BMVs.
This proposal tests the hypothesis that HSC-derived exosomes from Older individuals induce
imbalance in the mitochondrial bioenergetics and impair cerebrovascular function resulting in
cognitive decline. We further hypothesize that activation of MrgD is novel pharmacological
approach for the treatment of vascular dementia. We will evaluate molecular cargo in the
exosomes derived from Young and Old individuals by RNAseq analysis and determine the
mitochondrial functions of selected molecules in the brain MVECs and BMVs. The potential of
Mrgd activator Alamandine in reversing the detrimental effects of Old-HSC-Exos in the endothelial
mitochondria and BMVs. We’ll determine the detrimental effects of Old-HSC-Exos in murine
BMVs and test their potential to induce vascular dementia and cognitive decline in the Young and
Old mice. The potential benefits of MrgD activators in Old-HSC-Exos-induced vascular dementia
will be evaluated in vivo. Lastly, pharmacology of MrgD activators will be evaluated in APP/PS1
mice. If carried out successfully, this proposal will provide proof-of-concept for a novel role of
HSC-exosomes in the pathology of vascular dementia and for MrgD as a promising target for the
treatment."
10915563,"Project Summary
This project focuses on the role of telomeres and DSB repair in genome instability in cancer. Numerous recent
WGS studies have revealed that most cancer genomes carry a remarkable level of structural changes,
affirming the need to understand how this genome instability arises. In this context, our work asks how
telomeres affect tumorigenesis with emphasis on the two major contributions of telomeres in cancer: the
telomere tumor suppressor pathway and telomere-driven genome instability. During the current funding period,
we have provided genetic evidence for the telomere tumor suppressor pathway and showed that the correct
telomere length setting at birth prevents cancer in a wide range of tissues. We have dissected the mechanism
by which telomere crisis, a stage at which telomere shortening drives genome instability in checkpoint-deficient
cancer clones, instigates breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycles, chromothripsis, and kataegis. We have
provided the first evidence that telomerase can create new telomeres (neotelomeres) at DSBs and propose
that neotelomere formation can mold the cancer genome by increasing the fitness of cells struggling with
ongoing BFB cycles. Finally, our lab continued its work on the role of 53BP1 in DSB repair and PARPi
treatment of BRCA1-deficient cells, showing that, unlike what was generally believed, 53BP1 does not block
resection but recruits the CST-Pola/primase complex to fill-in resected DNA ends. These findings set the stage
for our future work, in which we aim to continue our path-breaking research and the mentoring of future cancer
researchers. Examples of projects we will pursue are:
 1. Using an innovative approach, we will use CRISPRi screens for repressors of neotelomere
 formation and query hits for gene loss/mutation in cancer.
 2. Our proposal that neotelomere formation can terminate BFB cycles and enhance the viability of
 cells with dicentric chromosomes will be tested in an in vitro model for induction of BFB cycles.
 3. To gain deeper insights into the telomere tumor suppressor pathway, we will determine how
 telomere length is regulated.
 4. Following a recent demonstration that cancer cell lines with short telomeres are exceptionally
 sensitive to loss of the telomeric factors CST and TRF1, we will determine the mechanistic basis of
 these vulnerabilities in hopes that our insights may point to new treatments.
Our aim is to derive deep insights into how cancer genomes are altered with the overarching goal of providing
oncologists with information that can inform their decisions on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.

10898025,"Project Summary
This application proposes a collaborative study to be performed by Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) in New
York, NY, as the lead organization in collaboration with GE Research (GER) in Niskayuna, NY, and Stony
Brook Medicine (SBM) affiliated with the State University of New York in Stony Brook, NY. The proposed
project addresses the need for reliable, highly sensitive means of detecting metastases to lymph nodes
(LNs) and distinguishing them from primary lymphomas and LNs affected by benign conditions. This
capability will allow improved staging and treatment of disease. Accordingly, we seek to validate existing
encouraging results obtained in prior studies by WCM and SBM using quantitative-ultrasound (QUS)
methods to detect metastases in LNs by applying and evaluating these promising methods using a
modified clinical scanner to acquire ultrasonic echo-signal data from patients undergoing medically
required ultrasonically guided fine-needle aspirations (FNAs) of suspicious LNs. The study will include a
far broader range of disease types from a larger and more-diverse patient population than has been
possible in studies to date. Validation efforts will develop, deploy, and validate an application for QUS-
based detection and characterization of LNs implemented in a clinical scanner. Successful validation will
establish a foundation for incorporation of QUS-based methods for LN evaluation into clinical ultrasonic
scanners. Such instruments will be able to evaluate suspicious LNs intra-operatively in the operating room
or pre-operatively in the examination room. The collaborating researchers will synergize capabilities in the
following general ways: WCM will provide project oversight and coordination and will apply, refine, and test
QUS and classification methods; GER will provide ultrasound instrumentation and will develop and
validate the QUS application for the scanner; SBM will recruit patients and acquire ultrasonic and
cytopathological data from patients undergoing FNAs of their LNs."
10851803,"In cancer, macrophages play a multifaceted role in disease progression and response to therapies. Tumor-
associated macrophages (TAMs) serve several pro-tumoral functions including the expression of factors
promoting growth, immune suppression and angiogenesis. A high TAM burden in the tumor microenvironment
is often associated with poor prognosis and therapeutic resistance to certain immunotherapies. Moreover, TAMs
are emerging as a target for anti-cancer therapeutics. Overall, an imaging probe that can non-invasively detect
TAM burden could help stratify patients and personalize treatments to improve response rates. Recently, our
laboratory has developed novel molecular probes enabling sensitive and precise imaging of inflammatory foci in
vivo. We synthesized functionalized fluorocarbon nanoemulsions incorporating a fluorous-encapsulated
radiometal chelate (FERM). Pre-formed FERM nanoemulsion rapidly captures zirconium-89 into the fluorous
phase. The highly hydrophobic nature of fluorocarbons helps exclude competition from water, cations, lipids and
proteins that contribute to the dissociation of 89Zr from the carrier. By encapsulating the radiometal inside the
volume of nanoemulsion droplet one can achieve a high payload and cell detection sensitivity, with low
background. Following an intravenous injection of FERM, nanoemulsion droplets are scavenged by phagocytic
macrophages. The labeled cells accumulate at inflammatory sites resulting in sensitive and quantifiable positron
emission tomography (PET) signals reflecting predominantly macrophage burden. Preliminary PET results from
our lab demonstrate excellent sensitivity and versatility of the FERM probe in a diversity of inflammation rodent
models, including solid tumor, acute infection and autoimmune disease. Building on these results, our project
has three Aims: Aim 1. 89Zr FERM formulation. We will perform FERM nanoemulsion formulation optimization
and scale-up. We will also develop optimal radiopharmacy methods to maximize labeling efficiency of FERM
and product yield. Aim 2. Biological characterizations. Cell-based assays will be performed to evaluate
potential toxicity of 89Zr FERM. Moreover, we will characterize the in vivo blood half-life, probe stability, and
preliminary dosimetry. Aim 3. In vivo immuno-oncology studies. We will characterize the effectiveness of
FERM for TAM detection and quantification, responsiveness to treatments that deplete TAM burden, and the
probe’s potential for predicting response to immunotherapeutic interventions in multiple murine solid tumor
models. Parallel phenotypic profiling of FERM-labeled cells in the tumor will be performed. The proposed studies
will generate essential data needed to drive potential clinical translation of the FERM imaging biomarker for use
in future immuno-oncology clinical trials."
10904810,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)
Androgen receptor (AR) targeted therapies such as abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide, and darolutamide are effective
treatments for patients with advanced castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, resistance to these therapies
represents a significant hurdle in the clinical management of advanced CRPC. Despite initial clinical benefit, most patients
relapse with acquired resistance within a year. An emerging mechanism of acquired resistance to AR-targeted therapy is the
ability of tumor cells to adapt a non-canonical AR activity for survival. Preliminary suggests that increased expression of a
master regulatory transcription factor (TF) cluster (ELF3, JDP2, PBX1, RARA) is associated with the non-canonical AR
activity observed with acquired enzalutamide resistance. Interestingly, expression levels of known AR partners, FOXA1
and HOXB13, were either unaffected or slightly decreased following exposure to enzalutamide in resistant models. AR
chromatin profiling showed a unique binding pattern of AR to novel master regulatory TFs at promoter and enhancer regions
that were absent in the presence of DHT. Preliminary data also suggests a decrease in these master TFs suppresses non-
canonical AR activity and reverses acquired resistance to enzalutamide in preclinical models. The overall objective of this
application is to determine the role of identified master regulatory TFs on non-canonical AR activity associated with
acquired enzalutamide resistance in CRPC and develop optimal therapeutic options that shift cells back to a phenotype that
is clinically manageable and re-sensitized to enzalutamide. Our central hypothesis is that non-canonical AR cistrome
associated with resistance is driven by the recruitment of novel master regulatory transcription factors. Targeting their
vulnerability can re-sensitize resistant cells to enzalutamide. The rationale is that through multimodal molecular
characterization, we can explore therapeutic options that can push back these cancer cells to a canonical AR state sensitive
to enzalutamide. We will test our central hypothesis and accomplish the objective of this application by pursuing the
following specific aims: (i) Multimodal characterization of non-canonical AR activity in patient-derived xenograft models
of advanced disease. (ii) Assess the functional role of identified master regulatory TF on non-canonical AR activity. (iii)
Assess the antitumor activity of candidate combination therapies in multiple PDX models and gather pharmacological and
Toxicology information. Impact: Results from this project will significantly expand our knowledge of the biology of lethal
prostate cancer (PCa) and provide optimal treatment strategies that improve outcomes for men with lethal PCa, reducing
the unequal burden of cancer. Our immediate goal is to leverage information from molecular studies to recognize the subset
of patients where resistance is driven by non-canonical AR activity using multi-omic-based markers. Furthermore, our study
will provide the mechanisms and vulnerabilities of the altered AR cistrome drivers and the implications for drug discovery
and developing optimal therapeutic options for this subset of patients. Our long-term goal is to translate our preclinical
findings into the clinic in the setting of phase I & II clinical trials."
10931518,"Abstract: Esophageal cancer is the 6th most common cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. While
esophageal squamous cell neoplasia (ESCN) carries a significant global burden, those in certain underserved
geographic regions (South America, eastern Africa, eastern Iran, northern China) have particularly high
incidence and mortality rates due to lack of endoscopic screening capacity. While endoscopy with Lugol’s
chromoendoscopy or “digital” chromoendoscopy has shown high sensitivity (>95%) for screening, specificity is
poor (<60%) and false-positive results abound due to confounding inflammatory areas. As a result, standard of
care endoscopy produces many unnecessary biopsies, increasing risk and cost of endoscopic screening and
surveillance.
 In our ongoing R01 project, we developed and validated a mobile, high-resolution microendoscope (mHRME)
for screening and surveillance of ESCN. Despite ≥2 years of COVID delays, which especially impacted the
Chinese sites, we completed: (1) a randomized, controlled clinical trial (USA and China; n=918) of mHRME with
visual interpretation in patients undergoing screening or surveillance for esophageal squamous cell neoplasia,
(2) deep-learning software algorithms for automated detection of neoplastic images, and (3) a pilot trial (n=41)
of the software-assisted mHRME in Brazil. The trial revealed higher specificity for qualitative (visual)
interpretation by experts but not novices, in surveillance arm (100% vs. 19%, p<0.05). In the screening arm,
diagnostic yield (neoplastic biopsies/total biopsies) increased 3.6 times (8 to 29%); 16% of patients were
correctly spared any biopsy; and 18% had a change in clinical plan. In a single-arm pilot study, we also evaluated
an artificial intelligence-based mobile HRME (AI-mHRME) in 41 Brazilian subjects. This study (January 2022)
confirmed that quantitative interpretation (AI-mHRME) doubled diagnostic yield, improved endoscopists’
confidence, and had significant clinical impact (change of clinical plan in 64%). Our initial deep-learning algorithm
had a sensitivity/specificity of 100%/85%. Participating clinicians uniformly said they favored an AI-guided
approach but expressed concerns about its implementation.
 In this competing renewal, we will build on this valuable global data to optimize an AI-mHRME and evaluate
its clinical impact and implementation potential in ethnically and socioeconomically diverse populations in the
USA and Brazil. A stakeholder-engaged approach will be used to evaluate barriers, acceptability,
appropriateness, and feasibility of using AI-mHRME in ESCN management and to determine contextual factors
influencing adoption. Data obtained will facilitate implementation and dissemination of innovative, AI-assisted
cancer screening strategies in diverse populations and other cancers."
10931762,"ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest growing cause of cancer death in the United States. While
prevention efforts are paramount, most patients succumb to advanced HCC disease. Thus, enrollment of at-
risk patients (e.g., cirrhosis of any etiology) in early detection programs is recommended in clinical practice
guidelines. Longstanding challenges to improving early-stage HCC detection are suboptimal performance of
the recommended surveillance tools [i.e., abdominal ultrasound and serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)] and the
low implementation rate of surveillance programs (as low as 25% in the United States). Various studies have
tried to utilize tumor nucleic acids released to the bloodstream (i.e., “liquid biopsy”) as novel early HCC
detection tools, but its role in this clinical setting is largely unexplored. Up to 18% of patients with cirrhosis have
indeterminate nodules detected during surveillance. In these patients, imaging is inconclusive, and patients
require either a biopsy of the suspicious nodule and/or close imaging follow-up.
Our project is designed to overcome these problems by using new blood-based liquid biopsy biomarkers and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based radiomics. We have assembled a multi-institutional Translational
Research Center including leading academic centers in NYC (Mount Sinai, Columbia, Cornell, and Montefiore).
We plan to collect blood, clinical and imaging data from a multiracial cohort of 2,560 patients (early HCC cases
and controls at high risk). In Aim 1, we will determine the clinical role of new liquid biopsy technologies (i.e.,
cell-free DNA fragment analysis and a 3-small RNA signatures from extracellular vesicles in plasma) as a
novel surveillance approach in HCC. In Aim 2, we will integrate MRI-based radiomics models with our liquid
biopsy technologies to better characterize indeterminate nodules in cirrhosis. Our project is timely and uniquely
poised to respond to the imperative of developing noninvasive biomarkers of early HCC detection."
10912796,"High-grade, fast-growing breast cancers often display necrosis, usually within the tumor interior, 
where perfusion, nutrients, and oxygen are limited. Recent studies indicate that necrosis is not 
just an indicator of aggressive disease, but also a regulator of the aggressive phenotype, by 
impairing cancer drug delivery, promoting genomic evolution, and instigating metastasis to distant 
organs. However, we currently lack an understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating necrosis 
development and consequently, there are no therapies to prevent the development of necrosis and its 
downstream effects on tumor aggression. For this application, we have developed animal models that 
enable the robust dissection of the tumor-host ecosystem in the necrotic interior. Our studies 
reveal that a secreted protein, angiopoietin-like 7 (Angptl7), is produced by tumor cells adjacent 
to the necrotic core and is a regulator of tumor core vasculature development. Importantly, when 
Angptl7 is suppressed genetically, tumor necrosis, tumor growth, and metastatic dissemination are 
each drastically reduced. Thus, necrosis development is not inevitable but rather is preventable by 
Angptl7 suppression. In the proposed work, we will combine studies using innovative animal models 
and breast cancer patient blood and tissue samples to test the hypothesis that the development of 
necrosis is a driving force for the evolution of highly metastatic and drug-resistant breast tumor 
cells. In Aim 1, we will use mouse models to test the hypothesis that Angptl7-induced necrosis 
limits delivery of chemotherapeutics to the tumor core, and that Angptl7 suppression synergizes 
with neoadjuvant chemotherapeutics to improve drug delivery and improve tumor killing. In Aim 2, we 
will use tissue from a large population-based cohort of early-stage breast cancer patients to 
determine how dilated blood vessels, an indicator of Angptl7-induced necrosis, influences risk of 
local and distant metastatic dissemination to predict benefit from adjuvant therapy. In Aim 3, we 
will apply genomic sequencing and circulating tumor DNA analysis in an innovative rat model for 
liquid biopsy studies to define the genomic signatures associated with Angptl7-induced necrosis.  
We will then determine the prognostic impact of a circulating tumor DNA signature of necrosis in 
human clinical samples. This work will define necrosis development as an engine for tumor 
diversification and aggression, and the clinical contexts both in early stage and metastatic 
settings where necrosis prevention could benetits patients with breast cancer and tumor types."

Calcium channel dysfunction in heart muscle cells induces cardiac arrhythmias such as Timothy syndrome, a
severe form of genetic long QT syndrome type 8. In preliminary experiments using pharmaceutical approach,
we found that activation of Sigma 1 receptor using its agonists could alleviate the cellular phenotypes in human
induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and mouse models of the genetic disease. The goal of this study is to design,
synthesize and characterize new small molecules to develop novel Sigma 1 receptor agonists that are more
suitable for the cardiac phenotypes in the genetic disease. To accomplish this goal, we will take advantage of
our experience and expertise in pharmaceutical science and medicinal chemistry using human iPSC and rodent

molecules can be applicable for common forms of genetic long QT syndrome such as type 1 and 2. Therefore,
our translational study will provide new opportunity of drug development for genetic cardiac arrhythmias."

Approximately 7% of school-aged children have Developmental Language Disorder (DLD), making it one of the
highest prevalence of the child language disorders. DLD places individuals at risk for academic failure, social
isolation, anxiety, depression, poor emotional regulation, juvenile incarceration (65%), and repeat offending
(70%). DLD persists into adulthood, with conservative estimates indicating that 12 million adults in the United
States have DLD, but because the behavioral phenotype can overlap with that of typical individuals', they may
no longer qualify for support services. Notably, although these young adults with DLD ""appear"" normal, their
language abilities are linked to brain structure and cortical dynamics that differ qualitative from typical individuals,
suggesting that neural signature of DLD may be a critical marker of the disorder. New machine learning methods
have revolutionized the neuroscience of neurodevelopmental disorders and advances in registering the optical
signal of functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to neuroanatomical data now make capturing the spatial-
temporal dynamics of spoken language processing feasible and cost-effective for speech, language, and hearing
populations. Expertise in these two domains is critical for high impact speech-language research. The candidate
is an established investigator with a strong record of research and extramural funding spanning more than 30
years in the area of DLD. The goal of the enhancement is to augment the candidate's current expertise in DLD
by gaining advanced training in fNIRS neuroimaging and newer computational modeling techniques to keep the
candidate's program of research in-step with emerging and evolving neuroimaging and computational modeling
approaches. The goals of the enhancement are to: (1) advance the candidate's skills in cutting-edge fNIRS
methods, (2) incorporate computational modeling into the candidate's program of research, and (3) catalyze new
research collaborations with cognitive neuroscientists, optical imagers, and computational modelers. Didactic
course work in applied machine learning and computational modeling (semester long courses), 1:1 meetings,
scholarly travel and a small-scale research project will provide the enhanced experience to substantially
augment the research skills of the candidate, seed new collaborations with scientists in other fields whose work
is relevant to DLD. The research project will provide the hands-on opportunity for the candidate to acquire
expertise under the mentorship of a superior team of young, up and coming mentors with expertise in optical
imaging (fNIRS), and functional and structural brain imaging (fMRI, MRI), and a group of senior collaborators
with expertise in computational modeling and cognitive neuroscience. A group of young adults ages 18;0 - 21;0
with/without DLD (n = 44) will complete standardized assessments, a structural MRI, and a series of fNIRS
tasks, which will then be used as inputs to derive multidimensional models of DLD. Overall, the enhancement
will significantly augment the current research trajectory of a well-established DLD researcher and provide the
foundation for new NIH funding to develop multidimensional neurobiologically derived models of DLD."
10897190,"Prion disease is a uniformly fatal, incurable neurodegenerative disease that causes 1 in every 6,000 deaths and typically leads to rapidly progressive dementia and death within less than half a year of first symptom. The various subtypes of prion disease including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, fatal familial insomnia, and Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease are all unified by a single molecular mechanism: misfolding of the prion protein (PrP) in the brain. PrP, encoded by the gene PRNP, is not pathogenic in its native form and is present in the brains of all mammals. But it is capable of undergoing a conformational change into a prion which spreads by corrupting other PrP molecules, eventually causing neuronal damage and death. Decades worth of research supports lowering PrP in the brain as a therapeutic strategy to prevent or delay onset, and slow the progression, of prion disease, and PrP appears to be dispensable for healthy life. However, finding a therapeutic modality with sufficient brain distribution, potency, durability, and tolerability to achieve adequate suppression of PrP in this relentlessly progressive whole brain disease is a major challenge. Divalent siRNA (di-siRNA) technology, first described in 2019, is a new class of chemically modified oligonucleotide therapeutic that can provide broad, deep, persistent suppression of target RNA molecules in the brain. Here we propose to develop a di-siRNA lead compound against the human PRNP RNA as a therapeutic for prion disease. In this project we will implement a manufacturing process, scale production, and perform quality testing of our lead di-siRNA, validate bioanalytical assays needed for animal and human studies of the compound, perform pharmacology and toxicology studies needed to support clinical development of a drug, and engage with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to establish a development path for di-siRNA. Success in this project will yield a drug candidate with the potential to transform therapy of human prion disease."
10724240,"Neurodegenerative disorders [e.g. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD)] are a group of
devastating conditions that are caused by progressive death of neurons in different regions of the brain. On
the other hand, multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common autoimmune disease of the central nervous
system, resulting in oligodendrocytes death and demyelination. Our lab primarily focuses on central nervous
system (CNS) cell signaling that leads to neuronal death in Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's
disease (AD) and demyelination in multiple sclerosis (MS). All these disorders are characterized by
activation of CNS glial cells (astroglia and microglia), excessive production of different proinflammatory
molecules within the CNS, and death of either oligodendroglia (MS) or neurons (AD and PD). From several
angles, we have been investigating mechanisms by which glial cells are activated to release different
proinflammatory molecules and neurotoxins for inducing apoptosis and cell death in neurons and
oligodendroglia. We are also involved in identifying signaling pathways by which glial cells may be
redirected to produce neuroprotective molecules and neural stem cells could be driven towards neurons and
myelin-producing cells (oligodendrocytes) within the neurodegenerative CNS. Finally, we are trying to
suppress neurotoxic signaling pathways and/or boost neuroprotective signaling pathways in different animal
models of neurodegenerative diseases by nontoxic drugs in order to achieve neuroprotection. Since many
veterans are suffering from dementia, AD, PD, and MS, results from these studies will directly help veterans.

10847555,"Assuring that all older adults coping with complex care needs at home have access to high-quality health and
social services and providing essential support to their caregivers are significant and growing societal challenges.
Effective responses to these priorities require research-informed solutions, especially those designed to reduce
systemic and structural inequities that disproportionately threaten the capacity of many older adults to remain at
home. The recent “hospital at home” movement is further fueling the demand for science-based care models
that address health needs and preferences, mitigate the impact of adverse social determinants of health, and
support caregivers, especially throughout challenging health transitions (e.g., new diagnosis, change in
functional status) and health care transitions (i.e., movement across health care providers or settings). The 12
core faculty responsible for the proposed renewal of the NINR-funded Individualized Care for At-Risk Older
Adults—a T32 training program based at the NewCourtland Center for Transitions and Health at the University
of Pennsylvania School of Nursing—are uniquely positioned to prepare four predoctoral and two postdoctoral
nurse trainees, appointed annually, to conduct transdisciplinary research designed to address these societal
priorities. Guided by both the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities’ Research Framework
and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s Multiple Chronic Conditions Research Network
conceptual model, and with a focus on the transitional care needs of at-risk older adults living at home and those
of their caregivers, trainees will be positioned to conceptualize, design, and conduct research aimed at advancing
integrated care models that promote health equity. Trainees will gain the theoretical knowledge and
methodological skills necessary to conduct rigorous and reproducible research guided by the highest ethical
standards, within a team science framework; employ contemporary and emerging research designs and
methodologies; and promote knowledge synthesis, dissemination, and implementation, with the ultimate goal of
conducting science that informs health care practices and policies and highlights nurses’ unique contributions.
The proposed training program benefits from considerable faculty expertise in aging, health equity, transitional
care, ethics, home and community-based care, and research methods. Led by two prominent nurse scientists,
the program has evolved to foster breadth and depth of conceptual and empirical knowledge related to health
inequities and integrated care models for diverse groups of older adults and their caregivers. Enhanced training
in research methods will emphasize sophisticated data science, emerging mixed methods designs, and multi-
level interventions with enhanced translational potential. Since 2007, this T32 has prepared 23 predoctoral
fellows and 24 postdoctoral fellows who are successfully pursuing scholarly careers focused on advancing
effective health and health care transitions of at-risk older adults. We expect our next cohorts to make substantive
contributions to advance high-quality care and support caregivers."
10847833,"The UC San Diego Department of Radiology is submitting a competitive renewal of its postdoctoral Clinician-
Scientist Training Program. The objective of the program is to train clinician-scientists in imaging research,
promote their career development, and cultivate their passion for academic radiology. Clinician-scientists are
necessary for the development and translation of new imaging technologies into clinical practice, which may
otherwise remain on the bench without direct application to human disease. To support and nurture a
pathway for physician-scientist trainees, we have leveraged our institutional resources to implement a unique
and 5-Year Residency Program that integrates rigorous research and intense clinical education. Into this
program, we admit up to three radiology residents per year. All our trainees are MDs or DOs, and most have
combined MD/PhDs. The trainees dedicate their first year to laboratory research, followed by 32 weeks of
protected research time during the subsequent 4 years of clinical training. The additional research time
allows trainees to continue to cultivate projects initiated during the first year, publish results, and apply for
grant funding, building an academic portfolio that allows them to transition to academic faculty positions.
Trainees select from a strong pool of faculty research mentors at UCSD, who are themselves highly
productive researchers with track records of strong collaborative research and grant support from NIH and
industry, many of whom serves as models of the physician-scientist career. For this proposal, we have
assembled 12 Radiology and 12 non‐Radiology research mentors with an average grant support of over
$1.1M per faculty member. Scientific areas span the translational spectrum and include molecular imaging,
magnetic resonance imaging, quantitative ultrasound methods, microCT, deep learning image analysis, and
imaging biomarker validation. Supplementing these robust career mentorship relationships are numerous
opportunities to promote resident education and engagement. Regular monthly lectures and workshops are
given by notable experts in topics relevant to the research residents, such as academic career development,
success in research, and responsible conduct of research. Participation in scientific conferences,
departmental Grand Rounds, and other meetings offer opportunities for residents to share their work through
formal presentations. Senior research residents serve as program chief residents to learn leadership and
administrative skills, facilitate trainee feedback, provide mentorship to their more junior colleagues, and help
ensure the program supports the trainees’ needs. Our graduates emerge with strong foundations in research
and clinical radiology, positioned to become successful clinician-scientists with the potential to shape and
drive the continued advancement of our field."
10910142,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is caused both by genetic and environmental factors, such as diet, as well as the
complex interactions between them. While diet is the cornerstone for T2D prevention, dietary interventions are
often difficult to implement and monitor due to limitations in dietary assessment techniques and strategies to
produce dietary changes. Despite efforts to reduce SSB consumption, SSBs remain the largest single source
of added sugar in the US. SSB consumption has been linked to a higher risk of T2D and related risk factors,
but the underlying biological mechanisms are not completely understood. Proteomic profiling and multi-omic
integration allow for more detailed phenotyping that may provide a broader view of diet-associated metabolic
changes and their functional interpretation. Examination of plasma proteomic and integrative omic profiles that
reflect SSB intake and a common alternative beverage, artificially sweetened beverages (ASB), may enhance
current dietary assessment methods and unveil novel biological pathways linking diet to T2D and related risk
factors through identification of novel dietary biomarkers.
 Discovery of plasma proteomic and multi-omic profiles of SSB and ASB consumption has immense
potential to provide an objective assessment of individual beverage intake and enable informed beverage
choices, which is in line with the precision nutrition approaches emphasized in the National Institute of Health’s
(NIH) 10-year strategic plan. This proposal cost-effectively leverages existing proteomics profiling among the
Nurses’ Health Study II and Health Professionals Follow-up Study cohorts (n=648). It also examines repeated
assays in the ongoing NIH-funded SUBstituting with Preferred OPtions trial, a randomized parallel-arm 6-
month beverage trial testing the effects of substituting SSBs with ASB or water among daily SSB consumers.
We will utilize proteomic and multi-omic network and machine learning analyses to identify discriminatory
profiles between SSB and ASB consumption levels and evaluate the associations of these profiles with T2D
risk factors. The central hypothesis is that distinct proteomic and omic profiles reflect habitual SSB or ASB
intake and that changes in their omic biomarkers are associated with changes in T2D risk factors, revealing
novel biomarkers of beverage consumption and biological pathways modified by beverage consumption. This
K01 career development award expands on the applicant’s experience in nutritional epidemiology, omics, and
biostatistics to gain proficiency in the design and management of intervention studies, implementation of
cutting-edge multi-omic statistical analysis techniques, and scientific leadership for precision nutrition
applications for T2D prevention. With mentorship from a renowned multidisciplinary research team, the
applicant will gain the crucial skills necessary to advance T2D prevention and refine a framework for the
utilization of innovative multi-omics techniques in complementary interventional and epidemiological study
designs to inform precision nutrition initiatives and transition to an independent investigator."

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) are chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune
diseases. Some features of these illnesses are similar. These include aspects of clinical manifestations,
serology and epidemiology. Most critical for this proposal is that there is a strong female bias found for both
diseases such that at least 90% of patients are women. The mechanism for this sex bias was unexplained
until the work of the PI, which began more than a decade ago and was funded in part by this VA Merit Review
for which a renewal is sought. The PI and his colleagues found that men with 47,XXY (Klinefelter’s syndrome)
are at the same risk of SLE or SS as women. In addition, 47,XXX women are at increased risk of either
disease compared to women carrying a 46,XX chromosomal complement. This X chromosome dose effect
was found for SLE and SS but not rheumatoid arthritis, primary biliary cirrhosis or sarcoidosis. Thus, our data
indicate multiple molecular pathways to female-biased disease. In cells with more than one X chromosome, all
but one undergoes X inactivation. However, X inactivation in humans is not an all-or-none process such that
up to 15% of genes on the X chromosome escape inactivation. That is, these genes are transcribed and
translated from both X chromosomes (biallelically) in normal (46,XX) women. We have identified two X
chromosomes genes that escape X inactivation in immune cells and are both involved in toll like receptor
(TLR) 7 signaling to produce interferon, and have a lupus risk allele identified in genome-wide association
studies. Namely, these genes are TLR7 itself and CXorf21. The protein product of CXorf21 physically
interacts with the protein product of another lupus risk gene – SLC15a4. In studies performed in the previous
cycle of this award, and published in 2019, we find that CXorf21 and SLC15a4 regulate endolysosomal pH and
are critical for TLR7 signaling. Knockdown of CXorf21 by CRISPR-Cas9 raises endolysosomal pH (less
conducive to TLR7 signaling), and impairs TLR7 signaling with marked reduction of interferon as well as other
cytokine production (see Progress Report and Preliminary Data). Of course, interferon production through
TLR7 signaling is known to be a critical aspect of lupus pathogenesis in both human and murine lupus. Thus,
these data constitute a strong premise for the work proposed herein. Much of the genetics of SLE has not
been identified by GWAS, and much of this missing genetics may be related to presently unidentified genetic
synergism. In the first aim, we will determine the degree of genetic synergism found in the interaction of the
lupus-associated alleles of these genes involved in the TLR7 pathway. This aim will use our cohort of >300
men with SLE, the largest cohort ever assembled by more than 3-fold. In the second aim, we will define the
physiological roles of the protein products of these genes in the TLR signaling pathway with particular attention
to the associated alleles using cutting edge molecular techniques. The final aim we will approach precision
medicine by studying the role of these genes in determining the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine. Since the
genes and hydroxychloroquine are involved in TLR7 signaling and lysosomal pH, we hypothesize that the
associated alleles will reduce the efficacy. This aim will utilize a unique resource of SLE patients on
hydroxychloroquine and followed for flare. Thus, these related but independent aims will advance the science
of the X chromosome gene dose effect that explains much of the sex bias of SLE and SS."
10875441,"Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are central regulators of intestinal homeostasis and organismal well-being. In response to infection or injury, intestinal epithelial stem cells (ISCs) alter their differentiation to promote host-protective inflammation in the epithelium. However, intestinal epithelial inflammation must be tightly regulated to prevent pathology. Type 2 intestinal inflammation occurs during food allergy and parasitic helminth infection that together cause substantial morbidity worldwide. In this context, bioactive lipids are released locally and lipid receptor expression is dynamically regulated, perfectly positioning lipids to fine tune IEC activities. However, how lipids regulate Type 2 epithelial inflammation is poorly defined, representing a gap in our understanding of how intestinal homeostasis is restored following allergy or worm infection. In intestinal Type 2 inflammation, IECs sense stimuli and release alarmins that activate immune cells to secrete the cytokine IL-13, which acts on ISCs to promote their differentiation to secretory goblet and tuft cells. Studies from our laboratory have recently shown that CRTH2, a receptor for the bioactive lipid prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), is expressed in murine and human IECs and enriched in ISCs. CRTH2-deficient ISCs were more likely to differentiate into goblet cells in vitro. PGD2, dependent on CRTH2, counteracted effects of IL-13 on murine small intestine IECs in vitro and in vivo, suppressing goblet cell differentiation during infection with a parasitic helminth. Finally, CRTH2-deficient mice retained goblet cell hyperplasia and increased barrier permeability after the resolution of Type 2 immune activation. Based on these data, we hypothesize that PGD2 acts on CRTH2+ ISCs to return the intestine to homeostasis after a Type 2 inflammatory event and to shape the IEC response to new stimuli. To test this idea, we propose 2 Aims. Aim 1 includes mechanistic studies that will test if PGD2 suppresses ISC differentiation to secretory lineages in response to Type 2 cytokines. Aim 1 will use a novel CRTH2-reporter mouse to identify PGD2-responsive IECs and will test how the PGD2-CRTH2 pathway affects murine and human ISC biology. Aim 2 includes studies that assess the biological significance of PGD2-CRTH2-mediated suppression of IEC responses. Aim 2 will test how PGD2 and CRTH2 affect barrier function and homeostasis and epigenetically program ISCs after Type 2 inflammation and how IEC CRTH2 deficiency during Type 2 inflammation impacts intestinal repair and pathology during a subsequent, acute or chronic inflammatory event. These studies are essential for understanding how PGD2 and CRTH2 aid in restoring gut homeostasis after Type 2 inflammation and will inform the use of existing CRTH2 modulators and other drugs that target lipids in the treatment of intestinal inflammatory disorders."

Women with pre-existing chronic conditions are more likely to experience unplanned pregnancy and
pregnancy complications than their peers without chronic conditions. Because contraceptive nonuse (not
using any contraceptive method) poses the greatest risk of unplanned pregnancy and is more prevalent
among those with chronic conditions, there is an urgent need to support the contraceptive goals of this group.
Contraceptive decision-making is a critical antecedent to contraceptive use, and a highly personal process. A
significant clinical care gap is the lack of resources that address the unique contraceptive decision needs
of patients with chronic conditions, such as understanding which methods may improve or worsen their
symptoms (e.g., anemia) or disease self-management (e.g., weight). Patients should also know if their chronic
conditions pose a health contraindication to a specific method, and if so, which other methods can be used
safely. However, clinicians, including primary care providers, do not routinely elicit patient preferences or
apply evidence-based contraceptive guidelines to counsel patients with chronic conditions. To address these
gaps, we designed a web-based tool, My Health My Choice (MHMC), to educate patients with chronic
conditions about their contraceptive options and promote clinician adherence to contraceptive guidelines from
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). MHMC is innovative because it is the first theory-
informed, user-tested contraceptive decision support tool that targets both patients with chronic conditions and
their clinicians. Our long-term goal is to improve reproductive health through contraceptive interventions in
general care settings. Building upon our promising pilot data, the study objective is to evaluate the efficacy of
MHMC in a two-arm, parallel cluster-randomized trial using mixed methods to compare MHMC (intervention)
to usual contraceptive care (control) in 14 primary care clinics that provide contraception. We hypothesize that
MHMC use will improve patient-reported quality of contraceptive decision-making and quality of contraceptive
counseling from their clinicians, which will lead to increased contraceptive use and decreased contraceptive
nonuse. The study aims are: Aim 1(Primary): To evaluate the impact of MHMC on contraceptive nonuse. Aim
2 (Secondary): To assess the impact of MHMC on adherence to the CDC Contraceptive Guidelines using
mixed methods. Aim 3: (Exploratory): To quantitatively explore decisional quality and contraceptive
counseling as mediators of the effects of MHMC on primary and secondary measures. The expected
outcomes are new findings regarding the efficacy of a novel contraceptive decision tool for individuals with
chronic conditions. This project will inform the development of scalable, person-centered contraceptive
interventions for medically at-risk patients in real-world clinical settings."

 Autoimmune diseases affect more than 20 million people in the United States, and the worldwide prevalence
is rising. Patients usually suffer from a lifetime of deteriorating illness because no cures are available for most
autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes. Addressing this formidable challenge requires a better
understanding of the pathogenic elements eliciting autoreactive responses. Although extensive studies have
examined the role of native antigens, whether neoantigens/neoepitopes function to drive the autoimmune
process remains poorly understood. The identity of neoantigens, especially post-translational modifications
(PTMs) responsible for generating immunogenic neoepitopes, requires a critical examination.
 Endocrine tissues are commonly targeted by autoimmunity. Diverse endocrine cells use the crinophagic
pathway to dispose of excessive amounts of secretory proteins to maintain cellular homeostasis. In this process,
the regular secretory granules are directly fused to lysosomes. The resulting vesicle, crinophagic bodies, or
crinosomes, are enriched with catabolized peptide segments. In type 1 diabetes, a deteriorating autoimmune
disease targeting the insulin-producing β cells in pancreatic islets, crinosomes function as an antigen source
providing native peptides for recognition by pathogenic CD4 T cells. Our recent examination by
immunopeptidomics uncovered diverse PTMs in crinosome-derived peptides, indicating that crinosomes are a
specialized repository of potential neoantigens and neoepitopes related to type 1 diabetes.
 A novel neoepitope family, C19S (cysteine-to-serine conversion in the insulin B-chain), became progressively
prominent along with the development of the diabetic autoimmune process. Most importantly, we identified highly
compatible sequences of C19S in mice and humans with T1D. In mice, C19S can be recognized by previously
unidentified CD4 T cells distinct from those reactive to the native epitope. It is therefore necessary to determine
the pathogenicity of the autoreactive T cells targeting C19S. Furthermore, as a representative neoepitope family,
C19S provides a setpoint for delineating how β-cell crinophagy functions as a novel pathogenic component in
T1D. C19S may initiate a ""feed-forward"" loop in T1D pathogenesis by linking β-cell stress with autoimmunity.
We also propose to assess translational applications of C19S in human crinophagy and T cell pathobiology.
These analyses may lead to a broad identification of neoepitopes generated by human crinophagy, which may
serve as valuable targets for T1D pathogenesis and therapeutics. Analysis of potential C19S-reactive T cells in
human PBMCs may extend our knowledge of autoimmune pathogenesis beyond the current paradigm defined
by native antigens."
10931516,"Project Summary / Abstract: Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a disease that leads to untreatable and
irreversible cone death and blindness. A myriad of loss-of-function mutations, including in transducin 1 or
phosphodiesterase 6 genes, underlie RP. Ex vivo studies from experimental models support abnormal
mitochondria performance as a common pathogenic condition leading to RP pathology. However,
evaluating such mitochondrial abnormalities in patients is not possible and a one-therapy-fits-all approach
is unlikely to improve outcomes patient diversity. Addressing these major knowledge gaps will require a
patient-friendly, non-invasive biomarker of mitochondria performance.
 Recently, we discovered a novel index of mitochondria performance based on a feature that is
readily identifiable in optical coherence tomography (OCT), the inner segment ellipsoid zone (ISez). Our
first-in-kind studies in wild-type mice show that the shape of the ISez profile changes from elongated
during a low energy demand condition (light) to rounder during a high energy demand condition (dark).
The underlying mitochondria etiology of the change in ISez profile shape is supported by electron
microscopy and oxygen consumption rate measurements in two mice strains with distinct mitochondria
activity. For example, OCT examination of cyclic-light reared 2-month-old mice with a mutation in the α
subunit of transducin 1 (Gnat1rd17) shows modest rod loss with a rounder-than-normal ISez and higher rate
of oxygen consumption than in the dark, biomarker evidence for early mitochondria overperformance.
Also, at postnatal (P) day 23, dark-reared mice with a mutation in the rod phosphodiesterase 6b gene
(Pde6brd10) show modest rod loss together with rounder-than-normal ISez when examined in the dark,
biomarker evidence for mitochondria overperformance. When P23 dark-reared Pde6brd10 mice are
exposed to room light for 1 hour they showed a more-elliptical-than-normal ISez shape suggesting rod
mitochondria underperformance. This is notable because, whilst the 1 hour of light did not cause
immediate additional rod death, accelerated rod loss reportedly occurs days later after continued dark-
rearing. These considerations show that the ISez profile shape is sensitive to abnormalities in the rod
energy landscape that precede later rod loss. The natural history of change of the ISez profile shape as it
relates to rod atrophy in cyclic-light reared Gnat1rd17 or Pde6brd10 mice is unknown.
 Our working hypothesis is that restoring our mitochondria performance biomarker (the ISez profile
shape) to wild-type-like levels predicts pro-survival treatment outcomes in experimental IRD. These
studies introduce an innovative and clinically relevant imaging biomarker, the ISez profile shape, for
assessing treatment efficacy in RP/IRD. Therapies that restore the ISez profile shape to normal are
ultimately expected to prevent loss of sight in patients with IRD."

Although multiple epigenetic processes contribute to developmental gene regulation, the mechanisms by which
they rewire gene regulatory networks during lineage specification are often unclear. Defects in epigenetic gene
regulation contribute to developmental disorders and disease. Nuclear RNAs, including multiple classes of
non-coding RNAs and nascent transcripts of coding genes help regulate the epigenetic landscape and facilitate
developmental gene regulation. We have focused on the functions of R-loops—RNA/DNA hybrids that most
often arise when nascent transcripts hybridize to their DNA templates—in the control of epigenetic gene
regulation in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We previously discovered that R-loops modulate binding
of the Tip60-p400 chromatin remodeling complex and partial depletion of R-loops from mESCs impairs the
fidelity of differentiation. However, the precise roles of R-loops in differentiation are unclear. We have recently
taken systematic and unbiased approaches to identify how R-loops impact the epigenome of mESCs and
uncover how depletion of R-loops disrupts differentiation. In addition, we uncovered R-loop binding proteins
that likely mediate some of their regulatory functions. We further developed new, single-cell genomic tools
necessary to uncover how R-loops and other classes of nuclear RNAs meditate their effects in different
lineages. Here, we propose to characterize the effects of one novel R-loop binding protein that functions in
gene regulation and is essential for cell proliferation. In addition, we will examine the roles of R-loops in
transcription elongation, fidelity, and RNA processing. Finally, we will leverage novel tools we developed for
simultaneous profiling of epigenetic features to identify the locations of R-loops and epigenetic marks during
gastrulation, where the three primary germ layers are established from pluripotent progenitors. Drawing on this
in vivo atlas, we will use an inducible RNaseH1 mESC line to disrupt R-loops in an ESC differentiation model,
uncovering their cell type-specific targets and mechanisms by which they control developmental gene
expression. Together, these studies will uncover the functions of a key mediator of R-loop dependent gene
regulation, the mechanisms by which R-loops modulate epigenetic marks critical for transcriptional fidelity, and
the developmental targets of R-loops. These studies will significantly expand our understanding of RNA-
mediated gene regulation and its roles in establishment of the mammalian body plan."

Early-onset atrial fibrillation (a first event of atrial fibrillation before 35 years of age) is associated with frequent
recurrences, often requiring electrical shocks to stop the arrhythmia, medication to prevent arrhythmia or
surgical/interventional management. Recent work has demonstrated that adult interventions for atrial fibrillation
(AF) are not effective in changing the frequency of recurrence in children and young adults. In clinical practice,
pediatric cardiologists do not follow the AF recommendations designed for adults. Recommendations for therapy
have not been established in early-onset AF, in part because we may be currently assessing the wrong markers
for risk. Our central hypothesis is that identifiable genetic factors are associated with clinical recurrence in
children and young adults with AF at ≤ 35 years of age. We will use three genomic approaches to addressing
our central hypothesis: a validated gene panel (Aim 1), common-variant analysis (Aim 2A), and rare variant
analysis with whole genome sequencing (Aim 2B). We will recruit patients with early-onset AF in a multicenter
network. In a prospective, observational study, we will record phenotype information and obtain genetic material.
In our first aim, we will determine if patients with pathogenic and likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants in 311
established cardiac genes have a shorter time to first AF recurrence than patients without a P/LP variant. By
testing clinically relevant genes in commercially available panels, we will be able to rapidly translate the results
of our first aim to clinical practice. In the second aim, we will focus on new genomic relationships. Data from
genome-wide association studies of AF in older adults have generated polygenic risk scores (PRS). High scores
on PRS have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults. However, it is not known
whether AF PRS have any relevance in children and young adults, nor whether they are markers of lifelong
genomic and myopathic risk. Therefore, we will validate whether existing AF PRS are higher in early-onset AF
than in a control population without cardiac phenotype. Finally, in a second genomic analysis, we identify
probands who have no P/LP variants in Aim 1 of the study. From those P/LP-negative probands, we will identify
trios where the proband has early-onset AF and both parents are negative for cardiac disease with a negative
family history of early-onset AF. We will perform trio whole genome sequencing to identify novel genetic markers
of risk in early-onset AF. If our central hypothesis is correct, these three approaches will identify a novel set of
risk factors in early-onset AF. The immediate impact will be the ability to test for commercially available genetic
abnormalities that identify risk of early AF recurrence and that may identify lifelong risk for progression of
myopathy, with implications for therapy and prevention. As a secondary benefit, the identification of P/LP variants
in a proband has implications for cascade screening in families. Finally, work on the genomic underpinnings of
early-onset AF has implications not only in the young, but as a hypothesis that the lifelong risks of atrial myopathy
affect the later incidence of atrial fibrillation in older adults."
10850811,"PROPOSAL SUMMARY
There are critical vaccine barriers to eliciting cytotoxic CD8 T cells against intracellular pathogens. Current
vaccine technologies have yielded limited success for protection against infections with intracellular pathogens
like tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV where CD8 T cells prevent and control infection. Licensed vaccines generate
mostly neutralizing or opsonizing antibodies, and their efficacy is contingent on a stable antigenic profile. Some
adjuvants like alum elicit helper type 2 CD4 T cells, but CD8 T cell immunity has been difficult to achieve. CD8
T cells can target conserved internal microbial components that are more difficult for pathogens to mutate. The
unparalleled potency, cross-protective immunity, and immunological memory mediated by CD8 T cells
underscores the urgency of developing CD8 T cell vaccines. To elicit CD8 T cell immunity, an adjuvant needs to
induce MHC presentation of the antigens present in the vaccine formulation by dendritic cells (DC), potent
antigen-presenting cells that prime naïve CD8 T cells. The MHC class I presentation of exogenous antigens such
as vaccine components by DC takes place through cross-presentation. Understanding the mechanisms that
regulate DC cross-presentation is thus critical for designing adjuvants that elicit strong CD8 T cell immunity. Our
published and unpublished work has shown that Toll-like receptors (TLR), which detect microbes and alert the
immune system, positively regulate DC cross-presentation. When studying the regulation of cross-presentation,
it is important to consider the route of antigen internalization into DC. Depending on the size of the internalized
antigen, internalization can be through phagocytosis (for particles that are >1µm in diameter) or endocytosis
(<1µm in diameter). We found that the TLR-dependent regulation of cross-presentation is different for endocytic
and phagocytic antigens. The common component that dictates the efficiency of cross-presentation to CD8 T
cells is correct subcellular trafficking of MHC-I molecules to sites of internalized antigen. For phagocytic antigens,
TLR signals control the traffic of MHC-I molecules from endosomal recycling compartments (ERC) in DC
specifically to phagocytic antigens such as from bacteria or infected dying cells. For endocytic antigens, we found
that a distinct TLR signaling machinery is involved, which controls endocytic antigen cross-presentation to CD8
T cells and traffics MHC-I molecules to endocytosed antigen from a cellular source other than the ERC. Using a
variety of validated and complementary approaches, we will investigate TLR-regulated mechanisms of endocytic
antigen cross-presentation and subcellular MHC-I trafficking to endocytosed antigens. We will elucidate how the
distinct TLR mechanisms that regulate endocytic antigen cross-presentation impact protective circulating and
tissue-resident CD8 T cell memory elicited by vaccination. We will use prototype subunit vaccines formulated
with adjuvant/TLR ligand combinations that engage and boost DC endocytic antigen cross-presentation.
Deciphering regulatory mechanisms of endocytic antigen cross-presentation will directly impact the design of
effective CD8 T cell vaccines to clinically relevant old and new pathogens including those with pandemic potential."

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) commonly co-occur, and this comorbidity
is associated with higher consumption, treatment dropout, and risk for relapse. Urban populations of low
socioeconomic status are particularly at risk for AUD and PTSD. Research on the etiology of co-occurring AUD
and PTSD is needed in these understudied and low resourced populations to help address a disparity in the
knowledge base. Directional models of comorbidity exist, self-medication and susceptibility, although there are
major gaps (e.g., few studies testing direction of causation and or bidirectionality effects, lack of specificity of
assessment, lack of test of sex effects). Additionally, comorbidity could be influenced by genetic risk as both
AUD and PTSD are moderately heritable, overlap in latent genetic risk, and are genetically correlated in large
genome wide association studies (GWAS; rG=0.35). Black persons are underrepresented in genetics research,
and thus, genetically informed studies in this population are critically needed for equity in knowledge gained in
this area. The current multi-method study will fill these gaps by conducting a genetically informative ecological
momentary assessment (EMA) study using a longitudinal measurement burst design. Participants recruited
through the Grady Trauma Project (GTP), which consists of high-risk inner-city residents. We will enroll a sample
of 400 individuals and they will be asked to provide: clinical interview diagnostic data on PTSD, AUD, and
comorbidities, detailed self-report measures including trauma history, social determinants of health, other risk
and protective factors, and a saliva sample for GWAS. The EMA protocol will capture the temporal relations
between PTSD and alcohol use phenotypes (e.g., consumption, binge, AUD symptoms, craving) and clarify not
only who is at risk, but when the risk behaviors occur. Analyses will simultaneously test all three models of
comorbidity (i.e., self-medication, susceptibility, shared risk) and will test for sex specific pathways. Following
this initial period of EMA, a measurement burst design consisting of three EMA bursts, each spaced two months
apart, will occur to examine the impact of time varying social determinants of health (e.g., new trauma, financial
stress, racial discrimination) on the functional relationships found in the first aim. Lastly, the exploratory aim will
conduct genome wide analyses with a focus on a novel multivariate genetic method, genomic Structural Equation
Modeling (gSEM), which will be used to produce polygenetic risk scores (PRS) that index genetic risk for
comorbidity of PTSD and AUD, and unique risk for each condition. PRS indexing shared risk between AUD-
PTSD, unique to AUD, and unique to PTSD, will be incorporated into the best fitting models from the EMA
analyses to determine if the phenotypic relations found are influenced by genetic risk. This study will advance
our understanding of risk underlying co-occurring AUD and PTSD, which is imperative to the development of
effective prevention and treatment programs, particularly among racially minoritized inner-city residents who are
at increased risk for trauma exposure and subsequent AUD and PTSD."

The goal of this R01 proposal is to develop an ultra-soft, fully implantable, wireless label-free cardiac mapping
and modulation system and apply it to identify chronic electrophysiological and metabolic changes and their links
during heart failure (HF) development, progression, and pacing treatment in unrestrained conscious animals at
cellular and whole heart levels. To achieve this, a miniaturized, mechanically compliant platform that integrates
high-density, high-resolution sensing and modulation channels with wireless energy harvesting, storage, control,
and data communication module is proposed. The resulting systems will greatly reduce motion artifacts and
allow bidirectional high-content electrical and metabolic mapping and pacing in live animals. Those devices are
innovative because they directly address the current limitations in chronically quantifying the individual roles and
interplay between vital cardiac biophysical parameters during heart disease pathogenesis and will be used to
fundamentally investigate the complex disease mechanisms involved in pathophysiological conditions leading to
lethal HF and its therapeutic treatment. Once realized, this technology will be highly valuable to the cardiac
research community. In the long term this work will enable closed-loop multiparametric cardiac mapping and
pacing systems and offer new approaches to study the precise mechanisms and optimize the diagnostic and
therapeutic strategies of other life-threatening heart diseases beyond HF. The three specific aims are:
 Aim 1 will establish ultra-soft multimodal cardiac systems for label-free cellular-resolution mapping of the
excitation-contraction-metabolic waves and cardiac pacing. The mechanically compliant highly stretchable
systems consist of high-density arrays (~300 channels in total) of (1) transparent microelectrodes for electrical
mapping and stimulation; (2) multicolor micro-light-emitting diodes, and micro-photodetectors to excite and
measure the autofluorescence of major endogenous fluorescent markers of cellular energy metabolism.
 Aim 2 will develop fully implantable wireless schemes for power harvesting, storage, control, and data
communication to chronically operate the platforms in Aim 1 within a closed thoracic cavity in freely behaving
small animals, which is beyond any possibility supported by current techniques. Graphical user interfaces will be
developed for device configuration, real-time bidirectional control, data acquisition and processing. The
integrated systems will be characterized, validated, and optimized by iterative benchtop measurements.
 Aim 3 will systematically investigate the precise mechanisms of HF pathogenesis and therapy using a battery
of tests in rat models of HF. The functions of the proposed systems will be assessed in both ex vivo and in vivo
studies. The implantable cardiac devices will identify the individual roles and links between local metabolic and
electrical properties during different time points and stages of HF development and progression, and thoroughly
evaluate the effects of cardiac-resynchronization therapy."
10739792,"Background. Social factors exert a substantially more potent impact on health than does health care, especially
among disadvantaged populations such as VA users. Adverse social determinants of health (SDH)—factors such
as housing instability, food insecurity, social isolation, and transportation barriers—are linked to problems with
access, poorer clinical outcomes, and increased health care costs. Despite the clinical and business case for
integrating SDHs into health care, these factors are not systematically assessed or addressed in clinical settings.
Significance/Impact. This study will leverage a previous survey of Veterans at high-risk for hospitalization, and a
new survey to be fielded to a nationally-representative sample of Veterans, to determine how SDHs influence
clinical, health care utilization, and experience outcomes. Review of findings by key stakeholders will generate
recommended SDH measures for universal screening within VA. These steps, coupled with qualitative interviews
about implementation challenges, will inform the future integration of high-value patient-reported SDH measures
into VA’s health record.
Innovation. The proposed work is innovative in its evaluation of a broad array of SDHs in high-need Veterans
to identify candidate measures for electronic health record (EHR) integration. The study will leverage a
theoretically-driven survey of SDH measures with a data-driven approach to identifying the associations between
these SDHs and a range of health, utilization, and patient experience outcomes. Results from these analyses
will inform a facilitated deliberative process to prioritize high-value, validated, and actionable measures that are
predictive of outcomes that are important to Veterans and the VA.
Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will use data from an Office of Primary Care-funded survey of Veterans at high-risk
for hospitalization to examine relationships between patient-reported SDH measures and utilization, cost, and days
in the community outcomes. In Aim 2, we will field a survey to a nationally-representative sample of VA patients to
determine the association between SDH measures and key outcomes, and to examine the prevalence of SDHs in
subpopulations of Veterans who are disproportionately affected by disparities (e.g., women, racial/ethnic minorities,
and rural Veterans). Aims 1 and 2 will inform partner and stakeholder discussions in Aim 3 to identify measures
that are associated with key outcomes and that are perceived by operations partners as actionable (i.e.,
addressable through VA or community services) and thereby good candidates for EHR integration.
Methodology. In Aim 1, we will leverage data from an operations-funded survey that our team administered in
2018. Using survey data for 4,685 Veterans at high-risk for hospitalization, we will examine the association
between patient-reported SDHs and utilization (i.e., VA and Medicare emergency department visits and
hospitalizations), VA and Medicare costs, and days in the community. In Aim 2, we will field a similar survey to
a nationally-representative sample of Veterans, evaluate the association between SDHs, patient experiences
(e.g., perceived access and coordination), and 12-month VA emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and
costs, and describe the prevalence of SDHs in the general VA population and Veterans who are at risk for health
disparities. In Aim 3, we will use a facilitated deliberative process with key stakeholders to prioritize actionable
SDH measures for EHR integration, and then conduct qualitative interviews with health system leaders,
clinicians, staff, and patients to examine implementation barriers and facilitators to assessing select SDH
measures at point of care.
Implementation/Next Steps. This study addresses health equity, particularly relevant in light of COVID-19, and
will be conducted with partners from VA’s Offices of Primary Care, Health Equity, Rural Health, and Women’s
Health. The study is especially timely with VA’s transition to the new Cerner EHR as the proposed aims will identify
SDH measures for potential EHR integration that are concise, actionable, and predictive of important outcomes."
10731387,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been going on for over a year worldwide, with 115,000,000
confirmed cases and over 2,500,000 deaths (as of Mar 3, 2021). We are seeing people recover
from the initial COVID19 infection with complaints of ongoing problems. An increasing number of
people are complaining of cognitive deficits and depression/anxiety. Veterans are at a higher risk
of COVID19 infection as well as suffering complications due to a number of co-morbidities.
Veterans with neurocognitive complications may experience premature aging and
neurodegeneration that could manifest as a huge burden for health care.
We have brought together two laboratories studying neurocognitive impairment using an EEG,
MRI, and behavioral approach as well as laboratory-based data. The Ford lab proposes to query
neuropsychological function in Veterans using a computerized internet-based neuropsychological
battery, EEG-based measures, functional MRI (connectivity) and structural MRI (gray and white
matter volumes, myelin, micro-bleeds). The Pulliam lab has preliminary data to show a continued
increase in plasma cytokines in COVID19 survivors. Plasma isolated neuronal enriched
extracellular vesicles (nEVs) showed an increase in amyloid beta, neurofilament light and pT181-
Tau, all proteins associated with neurodegeneration. The Overall Aim is to determine the extent
of the cognitive, clinical, and neurological damage in people recovered from COVID19.
The Specific Aims are to: 1) characterize neuropsychological function in COVID19 survivors, 2)
assess EEG and MRI data in COVID19 survivors, 3) determine whether peripheral inflammation
and markers of neuroinflammation, aging, and neurodegeneration persist in nEVs, and 4) explore

10731390,"Compared to a civilian population, Veterans have particularly high rates of severe chronic pain and
Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). Prevalence of chronic pain in individuals with OUD remains high despite
engagement in opioid agonist treatment (OAT), the first line treatment for OUD, consisting of buprenorphine or
methadone. Chronic pain treatment in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has recently shifted to
promoting non-pharmacologic approaches to treat chronic pain; however, individuals with OUD are often
excluded from pain treatment clinical trials. Among individuals with chronic pain and OUD receiving OAT, the
most commonly reported pain coping strategies are prayer, over the counter medication, and opioid
medication. There is an immediate need to develop evidence-based pain treatments for chronic pain that can
be integrated into OAT for Veterans with chronic pain and OUD.
 The gold standard non-pharmacologic treatment for chronic pain is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
for chronic pain. Despite having a favorable view of non-pharmacologic pain treatment, many OAT clinics lack
adequate staffing training and resources for intensive pain treatment such as CBT. Furthermore, Veterans are
often hesitant to seek care in pain specialty clinics due to stigma (e.g., drug-seeking behavior) and frequent
OAT dosing visits. Walking is a core component of CBT for chronic pain and has demonstrated effectiveness
at reducing pain in chronic pain patients. More specifically, walking has been identified as a low-cost, highly
accessible intervention that has been shown to reduce pain, disability, and increase quality of life in individuals
with chronic pain but has not been tested in Veterans with OUD engaged in OAT.
The proposed study will determine feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy for Steps to
Change (S2C), a behavioral pain treatment that includes biopsychosocial pain education and an adaptive
walking program. Importantly, S2C will be offered within in the Veteran’s OAT clinic to increase access and
encourage treatment engagement. Pain interference (primary outcome) collected using ecological momentary
assessment (EMA), where behavior is repeatedly sampled using a mobile device. The use of EMA to measure
pain interference offers considerable benefits to in-clinic measurement including significantly reducing recall
bias and substantially improving reliability of measurement. Daily steps will be measured using a study
provided pedometer and entered in end of day EMA surveys. Sixty Veterans will be randomized to either 1)
S2C or 2) health education control each consisting of 4x60 minute weekly groups in the OAT clinic. All
participants will complete EMA surveys for 8 weeks (1-week baseline, 4-week treatment, and 1-week post, 3-
and 6-month follow up). We predict that study procedures will be feasible with timely randomization,
comparable retention and EMA survey completion between treatment groups. We also predict that Veterans in
both groups will rate treatment as satisfying and credible with Veterans randomized to S2C reporting greater
average steps per day at post-treatment. Finally, we predict that Veterans receiving S2C will report lower pain
interference (vs. health education) at post-treatment and 3- and 6-month follow-up.
There is an urgent need for accessible, evidence-based pain treatments that can be integrated within
the VHA’s specialized OAT clinic and substance use disorders clinics. This treatment will serve a focused
exposure to chronic pain treatment, not as a replacement for CBT for chronic pain. To date, a walking
intervention has not been evaluated in Veterans with OUD receiving OAT, a population with high rates of
untreated chronic pain that are often excluded from pain treatment studies."

Ions are ubiquitous in nature and all charged biomolecules subsequently develop an ion atmosphere.
Unfortunately, our understanding of ion atmospheres at the atomic level is rather limited, and this severely
impacts our ability to determine and rationalize protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, for example. Here,
we propose to use the Kirkwood-Buff theory of solutions, coupled with local electroneutrality constraints, to
generate an improved view of the ion atmosphere around a variety of biomolecules. The results generate exact
relationships between the distribution of anions and cations around charged biomolecules and provide a way to
separate the ion contributions to electroneutrality from those related to the preferential interaction of a salt for a
biomolecule. A series of theoretical and computer simulation studies are proposed to achieve the two major aims
of the project. Aim 1: To Develop an Improved Description of Ion Atmospheres in Biological Systems. Aim 2: To
Determine the Consequences of Local Electroneutrality Requirements. The results from these studies will
provide a new view of the structure and extent of ion atmospheres around any biomolecular ion and will improve
our interpretation of the results from several biophysical techniques, such as osmotic pressure and ion counting
studies. Subsequently, this will impact our understanding of a wide range of systems of importance for the study
of many health-related diseases."
10861081,"ABSTRACT
The incidence of LC in never-smokers (LCINS) has been increasing but the etiology of this cancer type is largely
unknown. We have generated exciting preliminary data showing that exposure to house dust mites (HDM), the
most common indoor aeroallergen worldwide, not only provokes allergic reactions and inflammation in the lungs,
but also induces pro-tumor inflammation and DNA damage, and accelerates lung cancer (LC) development in
three preclinical mouse models of LC at a dose within the range of the annual human HDM exposure. We
identified that HDM genomic DNA is present in the tumors of a high percentage of LCINS patients and that it is
a strong activator of the AIM2 inflammasome and inducer of IL-1β secretion. Based on these new findings, we
hypothesize that long-term exposure to HDM increases the risk of LC development in susceptible hosts (i.e.,
mice and humans genetically predisposed to LC or co-exposed to other lung carcinogens). Our objectives in this
proposal are: 1) to investigate the cellular mechanisms by which chronic HDM exposure changes the lung
microenvironment and makes it conducive to LC development, 2) to determine whether HDM has mutagenic
effects by studying the mutational signatures potentially linked to HDM exposure in mice in vivo and in human
lung organoids in vitro, and 3) to translate these findings to LCINS patients by identifying the composition of the
lung tumor microenvironment (TME) and the mutational signature profiles in a subgroup of patients with signs of
prior exposure to HDM. Our long-term goal is to increase public awareness of the risk that chronic exposure to
HDM may pose for the development of LCINS. Thus, we propose the following three specific aims (SA): in SA-
1, we will test whether HDM exposure changes the cellular composition of the lung TME, in SA-2, we will
determine whether HDM exposure induces somatic mutations in lung epithelial cells, and in SA-3, we will
evaluate whether HDM exposure can be used as a biomarker for diagnosis, prognosis, and targeted therapy in
LCINS patients. The expected outcomes of this work are 1) to identify the cellular mechanisms by which HDM
exposure promotes LC development in susceptible hosts, 2) to demonstrate that chronic exposure to HDM is a
new environmental risk factor for LCINS, 3) to provide strong scientific support for the development of novel
preventive (e.g., HDM avoidance) and therapeutic (e.g., anti-HDM vaccine, anti-IL-1β antibodies, and
NLRP3/AIM2 inhibitors) interventions in LCINS patients chronically exposed to HDM, and 4) to expand the
investigations of exposure to other aeroallergens as potential risk factors in LC."
10909293,"Summary/Abstract: Accumulating evidence, including our own, indicates that in utero exposure to psychosocial
stress is associated with risks for elevated anxiety (ANX) and disruptive behavior (DB) symptomatology. In this
application, we will build on our existing birth cohort of children exposed and unexposed to Superstorm Sandy (SS)
in utero. SS randomly “assigned” stressful conditions to pregnant women and their offspring in our cohort, giving
us a unique opportunity to conduct a quasi-experiment of in utero stress. Using our deeply phenotyped cohort, we
propose to investigate whether in utero SS exposure modulates the impact of the postnatal stressful environment,
either amplifying (double-hit acceleration model) or shielding (stress inoculation model) the effects of postnatal
stress on ANX and DB symptomatology. We will continue to measure different types of postnatal stress (normative,
poor parenting, and COVID-related) to examine if magnitude, nature, timing and duration of the postnatal stressors
influences the direction and impact on such symptomatology. As well as the DSM-based diagnostic outcomes, we
will utilize the NIMH RDoC and focus on Negative Valence and Cognitive Control Systems (NVS/CCS), which will
enable a transdiagnostic perspective of pre- and postnatal stress-related changes in behavior and the brain.
Following our prior work, we will also examine sex-specific manifestations of the behavioral phenotypes (more
internalizing problems in girls and more externalizing in boys) and explore the moderating role of SES when
intersecting with individual differences in behaviors. As the brain is the central modulatory organ of
stress/adaptation and regulation, we will use neuroimaging to assess changes in brain structure, function, and
connectivity in limbic-frontal circuitry during early pre- and post-puberty, using a subsample of our cohort. Our
cohort was followed from in utero, with completed follow-up assessments (neurobehavioral, clinical, and biological
specimens), which will continue as they enter pre/puberty (ages 9-13), a time of peak risks for such problems and
sex-dimorphism. Specifically, we will: 1) examine the effects of SS-related stress and the postnatal psychosocial
environment on trajectories of clinical and adaptive neurobehaviors; 2) study the impact of prenatal SS stress and
postnatal stress on NVS/CCS brain outcomes (structure and function) and evaluate the extent to which NVS/CCS
structural changes mediate between prenatal SS-exposure and child anxiety and DB symptoms; and 3) develop
predictive models for NVS/CCS outcomes in early adolescence based on biological and behavioral measures
obtained in utero and/or the first decade of the child’s life. As pre/puberty is an important period of developmental
transition and heightened risk for ANX and DB, we will build on our unique repository of both clinical and stored
hair samples and continue to chart children’s neurobehavioral development and risk for psychopathology through
ages 9-13. Together with the inclusion of neuroimaging to investigate neural mechanisms centered on the
NVS/CCS and using tasks from the ABCD study, our study is uniquely positioned to elucidate the mechanisms of
fetal programing and threat sensitivity in the NVS/SSV that modulate the risks for anxiety and reactive aggression."
10878888,"ABSTRACT
Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that low-dose computed tomography can substantially reduce
lung cancer mortality, albeit at the cost of relatively high rates of false positives and complications from
downstream procedures. However, systematic differences between trial and general populations eligible for
lung cancer screening raise concerns about the relevance of trial findings for guiding the development and
dissemination of lung cancer screening programs in clinical practice. Despite clear recommendations from the
United States Preventative Services Task Force, lung cancer screening uptake and adherence remain low.
Several studies have documented dramatic and selective attrition across the screening continuum – where
about 10-20% of eligible individuals undergo lung cancer screening and of those, only about 40-60% are up-to-
date with their annual screening at 15 months. When the benefits and harms of an intervention vary across
subgroups and there is selective attrition, the balance of population-level benefits and harms is expected to
change. As such, there is an urgent need to better characterize the effectiveness of lung cancer screening with
low-dose computed tomography when applied to individuals outside of clinical trial settings. The primary
objective of this proposal is to generate real-world evidence of the benefits and harms of lung cancer screening
with low-dose computed tomography that explicitly considers the characteristics of populations at each step of
the screening continuum, from the screening-eligible, to the screened, to the adherent. To address this
objective, we will use cutting-edge causal inference methods, including trial transport and target trial emulation
using real-world data, which can avoid the potential for time-related biases. To carry-out our proposed
analyses, we will draw upon individual-level data from the randomized National Lung Screening Trial, as well
as four real-world datasets including the National Health and Interview Survey, the Behavioral Risk Factors
Surveillance Survey (Lung Cancer Screening Module), a 20% nationwide sample of Medicare claims, and the
North Carolina Lung Screening Registry. Findings from this study will generate information about the
effectiveness of lung cancer screening in real-world settings that can be used by patients, providers, and
policymakers. This work will enhance the evidence base used by policymakers to update screening
recommendations and refine decision aids to support communication with patients about screening net-
benefits during shared decision-making. Ultimately, this work will support efforts to improve the delivery of lung
cancer screening at the population level."

Genetic mutations or environmental insults that impair development of neural circuit connectivity can lead to
autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia, which together affect the quality of life, independence, and
productivity of millions of Americans and cost hundreds of billions of dollars annually. ASD and schizophrenia
are associated with an increased ratio of excitatory-to-inhibitory (E/I) synaptic transmission, raising the possibility
that drugs that are capable of restoring E/I balance could treat both disorders. GABAergic parvalbumin-
expressing fast-spiking interneurons (PV-INs) play critical roles in regulating inhibitory output in striatal networks
and coordinating high-frequency oscillations underlying cognition, sensory information processing, motor
behavior, and behavior, which are frequently disrupted in ASD and schizophrenia. The ability of PV-INs to fire
high-frequency action potentials (APs) is dependent on the expression of the voltage-gated potassium (K+)
channel Kv3.1, whose expression is largely restricted to PV-INs. De novo mutations in Kv3.1 are associated
with ASD in humans. A growing body of genetic, mathematical modeling, and pharmacological evidence
strongly suggests that small molecule potentiators/activators of Kv3.1 channel gating could promote PV-IN firing,
inhibitory output, and E/I balance. However, the dearth of potent and specific Kv3.1 channel potentiators with
suitable drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic (DMPK) properties has slowed efforts to critically evaluate the
therapeutic potential of Kv3.1 in treating ASD and schizophrenia. Here, we propose to employ a molecular target-
based drug discovery approach to develop 2-3 state-of-the-art Kv3.1 channel potentiators and then use them in
a mouse model of ASD to evaluate their ability to restore PV-IN excitability. In Aim 1, we will employ a fully
developed and validated fluorescence-based high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to interrogate
approximately 100,000 compounds from the Vanderbilt Institute of Chemical Biology library for novel Kv3.1
potentiators. Fluorescence and automated patch clamp electrophysiology assays will be used to identify potent,
selective, and chemically tractable compounds for further development. In Aim 2, an iterative cycle of medicinal
chemistry and functional assays will be used to optimize the potency, selectivity, and in vitro DMPK properties
of novel Kv3.1 potentiators. The studies outlined in Aim 3 will employ mouse brain slice electrophysiology to
evaluate the ability of optimized Kv3.1 potentiators restore PV-IN excitability in the nucleus accumbens and pre-
frontal cortex. We will specifically characterize the effects newly developed Kv3.1 potentiators on genetically
identified PV-IN current-voltage relationships, AP waveform, and firing frequency. This high-risk/high-reward
proposal will create unprecedented opportunities for pharmacologically modulating PV-IN excitability and
inhibitory output, critically evaluating the therapeutic value of Kv3.1 for modulating E/I balance, and potentially
impacting the clinical treatment of ASD and schizophrenia."
10872178,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Clinical observations from the late 1940s/early 1950s suggested that high-dose folic acid (FA) supplements,
while temporarily alleviating megaloblastic anemia of B12 deficiency, led to relapse and exacerbation of
neurological symptoms in B12-deficient patients. This led to discontinuation of FA supplements to treat B12
deficiency by the early 1970s. However, the mechanism by which FA putatively caused exacerbation of B12
deficiency was never elucidated. The issue of exacerbation of B12 deficiency by exposure to excess FA was
rekindled after the institution of FA fortification in the United States in 1998 when subsequent epidemiological
cohort studies indicated that people with deficient serum B12 and elevated serum folate concentrations had
greater risk of anemia and cognitive impairment, greater elevations of functional biomarkers of B12 deficiency
[serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine (Hcy)], and greater decrease in serum concentrations of
the active form of B12, holotranscobalamin (holoTC) than those with deficient B12 and non-elevated folate.
Recently, we proposed a novel hypothesis to explain the exacerbation of B12 deficiency by exposure to
excess FA: Excess intake of FA depletes serum holoTC, thereby decreasing active B12 in the circulation and
limiting its availability for tissues. Depletion of holoTC by FA in individuals with low B12 status further reduces
the capability to deliver B12 to B12-dependent enzymes, leading to a more pronounced state of biochemical
deficiency as reflected by elevated MMA and Hcy in blood (PMID: 34634124). The overall goal of this
proposal is to test this hypothesis using data from the 2011-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES). The Specific Aims are (1) assess the associations of total folate status with serum
holoTC, MMA, and Hcy, (2) determine if the associations between folate status and holoTC, MMA, and Hcy are
specific to the form of elevated folate in serum (i.e., FA versus methyltetrahydrofolate), and (3) determine if the
associations between serum folate and holoTC, MMA, and Hcy are modified by B12 status, age, sex, renal
function (as indicated by serum creatinine), and race/ethnicity. To address these aims, we will utilize both
existing data from the NHANES 2011-2012 cohort, including serum total B12, total folate, FA, 5-
methyltetrahydrofolate, MMA, creatinine, and new measurements of key biomarkers not already available in
the cohort, including serum holoTC and Hcy. Associations among the variables will be assessed using
multivariate linear regression. The proposed studies will directly address the hypothesis that excess FA intake
exacerbates B12 deficiency as indicated by metabolic indicators of B12 status, and will identify characteristics
of individuals who are susceptible to these effects of excess FA (e.g., age, overall B12 status, and renal
function). The results will inform future research to determine the acute and long-term health effects of
depleted B12 status resulting from high FA intakes in populations exposed to FA fortification and FA-containing
supplements."
10895450,"Deficits in mentalizing, a high-order social cognitive process that allows individuals to build representations of
others’ state of mind (e.g. emotions and motivation) and adjust their own behaviors accordingly, are
hypothesized to underline the core social communication abnormalities that characterize autism spectrum
disorder (ASD). Our pilot data outline a specialized mentalizing neural network that includes the temporo-
parietal junction (TPJ, including the posterior superior temporal sulcus, pSTS), that can be modulated with
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). These data show that the activity in the right TPJ/pSTS is
specifically modulated by mentalizing processes, probed with a social-competitive fMRI Domino task, and that
young adults diagnosed with either ASD or schizophrenia show decreased mentalizing related activity in this
region compared to typically developed (TD) controls. However, this deficit is associated with social
communication skills only in ASD. Thus, specifically modulating the underlying neural mechanisms of
mentalizing with rTMS could be an effective intervention for this core deficit in ASD. With this proposal, we will
delineate the mechanistic effects of inhibitory vs. excitatory rTMS of the right TPJ, specifically in modulating
mentalizing task-related (MTR) neural activity in adults diagnosed with ASD (N=40) compared to matched TD
(N=40) individuals ages 18-35 with IQ>80. All participants will be scheduled for four study sessions that include
a baseline and three subsequent sessions that will each include two functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) scans, one pre and one post an rTMS session. During each fMRI scan, participants will be engaged in
intersocial, competitive Domino task that involves mentalizing. Our rTMS manipulation, administered in a
double-blind, counterbalanced fashion, includes one session each of excitatory (intermittent theta-burst
stimulation, iTBS), inhibitory (continuous TBS, cTBS), and sham sequences. The rTMS will be guided with
individualized electric-field modeling calculated from a structural MRI scan collected on the baseline session.
This robust design is necessary to identify the optimal rTMS sequence to engage the right TPJ and the
mentalizing network in ASD because firm conclusions about how best to modulate this network cannot be
drawn from the few known published reports. We expect to replicate our previous findings of a mentalizing
network, with a right TPJ node, that will highlight deficits in ASD relative to TD participants. Also, we
hypothesize that iTBS will result in increased, while cTBS in decreased MTR neural activity in the mentalizing
network, with this being more pronounced in ASD, and sham resulting in no change. Understanding this
mechanism will be the first and crucial step in validating rTMS of the right TPJ as a viable neural target to
modulate neural circuit, and subsequently to modulate social-communication skills in ASD in future clinical
studies. The significance of such a line of research should be considered in the context of the high prevalence
of ASD and the dire need of developing effective interventions, especially for adults."

Gout is prevalent in the US (3.9% of the adult population) and not only directly impacts peoples’ lives but is
also co-morbid with cardiometabolic disease. Gout consists of unpredictable episodes of acute inflammation or
flares resulting from monocyte NLRP3 inflammasome activation by monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in
people with hyperuricemia, the subsequent production of IL-1, and recruitment of large numbers of
inflammatory cells into the affected joint. Epigenetic reprogramming and altered gene transcription in response
to elevated levels of soluble urate are mechanisms of this enhanced cellular reactivity to the secondary stimuli,
known as innate trained immunity. To better understand the factors controlling the progression from
hyperuricemia to gout we have completed a very large genome-wide association study (GWAS) in gout,
identifying several hundred gout-associated loci. Loci include long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that have
diverse functions including regulation of gene expression, deposition of epigenetic modifications and
organization of chromosome architecture. Some are immune gene-priming lncRNAs (IPLs) that direct
transcriptional machinery over multiple promoters. From these loci we have identified one key causal pathway
(clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP)) for which we will study the molecular genetic
processes controlling its activation. The CHIP pathway is involved in control of the epigenome - DNA
methylation, histone modification and metabolism of substrates. It may make people more susceptible to gout
by causing the innate immune system to be hyper-responsive to MSU crystals. We hypothesize that the
genetic loci identified from the gout GWAS control activity of this pathway by regulation of gene expression,
including through regulation of the epigenome. In testing this hypothesis, in three Aims, we will understand the
molecular control of the pathway and provide a basis for future studies in targeting this pathway for improved
management of gout. In Aim 1 we will use experimental systems, including a zebrafish model of gout, to
understand where regulatory regions are expressed and how the gout-associated loci influence NLRP3-
inflamasome activation. Zebrafish are translucent, allowing development of innovative models, and there is
82% conservation of genes with humans and functionally equivalent macrophages and neutrophils. In Aim 2
we will compare the transcriptome and epigenome in MSU crystal-stimulated monocytes of individuals with
high and low burdens of gout risk alleles in order to gain further insights into the molecular regulation of the
pathways, and to identify downstream pathways. Individual genes will be knocked down in a cell line. In Aim 3
we will use our established pipeline to understand how lncRNAs (i.e. IPLs) connect transcriptional machinery
to the promoters of innate immune genes at specific loci in the molecular control of activation of the gout flare.
Our studies will deepen our knowledge of the mechanisms of gout flares and its genetic basis, and ultimately
point to areas of research that may allow for novel treatments in gout."
10901961,"Project Summary
 Neuroinflammation, characterized by microglial activation and increased pro-inflammatory cytokine
production, is evident early in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and appears to play an important role in disease
progression. Signaling through TREM2 (Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) mediates this
inflammatory response through effects on microglial activation. TREM2 has also been recognized as a risk
factor for AD with missense mutations in the gene being associated with increased risk of AD and elevated
levels of TREM2 in the cerebrospinal fluid correlating with decreased disease severity. Excitingly, TREM2 was
recently shown by members of our study team to be a druggable target by the newly designed, orally available
agent, Sob-AM2. While Sob-AM2 has shown to be neuroprotective in other neurodegenerative disease
models where neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment are also evident, it has not yet been developed for
use in AD. The studies proposed here will begin to fill in these existing gaps in the preclinical testing of Sob-
AM2.
 In Aim 1 we will optimize the concentration of oral Sob-AM2 needed to elicit maximum increases in TREM2
expression in the brain without evoking toxicity. Aims 2 and 3 will utilize the identified dose, determine the
optimal timing of treatment initiation and assess efficacy in AD mouse models. Aim 2 will use the 5xFAD model
of beta-amyloid accumulation while Aim 3 will use the PS19 model of tauopathy to investigate the effects of an
early versus late start of oral Sob-AM2 treatment on the downstream effects of TREM2 activation on AD
pathology as well as neurodegeneration, cognition and neuroinflammation. We will also monitor the
downstream targets of thyroid hormone signaling to identify non-TREM2 related effects of Sob-AM2 as well as
to ensure that there is no evidence of aberrant signaling and that peripheral off-target effects are not seen.
 This work will address critical questions surrounding dosage and treatment duration of the first orally active,
small molecule drug to target TREM2. Given the lack of disease modifying AD therapies, Sob-AM2 is a very
promising candidate drug to develop for use in AD and completion of these essential preclinical studies
described in this project will greatly accelerate its eventual clinical translation."
10910119,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an increasing public health burden for which current therapies are focused on insulin
replacement. Future T1D treatments will try to preserve endogenous pancreatic beta cell function in new onset
T1D and replace beta cells via transplantation in long standing diabetes. Classically, T1D is viewed as an
autoimmune disease but beta cell loss is also driven by genetic risk factors and metabolic stress. Much has
been done to try to delay T1D progression from preclinical multiple autoantibody positivity to clinical disease, but
progression is highly heterogenous. C-peptide preservation can improve diabetes control and decrease the risk
for diabetes complications. There are a wide array of C-peptide measurements to examine endogenous beta
cell function and stress and many genes have been associated with C-peptide preservation in T1D. Less is
known about the influence of genetics on the preservation of endogenous beta cell function during the partial
remission period (PRM) or “honeymoon” after diagnosis. These factors are also likely important for patients with
chronic pancreatitis (CP) who have risk for islet loss but for whom genetic risk and metabolic stressors remain
largely unexplored. Patients with CP have severe pain and progressive endocrine insufficiency due to persistent
inflammation and hepatic insulin resistance. For patients with severe CP, total pancreatectomy with islet auto-
transplantation (TPIAT) is an attempt to preserve a patient’s endogenous beta cell function while removing the
source of their pain. Younger age and higher beta cell mass during transplantation are predictors for functional
graft survival. Less is known about the role of beta cell genetics in these patients, which I will evaluate in this
proposal.
I am an emerging researcher with experience in basic science beta cells studies and clinical research defining
heterogeneity in T1D. My goal in this career development award is to hone clinical research skills by studying
the impact of genetics and markers of beta cell function in patients with newly diagnosed T1D and in a model of
cell therapy (CP patients who have undergone TPIAT) with these aims:
1: Analyze if baseline markers of beta cell function and stress can predict PRM C-peptide preservation.
2: Evaluate if known pre-specified T1D SNPs are associated with PRM C-peptide preservation
3: Evaluate if pre-specified SNPs associated with C-peptide preservation predict insulin use and C-peptide in
CP patients who have undergone TPIAT
As part of this K23 award proposal, I outline educational, training, and scientific goals that will support my
pathway to independence. I have assembled a diverse and broad mentorship/collaborator team to support this
endeavor. This career development award will support my career goal to elucidate heterogeneity in beta cell
(dys-)function in diabetes and to develop novel cell therapy interventions."

From asymptomatic carriage to life-threatening diarrhea and colitis, C.difficile interacts with humans through a
range of phenotypes. The mechanisms underlying this spectrum are incompletely understood. Despite progress
in the understanding of the disease and the advent of newer therapies, patient outcomes such as failure to
respond promptly to therapy (~20%), recurrence (~21%), death, colectomy or need for critical care (severe
outcomes, ~3 %) remain common. As patient-centered outcomes (PCOs) take center stage in clinical research,
C.difficile Infection (CDI) will not be an exception. This Career Development proposal is based on the central
hypothesis that integrated analysis of immune, microbial and metabolic data (IMM/d) from new and existing
cohorts of CDI patients and carriers, by identifying biological markers and pathways, can transform patient
outcomes (especially PCOs) and re-categorize the CDI to colonization continuum (CDI/cc). Javier A. Villafuerte
Gálvez [JVG], MD is an Instructor at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and a gastroenterologist subspecialized in
immune-mediated digestive disease at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC). He has gained
substantial experience in clinical and translational research during his post-doctoral and T32 fellowships while
proving commitment to a patient centered research career.
This Award will provide the applicant with the opportunity to develop quantitative analysis skill while taking full
advantage of mentored research opportunities to address knowledge gaps in prediction, classification and
pathobiology of CDI. Dr. Ciarán P. Kelly, an expert in CDI and bowel inflammation will serve as mentor, along
with Dr. Yang-Yu Liu, an expert in bioinformatics studying the dynamics of the human gut microbiome who will
be co-mentor. The Advisory Committee composed by CDI and methodological experts (Drs. Garey, Pollock,
Gerszten and Dubberke) will confer regularly with the applicant to evaluate progress.
The K23 award will aid JVG to establish an independent research program applying bioinformatics tools to unmet
needs in immune-digestive disorders, with CDI as a first model. The backbone of the curriculum will be the
Master in Biomedical Informatics at HMS. Grant writing training and support through Harvard Catalyst will be
critical. The first aim of this project is to identify fecal IMM/d biological markers and pathways at the time of CDI
diagnosis associated with severe outcomes, recurrence and disease trajectory. Informed by this, we will recruit
a new CDI cohort to measure PCOs (symptoms, quality of life) while collecting biospecimens, in order to identify
IMM/d biological markers and pathways predicting and underlying PCOs. Finally, with IMM/d as substrate to
machine learning algorithms blinded to standard diagnostics, we will re-categorize patients in the CDI/cc in new
functional disease groupings. This research will answer critical questions in CDI diagnostics, prognostication and
pathobiology while placing PCOs at the forefront, generating foundational data for R-level proposals."
10913596,"A faulty AGA gene coding for the dysfunctional enzyme results in a severe and progressive genetic neurological disorder, Aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU, OMIM # 208400). The functional enzyme is required for the breakdown of glycoproteins in the cellular lysosomes. Absence of enzymatic activity results in impaired lysosomal function and accumulation of aspartylglucosamine (GlcNAc-Asn) in the lysosomes of various tissues and body fluids. The key consequence of the substrate accumulation is lysosomal hypertrophy that manifests as intellectual disability, and other associated symptoms including skeletal and joint abnormalities. Patients have slowed/regressive psychomotor development throughout childhood, deteriorating around the third decade of life to become severely impaired mentally and physically, highly dependent on supportive care thereafter. The median lifespan of AGU patients is approximately 40-50 years. Through efforts primarily funded through a parent-organized non-profit foundation, the Rare Trait Hope Fund, Dr. Gray’s lab has generated preclinical data supporting the initiation of a Phase I/II gene therapy trial to treat AGU. A Type B preIND meeting was held with the FDA regarding this in January 2018, which has charted a clear path forward for human translation. This approach would use an AAV9/AGA vector injected intrathecally, following a precedent set by Dr. Gray’s previous efforts to initiate similar Phase I trials for Giant Axonal Neuropathy at the NIH Clinical Center in 2015 and for CLN7 Batten disease at Children’s Medical Center Dallas in 2021. The wealth of available disease-specific biomarkers for AGU (including localized imaging of the AGA enzyme substrate in discrete brain regions) along with a potentially large treatment window, make AGU an ideal disease to rapidly and fully assess the complete efficacy and/or shortcomings of intrathecal AAV9 as a “platform” approach to treat many other neurological diseases. We propose to conduct the necessary IND-enabling studies to initiate a Phase I/II clinical trial for AGU."

Despite the critical need for high quality data in order to plan, implement, and evaluate malaria control
interventions, malaria surveillance is particularly poor in high burden countries such as Uganda. Malaria
molecular surveillance (MMS), which evaluates parasite DNA and host antibodies present in biological
samples to derive epidemiologically actionable information, has the potential to improve upon current
surveillance methods; however, there is limited use of these data outside of the research setting. A current
research priority is to understand how serologic and parasite genetic data can be used to enhance routine
malaria surveillance methods and evaluate malaria control interventions. Recently, our team was funded to
directly measure malaria incidence via enhanced passive surveillance within the catchment areas around 64
health facilities throughout Uganda. These 64 clusters will then be randomized to receive one of two types of
novel bednets, and cross-sectional surveys will be performed at each site 12, 24, and 36 months after the roll-
out of the intervention has been completed. This K23 project offers an outstanding opportunity to leverage
samples from cross-sectional surveys at these 64 sites to test the hypothesis that MMS will enable us to
estimate malaria incidence with more accuracy than parasite prevalence (PfPR), using enhanced incidence
data as the gold standard. Our approach will be to use established molecular techniques, including multiplex
serologic assays, qPCR, and amplicon deep-sequencing, to generate molecular metrics from samples
collected in these cross-sectional surveys; we will then build statistical models using these molecular metrics
as variables to estimate incidence as the outcome. Aim 1 is to use serologic metrics to improve the estimation
of malaria incidence in children <5 years compared to standard models based primarily on PfPR. Aim 2 is to
use parasite DNA-based metrics to improve the estimation of malaria incidence in children <5 years compared
to standard models based primarily on PfPR. In Aim 3, we will identify the set of MMS metrics that best
estimates changes in incidence over time to determine how changes in MMS metrics (both serologic and
parasite DNA-based) between each survey timepoint can be used to accurately predict changes in incidence
from year to year at each site. To complete this project, I will need additional mentorship and training in
seroepidemiology and biostatistical methods in addition to field experience in public health and surveillance
activities as outlined in this proposal. This K23 award will provide the crucial link in my transition from a
laboratory scientist to achieving my career goal of becoming a molecular epidemiologist with a focus on public
health surveillance, with the skills to effectively utilize molecular data to evaluate, develop, and apply
population level interventions for malaria control and elimination. I will emerge from this award prepared for a
strong NIH R01 application focused on utilizing molecular data to enhance malaria surveillance in settings with
poor health infrastructure in order to better target malaria control interventions."

Coincident signals are an essential feature of cellular communication. By detecting simultaneous inputs,
cells can filter signal from noise in complex chemical environments to mount proper responses. In many
biological and pathological contexts, coincident pH signals regulate the activity of individual proteins and
signaling networks. Examples include acidotic signals in maturing endosomes, inflammatory zones,
synapses, and tumor microenvironments. Our long-term objective is to understand how these coincident
pH signals regulate biology through different classes of cell surface receptors.
 We have developed a comprehensive and ambitious research program for studying proton-gated
(H+-gated) coincidence detection by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest and most
therapeutically targeted class of transmembrane receptors in humans. More than 800 GPCRs detect a
rich diversity of inputs, including H+. Although a few pH-sensing GPCRs are activated by protons alone,
we have shown that H+-gated coincidence detection is a far more common feature of GPCR regulation.
In this mode of proton sensing, GPCR agonism and/or inhibition is concurrently modulated by pH.
Our efforts to illuminate this context-dependent mechanism for controlling GPCR activity have led us to
establish a new frontier in cell signaling biology that is likely relevant to all receptor classes.
 The broad objective of our proposed research program is to pursue an in-depth understanding of
H+-gated signaling and pharmacology for a wide variety of GPCRs. By creating innovative wet-lab and
computational technologies, developing cutting-edge cell models, and building large libraries of GPCRs
in cell-based assay systems, our lab can extensively study the effects of pH on GPCR signaling. As such,
we can profile ambitious numbers of GPCRs and ligands as a function of pH using our yeast based
DCyFIR platform and human cell models. Our proposed program of research comprises three project
areas that synergistically utilize these unique capabilities: H+-gated GPCR coincidence detection of
metabolites and drugs, pH regulation of secreted peptide and protein sensing by GPCRs, and pH-
intelligent nanobody research tools and therapeutic leads for GPCRs.
 Over the next five years, our goal is to illuminate the mechanisms by which H+-gated coincidence
detection regulates the selectivity of endogenous and artificial agonists, inhibitors, modulators, approved
drugs, and conformationally-selective nanobody probes for a sizeable fraction of the human GPCRome.
We anticipate these efforts will enable us to both design and repurpose an array of therapeutic leads,
exploratory probes, and pharmacological tools for selectively targeting, controlling, and studying GPCR
signaling mechanisms at discrete physiologic pH values. As such, we anticipate our ambitious research
program will establish a new paradigm for GPCR biology and pharmacology in acidotic scenarios."
10738274,"Low back pain, most commonly caused by degeneration of the intervertebral disc,
places a significant social and economic burden on the general public, active duty
military and veterans alike. The intervertebral discs of the spine are the largest avascular
structures in the body, and the cells within the disc therefore rely on the transport of
nutrients and waste products across the vertebral endplate to maintain disc
homeostasis. A compromise in transport across the vertebral endplate interface is
therefore implicated in the initiation and progression of disc degeneration. The
overarching goal of this proposal is twofold: (1) Elucidate the properties of the boney and
cartilage endplates that affect trans-endplate transport and how alterations in transport
contribute to disc degeneration, and (2) investigate alterations to trans-endplate
transport and disc health during non-operative treatment of patients with back pain and
their correlation with pain relief and functional outcomes. These goals will be
accomplished via the following specific aims: Aim 1: Determine the structural,
mechanical and compositional properties of the vertebral endplates affecting diffusion
and convection into healthy and degenerative human intervertebral discs. A custom
MRI-compatible device will be constructed to quantify the transport properties of
cadaveric human endplate samples under both diffusion and convection (fluid flow).
Transport properties will then be correlated with boney endplate compositional and local
mechanical properties, as assayed via µCT, histology, Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR), local strain tracking analysis, and atomic force microscopy (AFM).
Aim 2: Establish correlations between intervertebral disc degeneration, trans-endplate
small molecule diffusion, and vertebral endplate structure, composition and mechanics in
an in vivo rabbit model. Intervertebral disc degeneration will be induced in vivo in a rabbit
model via puncture of the disc with a 16G or 21G needle. Animals will be euthanized at
4, 8, and 16 weeks post-puncture to generate a spectrum of degeneration from mild
(21G puncture) to severe (16G puncture). Small molecule trans-endplate diffusion into
the disc will be quantified via post-contrast enhanced MRI T1-mapping. The boney and
cartilage endplates will be assayed via microFil enhanced µCT to determine bone and
vascular density. Composition and mechanics of the endplates will be assayed via FTIR
and AFM, respectively. Degeneration of the intervertebral disc will be assessed via MRI
T2-mapping, histology, biochemistry and gene expression assays. Aim 3: Determine the
feasibility and preliminary outcomes of quantifying the effect of physical therapy on
trans-endplate diffusion into the degenerative disc in patients with back pain. Human
patients with back pain concomitant with disc degeneration will be subjected to MRI T2-
mapping and post-contrast enhanced T1-mapping at time points prior to and 6 weeks
after physical therapy. Standard questionnaires of pain (visual analog scale), function
(Oswestry Disability Index), as well as objective measures of lumbar range of motion,
will be completed at the same time points to establish correlations between disc health,
nutrition and patient outcomes."
10906967,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Stroke represents the primary cause of adult disability in the United States. A frequent, debilitating
consequence of stroke is impairments in the ability to produce and/or comprehend language, called aphasia,
which has profound impacts on quality of life due to the barriers it places on participation in professional and
social daily life activities. Behavioral intervention—the current standard-of-care—provide some benefit for
persons with aphasia (PWA), but their effectiveness is variable due in part to logistic and financial limitations
that render interventions with the level of frequency, intensity, and duration required for lasting benefits
infeasible for many PWA. Thus, there is a need for novel, time- and cost-effective interventions to expedite and
improve aphasia recovery. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has emerged as a promising
noninvasive brain stimulation technique that may enhance stroke-related disability (motor impairments) and
other neurological and psychiatric disorders, but the potential for improving outcomes specifically for language
impairment has not yet been explored. The career development and research plans of the proposed project will
allow the candidate to establish a T2 translational research program as an independent investigator to
systematically explore the potential for tACS to enhance treatment outcomes in individuals with stroke-induced
language impairment. The career development plan will help expand the candidate’s research program to
include basic and clinical investigations of tACS-induced plasticity and its potential to facilitate language
abilities in unimpaired and impaired speakers. The research plan provides an empirical foundation for this
research program by investigating the neurophysiological mechanism by which tACS promotes language
performance enhancement. The long-term goal of this research is to develop effective intervention approaches
for individuals with acquired language impairment by combining theoretically- and neurally-guided intervention
with treatment-enhancing neuromodulation techniques. The main objective of this proposal is to establish a
best-practice approach for using tACS to support impairments in spoken word production. The central
hypothesis of this proposal is that tACS can enhance word production abilities by modulating endogenous
neuronal activation patterns associated with language. The rationale for the proposed research is that
understanding neurophysiological biomarkers of language impairment and tACS-induced changes in neuronal
pattens of activation may help determine the most effective approach to enhancing stroke treatment outcomes
while extending our basic science knowledge of how tACS modulates neural activity. The proposed research is
significant because it will enable the development of intervention procedures that maximize recovery from
acquired language impairment, combining targeted therapy with tACS to unmask the residual capacity
neuroplasticity in chronic stroke survivors. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH’s mission pertaining to
developing fundamental knowledge that will potentially help to reduce the burdens of human disability."

Veterans suffer at a disproportional rate from squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract,
(SCCUADT) due to carcinogen exposure from tobacco and alcohol. Squamous cell carcinoma of the head
(SCCHN), specifically the oral cavity and larynx is also driven by carcinogen exposure and comprises a lethal
subset of these tumors. Despite aggressive treatments, SCCHN is a devastating disease that portends an
overall 5-year survival of only ~50%. This Merit Review recently identified that an understudied ion channel,
TMEM16A plays a key role in promoting SCCHN proliferation, by activating mitogenic signaling pathways. Not
surprisingly, we found that TMEM16A interacts with EGFR family members, HER2 (Erbb2) and HER3 (Erbb3)
and potentiates intracellular signaling. Interestingly, we surreptitiously discovered TMEM16A overexpression in
pre-cancerous (dysplastic) tissues obtained from patients undergoing cancer treatment. This renewal
application seeks to exploit this finding and determine if TMEM16A plays a critical role in cancer development,
in addition to the role it plays in promoting the growth and proliferation of frankly malignant cells.
This proposal therefore seeks to better understand the mechanism(s) by which SCCUADT develops, so that
we may develop effective strategies to treat the pre-malignant condition before the development of invasive
carcinoma. In order to reach this ultimate goal, we begin by proposing experiments that will elucidate the
fundamental biologic process that underlie the formation of pre-malignant lesions, in the context of carcinogen
exposure and define the mechanisms by which these lesions progress into invasive cancer. Aim I tests the
hypothesis that TMEM16A overexpression is an early event that promotes carcinogenesis. We will (A)
determine if TMEM16A is overexpressed in the earliest stages of carcinogenesis and (B) identify the molecular
mechanisms that regulate this overexpression. We will accomplish this using both human tissues and a mouse
model of carcinogen-induced SCCUADT. Firstly, we will determine if TMEM16A is overexpressed in tissues
that have been exposed to carcinogen, even in the absence of histologic changes. We will also determine if the
level of TMEM16A expression in premalignancy characterizes an increased risk of progression to invasive
cancer. Second, we will extend these investigations to dissect the molecular mechanism(s) that regulate
TMEM16A gene expression. Specifically, we will determine if gene amplification plays a role in this disease
process. We also employ cutting-edge promoter occupancy assays to determine which transcription factors
drive TMEM16A expression.
Aim II tests the model that carcinogenesis is initiated by increased levels of oxidative stress (reactive oxygen
species, ROS) which ultimately triggers a run-away cycle leading to increased TMEM16A and uncontrolled
growth. In this Aim, we will (A) determine the signaling pathways that are activated by TMEM16A and (B)
determine if TMEM16A inhibition will serve a therapeutic strategy to treat dysplasia. We postulate that
increased ROS leads to upregulation of NRF2 signaling. NRF2 acts to increase TMEM16A transcription and
ultimately promotes mitogenic signaling. Using a novel knock-out mouse model, we will determine if TMEM16A
is required for carcinogenesis. Finally, we use pharmacologic inhibitors to target TMEM16A, and implicate it as
a novel therapeutic target.
At the end of the proposed funding cycle, we plan to have characterized the role of TMEM16A in the process of
carcinogenesis of the UADT. We posit that this information will shed valuable insights into the biology of this
understudied disease and identify novel targets that may ultimately prevent the development of cancer."
10925375,"Impaired higher-order cognition is well-documented in different forms of neuropsychiatric illness, present in
unaffected relatives, often presumed to underlie behavioral symptoms, and associated with functional
outcome. Cognition is thus exceedingly relevant to studies of the etiology and trajectory of psychopathology.
Nonetheless, the relationship between cognitive decrements and specific psychopathological conditions is not
yet resolved. There are particular knowledge gaps in this regard for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD), one of the most common child psychiatry conditions worldwide. While models of ADHD have long
highlighted executive functions (EF) as driving the behavioral symptoms of the condition, cognition in ADHD is
increasingly acknowledged to be complex. Twin and family studies link aspects of cognition to ADHD risk, but
findings are inconsistent. Also, not all affected youth show EF deficits, and domains separable from EF are
impaired to varying degrees. Moreover, cognitive decrements within and beyond ADHD disrupt academic and
psychosocial functioning and show limited response to pharmacologic treatments that benefit the disorder.
Thus, understanding the overlapping and separable heritable neurobiology of ADHD and its related cognitive
systems has implications for psychopathology models and patient care. In this proposal, we will study these
issues through the lens of the NIMH’s Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework, which encourages a
dimensional approach, interrogation of specific transdiagnostic traits, and multi-level links across genetics,
brain systems and behavior. We will also capitalize on new resources in the field, i.e., advances in cognition
genomics, novel computational strategies, and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study.
Our goal is to validate and demarcate the heritable biological underpinnings of specific cognitive
systems that overlap with and extend beyond the ADHD construct. Our aims converge with NIMH PAR-
21-263, which seeks computational studies to validate dimensional constructs represented in the RDoC matrix
in relation to psychopathology. Aim 1 will extract the genetic basis of ADHD-related cognitive constructs
represented in RDoC using samples in the UK Biobank and comprehensively characterize their overlap with
the genetic risk for ADHD using cutting-edge statistical genetics methods. Aim 2 will develop and validate an
efficient, deep learning based, longitudinal neuroimaging processing pipeline that can extend to youth with
diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds, and produce an atlas of brain regions and neural circuitry that underlie
the cognitive constructs and the ADHD dimension. Aim 3 will train machine learning models that can integrate
genetic risk scores, neuroimaging markers, and cognitive and behavioral phenotypes to predict future ADHD
symptoms, cognitive functioning and functional outcomes. Completing these aims will advance models of the
overlapping and distinct neurobiological bases of ADHD and its associated cognitive systems, which, in turn,
will yield opportunities for risk stratification and novel therapeutics."

Lipids are major components of bacterial membranes and play vital roles in bacterial survival, host-pathogen
interactions and pathogenesis. An important mechanism used by bacteria to interact with hosts and cope with
antimicrobial stresses is the modulation of surface charge via alteration of membrane lipid composition. However,
membrane lipids remain uncharacterized for many significant bacterial pathogens, and our understanding of how
the bacterial cell surface contributes to pathogenesis is still very limited. We aim to address these important
knowledge gaps in our research on Gram-positive pathogens. We recently discovered novel, highly positively
charged glycolipids in a range of Gram-positive pathogens, including the neonatal meningitis pathogen
Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus; GBS). The overarching hypothesis of the project is that
cationic glycolipids impact Gram-positive bacterial cell surface biochemical properties and play crucial roles in
pathogenesis. Using GBS as a model organism, in Aim 1 we propose to investigate mechanisms for cationic
glycolipid-dependent blood-brain barrier disruption by GBS. We will examine key mechanisms involved in barrier
disruption, including loss of tight junctions, direct bacterial invasion and transcytosis, and inflammatory damage.
We will also characterize the role of GBS membrane vesicles during the pathogenesis of meningitis. In Aim 2,
we will investigate regulatory interactions between cationic glycolipids and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) biosynthesis.
Our genetic and lipidomic analysis show that these pathways have an inverse relationship because they utilize
the same substrates. This is a novel mechanism for regulating the cell surface structure-function of a Gram-
positive pathogen, and has relevance beyond GBS, as we have also identified novel cationic glycolipids in
multiple pathogenic enterococci. We will investigate this proposed mechanism further and quantify how this co-
regulation impacts the structure and level of GBS LTA using a combination of chemical, biochemical and genetic
approaches. In Aim 3, we will investigate the molecular mechanism for cationic glycolipid synthesis. The enzyme
that synthesizes novel cationic glycolipids is the Multiple Peptide Resistance Factor (MprF), a broadly distributed
virulence factor in bacteria. The molecular mechanism for lipid substrate selection by MprF enzymes is unknown.
Using molecular evolution, global statistical models, and machine learning approaches that analyze the entire
MprF family, we propose a rigorous dissection of MprF lipid substrate specificity in GBS, which will inform studies
of MprF structure-function in GBS and other pathogenic bacteria, and guide the discovery of other pathogenic
species producing cationic glycolipids. Overall, this project will elucidate the biosynthesis, distribution and
physiological functions of the novel cationic lipids in GBS and other Gram-positive bacteria and uncover their
roles in bacterial pathogenesis."

 Desmosomes are adhesive intercellular junctions that play critical roles in epidermal homeostasis by
mediating robust cell-cell adhesion and by modulating signaling pathways that regulate epidermal
differentiation. The importance of desmosomes is highlighted by numerous autoimmune and inherited skin
diseases that compromise desmosome function and cause epidermal fragility. These diseases include
pemphigus vulgaris (PV), a severe autoimmune epidermal blistering disease caused by autoantibodies (IgG)
directed against the desmosomal cadherin desmoglein-3 (Dsg3). The precise mechanism by which PV IgG
disrupt desmosome adhesion and trigger signaling pathways associated with the loss of adhesion are not well
understood. This limitation has hindered the development of new therapies that can spare or eliminate the
need for immunosuppressive treatments which can pose risks for patient safety. In the current proposal, we
outline a series of cutting edge imaging approaches that will resolve with previously unachievable detail
precisely how PV IgG disrupt adhesion. Aim 1 studies will determine how pemphigus IgG disrupt desmosome
dynamics, architecture, and function using cryo-EM, live cell imaging, and molecular dynamics simulations. In
Aim 2, we focus on how keratinocytes respond to pemphigus IgG and the role of Ca2+ signaling and
endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways in the endocytosis of desmosomal proteins and in the inflammatory
responses associated with desmosome disruption in both cultured cells and patient tissues. The outcome of
these studies will produce fundamentally new conceptual models for desmosome regulation and will form a
foundation for the treatment of skin diseases associated with loss of desmosome adhesion."

Placental dysfunctions arising from oxidative stress (OS) and inflammation are major pathophysiological
contributors to adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs; ~11% of all pregnancies). Risk-induced OS and
inflammation compromise various placental homeostatic functions, leading to APOs. The majority of APOs
lead to either indicated or spontaneous preterm birth, as delivery is the only option to reduce the risk of feto-
maternal mortalities and morbidities. Currently, no successful interventions are available for reducing the risk of
APOs. The lack of therapeutic strategies preventing APOs is partly due to the lack of models that accurately
recreate human placenta pathology and the in utero environment of the human fetal (placental)-maternal (F-M)
barriers. The placenta exhibits distinct cellularity in each of the pregnancy trimesters, which are under different
O2 environments. Current models (e.g., explant, 2D and transwell cultures, placental perfusion, and animals)
have several limitations as they do not address the complex and dynamic interplay between placental and
maternal cells, which has hindered understanding of placental physiology during normal pregnancies and
pathologies in APOs. To overcome these current limitations, we will develop a novel Placental (fetal)-decidual
(Maternal) interface (PMi) 5-chamber organ-on-chip (PMi-OOC) designed to mimic PMi structure and function
representing each of the three pregnancy trimesters, with specific O2 environments. New knowledge gained
from this study will be crucial in elucidating placental biology/pathology. Using three aims, we advance our
current placenta OOC and test the hypothesis that OS and inflammation-associated placental pathologies
compromise PMi homeostasis, leading to APOs.
Specific Aims are:
 SA 1: Engineer all three trimester-specific “healthy, physiological state” PMi-OOCs with or without the
 addition of maternal decidua immune cells.
 SA2: Develop a trimester-specific disease state model to study the effects of OS and inflammation. This
 model will be validated with the use of antioxidant N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine or anti-inflammatory interleukin-10
 to mitigate the effect of OS or inflammation.
This research will develop trimester-specific placenta OOC models that can be utilized to study healthy, and
disease states of pregnancy as well as conduct various preclinical trials."

 Although total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is effective at reducing pain from end-stage osteoarthritis (OA), it is
an acute trauma to the joint which exacerbates the underlying weakness and disability common with OA,
leading to long-term atrophy and further disability. Attenuation of this acute loss of strength and function can
lead to improved long-term outcomes. Key to attenuating this acute loss is effectively managing postoperative
knee swelling. Knee swelling after TKA is profound and is theorized to be a major driver of this acute strength
and functional loss. This early postoperative strength loss is driven by a deficit in voluntary activation that
acutely limits rehabilitation potential and leads to long-term atrophy and disability. Traditional interventions
such as elastic compression stockings (e.g., thromboembolism-deterrent [TED] hose) have minimal
effectiveness in reducing swelling after TKA. We have demonstrated in a preliminary study that an inelastic,
adjustable compression garment can decrease early postoperative swelling by 50%. However, there is a need
to formally evaluate the preliminary effects of this garment on all outcomes to inform sample size calculations
for a larger trial. Additionally, as a majority of research to date on quadriceps activation and swelling has relied
on laboratory induced swelling, this trial will be uniquely positioned to explore in-vivo mechanistic relationships
between changes in swelling and quadriceps activation. Therefore, we propose a randomized controlled study
of 58 older adult participants undergoing TKA to determine if an inelastic adjustable compression garment
(INCOM) improves postoperative swelling more than elastic TED hose (CONTROL). Both groups will wear the
assigned garments for the first 3 weeks after TKA and participate in a standardized rehabilitation program after
TKA. Outcomes will be assessed preoperatively and postoperatively at weeks 1, 3 (end of garment use),12
and 26. This study will enable us to determine (AIM 1) if INCOM results in improved surgical limb swelling
control after TKA (primary outcome) compared to CONTROL and (AIM 2) to explore the preliminary efficacy of
INCOM on the outcomes of quadriceps strength, pain, range of motion, physical function, and patient reported
outcomes after TKA compared to CONTROL. Additionally, we will explore (EXPLORATORY AIM) the
mediating role of swelling on outcomes after TKA. This study has high potential to prevent acute strength and
functional losses in the short-term and improve long-term health of the millions of older adults who will undergo
TKA annually. This study will uniquely provide insights into 1) causal relationships between swelling and
strength/functional outcomes and 2) mechanisms for quadriceps activation deficits. Study findings will also
provide insights into the management of numerous other patient populations with significant quadriceps
activation deficits (knee OA) or extremity swelling (post-surgical or trauma)."

American healthcare is rapidly evolving to a state where efficiency, quality and patient satisfaction are dominant
drivers. Several trends are driving fundamental changes in health care: 1) an expanding scope of virtual care
and telemedicine, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has changed how patients, healthcare providers,
and health systems interact; 2) a growing recognition of disparities leading to an emphasis in providing healthcare
equitably for historically marginalized populations; 3) an increasing appreciation for the patient as a critical
stakeholder in therapeutic decision-making, leading to an emphasis on patient-centered design; and 4)
increasing access to home health to enable better diagnosis, prevention and management of health conditions,
as illustrated by widespread adoption of home-testing for SARS-CoV-2. Despite this rapidly changing
environment, heart (cardiovascular), lung, blood, and sleep disorders (HLBS) continue to cause significant
morbidity, mortality, and cost in the US and worldwide. Combined, these diseases account for 41% of deaths in
the US and lead to over $400B in direct health care expenses plus lost income to affected patients and
caregivers. Thus, there are urgent unmet needs in HLBS. We will address these issues with the renewal of the
Center for Advancing Point of Care Technologies (CAPCaT) in HLBS Disorders. CAPCaT is a highly successful
Point-of-Care Technology Research Network (POCTRN) Center that leverages our experience running a
medical product incubator, the Massachusetts Medical Device Development Center (M2D2) at the University of
Massachusetts (Lowell and Worcester campuses), and our experience administering grants, running, and
managing solicitations, and working 1:1 with awardees to advance their technologies toward commercialization.
CAPCaT expanded upon the original vision and success of M2D2 and now has its own established track record
and collaborative network to develop and optimize novel POC and home-based technologies to improve the
diagnosis and management of HLBS disorders. Our objectives in achieving this goal are to continue: 1)
identifying, through stakeholder engagement, the most promising POC and home-based technologies to address
unmet medical needs; 2) supporting developmental plans, including pathways to adoption at the point of care or
in the home; and 3) training and disseminating developing POC and home-based technologies to the different
stakeholders."

 In Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) women outnumber men in approximately 9:1 ratio. Previously,
sexual dimorphism in immune processes has been explained by the location of immune genes on the sex
chromosomes, or by the effects of sex hormones. However, as demonstrated by our group, 87.8% of sex-biased
genes in skin lie on the autosomes, including interferon (IFN)-response genes (IRGs), as well as other genes
associated with autoimmune disease susceptibility, and are unrelated to sex hormone levels in vitro and in vivo.
Therefore, the mechanisms involved in autoimmune predisposition in women remain unclear.
This application is focused on elucidating the mechanism by which the Hippo pathway regulator Vgll3 promotes
autoimmunity, but our previous work identified this factor as a key determinant of sexually dimorphic immune
responses. Thus, VGLL3 target genes are enriched for multiple immune response elements associated with
multiple autoimmune diseases, including SLE, and a recently developed mouse model, where Vgll3 was
expressed constitutively in mouse epidermis develop a robust SLE-like inflammatory phenotype characterized
by increased type I IFN activation, and expression of SLE-associated cytokines including Tnfs13b (BAFF),
Tnfsf4, type I IFNs, along with robust activation of humoral immune response accompanied by autoantibodies
(anti-dsDNA) and immune complex deposition in skin and kidneys. Strikingly, crossing of transgenic Vgll3 mice
with Il-7 receptor deficient mice prevented development of this autoimmune phenotype, suggesting a critical role
for IL-7 in SLE pathogenesis.
 These observations form the basis of our hypothesis that VGLL3 nuclear trafficking and modulation of
TEAD transcription factor activity promotes an IL-7 dependent autoimmune phenotype. Three aims are
proposed to: Elucidate the mechanisms of VGLL3-induced IL7 expression (Aim 1). Determine the dependency
of VGLL3 and interferons in promoting sex-biased expression of IL7 (Aim 2), and to determine the mechanism
of IL-7-driven systemic autoimmune responses (Aim 3).
 This proposal will focus on a novel mechanism of sex-biased autoimmunity driven by VGLL3 modulation of
Hippo pathway signaling and activation of IL-7, and the target cell type it acts on to drive the down-stream
autoimmune response. It will elucidate a novel VGLL3-IL7-autoimmunity pathway in SLE pathogenesis and
provide novel approaches for future therapeutic targeting of this devastating disease."
10857210,"Heart disease is the leading cause of mortality worldwide and disruption of transcription in cardiomyocytes (CMs) contributes to the progression of heart disease. Transcriptional regulation of some individual genes by transcription factors (TFs) is described. However, much less is known about how functionally related genes, or gene expression programs, are collectively regulated in a coordinated manner in healthy and diseased CMs. The Mediator Complex serves as a bridge to link transcriptional machinery and TFs to control transcription, but the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by Mediator are not well-understood. Mediator is a large multiprotein complex organized as submodules, with the CDK8 kinase submodule regulating RNA Polymerase II transcriptional activity. MED12 is an essential Mediator component, and within the kinase submodule, is required for CDK8 kinase activity. Although traditionally considered a transcriptional repressor via the CDK8 kinase submodule, our published data demonstrates that increased MED12 is also able to directly activate transcription. Our preliminary studies indicate that MED12 levels are increased in failing hearts from humans and mice, sup- porting the clinical relevance of this novel MED12 function in mis-regulation of transcription in heart disease. Our published studies in mice with CM-specific Med12 deletion demonstrate that MED12 regulates a calcium-handling gene expression program, through direct interaction with the TF MEF2. We identified additional TFs that interact with MED12, and these findings suggest that MED12 has multiple transcriptional functions depending on its interactions, but its functions have not been delineated. To determine the contribution of MED12 to transcriptional mis-regulation in heart disease, it is crucial to define its molecular interactions and functions in CMs and identify its cell-specific roles. Subpopulations of kinase submodules have been reported in other cells, but their functions have not been defined. Additionally, functions of individual kinase submodule proteins have not been investigated for their roles in alternative kinase subcomplexes or for functions independent of the kinase submodule. Our published CM-specific Med12 knockout model (cKO) and newly generated CM Med12 transgenic model (cTg) both develop heart failure, emphasizing the critical contribution of MED12 to transcriptional homeostasis in CMs. We will use our Med12 genetic models to delineate the functions of MED12 in CMs. We will identify MED12 kinase subpopulations, interactions with TFs, and genomic interactions in normal CMs and those with MED12 overexpression. We will also assess the ability of a human MED12 missense mutations to bind TFs and kinase submodule proteins using hi-PSCs. The long-term goal of my lab is to uncover mechanisms that control coordinated transcriptional programs in the heart. In this proposal we aim to 1) determine the mechanisms of MED12-regulated transcription in CMs, and 2) identify the transcriptional mechanisms of MED12- driven heart failure. Consequently, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing cardiac gene expression will provide new insight into therapeutic strategies to restore cardiac function during disease."

 More than 2.7 million military service members have deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan since 2001.
Compared to non-deployed personnel, Veterans of these conflicts have a higher prevalence of exertional
dyspnea and other respiratory symptoms which may relate to exposure to inhalational irritants during
deployment. While many of these patients have asthma or other common respiratory conditions, approximately
one-third remain undiagnosed with a traditional lung disease despite an extensive pulmonary evaluation. In a
case series reported by our group in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2011, 38/49 such Veterans were
diagnosed with constrictive bronchiolitis (CB) after surgical lung biopsy. Although more than a decade has
passed since this initial report, no follow-up study has been performed to define the clinical evolution of
disease in these Veterans. Further, no study has been performed to link development of constrictive
bronchiolitis to specific exposures - either self-reported or quantified in lung tissue samples. Finally, although
constrictive bronchiolitis was included in the recently passed PACT Act, there is currently no means of
establishing this diagnosis outside of a surgical lung biopsy which is costly and carries significant morbidity and
some mortality.
 Our published and preliminary data suggest that lung biopsies from Veterans with DR-CB have chronic
activation of adaptive immunity which is associated with progressive airflow obstruction. Further, these findings
occur in association with widespread deposition of polarizable and non-polarizable pigmented material
containing foreign elements such as lead, silicon, strontium, and titanium. These data led us to hypothesize
that persistent elemental species in the lungs of Veterans with DR-CB drive ongoing adaptive immune
activation and progressive airflow obstruction. Further, we hypothesize that new imaging-based techniques can
diagnose DR-CB without a surgical lung biopsy. To test these hypotheses, we will 1) identify and quantify trace
elements in the lungs of Veterans with DR-CB, Veterans without DR-CB, and civilian controls, and correlate
these levels with morphometric measurements of lung pathology and the surrounding immune response; 2)
determine whether Veterans who were diagnosed with DR-CB have a higher prevalence of progressive
cardiopulmonary disease than those without DR-CB; and 3) establish non-invasive, radiology-based methods
of diagnosing DR-CB and monitoring for disease progression. Together, these studies will positively impact
Veterans by advancing our understanding of factors which may promote DR-CB development, rigorously
assessing cutting-edge diagnostic modalities which may improve our ability to diagnose DR-CB non-invasively,
informing our understanding of disease progression, and creating new surrogate endpoints for future clinical
trials."
10898740,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Diabetes affects 10% of the U.S. population and is responsible for $237 billion in direct medical costs annually.
Primary care and specialist visits, medications and testing supplies, durable medical equipment, lab testing,
and potential emergency and hospital visits can be costly. Patients with diabetes report a high level of financial
burden relative to patients without diabetes, struggling to pay for necessary health care, food, housing, and
retirement. Cost-related non-adherence (delaying filling a prescription or taking less medicine) for patients with
diabetes is high, and subsequently, patients in health insurance plans with poor coverage for needed services
and resources experience adverse outcomes like hyper- or hypoglycemia, acute cerebrovascular disease, and
ischemic heart disease due to delayed or forgone care. Therefore, choosing a health insurance plan that meets
your needs is critical to improve health, especially for patients with low income socioeconomic status.
Unfortunately, many consumers struggle to choose a health plan from among the many offered, focusing on a
single factor like costs, using heuristics to make decisions, falling subject to biases that challenge rational
decision-making theory, and failing to weigh trade-offs between plan features.
We hypothesize that health economic stated preference methods like discrete choice experiments and multi-
criteria decision analyses can be used to elicit health plan preferences and values. These tools specifically ask
patients to weigh trade-offs between multiple plan features and can assess which features influence patient
decisions the most. In this observational natural experiment study, we will use stated preference surveys to
systematically assess patient preferences for health plans that adequately cover diabetes care. We will
leverage our access to health plan and claims data from Harvard Pilgrim Health Care and the Tufts Health
Plan, two New England-based insurers with a combined 2.2 million covered lives. We will analyze the
concordance between patient preferences and their real-world health plan. Finally, we will assess the
relationship between preference-aligned health plan enrollment and adverse diabetes health outcomes, cost-
related treatment non-adherence, receipt of appropriate high-quality diabetes care, health care costs and
utilization, patient financial burden, and plan satisfaction. If preference-aligned health plans are associated with
better health and health care outcomes, future work will develop a decision aid that allows patients to clarify
their values and preferences for health care and choose a plan that will enable them to use preventive care
that reduces adverse health events and lowers their financial burden. If not, future research can use study
results to design a decision aid that directs consumers to plans with features associated with improved health,
health care utilization, health care costs, and consumer satisfaction."
10841591,"Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a chronic disease that is caused by mutations in the genes TSC1 or TSC2.
The disease affects 2 million people worldwide and there is no cure for TSC disease. Symptoms include
formation of large tumors called hamartomas in various organs of the body, including the brain, the kidney, and
the lung. One of the severe complications associated with these tumors is chylothorax, which is the accumulation
of chyle in the space between the pleura and chest cavity. Chyle is a milky fluid that originates from lymphatic
vessels draining dietary fats. Chylothorax can cause difficulty breathing, tachypnea, chest pain, respiratory
failure, and death. Although chylothorax indicates malfunctioning lymphatic vessels in TSC patients, the current
dogma is that tumors compress/obstruct the lymphatic vessels near the lung resulting in leakage, and it remains
unknown whether TSC mutations in lymphatic endothelial cells are a causative factor of chylothorax. Thus, a
significant unmet need is to determine whether lymphatic vessels are involved in TSC disease and delineate the
pathological changes of the lymphatic vasculature due to TSC loss-of-function, which will identify new signaling
pathways and molecular targets for this disease. Our preliminary data show that lymphatic-specific deletion of
the Tsc genes in mice leads to chylothorax and is accompanied by a severe loss of lymphatic valves. These data
suggest that the lymphatic vasculature is involved in TSC disease and regressing lymphatic valves allow lymph
to flow backwards into the paravertebral and intercostal lymphatic capillaries, which causes lymph leakage from
the thoracic duct into the chest cavity. Aim 1 will determine pathological changes in the lymphatic vasculature
upon genetic deletion of Tsc genes, Aim 2 will identify the molecular mechanisms by which loss of Tsc1 or Tsc2
causes the loss of lymphatic valves, and Aim 3 will investigate novel approach to reverse lymphatic valve loss
in the Tsc knockouts. It is highly anticipated that these aims will identify new pathogenic features of TSC disease
and new signaling pathways affected by loss of TSC signaling."
10843325,"Abstract: Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the most common cause of intellectual disability and autism, is caused by
the loss of FMR1 gene function. Drosophila and mouse models of FXS have been developed that are based on
loss of function mutations of their respective homologues of FMR1, dfmr1 and Fmr1. These models display
several phenotypes that bear similarity to Fragile X patient symptoms. In previous studies, we and others have
identified reduced cAMP levels and increased insulin/PI3K signaling as defects in the Fragile X animal model
brains. Our work on a Drosophila FXS model demonstrated that restoration of the cAMP deficit, by treatment
with PDE4 inhibitors, restores behavior and memory. We have also shown that genetic and pharmacological
manipulations that restore normal insulin signaling levels rescue behavioral and memory deficits. Our findings
for both pathway defects have been reproduced in the mouse FXS model. Further, we discovered that metformin
treatment of the FXS Drosophila model also restores memory and behavior, a finding that too has been replicated
in the mouse FXS model. In sum our studies have determined that three seemingly distinct approaches, e.g.
increasing cAMP levels, decreasing insulin signaling and metformin treatment can restore behavioral and
cognitive phenotypes displayed by the FXS animal models. Importantly two of these findings are being pursued
clinically and have given rise to promising results. A novel PDE4 inhibitor, BPN14770, has been tested in a
phase II clinical trial with Fragile X adults. The results of this study have shown that treatment with this compound
can significantly improve cognitive and life skills in Fragile X adult aged 18 to 45. Also, several case studies of
Fragile X patients treated with metformin have reported improvements in cognitive and social domains. These
findings have led to the initiation of clinical trials with metformin. Given the clinical relevance of our findings, an
important question that we will address in this study is how these three seemingly different approaches act to
restore behavior and cognition in a FXS animal model. Our preliminary studies indicate that they converge on
improving mitochondrial function. In recent studies we have identified robust mitochondrial deficits displayed by
the Drosophila FXS model and FXS patient derived cells. We have also determined that the mitochondrial master
regulator PGC-1a is significantly decreased in the Drosophila model and in FXS patient derived cells. Importantly
we have determined that the mitochondrial defects and PGC-1a are improved by metformin treatment and the
genetic reduction of insulin signaling. We have also demonstrated that independently increasing PGC-1a
expression improves mitochondrial function and a behavioral phenotype. In our proposed studies we will perform
experiments to verify that the restoration of the signaling pathway defects, as well as metformin treatment
increase both PGC-1a expression and mitochondrial function in the Drosophila FXS model and patient derived
cells. These studies will help expand our understanding of how to treat Fragile X syndrome most effectively and
possibly other neurodevelopmental disorders due to similar pathophysiological defects."
10893572,"SUMMARY
Obesity is particularly severe in terms of escalating kidney dysfunction, disrupted body fluid homeostasis, kidney
injury. Our diet-induced obesity (DIO) mouse model (20-wk, ad lib 45% high fat diet, HFD) dampened feeding
cycles, impaired kidney mitochondrial metabolism, amplified kidney medullary oxidative stress and excretion of
reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as increased medullary interstitial fibrosis compared to mice on a normal
diet. Remarkably, restoring feeding-fasting cycles through time-restricted food intake (TRF), without altering total
caloric intake during the final 2 weeks of DIO, re-established whole body diurnal energy metabolism, normalized
excretion of oxidants and renal injury markers, as well as abolished renal interstitial fibrosis and T cell infiltration.
These remarkable findings clearly indicate that feeding-fasting cycles are critical for kidney health in obesity. The
goal of the proposed studies is to determine specifically how timing of feeding-fasting cycles impacts kidney
mitochondrial respiration, inflammation and fibrosis in obesity. Our central hypothesis states that timed feeding-
fasting ameliorates DIO-driven kidney fibrosis by reinstating kidney mitochondrial function and reducing T cell
activation and migration to the kidney. Prior studies suggest that the clock gene, Bmal1, regulates mitochondrial
function, but whether this is critical for DIO-induced metabolic dysfunction in the kidney is unknown. Our new
data reveal significant, time-of-day differences in mitochondrial respiration in renal medulla of Bmal1 knockouts
compared to wildtype littermates. In our model of DIO, we observed that circadian rhythms in whole body energy
metabolism are lost but restored by TRF. We also observed that DIO causes a phase shift in the circadian
molecular clock in the kidney. We posit that the mechanisms responsible for the TRF effects in obesity to restore
kidney mitochondrial metabolism is via re-establishing clock activity and suppressing ROS production.
Furthermore, TRF abolishes kidney interstitial fibrosis and kidney vasa recta-associated T cell infiltration in obese
mice suggesting that timed feeding-fasting promotes kidney health by reducing kidney T cell inflammation. Our
new data found that endothelium-derived ET-1 specifically mediates kidney pro-inflammatory CD4+T cell
activation. We show that gut pro-inflammatory T cell activation and cytokine production is ETA dependent and
that CD4+T cells in the gut migrate to peripheral tissues. Thus, we further propose that TRF mitigates DIO-driven
kidney medullary fibrosis by reinstating diurnal rhythms of kidney endothelium-derived ET-1 with T cell clock
activity and ETA dependent T cell activation and migration from the gut to the kidney. Studies will address two
specific aims: First, to test the hypothesis that TRF reduces kidney fibrosis in DIO through Bmal1 mediated
restoration of mitochondrial function and reduced mitochondrial-derived ROS. Second, to test the hypothesis
that TRF mitigates DIO-driven kidney fibrosis by reinstating physiological endothelium-derived ET-1 in the kidney
with T cell activation."
10735693,"Project Summary/Abstract: FRAGILE FAMILIES AND CHILD WELLBEING – YOUNG ADULTHOOD
The Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS) is a birth cohort study following a stratified,
multistage, population-representative sample of children born in large US cities between 1998 and 2000. This
proposal requests funding to survey the children in young adulthood, around their 27th birthdays.
The study began with interviews conducted with mothers and fathers at birth. Fathers were interviewed again
when young adults were 1, 3, 5, and 9. Mothers were interviewed again when children were 1, 3, 5, and 9.
Primary caregivers were interviewed when the young adults were ages 15 and 22. Young adults were
assessed/interviewed at ages 3, 5, 9, 15, and 22. Saliva samples were collected from mothers at age 9 and
from children at ages 9, 15, and 22.
The original study design called for a large oversample of births to unmarried parents, and the sample is very
diverse (the mothers are 48% Black, 27% Hispanic, and 21% white), making the data a valuable resource for
studying racial and economic disparities in health and wellbeing. The age 22 interviews occurred in the context
of the COVID-19 pandemic and included detailed questions about education, employment, income, health,
housing, and family resource-sharing during the pandemic. To date, more than 8,700 researchers have used
the data, resulting in the publication of more than 1,110 journal articles, 44 books and book chapters, 150
dissertations, and 115 working papers.
Specific aims:
 (1) Collect data on the health and wellbeing of FFCWS young adults at age 27, including data on: a)
 socioeconomic status (education, employment, and income), b) family formation (intimate relationships,
 childbearing), c) health (self-reported physical and mental health), d) program participation (including
 health insurance, social services, cash and near-cash assistance, housing assistance) and e) systems
 involvement (experiences with the police and criminal justice system).
 (2) Collect innovative data on the social, economic, and physical environments of FFCWS young adults at
 age 27, including: a) family relationships and intergenerational support/obligations, and b) local area
 contexts such as policy regimes, neighborhood environments, and labor market conditions.
 (3) Obtain permission to access FFCWS young adults’ education, employment, health, and other
 administrative records (if not obtained at age 22).
To accomplish these aims, we will contact approximately 3,600 young adults through a web-based survey
around their 27th birthdays. Young adults who do not initially complete the web-based survey will receive phone
or in-person follow-up and the interview will be administered by a trained interviewer."
10884281,"ABSTRACT
Although immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has been a tremendous clinical success, just ~20% of non-
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients respond to anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy. The two major factors predictive of
favorable treatment response to ICI therapy are the presence of the IFNG signature and evidence of CD8+ T cell
infiltration into malignant tumor. Work from our group has shown that neutrophil infiltrated non-small cell lung
cancers do not display the IFNG signature, do not display CD8+ infiltration into malignant tumor, and do not
respond to ICI treatment. Our hypothesis to explain these observations is that tumor-associated neutrophils
release proteinases that degrade key cytokines (IFNG), chemokines (CXCL-9, -10, -11) and a chemokine
receptor (CXCR3) that destroys the IFNG mediated chemotactic gradient that facilitates T cell infiltration into
tumors. The proposed studies will demonstrate that a number of key neutrophil-derived proteinases are capable
of degrading T cell recruiting chemokines and CXCR3 and identify the novel cleavage products resulting from
these events. The functional consequences of these proteolytic events will be demonstrated in novel multicellular
tumor-in-chip systems and in state-of-the art mouse models of lung cancer. Lastly, we will employ a combined
fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) and multiplexed immunohistochemistry (M-IHC) panel to study the
relationship between CXCL9 expressing tumor cells, infiltrating CD8+CXCR3+ T cells, and TAN and determine
the impact that these measures have on ICI treatment outcomes in NSCLC patients."
10919876,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Physical activity is thought to be critically important in aging adults with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),
who have significantly higher rates of cardiovascular disease and multimorbidity than their peers without SLE.
Digital programming represents a viable option for physical activity promotion in older adults, including those
with SLE. Given the unique characteristics of older adults with SLE, SLE-specific adaptation is critical to
meeting the needs of the target population. The objective of this proposal is to determine physical activity
levels, impediments to and facilitators of physical activity, and readiness to participate in a digitally-delivered
physical activity program in a sample of aging adults with SLE (≥50 years of age). The central tenet of this
proposal is that deficits in physical activity behaviors and modifiable risk factors for a sedentary lifestyle can be
mitigated through the use of the digital physical activity program that addresses the unique challenges faced by
aging adults with SLE when attempting to engage in physical activity. Design of an efficacious program will first
require an understanding of the deficits in PA behaviors and modifiable risk factors for a sedentary lifestyle that
are present in the target population. Preliminary data gathered through the current proposal will inform
adaptation and pilot testing of an established 12-week digitally-delivered physical activity program with social
support features. The aims of this proposal are as follows:
Aim 1: To elicit perspectives of adults ≥50 years of age with SLE on engagement in physical activity, barriers
to and facilitators of physical activity, and use of a digital physical activity program. Semi-structured interviews
will address factors that influence physical activity behavior, as well as perceived usefulness and ease of use
of and likeliness to engage in a digital physical activity program.
Aim 2: To quantify physical activity levels, barriers to and facilitators of physical activity, and readiness for a
digital physical activity program in a national cross-sectional sample of aging adults (i.e., ≥50 years) with SLE.
Informed by the results of Aim 1, I will develop a questionnaire addressing barriers to and facilitators of
physical activity and factors impacting use of a digital physical activity program to evaluate prevalence of these
factors in a larger sample and guide future intervention adaptation. Using validated surveys, I will collect
additional data on physical activity levels, impediments to physical activity, and readiness for a digital health
intervention.
At the conclusion of the study, I will have the necessary preliminary data to adapt and pilot test a digital
physical activity program in older adults with SLE that is tailored to their needs and preferences, thus
empowering aging adults with SLE to increase their physical activity levels. Through this work, I will build a
track record of experience in multidisciplinary aging research that will allow me to improve the health and
wellbeing of this vulnerable population."
10907776,"Summary:
Chagas disease, an infectious disease caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, affects 6 to 7
million people in the Americas, and its treatment has been limited to drugs with relatively high toxicity and low
efficacy in the chronic phase of the infection. New validated targets are urgently needed to combat this disease.
Phosphorylation-mediated signal transduction in eukaryotes plays key roles as regulator of protein function.
Considering the changes in phosphorylation patterns reported in T. cruzi developmental stages, it is likely that
protein kinases play a pivotal role in the regulation of cell cycle, metabolism, survival, and particularly in parasite
differentiation. Therefore, protein kinases, which represent near 2% of the T. cruzi genome, conform an attractive
group of molecular targets for antiparasitic interventions. In addition, the subcellular localization of protein
kinases is determinant for their activity and function. Therefore, elucidating their localization is crucial to predict
their participation in specific cellular processes. Programmable CRISPR/Cas9 systems have improved our ability
to produce precise genome manipulations in T. cruzi. However, current methodologies have limitations to further
perform the simultaneous analysis of multiple knockout mutants in T. cruzi, which also restricts the identification
of molecular targets for drug discovery. Here we will apply a protein kinase screening by gene knockout and
gene tagging in T. cruzi epimastigotes, to identify protein kinases involved in life cycle progression. We will
investigate 124 protein kinases of T. cruzi, most of them with no apparent orthologs in mammals. We will analyze
the phenotype of pooled knockout mutants harboring unique DNA barcodes that will be generated by
CRISPR/Cas9-based methodology. Furthermore, we will use next-generation sequencing to identify protein
kinases required for epimastigote survival, growth and differentiation into metacyclic trypomastigotes, and for T.
cruzi infection and proliferation in tissue-cultured host cells. Overall, we will perform a large-scale screening to
assess parasite fitness. We will also perform endogenous tagging of selected genes encoding protein kinases
to determine their subcellular localization. Elucidating the role of protein kinases in T. cruzi will allow to gain
insight organelle-associated signaling pathways required for parasite survival, proliferation and differentiation."
10724254,"The skeleton is one of the most important structures in our bodies. Bones allow us to stand,
walk and move from one place to another, and they serve as protectors of our vital organs.
Degradation of our bones structure — osteoporosis — is a global health problem. The long-term
goal of my research is to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms governing skeletal
development, homeostasis and repair. Currently, we are studying the coupling of bone cell
metabolic activity the role of sensory nerves in bone development and function.
 Studies supported by my Merit Review Award identified a novel pathway that links the
metabolic activity of skeletal osteoblasts to global fuel metabolism and energy expenditure. Insulin
receptor signaling in the osteoblast regulates the production and bioavailability of osteocalcin, which
in turn, acts in an endocrine fashion to regulate pancreatic insulin secretion and peripheral insulin
responsiveness. The existence of this bone-panaceas endocrine loop suggests that bone
consumes a significant proportion of the body’s overall fuel supply, and consequently is in
competition with other energy consuming tissues. Currently, we are studying mouse models with
genetic alterations that selectively attenuate either glucose or fatty acid metabolism. These models
will be used to determine the fuel requirements of bone accrual and determine the impact of energy
substrate oxidation and metabolism by osteoblasts on global energy flux during post-natal bone
development and in response to discrete anabolic episodes. The importance of these metabolic
pathways humans is profoundly illustrated by metabolic diseases such as diabetes and
osteoporosis caused by genetic or environmental disturbances in endocrine control mechanisms.
 In another project sponsored by NIH we are investigating the role of sensory nerves on bone
development and repair. Developing tissues dictate the amount and type of innervation they require
by secreting neurotrophins, which promote neuronal survival by activating distinct tyrosine kinase
receptors. We show that nerve growth factor (NGF) signaling through neurotrophic tyrosine kinase
receptor type 1 (TrkA) directs innervation of the developing mouse femur to promote vascularization
and osteoprogenitor lineage progression. At the start of primary ossification, TrkA-positive axons
penetrate perichondrial bone surfaces, coincident with NGF expression in cells adjacent to centers
of incipient ossification. Inactivation of TrkA signaling during embryogenesis in TrkA(F592A) mice
impaired innervation, delayed vascular invasion of the primary and secondary ossification centers,
decreased numbers of Osx-expressing osteoprogenitors, and decreased femoral length and volume.
These same phenotypic abnormalities were observed in mice following tamoxifen-induced disruption
of NGF in Col2-expressing perichondrial osteochondral progenitors. These findings indicate that
NGF serves as a skeletal neurotrophin to promote sensory innervation of developing long bones, a
process critical for normal primary and secondary ossification. Similarly, NGF-TrkA signaling played
an important role during fracture repair in mice engineered with conditional TrkA alleles. NGF-
enriched populations accumulated within the soft callus with progressive accumulation of
CGRP+TrkA+ sensory nerve fibers within the reactive periosteum, at time points preceding periosteal
vascularization, ossification, and mineralization. Temporal inhibition of TrkA catalytic activity by
administration of 1NMPP1 to TrkAF592A mice over time of fracture significantly reduced the numbers of
sensory fibers, blunted revascularization, and delayed consolidation of the callus. Delayed response
to fracture was also observed in mice following treatment with cisplatinum to induce neuropathy."

My career focuses on research, clinical, and translational efforts to improve lifestyle treatment for obesity.
Obesity is a major contributor to cardiovascular
disease
(CVD),
accelerated by the current epidemic of highly
palatable energy dense food, reduced physical activity, and insufficient sleep. While weight loss can reduce
CVDrisk, sustaining weight loss is a major challenge for most individuals with obesity. It is imperative to identify
innovative and evidence-based strategies to promote greater and more durable weight loss. My collaborative
research program focuses on understanding predictors of successful weight loss maintenance and translating
those findings into strategies to improve lifestyle weight management programs. Specifically, I develop and
evaluate novel weight loss interventions, focusing on alterations of the timing or pattern of energy intake and
physical activity (PA). My studies involve rigorous, objective measures of free-living energy expenditure and
energy intake, and multi-disciplinary collaborations to comprehensively assess potential biologic, behavioral,
psychosocial, and environmental predictors of treatment response. Collectively, these studies provide a
framework and wealth of data for trainees to perform hypothesis-driven patient-oriented research (POR). I am
deeply committed to mentoring the next generation of innovative, collaborative clinical researchers to reduce
obesity and cardiometabolic disease risk. I have 8 years of mentoring experience supporting new and early-
stage clinical investigators in POR (undergraduate, graduate, and medical students; MD and PhD post-doctoral
research fellows; and junior faculty). My mentees have an excellent record of publication productivity, NIH grant
funding, successful career transitions, and retention in academic medicine. The K24 Mid-Career Investigator
Award will provide dedicated time for me to deliver focused mentorship to junior clinical investigators of
exceptional potential and capitalize on the outstanding mentoring, research, and training resources of our
campus. I will pursue leadership and administrative training, as well as develop multidisciplinary collaborations
to enhance my knowledge and skills in sleep/circadian physiology and qualitative methodology to extend the
breadth and reach of my obesity treatment POR program. I have assembled an experienced team of senior
clinical researchers with extensive mentorship experience and leadership roles in clinical and research training
programs on campus to serve as a K24 Advisory Committee to guide me during the K24 award period. My
specific aims are to 1) Mentor junior clinical investigators to create a pipeline of well-trained patient-oriented
researchers focused on obesity, nutrition, PA, and sleep, and 2) Build and enhance my collaborative research
program designed to rigorously evaluate strategies involving alterations of the timing or pattern of behaviors
(diet, PA, and sleep) to develop more effective lifestyle interventions to treat obesity, reduce cardiometabolic
disease, and improve health. As a dedicated physician-scientist, I am well-positioned to enhance the quality and
breadth of POR in weight management and CVD risk reduction and become a national leader in this field."
10897070,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hospitals are increasingly consolidating into health systems with shared ownership and management. Care in a
health system has potential benefits for surgical cancer patients including improved access, care coordination,
and strategies to disseminate and implement a rapidly evolving evidence-base into practice across system hub
and spoke sites. Prior research has demonstrated that these potential benefits remain elusive. The impact of
consolidation on quality varies widely, and there are disparate outcomes for surgical cancer patients treated at
different facilities in the same systems. We have shown that location of surgical cancer care determines whether
effective treatments are adopted (implementation) or ineffective treatments discontinued (de-
implementation). We hypothesize that health system characteristics and strategies are associated with variability
in implementation of oncologic evidence among hub and spoke hospitals and that through exploration of
observed differences we will identify levers for targeted, multi-level interventions.
This work addresses the NIH Blueprint objective to enhance research investments by ensuring adoption into
practice and targets rural individuals, a population with disparate healthcare access and outcomes, who are
often treated at spoke hospitals. We will examine the influence of treatment for common cancers in health system
hubs and spokes on patient access and receipt of evidence-based care by linking SEER-Medicare data with
health system data. Then, we will identify health system characteristics associated with evidence
implementation, both quantitatively using multilevel modeling and qualitatively through structured interviews with
health system stakeholders. Finally, we will use the resources within our Health System at the University of
Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) to develop a system-level intervention for dissemination and implementation of
oncologic evidence across hub and spoke sites.
My long-term goal is to become an independent investigator who improves the quality of cancer care delivery by
designing, implementing and studying health system-level interventions to increase clinical adoption of oncologic
evidence. Through this training award, I will complement my health services and quality improvement science
expertise with advanced training in the organization of healthcare delivery, multilevel analysis of secondary data,
and implementation science to develop a system-level intervention to improve evidence-based surgical cancer
care."
10873246,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Policies to facilitate participation in school nutrition programs could reduce diagnosis rate disparities in
behavioral disorders, namely attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder
(ODD), and conduct disorder (CD). Food insecurity predisposes children to these conditions and aggravates
their symptoms. It impairs child development, contributes to inattention, and is associated with externalizing
behaviors. Preliminary data show that two school meal delivery options could make a difference. One is the
Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), which enables schools to provide free meals to all enrolled children,
regardless of household socio-economic status. The other is making school breakfast available after classes
begin (breakfast after the bell). There is growing evidence that these meal-delivery options reduce disciplinary
incidents at school, but no studies have incorporated information on diagnosis or utilization of services for
behavioral disorders. Our central hypothesis is that better access to school meals reduces the burden of
behavioral disorders among children in underserved communities who face an elevated prevalence of food
insecurity. There is evidence that exclusionary discipline (i.e., suspension or expulsion) contributes to an
escalation of behavioral issues, which may predispose the child to an ODD or CD diagnoses and/or
interactions with the juvenile justice system. Universal free meals and breakfast after the bell increase
participation in school meals and are feasible meal delivery options for many schools but remain underutilized.
Using a novel longitudinal all-payer claims database linked to educational achievement and disciplinary
outcomes, three specific aims are proposed:
1. Describe variation in medical diagnoses for ADHD, ODD, and CD across schools by race, ethnicity,
 gender, age, rurality, and neighborhood characteristics.
2. Quantify the effect of school meal delivery policies and medical diagnoses on disciplinary outcomes and
 academic achievement by race/ethnicity, rurality, and socioeconomic status.
3. Determine the effect of universal meals and breakfast after the bell, alone and in combination, on the
 likelihood of diagnosed childhood behavioral disorders and subsequent service utilization overall and by
 race, ethnicity, and rurality.
The study will draw from the population of Arkansas public schoolchildren. Arkansas ranks second in the
nation for the percentage of children diagnosed with ADHD, third in the percentage of children taking ADHD
medications, and second in the incidence of childhood food insecurity. Understanding whether policies to make
meals more accessible prevent the medical diagnosis of behavioral disorders that can escalate into disciplinary
events at school will have significant implications for improving health-related quality of life, human capital
development, and fewer encounters with the juvenile and adult criminal justice systems."
10728678,"Loss of communication is one of the most devastating consequences of severe paralysis from a range of disorders, including ALS, stroke, and muscular dystrophy. Recent and ongoing studies have demonstrated the ability to decode words and sentences directly from the neural activity of a paralyzed individual who cannot speak. This success highlights the feasibility of synthesized speech decoded from neural signals using electrocorticography and lays critical groundwork for the development of a fully implantable speech prosthesis. A total implantable device will eliminate physical tethering, reduce infection risk, enable mobile, on-the-go use, expand communication training and capability, and improve patient autonomy and quality of life. Accordingly, we propose to finalize the development of a fully implantable speech prosthesis device system designed to restore real-time communication for patients suffering from severe dysarthria or anarthria. The system features a wireless brain interface device for ECoG recording, digitalization and data streaming and an external portable computer receiving data and hosting real-time speech decoding algorithms. Here, we will complete development and testing of the 3D electronic packaging, the electrode array, and peripherals to enable full integration of the device; undertake device manufacturing and perform functional and safety testing; obtain an FDA IDE; and perform intra-operative clinical studies to optimize the electrode interface and verify critical aspects of device performance. These studies will provide critical groundwork for future chronic implantation trials and subsequent commercialization."
10868551,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A more complete characterization of auditory cortical processing in humans is critical to understanding auditory
perception and cognition. Without it, developing effective treatment options for various auditory processing
deficits, such as those rooted in central auditory processing, may not be possible. Currently, there is a lack of
consensus regarding how to define and parcellate even the earliest regions of auditory cortex, including primary
auditory region A1, highlighting the significant gaps in our overall understanding of sound processing. Traditional
approaches to defining primary auditory regions in humans include identifying the macroanatomical landmarks
known as the Heshl’s gyri (HG) in each hemisphere and using their locations as a rough approximation of A1.
While macroscopic anatomical information, such as the sulcal and gyral patterning in auditory cortex, can provide
a rough estimate of where primary auditory regions are located, it is not sufficiently accurate. This is likely due
to the high degree of variability in the size, shape, location, and number of HGs found in the auditory cortices of
humans. Conversely, attempts to use functional properties—in particular, frequency mapping (tonotopy)—have
also been met with limited success, as tonotopic gradients cannot be used to uniquely position the areal
boundaries of A1. Aim 1 of the proposed research will exploit recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) to non-invasively acquire unprecedentedly high-resolution in vivo human anatomical data at the
mesoscopic scale (~0.35mm3), revealing biological information that was not previously available via
neuroimaging. Access to this information will allow us to generate detailed, data-driven parcellations of auditory
cortices that more closely match the underlying cytoarchitecture. Aim 2 will complement the anatomical
approaches in Aim 1 by defining A1 in the same set of individuals, using several high-field cortical and sub-
cortical measures of functional activation derived using both task-based and functional connectivity paradigms.
The task-based functional data will be used to construct tuning maps for several key perceptually-relevant
acoustic features, the parcellation of which will be constrained by the patterns of resting state connectivity
between sub-cortical and cortical regions. Work from both aims, which includes mesoscopic MRI, subcortical
neuroimaging, computational modeling, and resting state connectivity, will be combined to provide the auditory
neuroimaging community with a state-of-the-art multimodal structure-function characterization of primary
auditory cortex in humans. To aid in the standardization of auditory cortex characterizations in future studies,
this information will be made publicly available, along with an atlas. The long-term goal is a complete
characterization and parcellation of auditory cortex in humans. The resulting parcellations in normal-hearing
populations will serve as a baseline for characterizing and subsequently developing effective treatments for
auditory processing deficits in hearing-impaired populations."

High-throughput functional genomics of variants in genes linked to substance use disorders
Understanding of the genetic basis of substance use disorders has advanced significantly in the recent past; the
generation of a reference human sequence in the early 2000’s enabled Genome Wide Association Studies
(GWAS), which in turn led to the identification of thousands of genetic variants that are statistically significantly
associated with substance use and substance use disorders. The number of these clinically relevant variants
continues to grow proportionally with the increase in sample sizes for GWAS and genome sequencing studies
of substance use disorders. Model organism studies have also led to the identification of genes and pathways
that are linked to these phenotypes. However, one persistent bottleneck in this field has been the lack of
experimental testing of nearly all (>99%) of these variants in genes and regulatory regions to determine
which are functionally significant. Determining the functional effects of genetic variants is crucial to acquiring
a molecular understanding of the basis of substance use disorders, and this deeper understanding will enable
future development and testing of targeted and rationally designed therapeutic interventions. This forward-
thinking application proposes to address this gap by applying highly innovative high-throughput
functional genomics approaches, including Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs) and Deep
Mutational Scan (DMS) techniques, that were recently deployed for the study of rare Mendelian
disorders, to the study thousands of both noncoding and coding variants associated with substance
use disorders. These approaches have not previously been applied to the genetics of substance use disorders,
although they have enabled significant advancements in other fields, such as the genetics of
neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Furthermore, this early-stage investigator’s
multidisciplinary training, including MD/PhD degrees, Pediatrics residency, a postdoctoral fellowship, and four
years of dedicated K08 Early Career Development work that was focused on acquiring expertise in the use of
functional genomics techniques, has established him as a rising leader in the field of human genetics. His prior
paradigm-altering and team-based accomplishments include establishment of an exome sequencing testing
pipeline for children with autism in 2015, ongoing coordination of the Model Organism Screening Center for the
NIH-funded Undiagnosed Diseases Network, and leadership of a $1.5 million institutionally-funded, multi-
investigator functional genomics project that resulted in deployment of critical infrastructure and delivered a 10:1
return on investment in subsequent grant funding. Although this talented investigator has not previously focused
on substance use disorders, he has established a collaboration with a world expert in this field, Dr. Laura Bierut,
who has agreed to advise him in this research program and connect him with other relevant investigators in the
field. In sum, this very high impact and extremely innovative proposal from a particularly well qualified early-
stage investigator will significantly advance the understanding of the genetics of substance use disorders."

Early recognition of cognitive impairment and timeliness in Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias
(ADRD) diagnoses are key to optimal dementia care. Data show that early ADRD recognition is linked to less
exposure to potentially inappropriate medications (PIM), less propensity for acute care use, lower rates of falls,
and increased adoption of advance care planning. One potential way to improve early recognition of ADRD is
Annual Wellness Visits (AWVs)—a free preventive service that covers cognition and fall risk assessment,
medication reconciliation, and personalized prevention plans. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
(CMS) began reimbursing AWVs in 2011. The Alzheimer’s Association (AA) has drawn attention to the higher
prevalence and risk of ADRD among women than men and black and Hispanic Americans than whites. Receipt
of AWVs might decrease health disparities; however, evidence to date is inconsistent.
This 5-year R01 project has a focus on community-dwelling ADRD patients and is based on the Institute for
Healthcare Improvement’s 4Ms framework of an age-friendly health system, 4Ms: what matters, mentation,
mobility, and medication. We will conduct a convergent parallel mixed-methods design research study to
assess the effect of AWV policy on early ADRD diagnosis and reducing health disparities. We will analyze
national Medicare data, health retirement survey-Medicare linkage data, and National Health & Aging Trends
study-Medicare linkage data to understand the effect of AWV implementation on reducing health disparities
across sex, racial/ethnic, socioeconomic status, and rural/urban residence. Also, we will collect primary data
(phone interviews) from 180 family caregivers of ADRD patients (~30 in each of the 6 groups: Hispanic men,
Hispanic women, black men, black women, white men, and white women) and 400 clinicians (~100 in each of
4 Medicare regions, ~25 in each of 4 credential areas: family medicine, internal medicine primary care,
geriatricians, nurse practitioners) to understand how AWV is delivered to ADRD patients in order to identify the
potential mechanism for reducing health disparity through AWV. For family caregivers, we will use a snowball
sampling method with AA’s and Rotary International networks, and AA’s TrialMatch® platform to reach
potential subjects nationwide. For clinicians, we will randomly select clinicians nationwide from the 2019 CMS
doctors and clinicians national file. We will partner with AA to ensure sound data collection and development of
practical implications to inform policy/practice. Our three specific aims are:
 Aim 1: Assess the effects of AWV on the timeliness of ADRD diagnosis (mentation);
 Aim 2: Assess the effects of AWV on advance care planning consultation (what matters), depression
 (mentation), fall and fracture (mobility), and PIM use and ADRD treatment (medication) for ADRD
 patients across sex, racial/ethnic, socioeconomic status, and rural/urban residence; and
 Aim 3: Identify what works and what does not work in AWV delivery for ADRD patients."

Opioid use disorder (OUD) has reached epidemic levels in the Unites States, associated with increased rates of
hospitalization and drug overdose death, the latter showing a significant steep rise of up to 29.4% in 2020.
While genetic risk factors have been identified in recent large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
of OUD, these explain only part of the variance and often map to noncoding regions. Epigenetic modifications
have been implicated in the etiology of opioid use disorders (OUD) underlying the gene and environment
interplay. We and others have found that alterations of DNA methylation (5mC), one of the most studied
epigenetic mechanisms, is associated with OUD in both human peripheral and postmortem brain. However,
most of this work has been done in bulk tissues, which obscures the functional role of the cellular diversity in
human cells. Further, research is needed to assess additional and novel epigenetic regulatory layers to gain a
better understanding of its contribution to gene regulation and its ability to interpret the functionality of GWAS
genetic variants in the context of OUD. Here, I offer a novel framework to tackle these gaps and challenges: 1)
conduct a simultaneous profiling of DNA methylation, DNA hydroxymethylation, and 3D genome structure in
single human nuclei, 2) identify OUD-dependent regulatory signatures within cell types and brain regions, 3)
evaluate the crosstalk between the different epigenomic regulatory layers, and 4) construct gene programs to
finely map OUD GWAS variants and polygenic signals to function. This comprehensive single-cell multiomics
mapping of OUD will examine the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), amygdala (BLA), and nucleus
accumbens (NAcc), part of the addiction circuitry, of human postmortem brain samples collected from the
UTHealth Brain Collection datasets and using the VA Brain Bank (NPBB) as a validation cohort. This work is
highly innovative and will open new lines of research the genetics and epigenetics of OUD by providing novel
mechanistic insights on its gene regulatory structure in the human brain. This proposed study will identify and
help inform molecular targets to be used as prevention and treatment efforts for individuals suffering from
OUD."
10883702,"Project Summary/Abstract
Survival outcomes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients are negatively affected by high inflammation in the
bone marrow compared to low inflammation patients within the same molecular subgroup. The overarching goal
of our study is to delineate functionally relevant contributors to aberrant inflammation, characterize changes to
the inflammatory state longitudinally during different standard-of-care treatment approaches and determine
whether targeting inflammation via inhibitors that target the crucial mediators of inflammation can improve
treatment response and survival. The proposal was prompted by our recent characterization of inflammation-
mediated progression to AML in animal models and the notable cooperation with select mutational backgrounds
to promote leukemogenesis; and our notion of distinct cellular remodeling of both leukemic cells and the
microenvironment to promote inflammation. We believe that the observed strong negative treatment response
and survival association that was independent from other genetic contributors provides an exciting rationale to
target aberrant inflammation in AML patients in order to improve treatment response and disease progression.
This goal will be achieved by two independent, but complementary Specific Aims. (1) Utilizing our large cohort
of 1,600 AML patients who were molecularly and clinically characterized and have a defined inflammatory state,
we will characterize those patients with the highest and the lowest inflammation and compare cell state, cell fate
and immune response at the single cell level via a comprehensive multi-omic approach. (2) We will track
dynamics of inflammatory, immune-regulatory and associated clonal structures during different treatments via
the same multi-omic profiling with an integrated approach that first profiles longitudinally collected patient
samples with select genotypes during different treatments, followed by patient derived xengraft models of the
same patients that will undergo 2 different therapeutic approaches followed by serial profiling, thereby allowing
for direct comparison and definitive characterization of the observed changes. Lastly, we will test the
effectiveness of anti-inflammatory agents (IL-1 inhibitors) to lower inflammation and prevent the inflammation-
associated bone marrow remodeling and inferior treatment response. Together, our results will, for the first time,
provide critically needed information to provide a basis for targeting aberrant inflammation in AML patients."
10887649,"Treatment of post-stroke apraxia of speech (AOS) requires frequent and ongoing practice with a speech-
language pathologist to facilitate lasting behavioral change, which is costly and, therefore, inaccessible to many
patients. Thus, there is a critical need to identify novel, cost-effective ways to supplement speech therapy to
increase opportunities for practice and optimize treatment outcomes. Our long-term goal is to develop an
effective, home-practice, computer-based, motor imagery protocol [Motor Imagery for Treatment Enhancement
and Efficacy (MI-TEE)] which will serve as an adjunct to routine speech therapy to optimize treatment response
in persons with AOS. The overall objectives of this application are to (i) evaluate the acceptability and feasibility
of MI-TEE as a home practice program and (ii) determine the efficacy of MI-TEE with speech therapy, compared
to speech therapy alone, in improving speech production in people with AOS. Our central hypothesis is that MI-
TEE will be an accessible, feasible, and efficacious adjunct to speech therapy. To attain our objectives, the
following specific aims will be pursued using two single-subject experimental designs with multiple baselines
across participants (n=18): 1) Evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of MI-TEE as an adjunct to speech therapy
for the rehabilitation of AOS; and 2) Compare the efficacy of adjunctive MI-TEE plus standard speech therapy to
standard speech therapy alone. Under the first aim, observational data, surveys, and semi-structured interviews
will be employed to assess the acceptability (perceived satisfaction, appropriateness, and intent to continue use)
and feasibility (recruitment, retention, and intervention adherence rates) of MI-TEE. For the second aim,
accuracy of articulation for trained words and untrained words (generalization) will be measured pre-treatment,
repeatedly during the treatment phase, and post-treatment. Improvements in speech accuracy will be
documented using a binary scoring system (correct/incorrect). Multilevel analyses will be used to address rate
of acquisition, overall change, and response variation across participants. The proposed research is innovative
because it focuses on establishing a tool for increasing independent practice of target stimuli for people with
AOS in an accessible and inexpensive manner. Until now, outcomes for evidence-based treatments for AOS
have been examined in controlled laboratory or clinical settings. Now that strong evidence exists to support the
benefit of these treatments, it is imperative to optimize outcomes and provide more economical and accessible
practice opportunities. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to serve as the foundation for
a larger clinical trial (R01) implementing MI-TEE to advance treatment response in people with AOS. Specifically,
this line of research will yield an accessible and efficacious tool that will provide additional opportunities for
practice to enhance treatment response and reduce costs associated with frequent in-person speech therapy.
The anticipated outcomes from this line of research address NIDCD’s Priority Areas: (Area 3) to improve
treatment of disorders of human communication and (Area 4) to improve outcomes for human communication."

Project description: Aggression is a competitive social behavior that animals use to acquire resources and
protect kin. While genetic variation is known to contribute to individual differences in aggression, we know very
little about the specific genes involved and their mechanisms. To discover genes that regulate aggression, the
applicant will exploit the unique features of the Siamese fighting fish Betta splendens (betta). Highly aggressive
fighting betta have been generated through a long history of artificial breeding. Their aggressive behaviors are
easily triggered by visual stimuli, and their intense fighting continues until retreat or death. The applicant
proposes to use these fighting fish, along with their unselected, less aggressive wild counterparts, to expand
our knowledge of genetic and neuronal bases underlying aggression. In Aim 1 (K99), the applicant will
characterize the behavioral differences between wild and fighting betta during fights by developing a novel
behavioral test and utilizing machine-learning based tools for behavioral analyses. In Aim 2 (K99), the
applicant will discover aggression-associated variants that contribute to the behavioral differences with
complementary mapping methods and genetic tools for functional perturbation. Finally, in Aim 3 (R00), the
applicant will probe how the mapped genes influence the nervous system and mediate aggression using
neuronal imaging and circuit tracing tools.
Candidate and career goals: The applicant’s broad research interests involve understanding how genetic
variation shapes the nervous system to modulate behaviors. The proposed research activities will build upon
the applicant’s strong background in genetics and genomics skillsets with imaging and circuit tracing
techniques, enabling the interdisciplinary approach necessary to tackle the applicant’s highly innovative
research questions. The proposed project will also lay the foundation for the applicant’s long-term goal as an
independent researcher who brings computational, genetic, and neurobiological fields together to create bold
new approaches for understanding social behavior.
Career development plan: The K99 phase of this work will be done in Columbia’s Zuckerman Mind Brain
Behavior Institute (ZMBBI) under the mentorship of Drs. Andrés Bendesky and Franck Polleux. In addition, the
candidate has assembled an extraordinary team of advisors and collaborators, consisting of Drs. Molly
Przeworski, Carolyn (Lindy) McBride, Vanessa Ruta, and David Manuel Flores Gonçalves. The applicant’s
research and transition to independence will benefit from this strong mentorship team, the state-of-the-art
facilities and infrastructure at ZMBBI, and numerous Professional Development resources offered through
ZMBBI and Columbia."

HIV program. A custom project will be created and maintained on the UCSF Data Library platform to store,
secure, curate, and make accessible all raw and processed biological data and de-identified clinical data
associated with the research program. We will interface with each project team for data ingestion and provide
statistical and bioinformatic support to each. We will additionally perform multi-modal integrative analyses,
including cross-species analysis, to answer questions within and across each project toward better
understanding how vaccine regimens and metabolic conditions influence T-cell responses to and virologic

We will accomplish these goals with the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Develop and maintain a centralized system of data management and sharing using the UCSF
Data Library.
 - We will leverage the UCSF Data Library (UCDL) to facilitate the ingestion, curation, and secure storage
 of the diverse high-dimensional data types and metadata or de-identified clinical data generated across
 the projects.
 - We will apply shared data schemas per modality that store raw and processed data and annotations.
 - The UCDL supports web-based data sharing across all members of project and core teams as well as
 serves as a staging area for the transfer of all raw and processed data and metadata to ImmPort and
 other public databases.
Aim 2: Provide statistical analysis and bioinformatic support for testing project hypotheses relevant to
vaccine regimens, T-cell features, metabolomics, and rebound kinetics.
 - We will apply standardized and custom approaches to harmonize datasets for use by all teams.
 - We will work collaboratively with each project and core team to perform described analyses including
 dimensionality reduction, differential analysis, and association with outcomes.
Aim 3: Integrate multi-modal data to develop a model of joint immune and metabolomic influence over
vaccine responses and control over viremia in ATI.
 - We will leverage the complementary nature of these projects and state-of-the-art integrative analysis
 techniques, including cross-species analysis, to construct models relating multi-modal factors to
 longitudinal immune and virologic outcomes.
 - We will address the Bridging Hypotheses described in the Overall component."
10845632,"ABSTRACT
In order to effectively control HIV after ART is stopped, HIV-specific T cell responses to
therapeutic vaccination must not only be increased in magnitude, but they also must be long-
lived, have the capacity to home to sites of reservoir persistence, have the T cell memory-like
capacity to robustly proliferate and execute effector functions in response to antigen (i.e., they
need to overcome the residual T cell exhaustion that persists in pre-existing HIV-specific T cells
despite viral load suppression with ART), and be refocused to have dominant responses that
target vulnerable epitopes. Due to the limitations of standard T cell assays, and despite
emerging data from clinical trials showing at least partial control of HIV post-vaccination, little is
known about the mechanisms by which HIV therapeutic vaccine regimens transform ineffective
pre-existing HIV-specific T cell immunity into an effective antiviral response. In this Project, we
will leverage our experience performing integrated multi-modal systems immunology analysis
with paired single cell transcriptome and TCR sequencing (scRNA/TCRseq) data and high-
dimensional flow cytometry data. We will perform clonal-level analysis on HIV/SIV therapeutic
vaccine-elicited CD8+ T cells from highly unique and clinically relevant human and macaque
HIV/SIV cohorts in which therapeutic vaccines have exerted a measurable effect on altering
viral load kinetics after treatment interruption to ask: to what extent are current top-candidate
therapeutic vaccine regimens capable of recruiting new and/or pre-existing T cell clones with
optimal memory-like properties (function and differentiation state; Aims 1 and 2), and to what
extent do memory-like features (or other features) of the vaccine-elicited T cell response
correlate with post-treatment control of HIV (Aim 3)? These studies will allow us to characterize
in unprecedented depth the impact of different therapeutic vaccine regimens on critical – and
previously unmeasurable – facets of the quality of the virus-specific T cell response. Our results
will lay the groundwork for us to develop reliable measurements of virus-specific T cell clonal
structure and differentiation state that will inform iterative studies in humans and macaques."
10845634,"Project 2 will determine the extent to which metabolic conditions and immunometabolic programming
impact the ability to recruit new T-cell clonotypes with memory-like features. HIV-infected individuals
harbor pre-existing HIV-specific T cells that were insufficiently potent to control initial infection and that will
likely remain ineffective even after expansion in number following therapeutic vaccination. We propose that
metabolic control over the response to vaccination can positively bias the response by limiting expansion of
exhausted T cells and allowing expansion of long-lived memory cells that can control viral replication after
treatment interruption. If so, then control over host and specifically T-cell metabolism may be required to
design impactful therapeutic T-cell vaccines that transform the host immune response to HIV.
We believe that fully understanding T-cell responses in human populations will require better understanding of
how host metabolism controls T-cell differentiation. Furthermore, manipulation of metabolic pathways,
especially amino-acid sensing pathways, may offer a mechanism for greater control over the quality of the T-
cell response elicited by therapeutic vaccination.
This project will use metabolic profiling via plasma metabolomics, RNAseq, and SCENITH to (i) understand the
extent to which metabolic profiles are associated with success in completed therapeutic-vaccine trials, and (ii)
test if metabolic regulation can alter the trajectory of T-cell development in response to therapeutic vaccines.
We hypothesize that successful vaccines leverage immunometabolic programming to restrain pre-existing
memory CD8+ T cells from expanding and promote outgrowth of broadly reactive new CD4+ and CD8+
clonotypes with stem-like qualities.
Aim 1: Using samples from therapeutically vaccinated humans and non-human primates, identify
metabolomic features that predict T-cell differentiation patterns, breadth, and/or control over viremia in
ATI. In this aim, we test if rich metabolomic data (plasma analytes, bulk RNAseq, and SCENITH) from
macaques and humans can predict both the quality of T-cell responses generated by therapeutic vaccination
and the virus control achieved after ATI.
Aim 2: Examine the systemic and T cell-specific metabolomic impact of SIV vaccines co-delivered with
either supplemental arginine or the arginine-catabolizing enzyme, arginase 1, and the effect on viremia
after ART cessation. mTOR regulates cellular metabolism based on integration of nutrient-sensing systems,
including those that measure availability of amino acids. Vaccine-mediated modulation of amino-acid
catabolism could therefore provide a route to local and limited metabolic regulation that encourages a
transformative and effective T-cell response."

Advanced prostate cancer is a universally lethal disease and one for which no biomarkers have yet been found
to inform therapeutic decision making. DNA repair deficiency in the homologous recombination and CDK12
pathways increases sensitivity of tumors to the DNA damaging effects of high dose testosterone based on
early biomarker interrogations of phase II high dose testosterone studies. High dose testosterone is also very
well tolerated in appropriately selected patient populations who are asymptomatic. The proposed study is a
two arm phase II study of high dose testosterone in men with metastatic, castration resistant prostate cancer
containing mutations in ATM or CDK12. Patients would receive intermittent high dose testosterone
(intramuscular injections Day 1 of each monthly cycle) until clinical or radiographic progression or intolerance.
Androgen deprivation is continued in order to maintain consistent nadir testosterone levels which are critical to
the concept of inducing genomic instability by exposing tumor cells to very high and low testosterone levels
over the length of the cycle. The primary endpoint will be 50% decline in PSA from baseline. Secondary
endpoints are radiographic response per RECIST, radiographic progression free survival, PSA progression
free survival, overall survival, PSA50 response rate in each genomic subgroup, quality of life by FACT-P and
International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) surveys and incidence and severity of adverse events according
to CTCAE version 4.0. This study will provide critical information regarding efficacy and toxicity of high dose
testosterone therapy in a biomarker selected population. High dose testosterone in appropriately selected
patients is very well tolerated and would provide treatment options for patients who are otherwise not at the
appropriate point in their treatment sequence for other treatments. The importance of this study will be to
establish the utility of DNA repair deficiency in specific genes as a predictive biomarker for response to high
dose testosterone and to justify larger studies targeting specific subsets, particularly for subsets for which
effective therapies have not yet been established such as ATM and CDK12."

The proposed SPiRE builds on preliminary work in which we have observed a relationship between efficacy of
the corticospinal tract serving the plantarflexors and walking function, specifically ankle plantarflexor power, in
individuals with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis. We have observed robust associations between: i) PF
corticospinal efficacy, and ii) modulation of corticospinal drive, and PF power, particularly in individuals post-
stroke. Importantly, clinical and demographic factors including: age, stroke chronicity, and lesion location, neither
explain, nor modify, these associations. In combination, these findings lead to our central premise, that
improved efficacy of the corticospinal tract serving the plantarflexors will enable augmentation of ankle PF power
and contribute to improved walking function in individuals post-stroke. Here we propose to investigate use of
paired associative stimulation (PAS) to enhance corticospinal efficacy and to the plantarflexors through targeted
neuroplasticity. We will explore three approaches to PAS to determine its efficacy for enhancing: i) neural
responses, ii) biomechanical effects (A2), and iii) retention of neural and biomechanical effects.
Objectives. The proposed SPiRE focused on methodological variables required to optimize efficacy of PAS on:
a) corticospinal efficacy to the plantarflexors, and b) walking function (quantified as A2) in Veterans with post-
stroke walking dysfunction. By achieving our aims, data generated from this SPiRE will contribute to
development of more focused and relevant hypotheses to be tested in future studies supported through
competitive Merit Review. However, before motivating a larger study, we first seek to determine the salience
and magnitude of effects of PAS. In addition to exploring methodological issues related to PAS, data generated
from the proposed SPiRE will enable us to determine the appropriate scope of a future project including sample
size and dosing. Our objectives are consistent with the programmatic guidelines of the SPiRE (RX-20-009),
particularly as they relate to senior investigators. Specifically: i) this work has not previously been funded; ii) the
question to be addressed in this proposal represents a new area of research, and a new collaboration, for the
PI, and iii) we seek to develop our methodology, determine feasibility, and generate preliminary/exploratory data
for sake of determining effect sizes and computing statistical power for future large scale studies in human
subjects. We will compare effects of PAS targeting ankle plantarflexion when delivered: at rest, during
submaximal activity, and during walking."

The Health Care Systems Research Network (HCSRN)-Older Americans Independence Centers (OAICs)
AGING (Advancing Geriatrics Infrastructure and Network Growth) Initiative (R24AG045050/R33AG0577806)
was launched in 2014 to address knowledge gaps around multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) in older adults by
fostering an interdisciplinary research agenda. Our mission has been to counter the traditional single-condition,
siloed approach to the care of older adults and advance the science of MCCs. The AGING Initiative is a highly
productive, collaborative, transdisciplinary endeavor involving scientists from 20 HCSRN research centers,
embedded within healthcare delivery systems caring for over 2 million persons aged 65 and older, in
partnership with investigators from 15 premier, university-based centers established by the National Institute
on Aging (the OAICs). In this competitive renewal, our overarching aim is to build on our successful efforts and
collaborations, while taking the AGING Initiative in new, more ambitious, and sustainable directions. We will
seek to promote health equity, further integrate diverse patients and care partners into our scientific activities,
expand efforts to foster the careers of underrepresented minority (URM) scientists, and expand our efforts to
engage with a more diverse group of patients/care partners and a broader array of organizations to improve
the care of older adults with MCCs. Our specific aims are: (1) to foster research innovation and translation of

The goals of this project are to understand how and why a metamorphic protein evolved from a non-
metamorphic ancestor and develop a method for de novo design of fold-switching proteins. Nearly all
known proteins adopt a single folded structure, but XCL1 is a rare example of a fold-switching, or
metamorphic, protein. Metamorphic proteins reversibly exchange between two entirely different,
incompatible structures. Experiments proposed in specific aim 1 seek to answer the question: why is
human XCL1 metamorphic? We hypothesize that fold-switching conferred a functional advantage to an
XCL1 ancestor that was subsequently optimized for its role in the human immune system. XCL1 binds
and activates the chemokine receptor XCR1 using the conserved chemokine fold. However, we
discovered that an atypical receptor binds the non-chemokine fold, and may have exerted selective
pressure on XCL1 evolution. We will define the structural basis for XCL1 recognition by both receptors.
We recently used ancestral sequence reconstruction to show that XCL1 evolved from a non-
metamorphic chemokine fold and identified the sequence changes that permitted spontaneous
interconversion with an unrelated beta sheet structure. Specific aim 2 will define structure-function
relationships for the resurrected XCL1 ancestors and test the hypothesis that cold denaturation of the
beta sheet structure enables interconversion with the chemokine fold. In specific aim 3, we will use
Rosetta and AlphaFold2 to identify novel sequences that shift between two distinct, folded, monomeric
helical bundle structures. Structural dynamics of the most promising designs will be characterized by
NMR and other biophysical measurements. Metamorphic designs and related monomorphic sequences
will be systematically analyzed to assess the relative importance of interface optimization, flexibility or
strain, and internal contact networks and identify features required to encode multiple structures in a
single protein. Collectively, the proposed studies will provide a deeper understanding of the
evolutionary origin and design of fold-switching proteins, an important but underrepresented category of
biomolecules."

The behavior of a cell is influenced by its surrounding environment within a tissue. Knowledge of the
locations of different cells in a tissue is critical for understanding the spatial organization of cell types and
pathology.Although single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has made it possible to characterize cell
types and states at an unprecedented resolution, the lack of physical relationships among cells has hindered the
study of cell-cell communications within tissue context. Recent technology advances in spatial transcriptomics
(ST) have enabled gene expression profiling while retaining location information in tissues. A popular ST
technology is based on spatial barcoding followed by next-generation sequencing in which transcriptome-wide
gene expression is measured in spatially barcoded spots. Data from such ST technologies often include a high-
resolution hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained histology image of the tissue section from which the gene
expression data are obtained. Although ST is powerful, such data are still expensive to generate. On the other
hand, it is relatively cheaper to generate H&E-stained histology images and scRNA-seq data. The main
motivation of this project is to leverage information in ST to gain additional knowledge from the relatively easy-
to-obtain histology images and scRNA-seq data. Building upon our expertise in statistical genomics, we propose
to develop novel machine learning methods to address key computational challenges when performing
integrative analysis of ST, histology images, and single cells. Our methods will jointly model gene expression
and histology to characterize the spatial organization of tissues and predict spatial gene expression from
histology images. The resulting spatial map from these analyses will further enable the spatial mapping of single
cells back to tissues. The proposed methods will be applied to public data and data generated from ongoing
collaborations in various diseases to evaluate their performance. The successful completion of this project will
allow researchers to take advantage of advanced machine learning algorithms to integrate ST, histology, and
single-cell data to gain a holistic view of the spatial organization of tissues."
10850810,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Several human pattern-recognition receptors detect intracellular danger-associated signals, oligomerize into
multiprotein complexes called inflammasomes, and trigger a lytic form of cell death called pyroptosis.
Inflammasomes are involved in mounting immune responses to pathogens and in maintaining organismal
homeostasis, but their hyperactivation can cause cancer, autoimmune disorders, and metabolic dysfunction. As
such, it is critically important to characterize the molecular mechanisms that regulate inflammasome activation.
NLRP1 and CARD8 are related pattern-recognition receptors that form inflammasomes, but the danger signals
that they sense have not been fully established. Notably, ligands that bind to the serine dipeptidyl peptidases 8
and 9 (DPP8/9), including endogenous peptides with Xaa-Pro (where Xaa is any amino acid) N-termini, have
been reported to activate these inflammasomes. However, why the innate immune system monitors Xaa-Pro
peptide levels is unknown and constitutes a major knowledge gap. Recently, reductive stress, or a profound
lack of reactive oxygen species (ROS), was also reported to activate the NLPR1 and CARD8 inflammasomes.
The central hypothesis of this application is that reductive stress and Xaa-Pro peptide accumulation are
intimately related danger signals that together comprise an overall “danger state” that causes rapid and full
NLRP1 and CARD8 inflammasome activation. Specifically, it is proposed that the disordered regions of many
cytosolic proteins, including the autoinhibitory N-terminal region of CARD8, are stabilized by intramolecular
disulfide bonds; reductive stress abolishes these bonds, destabilizing these sequences and triggering their
degradation into peptides by the proteasome. Proline is the most abundant amino acid in disordered protein
regions, and therefore reductive stress likely generates many Xaa-Pro peptides. In this way, Xaa-Pro peptide
accumulation can serve to confirm that reductive stress is occurring. This central hypothesis has been
formulated based on preliminary data produced in the applicant’s laboratory and described in this application.
The objective of this project is to determine the relationship between reductive stress, disordered protein
degradation, and Xaa-Pro peptide accumulation. This project consists of three Specific Aims: 1) to determine
how reductive stress induces the proteasome-mediated degradation of CARD8, 2) to characterize the
relationship between reductive stress and Xaa-Pro peptide accumulation, and 3) to determine the relationship
between cell metabolism and inflammasome activation. The successful completion of this work will not only
clarify the primordial function of these enigmatic inflammasomes, but will also reveal a previously unknown a
connection between intracellular redox state and protein stability. Moreover, this work will provide the
foundation for future efforts to therapeutically control these inflammasomes for the treatment of human disease."

Recent studies by my group have highlighted the clinical relevance of platelet-derived growth factor-B
(PDGFB) secreted by malignant breast epithelial cells and its receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor
beta (PDGFRβ), expressed on cells of the mesenchymal lineage (e.g., fibroblasts, pericytes, astrocytes) in the
promotion of breast cancer metastasis to the brain (BCBM). Our studies revealed: (1) PDGFB ligand promotes
primary and intracranial breast tumor growth, (2) mesenchymal-specific PDGFRβ hyperactivity (Fsp1-
cre;PdgfrbD849V/+) promotes BCBM in mice, (3) PDGFB ligand expression in the primary breast tumor is
prognostic of brain metastases in human breast cancer patients, and (4) inhibition with a small molecule
selective PDGFR inhibitor (crenolanib) reduces intracranial tumor growth in mouse models of BCBM. This
published work discovered PDGFB-to-PDGFRβ signaling as a clinically relevant signaling node for predicting,
and potentially treating, BCBM. Our continued investigation into how breast cancer-derived PDGFB
mechanistically modulates the brain TME has further revealed previously unknown immuno-modulatory and
vascular effects. The current application will directly test the overarching hypothesis that breast cancer cells
expressing PDGFB completely transform the brain metastatic niche, both by creating a pro-tumorigenic
immune microenvironment and by invoking vascular changes. In Aim 1, the interaction between breast cancer
cells with/without PDGFB and the brain immune microenvironment will be evaluated in vitro (microglial co-
cultures and conditioned media experiments) and in vivo (intracardiac injections followed by brain
histopathological evaluation and high-plex spectral cytometry). This aim will also evaluate if PDGFB causes
changes in the microglial phagocytic response as well as shifts in anti-tumorigenic/pro-tumorigenic myeloid cell
phenotypes. These studies will be the first to directly test whether breast cancer-derived PDGFB drives
immune evasion in the brain metastatic microenvironment. In Aim 2, the interaction between breast cancer
cells with/without PDGFB and the brain microvasculature will be evaluated in vitro (BBB spheroids,
microfluidics) and in vivo (intracardiac injections followed by brain histopathological evaluation). This aim will
also evaluate a putative mechanism by which PDGFB functions in an autocrine manner to upregulate the pro-
angiogenic factor Angiopoietin-1, and whether these vascular changes can be ablated with small molecule
inhibitors of PDGFRβ and/or Tie2 (angiopoietin receptor). These studies will be the first to directly test the
hypothesis that breast cancer-derived PDGFB alters the brain microvasculature indirectly through an autocrine
PDGFB-PDGFRβ-Ang1 axis. Upon completion of the proposed study, we will have determined potentially
targetable mechanism(s) by which PDGFB pre-conditions the brain microenvironment allowing for metastasis
to this site."

Influenza is a major cause of respiratory disease. Moreover, an influenza pandemic is a perennial threat, which
may lead to >30 million deaths worldwide within 6 months. Current vaccines generate an antibody immune re-
sponse against surface proteins, which change constantly, requiring annual updates. Moreover, their effective-
ness may be as low as 10-20% when circulating viruses do not match the vaccine viruses. As seasonal influenza
vaccines are highly strain-specific, they would provide very limited protection against novel pandemic strains.
The best way to prevent an unknown future seasonal or pandemic influenza strain is with a vaccine with efficacy
against as broad a range of strains as possible – preferably universal efficacy. To do so, it must target an antigen
that is highly conserved among all influenza strains and subtypes. Nucleoprotein (NP) is very well conserved
within A-strains (up to 95%). NP-specific T-cells present in patients before exposure correlate with >70% reduc-
tion in influenza A – both pandemic and seasonal. Therefore, we hypothesize that T-cell immunization against
NP would have broad-spectrum (possibly universal) efficacy against influenza, including pandemic strains.
Osivax is proposing a novel approach based on its proprietary platform technology, oligoDOM®, to generate
heptameric antigens with improved humoral and cellular immunogenicity. Using this technology, Osivax devel-
oped OVX836: a recombinant protein in which the full-length NP sequence of an H1N1 influenza strain was
fused to oligoDOM®. OVX836 generates high, long-lasting, and dose-dependent humoral and T-cell responses
in mice, leading to cross-protective efficacy against lethal challenge by both homologous and heterologous in-
fluenza A- and B-strains. This efficacy was confirmed clinically in two Phase 2a clinical trials conducted during
influenza seasons in which heterologous H1N1 and H3N2 strains were dominant, with efficacy in the range of
75-80%, in line with the WHO/NIAID aspirational efficacy target for influenza vaccines. The main advantage of
OVX836 over other vaccines is that it is universal, multi-season and strain-independent. Moreover, it stimulates
all three arms of immunity – CD8+ T-cells, CD4+ T-cells and antibodies – in contrast to existing vaccines, which
rely mostly on an antibody response against surface antigens that are highly prone to mutations.
This project aims to demonstrate the breadth of protection conferred by OVX836 against two heterologous influ-
enza A-strains – namely the once pandemic but now seasonal pH1N1 (Specific Aim #1) and H5N1, a highly
pathogenic strain with pandemic potential (Specific Aim #2) – in a non-human primate (NHP) challenge model.
While a naïve infection model is simpler and more convenient, a pre-infected model is likely to better mimic the
human condition. Therefore, in order to validate a pre-infection model, we propose to evaluate the protection
and immune response conferred by OVX836 in naïve and pre-infected NHPs. By evaluating the immune re-
sponses in NHPs we will also further investigate the mechanism of action of our vaccine and identify potential
correlates of protection to be further evaluated in human."

The endothelial glycocalyx is a glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-enriched layer lining the lumen of all blood vessels.
Endothelial glycocalyx integrity is necessary for vascular homeostasis; as such, sepsis-associated glycocalyx
degradation contributes to the microvascular dysfunction characteristic of septic organ injury. Elevated
concentrations of circulating GAG fragments (quantified by gold-standard mass spectrometry approaches
developed by our group) are accordingly associated with poor outcomes in septic humans.
Given the association between glycocalyx degradation and septic organ injury, point-of-care quantification of
circulating GAGs is an attractive biomarker of endothelial injury and thus sepsis severity. However, mass
spectrometry is expensive and ill-suited for bedside use. To address the need for a rapid, inexpensive, point-
of-care assay of soluble GAGs, we developed the dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) assay, a colorimetric assay
of sulfated GAGs that can be performed easily in unprocessed human urine and airspace fluid. However, the
accuracy of DMMB in blood is unknown, as this colorimetric assay may be confounded by not only the baseline
color of blood/plasma but also cross-reactivity with circulating cell-free DNA commonly found in the blood of
septic patients. Alternatively, as plasma GAGs are rapidly excreted into the urine, urinary DMMB could be a
noninvasive index of plasma GAGs that would avoid the potential pitfalls of plasma DMMB. However, the
concordance of urine DMMB with plasma GAGs has not been explored.
In the R21 section of this application, we propose to optimize DMMB as a measure of plasma GAGs, using
both ex vivo testing of normal human blood as well comparing DMMB with gold-standard mass spectrometry in
plasma from an established biobank of septic patients. Furthermore, we will prospectively collect matched
blood and urine samples to determine if urine DMMB correlates with plasma GAGs.
In the R33 section of this application, we will perform a prospective study across three Boston academic
medical centers to determine if DMMB indices of plasma GAGs (measured at various timepoints during the
progression of sepsis) can serve as a biomarker of endothelial injury, defined by a panel of protein biomarkers
associated with endothelial activation. Finally, we will determine if DMMB indices of glycocalyx degradation
correlate with clinical indices of sepsis severity, demonstrating the translational relevance of this assay.
If successful, our R21/R33 will identify a rapid, inexpensive, point-of-care assay for assessing endothelial
glycocalyx degradation and endothelial injury in septic patients. This assay would not only serve as a predictive
biomarker in sepsis, but potentially could identify sepsis “endotypes” amenable to future endothelial-targeted
therapies, allowing for precision medicine approaches in the care of critically ill patients."

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic remains a global health threat, responsible for an
estimated 35 million active infections and one million deaths per year. Small molecule drugs have transformed
HIV prognosis and prophylaxis, but a preventative vaccine that elicits protective neutralizing antibodies is a
critical priority. Because of HIV’s vast global diversity, it remains an open challenge to elicit antibodies via
vaccination with sufficient antiviral breadth and potency to protect against diverse viral isolates. Rare broadly
neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that can inhibit the majority of circulating HIV strains have been isolated from
HIV-infected patients, establishing a targeted endpoint for an effective HIV vaccine. These bnAbs are also
promising molecules for direct therapeutic or prophylactic use. However, our understanding of HIV bnAb
function and development has not yet proven sufficient to effectively harness their protective potential. In this
proposal, I outline innovative high-throughput biochemical approaches to study the molecular evolutionary
basis for bnAb function. With a focus on bnAbs targeting the HIV Envelope CD4 receptor-binding site, we will
use high-throughput mutational scanning methods to reveal how all amino acid mutations in select bnAbs and
their naive precursors impact specificity versus breadth of binding to diverse HIV Env antigens and to rationally
designed candidate vaccine immunogens. In parallel, we will measure mutational effects on orthogonal
antibody properties that can constrain antibody development including thermodynamic stability, polyspecificity,
and autoreactivity. By synthesizing this wealth of mutational data together with existing natural antibody
sequencing data from infection and vaccination, we will identify the molecular evolutionary forces that guide
and constrain bnAb affinity maturation. These observations will enable the design of improved antibody
therapeutics and vaccine immunogens for this promising class of HIV bnAb. More broadly, the proposed
studies will provide important perspectives on the molecular and evolutionary basis for antibody development
and pioneer interdisciplinary methodological approaches with utility for various pathogens where the need for
broad immune recognition presents a challenge to therapeutic control."
10724259,"Individual variation in inflammatory responses regulates onset and severity of multiple sclerosis (MS) and other
types of brain injury. Initiation, amplification, and resolution of these inflammatory responses occur in part
through innate immune signaling mediated by macrophages and related immune cells. This laboratory has
discovered novel innate immune signaling pathways in human macrophages that are regulated by intracellular
splice variants of voltage-gated sodium channels. These channels regulate pattern recognition of dsRNA,
intracellular signaling, vesicular trafficking, and transcription of anti-viral genes. In a mouse model of MS,
expression of one of these channels, human macrophage SCN5A, in mouse macrophages reduced disease
severity and enhanced tissue repair. Recently published work demonstrates that a newly discovered channel
variant, human macrophage SCN10A, acts in a synergistic manner with SCN5A to regulate RNA processing of
a transcript that encodes a DNA repair protein, PPP1R10. New preliminary data demonstrate individual
variation in regulation of PPP1R10 expression. New data also reveal that SCN10A localizes to mitochondria
during cellular injury and regulates ATP production. The objective of this revised proposal is to characterize
these innate immune signaling mechanisms in human cells and an animal model. The central hypothesis is
that human macrophage SCN10A and SCN5A prevent cell and tissue injury through enhancement of DNA
repair and maintenance of cellular bioenergetics. This hypothesis will be assessed in three aims: 1) Analyze
how human macrophage channel variants regulate PPP1R10 protein expression, 2) Determine how the human
macrophage channel variants regulate mitochondrial function, and 3) Characterize how macrophage SN10A
and SCN5A prevent tissue injury. For Aim 1, the proposed model is that endogenous signals of cellular injury
activate human macrophage SCN10A and SCN5A to initiate a calcium-dependent nuclear signaling pathway
that regulates expression of the DNA repair protein PPP1R10. It is hypothesized that individual variation in this
pathway increases the risk of tissue injury in inflammatory diseases such as MS. For Aim 2, it is proposed that
human macrophage SCN10A localizes to mitochondria during cellular injury to transiently increase
mitochondrial ATP production. It is also hypothesized that SCN10A and SCN5A regulate mitophagy, a cellular
protective mechanism. For Aim 3, it is postulated that macrophages that express human variants of SCN5A
and SCN10A prevent tissue injury in inflammatory lesions through enhancement of DNA repair and
maintenance of bioenergetics. These hypotheses will be tested using multidisciplinary approaches in primary
cultures of human macrophages; macrophages, microglia, and neurons derived from human induced-
pluripotent stem cells; and in the mouse model of multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis. The expectations are that we will identify novel regulatory mechanisms of bioenergetics and
tissue repair that are relevant to MS and related diseases. The long-term goals are to develop new biomarkers
of disease susceptibility and severity and identify novel therapeutic strategies that prevent and reduce long-
term disability of Veterans with MS."
10724260,"Anticipated Impacts on Veterans Health Care. The incidence of infections due to highly resistant
Acinetobacter baumannii is increasing. True pan drug resistant (PDR) strains have been reported.
Unfortunately, the newly approved antimicrobials ceftolozane-tazobactam, ceftazidime-avibactam, and
meropenem/vaborbactam are poorly active against resistant A. baumannii. The need to identify new
antimicrobials active against A. baumannii is pressing.
Background. We have demonstrated that the A. baumannii low molecular mass (LMM) penicillin binding
protein 7/8 (PBP 7/8) is essential in vivo (i.e., required for bacterial survival in a host) in rat pneumonia and
subcutaneous abscess infection models, and is required for survival in human serum and ascites. Our initial
studies on PBP 7/8 were performed in an antimicrobial sensitive strain AB307-0294. These findings have
since been confirmed with the extensively drug resistant (XDR) strain HUMC1. Since our initial observation
other investigators, using INseq and Tn-seq, have shown that PBP 7/8 is needed for A. baumannii survival in
the Galleria mellonella insect infection model and serum respectively. PBP 7/8 has many characteristics that
support its potential as a high value drug target. However, based on studies in rich laboratory medium, LMM
PBPs including PBP 7/8 have been perceived to be non-essential. As a result, PBP 7/8 have received scant
attention as an antibacterial target and has not been considered for A. baumannii. However, our data
contradicts this paradigm and endorses the need for additional studies on PBP 7/8 in XDR A. baumannii.
Therefore, our objective is to validate PBP 7/8 as a drug target, delineate mechanisms that mediate its ex
vivo and in vivo essentiality, and to identify compounds that inactivate PBP 7/8.
Objectives and Methods. To achieve these objectives, studies on PBP 7/8 will be extended to include
additional XDR strains of A. baumannii to confirm our findings are generalizable (aim 1). Aim 1 also will also
explore mechanisms by which PBP 7/8 enables growth/survival of A. baumannii ex vivo and in vivo and
identify the innate host defense factors it protects against. Increasing data support the need to treat infections
due to XDR isolates with multiple agents, thereby increasing efficacy and protecting against the development
of resistance. Our demonstration that the loss of PBP 7/8 production increases susceptibility to complement
and lysozyme mediated bactericidal activity and changes cell structure supports the hypothesis that the
inability to produce PBP 7/8 affects permeability, a critical factor in the intrinsic antimicrobial resistance of A.
baumannii. Therefore, an additional goal of this proposal will be to assess the whether the loss of PBP 7/8
production enhances the activity of adjunctive therapy with antimicrobials and/or monoclonal antibodies
directed against the capsule (aim 2). Additional studies in aim 2 will assess whether the loss of PBP 7/8 affects
the production of other PBPs and ampC expression. These data will generate additional mechanistic insights
into the consequences of not being able to produce PBP 7/8. Lastly, aim 3 will begin the process of identifying
a “tool” compound that is active against PBP 7/8. A live wild-type XDR strain will be screened against a
chemical library to identify compounds directed against PBP 7/8 that possess bactericidal activity. Additional
orthogonal assays will establish specificity, determine their quality, and prioritize identified inhibitors for
downstream optimization and pre-clinical studies. Deliverables from this proposal will validate the paradigm
shift on the value of PBP 7/8 as an antimicrobial target and open an untapped venue for the development of
a new class of antimicrobial agents against this XDR pathogen."

Over the past several decades, the world has experienced a surge in outbreaks of virus-induced disease that
have led to significant human suffering, while putting considerable stress on the global public health system and
society. Due to the scientific and public health challenges posed by these viruses, there is an ongoing need for
well-trained virology researchers. To meet this need, the UNC predoctoral T32 Virology Training Program
requests support for 5 training slots per year. The UNC Virology Training Program consists of 22 faculty
members whose research focuses on a diverse set of RNA, DNA, and retroviruses. Together the UNC virology
faculty provide cutting edge virology training in viral pathogenesis, virus-host interactions, model systems, host
genetics of virus susceptibility, antiviral and vaccine development, carcinogenic mechanisms, as well as
translational research opportunities focused on a number of important human pathogens. Our Program provides
our students with fundamental training in virology, combined with laboratory-based training in state-of-the-art
virology techniques, while developing critical thinking and scientific communication skills. Our goal is to develop
our trainees into well-rounded scientists that are positioned to successfully pursue scientific careers in virology-
related research. To achieve these goals, our students receive one to two years of support from the Training
Grant during years 3-5 of their training. Our students take three one semester courses covering molecular
virology, viral pathogenesis, and a special topics course focused the virology literature. Students routinely
present their research at multiple in-house seminar series, take part in several virology focused mini-
symposia/training activities, and present their work at local, national, and international scientific meetings. We
provide students with a broad array of career development activities in the form of small group meetings, career

Pediatric appendectomy, the most prevalent inpatient procedure in children, is associated with significant
burden to the patient, their parents, healthcare systems and third party payors. After discharge, monitoring by
parents consists only of such “proxy” subjective assessments, which have been reported as inaccurate, and
resulted in both increased complications (e.g., readmissions), and wasted healthcare resources (e.g.,
potentially avoidable emergency department (ED) visits after surgery). Advances in consumer wearable
devices (“CWDs”) that passively and non-invasively monitor physical activity (PA), heart rate (HR), and sleep
are ushering in a new era of symptoms science, particularly after surgery. Their expanding capability to
generate continuous, valid, objective, and actionable measures in near-real time in children, provide
opportunities to detect altered post-operative recovery patterns early, and therefore improve the precision and
timeliness of any necessary clinical interventions. The proposed study will use a CWD, the Fitbit Inspire 2, and
will apply machine learning methods to the Fitbit data (physical activity, HR, and sleep) to create clinically
meaningful alerts for early detection of postoperative infection. During hospitalization and continuing after
discharge, a Fitbit Inspire 2, a widely-used, commercially wearable device well-tolerated by young children (3-
18 years old) will be used to measure step counts, sleep, and HR. The proposal has 2 aims. Aim 1 develops
and validates machine learning algorithm for infection using the Fitbit. Aim 2 prospectively feeds near-real time
Fitbit data on postoperative appendectomy patients to clinicians, and examines their effect on clinical decision
making, time to first contact with the healthcare system, and on overall healthcare use patterns. The proposal
is aligned with NINR’s research priorities. Methods developed from this work will pave the way to develop
similar algorithms for other patient populations needing a proxy, as well as to characterize other surgeries and,
should improve overall postoperative management for all surgical patients."

1) to develop the research infrastructure needed to improve the health of minority elders through the
development, implementation, and evaluation of community and health system interventions designed to
mitigate health disparities which incorporates two of NIA's areas of scientific focus: identify and develop
solutions to eliminate health disparities and health inequities in the growing population of older adults, and
improve the health and well-being of older adults; 2) to conduct rigorous analyses of existing data sets to
identify sociocultural factors, health care factors, and behavioral and biological level correlates of health
disparities to inform the design of interventions or health policies to mitigate health disparities; 3) to contribute
to the development, evaluation, and dissemination of measures that can be used to track health outcomes or
measure critical social, behavioral, and economic predictors of the health and the health-care of minority
elders; 4) to build on CHIME’s 20-year track record of successful academic advancement of minority faculty
through mentorship and support of their conduct of independent research on the health of minority elders; 5) to
broaden both existing and new partnerships with communities to expand the pool of potential minority research
participants and the beneficiaries of the findings from both the research conducted under the auspices of
CHIME and other funded research. 6) Continue our long-standing and highly successful partnership and

10913624,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)
Our long-term goal is to elucidate the systems and circuits, within and across brain regions, responsible for
decision making. The objective of this proposal is to examine the neural circuit basis for how, in the face of
sensory uncertainty, perceptual decisions are adaptively biased to the most valuable option, as instructed by the
recent history of choices and their outcomes. We address this question by focusing on the superior colliculus
(SC), a key midbrain node in the network of brain regions responsible for selecting targets for movement (i.e.,
“spatial choice”), an important form of decision making amenable to circuit-level interrogation. The SC integrates
input from numerous brain regions, has extensive intrinsic circuitry capable of integrating priors with sensory
evidence as required by Bayesian frameworks, and outputs pre-motor orienting commands to downstream motor
nuclei. Given its role as a functional hub for spatial choice, as well as its known cell types and circuitry, the SC
is ideal for examining the neural circuit basis for adaptive decision making and how decisions are influenced by
priors. In particular, the SC receives a robust input – of unknown function – from the mesencephalic
pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg), which we have shown represents recent spatial choices and
outcomes. In a set of experiments in behaving mice, we test the overarching hypothesis that the SC adaptively
biases spatial choice by integrating priors represented by PPTg input.
 We use a variant of an established spatial choice task for mice in which the dominant component of an
odor mixture presented at a central port cues whether reward is available at the left or right reward port, and in
which the left/right reward ratio changes across blocks of trials. On trials in which the odor mixture provides only
weak evidence about reward location, decision making can be optimized by biasing choices towards the port
yielding the larger reward. In Aim 1, we test the hypothesis that pre-motor SC output biases choice towards the
most valuable target, by recording and perturbing the activity of genetically defined pre-motor SC neurons during
the task. In Aim 2, we test the hypothesis that PPTg input transmits representations of priors to the SC that
instruct adaptive choice bias in pre-motor SC neurons. We examine whether SC neurons – particularly inhibitory
commissural neurons well positioned to mediating competition between left and right choices – represent choices
and outcomes of previous trials, as we have seen in the PPTg. We then determine whether representations of
priors and choice bias in the SC depend on PPTg input, by perturbing PPTg activity and recording SC activity
during the task.
 If successful, the overall impact of our proposal will be the elucidation of a key circuit mechanism for how
decisions are optimized by priors, a critical nervous system function. In addition, our proposal will enable future
research into how genetically-defined and projection-specific neural circuits contribute to decision making,
offering insight into basic brain function and neurological conditions in which decision making is impaired."
10881929,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S. and worldwide. Non–small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancers. Early detection of indeterminate
pulmonary nodules (IPNs) with chest low dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening followed by effective
treatments can reduce mortality by 20% relative to chest radiography. However, the high false positive rate
finding as >95% limits the application. The unmet clinical need for early diagnosis is the lack of a noninvasive
test that can be applied to individuals with CT-detected lung nodules and reliably discriminates between
malignant or benign nodules. Liquid biopsy focused on the characterization of tumor-associated genetic
alterations in cell free circulating tumor DNA can non-invasively profile the molecular landscape of solid tumors.
However, the low biological concentrations of ctDNA, low frequency of somatic mutations and the confounding
impact of clonal hematopoiesis-related variants in early-stage lung cancer limit the sensitivity of ctDNA-based
liquid biopsy assays. It would be essential if additional cell free DNA biomarkers could be included to allow the
development of more sensitive molecular diagnostics approaches for the early assessment of lung cancer.
 We have discovered a distinct population of ultra-short single-stranded cell-free DNA (uscf/ctDNA) with a
size of 40-70nt in healthy and NSCLC plasma. Our preliminary data showed that the fragmentomic features,
including functional element profile, fragmentation patterns and end motifs of uscfDNA molecules, can
distinguish NSCLC patients from healthy donors. This R21 application is to explore and test our hypothesis that
the fragmentomic features of uscfDNA molecules can serve as novel biomarkers to differentiate NSCLC patients
from non-cancer subjects with IPNs and allow more sensitive liquid biopsy molecular diagnostics for early
NSCLC detection. Two specific aims are in place for hypothesis testing. Aim 1 is to develop a predictive model
using uscfDNA-seq assay on uscfDNA fragmentomic analysis for liquid biopsy of NSCLC. Aim 2 is to pre-validate
uscfDNA-Seq test for the early detection of NSCLC. Together, the translational and pre-validation, targeting
uscfDNA for early detection of NSCLC can break new ground and extend previous discoveries towards impactful
new directions and clinical applications."
10924000,"ABSTRACT
The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has proposed the continuation
of the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN). As described in the RFA, DILIN will be a network composed
of up to 5 Clinical Centers (CCs) with expertise in diagnosis and management of DILI and a Data Coordinating
Center (DCC) with expertise in the management of multicenter studies and clinical and translational datasets.
The major aim of the network study is to pursue genetic analyses to find predictive biomarkers as well as
genetic ""fingerprints"" useful for elucidating the pathogenesis of Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) and ultimately
for developing specific means of prevention and or treatment. The Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI)
proposes to continue as the DCC for DILIN. In this role, we will apply our extensive experience and research
infrastructure to coordinate, support and facilitate the activities of the DILIN network. In particular, we will
attend to the following specific aims: (1) Support the network’s effort to increase recruitment productivity and
efficiency; (2) Support current and new DILIN studies including new mechanistic studies and/or trials; (3)
Provide overall network support of general DILIN functions; (4) Ensure quality assurance and continue data
management activities; and (5) Administer subcontracts with external partners including the analytical core at
the National Center for Natural Products Research."
10731732,"Background: Nearly half of Veterans who screen positive for PTSD in VA primary care clinics do not receive
VA mental health treatment. To increase timely access to VA care, we must understand Veterans’ access
pathways (the series of options offered to, and choices made by, Veterans after a positive PTSD screen that
may lead them to VA care). Mapping these pathways is key to understanding who is being lost to VA care and
where they are being lost. Further, by examining contextual and individual factors that predict who and where
Veterans are falling off these pathways, we will be able to ascertain why these Veterans are being lost.
Significance: The proposed IIR is responsive to the HSR&D priorities of both mental health and access to
care and will provide insight into the impact of the MISSION Act on mental health access. At the completion of
this project, we will provide three distinct deliverables: 1) guidance on where and to whom access interventions
should be targeted; 2) policy and practice guidance to aid providers in linking Veterans who screen positive to
effective VA care; and 3) a method for classifying Veterans from screening to VA mental health care, which
could be extended to other conditions (e.g. suicidality).
Innovation and Impact: Past research designed to provide information to improve access to PTSD care has
been limited by focusing on the end goal (whether these Veterans do or do not access care) rather than the
process by which Veterans arrive at this goal (the access pathways). The proposed project is not only one of
the first to consider access to care as a process rather than an end point, it is the only study to propose
examining the process of access comprehensively using a method that will generalize to the VA system as a
whole, and will be applicable to other healthcare conditions identified by VA-based screening.
Specific Aims: The proposed mixed methods study has the following aims:
1. Aim 1: Identify contextual- and individual-level variables that differentiate Veterans classified into a VA initial
 access step (an immediate response to a positive PTSD screen in primary care likely to lead to VA care;
 e.g., referral to PC-MHI) from those who were not, including those referred to community care via the
 MISSION Act.
2. Aim 2: Understand VA providers’ and patients’ experiences with, and perspectives on, why Veterans are lost
 to VA follow-up care immediately after screening positive for PTSD, including the role of the MISSION Act.
3. Aim 3: Map the access pathway steps hypothesized to follow each of the six initial VA access steps, as well
 as the step hypothesized to lead to community care provided via the MISSION Act, by leveraging the
 methods developed in our pilot work.
Methodology: Aim 1 will include all Veterans with new PTSD screens in primary care between FY 2017-2019.
Data from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) will be used to determine Veteran access step
classification and to identify contextual and individual variables that significantly predict classification. Aim 2 will
use the data from Aim 1 to identify high- and low-performing sites, and qualitative interviews will be conducted
with site stakeholders to understand access barriers and facilitators. Aim 3 will use quantitative data extracted
from the VA CDW to map the remaining steps in the access pathways to identify which Veterans are lost to
follow-up, and where. Predictive models using relevant access variables identified in Aims 1 and 2 will be run.
Next Steps/Implementation: Results from the proposed IIR will inform the best ways to deploy and tailor
existing access interventions (e.g. PC-MHI, direct-to-Veteran media campaigns). We will work with the Office
of Primary Care to develop policy and practice guidance, and work with both the Office of Primary Care and
NCPTSD leadership to disseminate guidelines and our methodology to VA primary care and PC-MHI
leadership at the national level. We will begin testing implementation strategies in a subsequent IIR."
10731734,"Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including ASD, affect over 15 percent of US children –
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) alone affects approximately 1.5% of US children. Identification
of underlying causes can lead to primary and secondary prevention efforts. Substantial evidence
supports contribution of both genes and environment, particularly prenatal exposures.
Prospective studies, with exposure information collected during pregnancy, prior to symptom
onset, are sorely needed although prospective studies in the general population are not feasible,
cost effective, or efficient for ASD. The enriched-familial-risk design, which capitalizes on the
substantial recurrence risk of both ASD and NDD among siblings of children with ASD, has been
employed to achieve prospective data collection with reasonable outcome events. The Early
Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) study has helped to trailblaze this enriched risk
cohort approach. EARLI recruited and followed over 260 pregnant women who already had a
child with ASD with multiple study visits, child assessments, biosampling, and home environment
surveys over pregnancy and the first 3 years of life. While the total sample size was constrained;
the value of EARLI is the depth of longitudinal data and molecular measurements across multiple
tissue types and early developmental windows. To date, over 9.4 billion data points have been
generated across multiple phenotypes, tissues, exposures, and -omic measures. The current
proposal seeks to maintain and enrich this valuable study to fully realize its impact on
environmental health. The goals are to: 1. Maintain and extend the EARLI Biosample Repository
through support of the storage and retrieval efforts and addition and storage of shed baby teeth
that will enable longitudinal prenatal exposure measures across a growing array of toxicant
exposures. 2. Measure frequency and patterns of emerging co-occurring conditions at school age
to better characterize phenotypes across co-occurring NDDs and quantitative traits. 3.
Characterize variability of heavy metals measurement across timing, family members, and
matrices including maternal blood and urine and shed baby teeth. 4. Develop and apply methods
for phenotype and for exposure harmonization using latent constructs, enabling within and cross-
cohort investigations; 5. Migrate, enhance, and increase the reproducibility of EARLI research
data to enable data sharing. The EARLI study is a valuable asset to early life environmental
epidemiology of neurodevelopmental outcomes. Conducting these aims will allow us to maximize
the contribution of this novel study to the understanding of ASD and NDD etiology."
10731735,"Summary
The combination of chronic dietary exposure to the fungal toxin, aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), and hepatitis B viral (HBV)
infection is associated with a significant increased risk for early onset hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) in
millions of people living in East Asia, Central and South America, and sub-Saharan Africa. Even though dietary
exposures to aflatoxins constitute the second largest global environmental risk factor for cancer development,
there are still significant questions concerning the molecular mechanisms driving carcinogenesis. In-depth
knowledge of these mechanisms is critical for the identification of genetic risk factors that affect individual
susceptibility for people who are HBV infected and AFB1 exposed. In this regard, since AFB1 carcinogenesis is
driven by high frequency G to T transversions, the DNA repair pathways that initiate and complete repair of
persistent AFB1-induced DNA adducts and base damage from HBV-induced inflammation have strong
biological significance. These pathways define the mutagenic burden in the target tissues and ultimately limit
cellular progression to cancer. Although the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway has been shown to
repair AFB1 DNA adducts, murine data presented herein demonstrate that knockout of the DNA base excision
repair (BER) pathway, initiated by the DNA glycosylase NEIL1, is significantly more important than NER
relative to the removal of the highly mutagenic AFB1-Fapy-dG adducts. Thus, our data suggest that
deficiencies in NEIL1 could contribute to the initiation of HCCs in humans. To maximize relevance to human
health, all known variants of NEIL1 will be characterized from regions of the world where aflatoxin ingestion
and HBV infection are prevalent. All variants will be characterized for their biochemical properties relative to
WT NEIL1 and expressed in cells and transgenic mice to understand the potential for catalytically-
compromised variants of NEIL1 to alter susceptibility to aflatoxin exposures. These aims will test the
hypothesis that expression of the oncogenic and other catalytically-compromised variants of NEIL1 can
efficiently block repair and promote increased mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. Characterization of
phenotypically dominant oncogenic variants of NEIL1 will provide the molecular basis from which to design
human epidemiological studies in at-risk populations and early onset HCC cohorts. Further, this application
proposes to establish the molecular mechanisms by which the combination of chronic inflammation driven by
the hepatitis B surface antigen and deficiencies in DNA repair could synergistically drive AFB1-induced
mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. Overall, these studies have direct human health relevance pertaining to
understanding a global environmental health problem by identifying genetic risk factors and biochemical
pathways previously not recognized as germane to AFB1-induced carcinogenesis."
10871893,"ABSTRACT
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a small subset of T cells that are vital to immune self-tolerance. They
function by dominantly controlling the activities of other immune cells. In mouse models of type 1 diabetes
(T1D), a single infusion of islet-specific Tregs prevents and stably reverses autoimmune diabetes. In these
mouse models, infused Tregs accumulate in pancreatic islets and arrest autoimmune aggression against
islet beta cells by expressing immune suppressive functions locally.
Early-phase clinical trials of Treg cell therapy in patients with T1D have shown that it is feasible to produce
billions of patients’ own Tregs for infusion and the therapy is well tolerated and safe. These pioneering
efforts have paved the way for the development of next-generation Treg therapy aiming at establishing
efficacy. The research program described in this proposal focuses on a critical need for a strategy to
increase effectiveness by targeting human Tregs to the pancreatic islets and to monitor the targeting
efficacy in patients.
The proposed strategy is guided by the overarching hypothesis that shared, dominant immunopeptides
on the surface of beta cells are highly specific anchors for islet targeting. Tregs can be engineered to
target these anchors to deliver their immune regulatory function locally in the islets. Moreover, successful
engagement of Tregs with beta cells can be monitored using an engineered biomarker released into the
peripheral blood.
Aim 1 will define the immunopeptidome of pancreatic beta cells. Aim 2 will develop a cellular engineering
strategy to target Tregs efficiently and safely to pancreatic islets. Aim 3 will develop a barcode biomarker
that is released by activated Tregs into the peripheral blood. These projects together aim to develop islet-
specific TCR activation relay (iSTAR) Tregs. We have built a team of three investigators with
complementary expertise in immunology, beta cell biology, and technology development. The proposed
program synergizes our expertise to tackle the challenges in precision targeting of pancreatic islets for
the preservation of beta cell mass in T1D."
10883742,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The distribution of engineered nanomaterials (ENM) in consumer products, manufacturing processes and clinical
diagnostics is rising rapidly, despite our limited understanding of their impacts on human health. ENM exposure
is of particular concern during fetal development and it can influence susceptibility to pathological insults later in
life. Mitochondria play an important role in fetal developmental and they can be impacted by environmental
conditions, which has led to the novel concept of mitochondrial programming. Epigenetic changes are important
determinants of mitochondrial programming, as they influence the organelle's proteomic make-up, which is
responsible for its structure, function and redox balance. Nevertheless, mitochondrial programming in the context
of development is understudied. Our laboratory made the initial observation that maternal ENM inhalation
exposure causes cardiac contractile dysfunction and disruption to mitochondrial bioenergetics in the developing
fetus. These effects were sustained into adulthood. We also reported that maternal ENM inhalation exposure
increases epigenetic methylation of mRNAs in the fetal heart. MRNA methylation occurs primarily to adenosine
leading to N6-methyladenosine (m6A), and to a lesser extent to cytosine, leading to 5-methylcytosine (m5C).
The preliminary data in this grant application suggest that maternal ENM inhalation exposure influences fetal
cardiac mitochondrial programming by enhancing oxidant production and mitochondrial dysfunction, but it is
unclear whether this is mechanistically linked by epigenetic methylation to nuclear genome-encoded
mitochondrial mRNAs and loss of mitochondrial proteins. The proposed studies focus on this gap in knowledge
and they are designed to determine whether maternal ENM inhalation exposure negatively influences
mitochondrial programming in the fetal heart and the susceptibility to future cardiac pathological insult, through
an oxidant driven mechanism. The studies address this specific need, as they will identify mechanisms driving
fetal mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from maternal ENM inhalation exposure as well as the susceptibility to
a secondary cardiac pathological insult that occurs later in life. The central hypothesis being tested is that
maternal ENM inhalation exposure epigenetically reprograms fetal cardiac mitochondria through an oxidant-
driven mechanism that results in enhanced susceptibility to a secondary cardiovascular insult at adulthood. The
objectives of this application are to determine the influence of maternal ENM inhalation exposure and the impact
of enhanced oxidant scavenging on (1) fetal cardiac mitochondrial programming that influence mitochondrial
structure, function and redox balance; (2) fetal cardiac epigenetic methylation of nuclear genome-encoded
mRNAs that encode for mitochondrial proteins; and (3) the susceptibility to a secondary cardiovascular insult at
adulthood. Completion of these studies is expected to provide fundamental mechanistic insight regarding fetal
mitochondrial programming in maternal exposure models and the susceptibility to future cardiac pathologies."
10930936,"Project Summary
The dopamine system plays a major role in the pathogenesis of substance use disorders. Stimulant drug use
and abuse lead to several dopaminergic alterations that contribute to the complex behavior associated with the
formation of addiction. A single acute exposure to a stimulant drug can trigger receptor internalization as an early
synaptic adaptation mechanism to high dopamine concentrations. These mechanisms have been shown to affect
neuroimaging outcomes, specifically positron emission tomography (PET), which has revealed paradoxically
long reductions in dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability after stimulant-induced dopamine release. To date, we
still have a limited understanding of the timeline of dopamine receptor internalization and recovery with repeated
drug exposure and how these adaptation mechanisms affect whole-brain signaling of both excitatory D1 and
inhibitory D2-type receptors. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by characterizing how two classes
of stimulant drugs (amphetamine and methylphenidate) modulate dopamine receptor subtype signaling and
receptor trafficking over time. Using state-of-the-art simultaneous PET and functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) methodology in non-human primates, the timescales of amphetamine-induced receptor
internalization and recycling will be established using repeated amphetamine administrations. Targeted
dopaminergic blocking drugs will be paired with amphetamine to determine how the balance between excitatory
D1 and inhibitory D2 receptor signaling and trafficking is modulated over time. The effects of repeated
amphetamine will then be compared to those of methylphenidate to assess varying levels of dopamine surges
and differential mechanisms of action across these two stimulant drugs. Overall, this study will unravel brain-
wide molecular and functional changes due to repeated stimulant drug exposure by imaging the timescales of
dopamine receptor trafficking in the living brain in a translational animal model. The results will elucidate the role
of dopamine D1 and D2-type receptor adaptations, thereby providing important insight into the neurobiological
mechanisms involved in repeated stimulant drug use relevant for initiating and eventually preventing drug
sensitization and addiction."
10893498,"Behavioral strategies for obesity treatment reliably result in weight loss and health benefits. However,
weight loss typically plateaus at ~7–10% of total body weight (a plateau phase) after which weight regain is
common, limiting the ability of most intervention strategies to modify obesity-related disease risk in a sustained
manner. Overcoming these limitations requires advancing understanding of metabolic, appetitive, and
neurological factors that counteract—and eventually halt—weight loss. Existing literature shows that weight
loss evokes appetitive adaptations that include increased hunger and decreased satiety. The investigative
team’s preliminary data add evidence that an impaired satiety response in brain regions controlling reward and
motivation follows weight loss. Documented metabolic responses to weight loss include declines in total body
and resting energy expenditure as well as increased metabolic efficiency in muscle and adipose tissue. We
now present preliminary data using novel measures of mitochondrial metabolism indicating that a weight loss
plateau is characterized by reductions in mitochondrial metabolic capacity in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells. The proposed research aims to 1) test if an involuntary weight loss plateau is distinguished from other
phases of weight loss by alterations in cellular bioenergetics across multiple tissue types including circulating
blood cells, muscle, and adipose tissue; 2) test for neurophysiologic changes consistent with reduced satiety at
an involuntary weight loss plateau and assess their relation to changes in metabolism; and 3) investigate
predictors of a weight loss plateau using data collected at baseline and in real time during behavioral weight
loss. To address these three Specific Aims, the multidisciplinary study team proposes a basic experimental
study in humans using a remotely delivered group behavioral weight loss intervention to evoke and study
plateau physiology. Real-time remote monitoring of weight loss trajectories will be used to individualize
assessments for 130 adults with overweight or obesity to occur at baseline, during active weight loss, and at a
weight loss plateau. Intensive phenotyping will include serial behavioral assessments and tasks, fasting and
postprandial blood sampling, functional and structural brain magnetic resonance imaging, indirect calorimetry,
and adipose and muscle biopsies to investigate the contribution of mitochondrial function and other pathways
to this weight loss plateau. Future work will probe underlying mechanisms that trigger plateau physiology in a
tissue-specific manner, using identified predictors to target individuals and timepoints. In sum, the proposed
research uses an innovative, individualized approach to improve understanding of the physiological factors that
make additional weight loss difficult once a weight loss plateau is reached. The long-term goal is to develop
new approaches for extending weight loss and improving weight maintenance."

Home visiting programs for new mothers have a broad range of goals, including improvements in maternal and
child health, reductions in child maltreatment, and improvements in child development. Over 286,000 families
facing adversity are served annually by 19 evidence-based models throughout the United States, which
provide support, education, and connections to other services. Before 2020, only a small portion of visits were
delivered through tele home visiting (teleHV; phone or video encounters). The Coronavirus Disease-2019
(COVID-19) pandemic required rapid adoption of teleHV; by early April 2020, 99% of home visits were by
teleHV. Prior to 2020, teleHV was recommended only as a partial replacement for in-person visits and only
after a relationship between the home visitor and family was established, because of the importance of the
therapeutic relationship. This relationship is a key element across home visiting programs, because it serves
as the foundation for teaching, mentoring, and collaborating with the family. There is limited evidence regarding
teleHV, although we anticipate many families will use a mix of in-person visits and teleHV after COVID-19
restrictions are lifted due to greater flexibility and other advantages. We propose a secondary data analysis to
make use of this natural experiment and determine if in-person visits during the establishment of the home
visitor-family relationship is associated with better outcomes than teleHV during the establishment of this
relationship. We will also explore if family characteristics associated with better outcomes vary between in-
person home visiting and teleHV, which will contribute to our understanding of both acceptance and
effectiveness of teleHV by family characteristics. We will consider both health outcomes (maternal depressive
symptoms, breastfeeding, intimate partner violence [IPV]) and process outcomes (retention, visit attendance,
screening completion). We will obtain data from a large, evidence-based home visiting program, Nurse-Family
Partnership (NFP). NFP has approximately 260 sites across the United States; 1000 to 1600 pregnant first-
time mothers enroll per month, before their third trimester and receive regular visits (frequency varies by
developmental stage: weekly to monthly) from nurses during pregnancy through the child’s second birthday.
The NFP National Service Office collects data on all enrolled families both at intake and at defined time points
regarding visits, screenings, and outcomes (including maternal and child health). We have previously worked
with these data and are well-positioned to access and analyze them. Our estimated sample size for the primary
aim is 3000 families per group. This will allow sufficient power to conduct regression analyses, controlling for
family, program site, and community characteristics. This project will provide critical new knowledge about the
importance of starting the home visiting relationship in person vs. through teleHV. This knowledge will help
home visiting programs better utilize teleHV in the future, resulting in better outcomes for the families served in
these circumstances, including reductions in health inequities."
10893591,"During embryonic and fetal stages, the kidneys develop millions of nephrons that generate highly specialized
cells. These cells ensure that blood flowing into the kidney is filtered and required substances are reabsorbed
while unwanted metabolites and solutes are led to the bladder for excretion. Birth defects are common in the
kidney, ~ 1/100 of all births have a so-called Congenital Anomaly of the Kidney and Urinary Tract (CAKUT). At
the most severe end of CAKUT, newborns are missing kidney functionality, and their life expectancy is less than
one year. Most abnormalities have no current effective interventions and genetic changes lack context. There is
thus a critical need to understand where developmental defects arise and to generate new therapies restoring
or replacing kidney function. In our work we have used single cell omics and molecular characterizations of
human and mouse kidneys to provide a blueprint for how nephrons form and maps for to replicate this in human
stem cell-derived kidney organoids. In doing so we provide a genetic and developmental context to genes
identified in CAKUT patients. In this proposal we will follow these leads and address three outstanding questions
in developmental nephrology. In Aim 1, we investigate the embryonic origins of distal nephron tubule segments.
We will perform the first single cell omic analysis linking developing and adult kidneys. This provides a roadmap
for how cells differentiate. We will use new genetic mouse lineage-tracing tools to test how cells in the early distal
nephron relate to functional cells in mature kidneys. These experiments will map where genes are required as
the nephron develops. In Aim 2, we will investigate how proteins that turn genes on and off control the
development of the distal nephron. We will use a technique called Cut&Run to analyze how genes often mutated
in CAKUT, control DNA and gene expression. We will also activate signaling pathways and alter the expression
of genes linked to CAKUT. This will allow us to directly study how distal nephron cells form provide causality
between gene expression and regulation. We will use our new system to generate hundreds of nephrons from
human stem cells in - synchronized nephroids. In this system, nephrons develop at the same time and pace,
unlike in the body where nephrons from many developmental stages form near each other. Our system provides
a unique advantage to study, manipulate, and isolate cells from nephrons at the same developmental stage. The
data we collect will show how genes are activated. In Aim 3 we address a fundamental question in developmental
nephrology - how is the nephron initially patterned? To do this we will use synthetic cellular organizers that
secrete signaling proteins to pattern our synchronized nephroids. We will study how signal ligands control
nephron formation and patterning. This also has a practical application as we can gain control over nephroid
patterning. Our system will inform our efforts to build massive parallel arrays of nephroids for replacement
therapies and disease modeling. A strength of the proposal is the unique expertise intersecting human and
mouse kidney genetics, a novel system of stem cell derived kidney organoids, and synthetic biology."
10719238,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Models of alcohol use disorder (AUD) risk increasingly conceptualize relationship factors as being critical to the
understanding of problem drinking. A substantial literature exists linking low relationship quality (e.g., partner conflict,
relationship dissatisfaction, insecure attachment) to the development of AUD, and interventions focused on improving
relationship quality have demonstrated some success. However, we lack an understanding of how and why low
relationship quality shapes AUD risk over time. A better understanding of such mechanisms could have broad
implications for understanding AUD risk in close relationships more generally. The proposed project merges insights
from the alcohol administration literature and research conducted by social psychologists with expertise in close
relationships to offer a novel conceptual model that depicts how poor relationship quality impacts the way that couples
experience alcohol, which in turn sets them on a path toward heavier alcohol consumption and the development of AUD
symptoms. More specifically, we predict that couples with low (vs. high) relationship quality experience heightened
alcohol-induced social bonding and emotional rewards compared to couples with high relationship quality, and that this
increased sensitivity to alcohol’s social and emotional rewards in couples with low relationship quality is a key
mechanism that drives problematic drinking over time, which then increases risk for AUD. Two-hundred-ten couples
(N=420 young adult heavy drinkers; aged 21-30) will drink together over 36-min a moderate dose of alcohol (males: 0.82
g/kg; females: 0.74 g/kg) or a placebo beverage. Alcohol reinforcement (e.g., social bonding, reduced social tension) will
be assessed during a free interaction period and a conflict resolution discussion using a broad range of measures across
multiple response systems (e.g., self-reports, observational measures). Drinking behavior, alcohol reinforcement, acute
alcohol-related problems, and relationship functioning will be assessed in daily life during three subsequent ecological
momentary assessment bursts, and AUD symptoms will be assessed at baseline and at 12-month follow-up.
 We predict 1) an alcohol by relationship quality interaction, such that alcohol’s social and emotional reinforcing
effects at the individual and dyad-levels, measured across multiple response systems, will be stronger in low (vs. high) RQ
couples, 2) alcohol’s social and emotional reinforcing effects in real-world contexts will vary across couples as a function
of the blood alcohol curve (BAC) and partner drinking status, such that couples with low (vs. high) RQ will experience
stronger reinforcing effects on the ascending limb of the BAC when both members are drinking together (vs. when
couples are together but only one member is drinking), 3) higher alcohol reinforcement on the ascending limb of the BAC
will predict heavier alcohol consumption and more acute alcohol problems (both within-person and across-partners), and
4) lab-based and real-world measures of alcohol reinforcement will prospectively predict heavier drinking and more AUD
symptoms at 12-month follow-up, particularly for low RQ couples. This project integrates two prominent literatures that
have not been connected before (i.e., social psychological theory and research in couples with longitudinal alcohol
administration work) and promises to have broad conceptual, methodological, and clinical implications."

GABAergic inhibitory interneurons (INs) are a diverse group of neurons with critical roles in sculpting the
spatiotemporal aspects of circuit activity and signal processing in the cerebral cortex. Moreover, malfunction of
these neurons has been implicated in a number of diseases ranging from epilepsy to schizophrenia, anxiety
disorders and autism. This project is focused on the GABAergic INs that express the neuropeptide vasoactive
intestinal peptide (VIP). VIP INs are the main IN population in the superficial layers of the cortex, and were
recently found to be major targets of cotico-cortical and thalamocortical projections, as well as cholinergic
projections, that mediate top-down or contextual sensory processing and to mainly target inhibitory somatostatin
(SST) INs. Based on this connectivity and the analysis of their patterns of in vivo activity in multiple types of
sensory cortices, these studies have suggested that VIP INs mediate a disinhibitory canonical circuit that is
important in brain state-dependent control of cortical function. VIP INs have been implicated in arousal, attention,
sensory processing and synaptic plasticity and learning. Furthermore, several studies have implicated VIP INs
in schizophrenia and in the cognitive deficits associated with childhood epilepsy. Recent work shows that VIP
INs are diverse. We show they consist of at least three distinct populations with different laminar distribution, as
well as different morphology and potentially different afferent and efferent connectivity, suggesting distinct
inhibitory and disinhibitory actions on pyramidal neurons. The data implies that to discover the circuit
mechanisms by which VIP INs regulate specific cortical functions and the mechanisms by which they cause
disease it is necessary to understand the differential connectivity and function of VIP IN subtypes. This
application uses state-of-the-art electrophysiological and optogenetic methods as well as innovative
intersectional genetic strategies to identify and manipulate specific VIP IN subtypes to understand their efferent
(Aim 1) and afferent connectivity (Aim 2). In Aim 3 we use 2-photon Ca2+ imaging, optogenetic and
pharmacogenetic manipulations in awake behaving mice to discover how VIP IN subtypes regulate the effects
of arousal on cortical functional reorganization and sensory processing. These studies will advance our
understanding of VIP IN function and the mechanisms of top down modulation of sensory processing."
10872235,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute liver injury caused by overdose of the pain medication acetaminophen (APAP) is a leading cause of
acute liver injury in the United States. In many cases, a failure of liver repair causes acute liver injury to persist
and this can progress to acute liver failure (ALF). Acute liver injury and ALF have a poor prognosis and little
therapeutic options beyond intensive care. Over the past decade, several studies have highlighted how
changes in the hemostatic system are connected to the progression of ALF. For example, an unbalance in the
platelet adhesive protein von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and its primary regulatory enzyme ADAMTS13 have
been identified as unique indicators of increased risk for liver transplant and death in patients with ALF. Our
published studies indicate that VWF inhibits repair of the APAP-injured liver. Strong preliminary results using
mice with deficiencies in VWF or ADAMTS13, leading-edge VWF-targeted therapeutics, and human ALF
samples suggest that VWF inhibits the resolution of APAP-induced liver injury. Based on our published and
preliminary studies, our central hypothesis is that hepatic VWF deposition inhibits the resolution of APAP-
induced liver injury through formation of intrahepatic VWF-platelet microthrombi. Our approach includes
genetically-modified mice, VWF-targeted molecules in clinical development, novel molecules designed to hold
VWF in a resting state, and novel VWF-targeted thrombolytic drugs. These studies are closely aligned with
creative analyses in which we seek to uncover VWF-focused biomarkers as novel biomarkers of liver repair
and outcome in samples from a large, well-characterized cohort provided by the ALF Study Group. The
investigative team represents an optimal pairing of experts on hemostasis and liver disease, experts on VWF
and thrombolysis, and highly collaborative physician-scientists, increasing the impact of our studies and
potential for translation. Our proposed studies will determine the role of ADAMTS13 and VWF multimer size in
APAP-induced liver injury and repair (Aim 1), determine the mechanisms linking VWF to inhibition liver repair
after APAP challenge (Aim 2), and identify strategies to accelerate degradation of pathologic VWF deposits to
enhance repair of the APAP-injured liver (Aim 3). The expected outcome of these Specific Aims is the
discovery of novel mechanisms whereby VWF inhibits repair of the injured liver. This outcome would make a
significant impact on the field because it would deliver novel mechanistic details for clinical associations
between VWF and poor outcome in acute liver injury. The proposed studies are transformative and anticipated
to deliver clinically applicable strategies to accelerate repair of the liver, owing to a strong combination of
experimental and translational science backed by a team with clinical and basic research expertise."
10929460,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In 2020, 28.3 million Americans experienced an alcohol use disorder (AUD); yet only 25% of these people
received treatment. During the pandemic, 60% of patients with a substance use disorder reported receiving
telehealth-based care for their addiction. The pivot to telehealth provides an opportunity to overcome the barriers
to access and retention that affect in-person care (e.g., inconvenience, stigma). In contingency management
(CM), people receive tangible reinforcers in exchange for submitting biological samples to verify abstinence. CM
is ideal for telehealth delivery and initial studies of telehealth models demonstrated reductions in alcohol use. At
the same time, these models have limitations. They require wearing a transdermal monitor or submitting multiple
breath samples daily. As a result, these approaches are costly, burdensome, and stigmatizing which limits their
feasibility. In part due to limitations of these biomarkers, current CM models are brief, averaging about 12 weeks,
despite evidence suggesting that longer CM interventions result in better post-treatment outcomes. Therefore,
the overall objective of our program of research is to utilize phosphatidylethanol (PEth), a blood-based biomarker
that can detect alcohol use for up to 28 days to deliver a feasible telehealth-based 26-week CM intervention. In
a pilot trial, we developed a telehealth-based PEth CM intervention where participants used a medical device,
the TASSO-M20 to self-collect blood for PEth testing under the observation of research staff over Zoom. This
intervention used a two-phase approach where the frequency of PEth testing and reinforcement was decreased
from once a week, to as infrequently as every four weeks once participants achieved a PEth level consistent
with two to four weeks of abstinence (< 20 ng/mL). Seventy-one percent of CM participants achieved >4 weeks
of abstinence versus 21% of the treatment as usual (TAU) group, and 43% of CM participants achieved >24
weeks of abstinence compared to 0% of the TAU group (p < 0.05). Based on these promising results, we now
propose to test our telehealth PEth-based CM model in a sample of adults with AUD (n=200), recruited via online
platforms by randomizing individuals to six months of 1) an online cognitive behavioral therapy for AUD
(CBT4CBT) and telehealth PEth-based CM (CM condition) or 2) CBT4CBT and reinforcers for submitting blood
samples (no abstinence required) (control condition). We will assess group differences in PEth-defined
abstinence and regular excessive drinking (PEth ³ 200 ng/mL), and alcohol-related harms (e.g., smoking, drug
use). We will address important gaps in CM research by assessing outcomes during a 12-month follow-up, which
is much longer than most previous CM studies; using a conceptual model to identify predictors of post-treatment
abstinence. The primary barrier to the dissemination of our model is the cost of PEth testing and CM reinforcers.
We will conduct an economic analysis to place these costs in the context of downstream CM-associated cost-
offsets and improvements in personal and public health. If our model increases alcohol abstinence and is cost-
effective it could reach millions of Americans with AUD that cannot or do not seek in-person care."
10877936,"Project Summary: Measuring and Predicting Appropriate Antibiotic Use to Combat Resistant Bacteria
 Antimicrobial resistant infections already cause over 2.8 million illnesses and 24,000 deaths per year in
the US alone. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identify antibiotic prescribing
stewardship as the most important action to slow resistant infections.
 Our objective is to produce the methods for clinical decision support systems to reduce both over and
under use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. We will test novel methods to measure and predict better antibiotic
choices on urinary tract infections (UTIs), the most common human bacterial infection that accounts for 25-
50% of antibiotic prescriptions with resistance already exceeding 20% for common antibiotics.
 The key challenge is that prescriptions for antibiotics are almost always guesses before definitive test
results are available. This actionable, arbitrary, and ascertainable process where an important decision
(antibiotic prescribing) depends on humans predicting a verifiable result (diagnostic culture results) is ideally
suited for innovative machine learning that can produce Personalized Antibiograms that predict antibiotic
susceptibility for individuals based on patterns learned from large collections of prior examples.
 Major scientific barriers to progress in combating antibiotic resistant bacteria include the limited
personalization of conventional tools for prescribing guidance, overly optimistic retrospective evaluations of
predictive models, and the lack of measures for effective diagnostic antibiotic prescribing decisions. With the
combined expertise of our multi-site team (Stanford, UT Southwestern, Harvard), we will overcome these
barriers and achieve the objectives of this proposal through the following aims:
(1a) Multi-site data harmonization and sharing of electronic health records for suspected UTIs
(1b) Develop and validate Personalized Antibiogram prediction models for microbial culture results
(2) Prospective validation of antibiogram models with real-time electronic health record integration
(3) Develop and validate automated methods for electronic phenotyping UTIs
(4) Develop and validate a measure of antibiotic appropriateness and desirability"
10900461,"Summary
 Heart failure (HF) is a major cardiac syndrome with high mortality and morbidity. Yet therapeutic options
that primarily target failing heart muscle are lacking. The typical pathophysiology of failing cardiomyocytes is
weakened calcium transients due to abnormal systolic calcium release from calcium channel and ryanodine
receptor dyads and impaired diastolic removal due to altered SERCA2a activity. Impaired activity of the calcium
handling proteins is linked to pathologic remodeling of t-tubules (TT) during heart failure. Specifically, during HF,
TT microdomains are lost, with consequent disruption of the calcium handling machinery.
 We recently identified that a therapeutic target may exist in the calcium regulating cardiac bridging inte-
grator 1 (cBIN1) which organizes TT microdomains. Exogenous cBIN1 therapy rescues HF in rodents. The over-
all objective in this proposal is to identify whether the cBIN1-microdomain targeting gene therapy can be trans-
lated to a large animal model of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Our central hypothesis is that cBIN1-microdo-
mains are disrupted in a minipig model of chronic ventricular pacing-induced HF, which can be recovered by
cBIN1 gene therapy for rescue cardiomyocyte microanatomy as well as cardiac function.
 Two aims are proposed to first explore abnormal remodeling of subcellular organelle and microdomains
in failing cardiomyocytes from minipig hearts failing from pacing-induced HF. Using biochemical and imaging
tools, we will also determine the critical pathophysiological point of myocardial remodeling at which HF progres-
sion is irreversible. The second aim is proposed to study the efficacy of adeno associated virus 9 (AAV9)-
transduced exogenous cBIN1 in rescuing myocardial dysfunction and HF progression. The minipig model of non-
ischemic cardiomyopathy will be used to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of AAV9-cBIN1 gene therapy. Our
preliminary data are striking that a single low dose of intravenous injection of AAV9-cBIN1 can fully
normalize ejection fraction and induce reverse remodelling of dilated ventricles in minipigs with heart
failure. Building on these preliminary studies, we will evaluate cBIN1 gene therapy in rescuing HF by monitoring
echocardiography recordings, hemodynamics, systemic symptoms, and blood available markers, as well as sub-
cellular organization of the TT membrane and the calcium handling machinery.
 Our contribution here is expected to identify whether and how cBIN1-microdomains are critical for cardiac
function in failing minipig hearts. This contribution is significant because it will introduce a new HF therapeutic,
which corrects calcium signaling abnormalities through preservation of cBIN1-microdomains at TT membrane.
The proposed research is innovative because it introduces a new class of cardiac muscle specific therapy that
will improve cardiac inotropy, cardiac lusitropy, and patient mortality."

Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Patients are treated with clot-busting drugs
(thrombolytic therapy) or the artery is reopened with a catheter (percutaneous coronary intervention), but,
paradoxically, restoration of blood flow to the heart muscle can cause additional injury that limits the success of
these procedures. Reperfusion injury appears to be a cascade of events, initiated by coronary artery
extravasation (hemorrhage), culminating in a failure to restore myocardial perfusion and leading to cell death
among viable cardiomyocytes in the peri-infarct region. It may be a predictor of long-term adverse clinical
outcomes or provide a therapy-modifiable target in patients with myocardial infarction. Imaging methods
specific to the molecular mechanisms of reperfusion injury would improve clinical care and our scientific
understanding of this disease. We hypothesize that iron is a catalyst for reactive oxygen species production in
reperfused myocardial infarction. We propose a series of experiments to investigate the association between
iron and reactive oxygen species using iron-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission
tomography. We will validate these in vivo non-invasive imaging modalities with a battery of pathology,
immunohistochemistry, and spectrometry techniques in a large animal model. In Aim 1, we will investigate the
association between reactive oxygen species, iron and severity of infarction using MRI and PET. In Aim 2, we
will determine the extent of association between imaging markers of reperfusion injury and remodeling of the
left ventricle weeks after injury. This study will give a new understanding of the spatiotemporal relationships of
reactive oxygen species in the sub-acute and chronic period of myocardial infarction wound healing. This will
lead to studies in large animal models and humans that can evaluate therapies targeting imaging biomarkers of
reperfusion injury."
10912758,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The UCSF Center for Aging in Diverse Communities (CADC) Analysis Core (AnC), funded since 1997, has
been active in national efforts to advance and propagate methods for conducting health disparities and health
equity research in older adult populations. Specializing in measurement, behavioral interventions, study
design, and statistical and data analysis methods, we have provided methodological training and hands-on
mentoring to numerous early-career investigators (CADC Scientists) and disseminated methodological
resources via publications and the CADC website. To move the field of aging-related health disparities
research forward, identifying the key determinants of health disparities and their mechanisms at multiple levels
is a crucial priority and critical to achieve health equity. Thus, we need to build the capacity of CADC Scientists
in general and specialized methods to explicate health disparities determinants and mechanisms, design and
implement interventions, and ultimately accelerate health equity. Because the complexity and diversity of data
sources and methods in aging-related health disparities research are accelerating, it can be difficult for our
Scientists to identify, select, and develop capacity in these general and specialized methods. The overarching
objective of the CADC AnC is to continue to maximize the scientific rigor of the research conducted by our
Scientists by promoting use of optimal methods and cutting-edge tools. While focusing on our Scientists’ pilot
projects, we will simultaneously help them plan next steps (e.g., NIH proposals to support the next stage of
their research). Given the wide array of health disparities research methods, our team-based training approach
will draw on the complementary expertise of the Scientists, their CADC and non-CADC content mentors, the
AnC, and other experts to optimally build Scientists’ research methods capacity tailored to the Scientists’
programs of aging-related health disparities research. Our specific aims are to: 1) provide group-based training
on topics all Scientists should know regardless of their pilot study methods, including (a) established methods
for aging-related health disparities research, (b) use of publicly-available datasets, and (c) relevant NIH
policies; 2) provide individualized training using a team-based strategy by: (a) determining each Scientist’s
needs for general and specialized methods tailored to their pilot and subsequent research and (b) creating and
implementing a customized training and mentoring plan to meet those needs; and 3) continue to develop
methodological resources to promote and build capacity in utilizing optimal methods in aging-related health
disparities research, and disseminate them through publications and our website. By providing methodological
training/mentoring and consultation, we will increase Scientists’ capacity to conduct rigorous aging-related
health disparities research. By disseminating new methodological resources, we will increase national capacity
to understand mechanisms of health disparities in older adults and develop interventions to achieve equity."
10912759,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – RESEARCH EDUCATION COMPONENT (REC)
A priority of the 2020 National Institute on Aging report, Strategic Directions for Research 2020-2025, is to
“attract and train more researchers from diverse scientific and cultural backgrounds”. Since 1997, the Center
for Aging in Diverse Communities (CADC) at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) has been
refining its highly successful mentoring program to increase the number of very skilled, early-stage diverse
investigators with successful and sustained careers in health disparities research with older populations (aging-
related health disparities research). The primary role of CADC’s REC is to provide comprehensive mentoring,
education and training, and career development to diverse scientists focused on the CADC research theme of
understanding the multilevel social and behavioral mechanisms of health disparities that impact older adults
and developing community and practice-based interventions to achieve health equity. We do this under the
scientific leadership and coordination of the Leadership Administrative Core (LAC), and in collaboration with
the Analysis Core (AnC). During the 2018-2023 cycle, CADC’s REC has mentored 20 CADC Scientists (19
pilot and one Diversity Supplement recipient). Since becoming CADC Scientists, those 20 investigators have
made significant contributions to aging-related health disparities research by publishing 196 articles (87 or 44%
as first or last author) and securing 52 new grants as PI or MPI. In this proposed renewal the 9 CADC Mentor
Faculty (including 4 alumni CADC Scientists) collectively have decades of aging-related health disparities
research experience and a robust track record of mentoring diverse early-stage investigators in establishing
sustained research careers. The CADC REC proposes the following specific aims: 1) select 3-4 CADC
Scientists per year from diverse backgrounds who have proposed innovative pilot research projects focused on
the research theme of the Center; 2) deliver our comprehensive mentoring program to CADC Scientists to help
them develop independent, sustained careers in aging-related health disparities research; and 3) deliver a
robust education program to our CADC Scientists focused on research topics and methods relevant to aging-
related health disparities research. To achieve these aims, two alumni CADC Scientists (from 2018-2023
cycle) joining our faculty will enhance our program by further diversifying CADC’s faculty and leadership, and
through near-peer mentorship to our Scientists. We will expand the REC’s reach via an affiliation with Hispanic
serving University of California Merced (UCM), deepen collaborations with synergistic NIH supported aging-
related centers and programs at UCSF, and create additional mentorship, educational, and networking
opportunities for CADC Scientists during our new annual retreat, and through our innovative Mentor Resource
Group, comprising highly experienced aging-researchers from across UCSF. Through comprehensive
mentorship, robust education and innovation, CADC’s REC will build on its already strong record of promoting
research workforce diversity, with the goal of meeting the needs of aging populations to achieve health equity."
10912797,"PROJECT SUMMARY—OVERALL COMPONENT
The goal of the NIA’s RCMAR program is to mentor promising scientists from diverse backgrounds, including
individuals from underrepresented groups in the biomedical sciences for sustained and impactful behavioral
and social science research careers focused on aging, health disparities of older adults, and AD-related
dementias (ADRD). The Stanford Aging and Ethnogeriatrics (SAGE) Center (RCMAR) was founded in 2018 to
advance research on health disparities of older adults, especially those from communities of color, using
innovative methodologies and culturally respectful approaches. Guided by our multi-stakeholder advisory
board, we successfully expanded our RCMAR into the multi-organizational Longevity, Equity, and Aging,
Research Network (L.E.A.R.N) Consortium, which now includes Stanford University, the Minority Serving
Institutions—Palo Alto University (PAU) and San Jose State University (SJSU)—the VA Palo Alto Health Care
System (VAPAHCS), and several community partners. Goals: (i) increase the diversity of the aging research
workforce by recruiting, retaining, and mentoring new leaders in ethnogeriatrics disparities research and (ii)
promote new advances and culturally respectful methodologies in biobehavioral and social sciences research
on aging with minority older adults. By providing pilot funds, methodological and recruitment support, ongoing
mentoring, and numerous leadership and professional development opportunities, we will advance the
research careers of our early career RCMAR Scientists and create a diverse research workforce focused on
promoting equity in healthcare and mitigating disparities faced by multicultural older populations. Specific Aims:
1) Further develop and enhance research infrastructure needed to conduct bio-psycho-socio-cultural research
to mitigate health disparities and advance the health of diverse older adults; 2) Conduct innovative research
using data science and other cutting-edge methodologies and encompassing multiple domains (e.g., bio-
behavioral, physical, sociocultural, and healthcare system) and levels of influence (e.g., individual,
interpersonal, community, and societal) to inform development of effective strategies to mitigate disparities; 3)
Develop, implement, evaluate, and disseminate culturally respectful methodologies to measure social,
behavioral, and cultural factors impacting the health of minority older adults; and 4) Expand the L.E.A.R.N
Consortium, broaden existing and forge new partnerships with Minority Serving Institutions (MSI), and
collaborate with them to recruit, mentor, retain, and support diverse investigators focused on ethnogeriatric
health disparities research. “Ethnogeriatric health disparities research” is the backbone of our RCMAR and
directly aligns with Goal F of the 2020-2025 NIA Strategic Plan. We also specifically seek (i) to foster the
development of research and clinician scientists in aging, (ii) provide ethnogeriatrics research resources, (iii)
support and conduct biobehavioral, sociocultural research on aging (Goal B), and (iv) attract and train more
researchers from diverse scientific and cultural backgrounds (Strategic Goal G-4)."

The theme of the UCSF OAIC is ""Predictors, Outcomes, and Amelioration of Late-life Disability: A Focus on
Vulnerable Populations."" We are dedicated to better understanding and addressing late-life disability in
vulnerable populations - vulnerable due to either medical vulnerabilities (such as cancer with comorbid lung
disease and cognitive impairment) or to social vulnerabilities (such as isolation, poverty, and other forms of
social disadvantage). During our second cycle, the UCSF OAIC successfully expanded the work and impact of
our programs, creating a dynamic and collaborative center that has made key contributions to science and
investigator development in our thematic niche. In our third cycle, we will continue to build the people and
programs that are shifting paradigms in aging and improving clinical care.
The LAC is the glue that coordinates the OAIC Cores and maintains collaboration and will continue its focus on
tangible metrics of research productivity: publications in high impact journals and new NIH funding. To achieve
these goals, we have identified nine specific aims. They allow the Center to excel in its mission of developing
superb investigators and supporting the highest-quality science. Our aims also focus on building partnerships
with other programs at UCSF such as our CTSI, RCMAR, and ADRC and with the national OAIC network.
The LAC has the following Specific Aims:
 1. To provide leadership, direction, and coordination across OAIC Cores
 2. To provide day-to-day management of the UCSF OAIC, including administrative tasks such as the
 annual progress report and communications with the OAIC Coordinating Center.
 3. To manage fiscal matters, review use of Core resources, and make reallocation decisions.
 4. To lead outreach efforts, linking the OAIC with other UCSF centers and the national OAIC network.
 5. To assess opportunities for new uses of Core resources, with special consideration of opportunities for
 translation between clinical research, practice, and policy.
 6. To assess and plan areas of collaboration among UCSF OAIC Cores and with other OAICs.
 7. To solicit, review, and fund proposals for REC, PESC, and DP awards in collaboration with relevant
Cores.
 8. To organize activities of UCSF OAIC advisory boards and review panels.
 9. To monitor Core progress and implement necessary remediation.
LAC Leaders Drs. Covinsky and Steinman will foster a mission-driven culture of excellence, achievement,
intellectual generosity, and collaboration, pushing the UCSF OAIC team to support research that translates into
better care for vulnerable older adults."
10916483,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT – Data and Analysis Core (DAC)
Research on function and disability in vulnerable older adults involves methodological and analytical
challenges. Addressing these challenges often requires specialized expertise and approaches, including
methods for working with data ranging from small, specialized datasets to complex national datasets;
developing tailored approaches to analyzing longitudinal, repeated measures; managing complex and
informative missing data mechanisms; addressing competing risks; and controlling for multilayered
confounding in predictor-outcome relationships. It also requires a deep understanding of measurement,
including the many ways in which disability and function can be measured and how these measures relate to
underlying constructs of function and disability. The Data and Analysis Core (DAC) will build upon its history of
success by serving as a hub of expertise and support in these areas and assisting the research design and
analytic needs of OAIC-affiliated investigators. We will focus on two areas that have emerged as central pillars
of our past successes. First, we aim to provide world-class statistical and methodologic consultation and direct
analytic support to OAIC-affiliated investigators, with a major focus on study design, measurement, and the
special analytic considerations that arise in quantitative studies of function and disability in vulnerable older
adults. Second, we will provide expert consultation and direct support for secondary data analysis studies
using high-value national datasets including the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), National Health and
Aging Trends Study (NHATS), national Medicare data including the Minimum Data Set (MDS), and national VA
data. In addition to continuing our established programs in these areas, we seek to innovate and grow to
address the evolving landscape of aging research and the needs of investigators working in this field. Areas of
growth include enhanced focus on thoughtfully addressing race, ethnicity, and other important socioeconomic
features in study focus, design, and analyses; expanding opportunities to incorporate physical performance,
biomarker, and genetic data into research using high-value datasets such as the Health and Retirement Study;
expanding capacity for analysis of national Medicare data and of UCSF electronic health record data; and
addressing important opportunities and analytic challenges that have arisen from the COVID pandemic.
Our specific aims are: (1) To provide statistical consultation and direct analytic support for OAIC-affiliated
research, particularly for pilot, research career development, External Project, and Development Project
investigators; (2) To provide consultation on study design and measurement issues for OAIC-affiliated
research, particularly for pilot, research career development, External Project, and Development Project
investigators; (3) To promote and support research on function and disability using high-value national
datasets; and (4) To support Development Projects that conduct novel methodologic research that advances
the science of studying function and disability in vulnerable older adults."
10916485,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT — Vulnerable Aging Research Core (VARC)
The Vulnerable Aging Research Core (VARC) supports OAIC investigators conducting primary data collection
studies that include vulnerable older adults. Older adults are vastly underrepresented in research. This
underrepresentation is even more pronounced for older adults with medical vulnerability (e.g., cognitive
impairment and complex multi-morbidity) and/or social vulnerability (e.g., isolation, poverty, limited health
literacy, homelessness). These medical and social vulnerabilities often coexist and interact to produce
profound effects on disease incidence, progression, outcomes, and response to health interventions. Yet, older
adults with these vulnerabilities are often difficult to recruit and retain, adversely affecting their representation
in research and impairing our knowledge of how best to optimize their care. The UCSF Pepper Center has an
international reputation for expertise in the recruitment, retention, and protection of medically and socially
vulnerable older adults in research including in community-engaged research, prospective studies, and
randomized trials. Since the VARC's inception last cycle, the number of OAIC investigators engaged in primary
data collection of medically and socially vulnerable older adults has continued to grow exponentially, as have
the services we provide to investigators. We propose the following aims: (1) Provide expert consultation for
the design of primary data collection studies that focus on older adults with medical and/or social
vulnerabilities, including human subject considerations; (2) Support OAIC-affiliated investigators on methods
for recruiting, consenting, enrolling, and retaining vulnerable older adults, including convening and maintaining
community advisory boards; (3) Support OAIC investigators on methods to develop and test interventions that
are responsive to the needs and priorities of vulnerable older adults; (4) Advise on the incorporation of
predictor and outcome measures of medical and social vulnerability (e.g., cognitive impairment, frailty, health
literacy, poverty, social isolation) in collaboration with the Data and Analysis Core; and (5) Support
Development Projects that advance the development of new methodologies in our Core's theme area. We
propose a novel Development Project to develop innovative methods for merging qualitative and mixed
methods data across studies involving older adults with disability and their care partners and clinicians. The
VARC will also support stellar external investigators whose research involves recruiting and retaining
vulnerable older adults. Proposed external projects include NIA-funded studies exploring barriers to long-term
social support services for older adults with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias and the effects of a
novel decision support tool to help older adults discuss diabetes medication deprescribing with clinicians."

AD/ADRD-relevant research to support diverse early career researchers and mid-career scientists newly
transitioning into AD/ADRD-relevant research carrying out research of high quality intended to prevent
cognitive and functional decline in minority older adults and reduce racial disparities of AD/ADRD. The faculty
of this AD-RCMAR are from the Johns Hopkins Schools of Public Health, Nursing, and Medicine, Morgan State
University, and Hampton University and have decades of experience working with African American, Hispanic,
and Asian American older adults, and the community organizations that serve them. All are nationally
recognized mentors with substantial experience training under-represented minority scholars. The overall aims
for this renewal application of the Leadership and Administrative Core (LAC) are to provide governance and
administration of the Center, to facilitate the training and development of RCMAR Scientists from
underrepresented backgrounds, and to advance the field of minority aging research on AD/ADRD. The LAC
will provide essential leadership and structure for this AD-RCMAR and its mentoring, data collection, analysis,

on our world-class biostatistics environment at Johns Hopkins, we have expanded our methodological
expertise to include mixed methods and qualitative approaches to better encompass translational studies (e.g.,
intervention development) and implementation research, as well as observational studies of risk factors and
functional and cognitive trajectories. While quantitative approaches can characterize and measure outcomes,
the use of mixed methods and qualitative approaches can complement statistical analyses to identify
unmeasured factors that might be associated with how an individual responds to interventions or to how to
better accommodate diverse needs and circumstances through tailoring interventions. Under the direction of
the Leadership and Administrative Core (LAC), and in close collaboration with the Research Education
Component (REC) and the Community-Liaison and Recruitment Core (CLRC), the AnC aims to provide
methodological expertise in support of the conceptualization, design, implementation, analysis, and
interpretation of research relevant to the work of the RCMAR Scientists; provide access to modern data
acquisition and management tools and emerging computing technologies by capitalizing on the existing IT
infrastructure at the Johns Hopkins Center on Aging and Health; and provide mentoring to junior faculty
supported by the REC, with the goals of maximizing their skills in study design, data analysis, effective

with the CLRC and Johns Hopkins OAIC to increase study recruitment and retention of older adults from
under-represented backgrounds. We have a critical mass of dedicated expertise, infrastructure, and staffing to
support the proposed studies in our AD-RCMAR. The interdisciplinary relationships that we have built with the
gerontologic scientists at Johns Hopkins through years of collaboration in gerontology, and our track record of

epidemiology of dementia and development, testing, and implementation of novel interventions for diverse
minority older adults and care providers to enhance health and functioning. Mentoring relationships include
early-career researchers and/or mid-career scientists newly transitioning into AD/ADRD research focusing on

out a plan to assure successful mentoring of, and collaboration with, diverse researchers pursuing careers in
the focused area of this AD-RCMAR: novel approaches to enhance and maintain cognitive health and function
and reduce AD/ADRD dementia risk among minority older adults. Our REC is structured to mentor JHAD-
RCMAR Scientists to be successful with developing and carrying out pilot projects and includes structured
longitudinal mentorship for RCMAR Scientists, which will support independent, NIA-funded research careers
focused on health disparities and AD/ADRD research among older adults, particularly minority older adults.
The REC will also develop and maintain a process for facilitating and tracking the evolution of scientists from
pilot to independent investigators, and evaluation of the REC, by collaborating with the National Coordinating
Center and participating in an annual reporting procedure. To accomplish the specific aims, the REC will
maintain the infrastructure necessary to recruit, develop, and support under-represented minority investigators.
This yields a more diverse biomedical workforce by building the capacity of a cadre of new investigators from
under-represented backgrounds who are committed to a research portfolio focused on health disparities and
minority aging research as it relates to AD/ADRD. This goal will be largely achieved by cultivating cutting edge
pilot studies that will lead to a greater understanding of health disparities in AD/ADRD, and AD/ADRD among
populations of under-represented groups."

point for P01 investigators to draw statistical and bioinformatics expertise for the design and analysis of their
research projects as well as for staffing support to execute the planned studies. Core C will enable a deep, multi-
model understanding to help identify cellular and/or spatial signatures that can predict or inform mechanisms of
interventional efficacy against HIV viral reservoirs. The Specific Aims of the Core are to: 1) use established
computational methods to power, quality control, and analyze bulk/single-cell genomics data; 2) use established
computational methods to quality control and analyze spatial-omics data; and 3) Cross-platform and -species
integration of single-cell and spatial-omics data for identifying predictive features of HIV interventional efficacy.
Core C members will be involved in all Projects at every research stage. As the Projects yield results, the Core
will conduct data analyses, prepare any necessary reports, and assist investigators with the preparation of
presentations and manuscripts. Core C will be co-led by Drs. Qin Ma (Ohio State University), Sizun Jiang
(Harvard Medical School), Alex K. Shalek (MIT/Ragon Institute/Broad Institute), and Dongjun Chung (Ohio
State University). All Core members have extensive experience in applied biostatistics and bioinformatics
methods for serology, bulk, single-cell, and spatial multi-omics data. They will work closely with other cores (e.g.,
Multi-omics Core) for seamless integration of all aspects of this innovative P01 project. Specifically, Drs. Ma
and Shalek will oversee bulk and single-cell related data analyses, Drs. Jiang and Ma will oversee spatial omics
data analysis (including CODEX and CosMX), and Dr. Chung will oversee the statistical and power analyses.
Moreover, the integrative analysis of single-cell and spatial-omics data will be collaboratively overseen by all
members. In summary, Core C will ensure rigor and reproducibility by applying accepted and appropriate
statistical and bioinformatics methods to data analysis, by clearly describing methodology, rationale, and
interpretations in reports and manuscripts, and by openly sharing research results and data."
10886131,"SUMMARY
Accumulating data suggests that administration of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) in ART-suppressed,
SHIV-infected nonhuman primates (NHPs) and HIV-1-infected humans can delay viral rebound following ART
discontinuation. However, the mechanism underlying the efficacy of bNAbs remains to be determined. Multiple
mechanisms may contribute to the effectiveness of bNAbs in delaying viral rebound, including direct antiviral
activity against replicating virus, targeting of the replication-competent viral reservoir, and indirect effects such
as augmenting cellular immune responses via the “vaccinal” effect. Understanding the mechanism of action
underlying bNAb efficacy will lead to optimization of these and other HIV-1 cure strategies.
In Project 1, we hypothesize that bNAbs can directly target the viral reservoir in addition to providing
direct antiviral effects, both of which contribute to the observed long-term virologic control following
ART discontinuation. An alternative hypothesis is that bNAbs contribute to long-term antiviral efficacy
by modulating host cellular immunity via the vaccinal effect. To evaluate these hypotheses, we propose
two Specific Aims:
Aim 1. To determine multi-omics correlates of bNAb based virologic control in HIV-1-infected humans.
We will perform a comprehensive virologic, immunologic, and multi-omics analysis of existing clinical specimens
from the T003 study to generate hypotheses regarding correlates of long term vs. short term virologic control.
Aim 2. To define mechanisms of bNAb efficacy in lymphoid tissues in SHIV-infected rhesus macaques.
We will perform interventional studies to test the hypothesis that bNAbs can target the viral reservoir in lymph
nodes and gastrointestinal mucosa in SHIV-infected rhesus macaques.
We will apply cutting-edge, high-throughput, multi-omics profiling platforms detailed in Core B (Multi-Omics
Core) to define the impact of bNAb therapy. We will then integrate the multi-omics data in Core C (Computational
Analysis Core) to generate a comprehensive landscape and regulatory network of the viral reservoir and host
immune responses following bNAb therapy. These data will define the impact of bNAbs on the replication-
competent viral reservoir at an unprecedented level of resolution, which will provide critical insights for next
generation HIV-1 cure efforts."
10886132,"SUMMARY
The goal of therapeutic vaccination is to increase host immune control of HIV-1 to achieve durable virologic
control in the absence of ART, which is defined as a “functional cure”. However, therapeutic vaccine studies in
humans have to date been largely unsuccessful. In contrast, in previous therapeutic vaccination studies in
SIV/SHIV infected non-human primates (NHPs), a subset of animals achieved viral control including reduced
viral levels in lymphoid organs, suggesting an anti-reservoir effect of the interventions. Understanding the
mechanisms underlying therapeutic vaccine efficacy and identifying immune signatures that associate with anti-
reservoir activity in vivo is a fundamental prerequisite towards their optimization for HIV cure.
In Project 2, we hypothesize that combinatorial immunization strategies that result in virological control
induce unique peripheral and tissue immune signatures, including reorganization within viral tissue
reservoirs, which can be identified using spatial multi-omics approaches. We further hypothesize that
such protective immune responses mediate their efficacy primarily in lymphoid tissues. To evaluate these
hypotheses, we propose two Specific Aims:
Aim 1. Identify the immunological correlates of virologic control in SIV/SHIV-infected rhesus macaques
following active and combinatorial immunization strategies. We will perform a comprehensive virologic,
immunologic, and multi-omics analysis of existing specimens from three non-human primate and one clinical
studies study to generate hypotheses regarding correlates of long term vs. short term virologic control.
Aim 2. Define mechanisms of peripheral and tissue viral reservoir control in lymphoid tissues following
therapeutic vaccination of SHIV-infected rhesus macaques. We will perform interventional studies to test
the hypothesis that combinatorial vaccine strategies can induce immune responses that target the viral reservoir
in lymph nodes and gastrointestinal mucosa in SHIV-infected rhesus macaques.
We will apply cutting-edge, high-throughput, multi-omics profiling platforms detailed in Core B (Multi-Omics
Core) to define the impact of therapeutic vaccination. We will then integrate the multi-omics data in Core C
(Computational Analysis Core) to generate a comprehensive landscape and regulatory network of the viral
reservoir and host immune responses following therapeutic vaccination. These data will define the impact of
therapeutic vaccination on the replication-competent viral reservoir at an unprecedented level of resolution,
which will provide critical insights for next generation HIV-1 cure efforts."
10904671,"Description: Extremity trauma has been the predominant cause of combat casualties for U.S. armed forces
members in recent military conflicts. These injuries often result in long-term functional disabilities, pain, and
neurologic dysfunction. This proposal will utilize preclinical models of extremity trauma and test new tissue
engineered therapies in combination with rehabilitation regimens. The overall objective of the proposed study
is to establish an integrated regenerative medicine and rehabilitation therapy treatment protocol to enhance
restoration of limb function following severe extremity trauma. The hypothesis is that treatment of large volume
multi-tissue injuries with regenerative engineering strategies that improve revascularization in combination with
low intensity rehabilitation regimens will enhance tissue regeneration, integration, and long term functional
outcomes.
Research Plan: We propose the following Aims: Aim 1: Engineer regenerative muscle constructs using muscle
stem (satellite) cells and microvascular fragments for Volumetric Muscle Loss (VML) injuries; Aim 2: In a VML
model alone, determine if treadmill running rehabilitation enhances the regeneration of large muscle loss treated
with muscle stem cell constructs; Aim 3: In a multi-tissue extremity trauma model, assess the efficacy of
combined treadmill running rehabilitation and regenerative therapies on muscle and bone healing
Methods: We will use preclinical models of extremity trauma, including VML and multi-tissue bone and muscle
defects. In Aim 1 VML injuries will be treated with regenerative muscle therapies including muscle stem cells or
microvascular fragments which will be delivered in collagen hydrogels or decellularized muscle matrices. In Aim
2, treadmill based exercise will be used to test the role of key rehabilitation parameters including timing of
initiation and intensity on graft integration and function. In Aim 3, rehabilitation and regenerative therapies (as
determined in Aim 2 for re-vascularization potency or muscle regeneration potency) will be tested in a multi-
tissue injury model of composite bone and muscle trauma. Outcome measures will include assessments of
muscle and limb structure and function (Aim 1-3) and bone structure and function (Aim 3).
We anticipate the proposed work will result in new insights on rehabilitation protocols for severely injured limbs
and will be communicated through publications and our clinical consultants to impact military and veterans care."
10918209,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A vibrant learning environment is essential for training investigators who will generate new advances in
biomedical science within the mission of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
Over the past several decades, our T32 and other training programs have been successful in developing
scientists who have made seminal contributions to kidney, urology and non-malignant hematology (KUH)
research. However, traditional pre- and post-doc training programs are not ideally suited for training the
scientific workforce of the future which prioritizes interdisciplinary, team-based approaches to solve complex
problems and transform novel discoveries into meaningful scientific and clinical breakthroughs. Nowhere is the
need for developing this workforce more pressing than the Deep South of the United States, a region of the
country that bears a disproportionate burden of KUH diseases as well as disparities in health outcomes related
to these conditions. Accordingly, the mission of the Deep South KUH Premier Research and Inter-
disciplinary Mentored Education (PRIME) program is to develop a modern workforce of investigators in the
Deep South who have the training, skills and drive necessary to advance KUH health through science and
medicine. We will do so by bringing together the distinguished KUH research programs and complementary
training assets at Augusta University, Tulane University, and the University of Alabama at Birmingham
(UAB) to foster KUH training activities across our entire region. The Deep South KUH PRIME will leverage our
established research partnerships including the Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CTSA hub)
Partner Network and long-standing KUH research collaborations within and between our institutions. Through
our Administrative, Professional Development, Network, and TL1 Cores, we will accomplish our overall vision
to create and nurture a multi-institutional community of trainees that is diverse, interdisciplinary, inter-
connected, and well-equipped with skills to transform and advance scientific discovery. Specifically we will (1)
Combine K, U, and H training activities in our institutions into a unified KUH training ecosystem; (2) identify,
recruit and cultivate a diverse cohort of pre- and post-doctoral trainees committed to KUH research; (3) expand
and develop innovative new opportunities for professional development; (4) create a vibrant trainee networking
hub with peer-to-peer and near-peer mentoring; and (5) participate in the nationwide U2C/TL1 training network,
including hosting regional and national meetings, establishing pipelines across institutions, and engaging
regional partners to expand training efforts. The Deep South KUH PRIME will provide an unparalleled
opportunity to build a new program that integrates the unique research strengths and training capacities
offered by each of our institutions to immerse trainees of diverse backgrounds in an inter-connected network of
team training, skill development, and community building, with cross-cutting themes that integrate shared
interests and drives scientific advances in KUH research in the Deep South and across the country.

10867489,"Project Summary. While recent efforts have identified the need for methodologies capable of inactivating
oncoproteins, current intervention strategies have left much of the proteome “undruggable.” In response the
NCI has recognized this challenge as outlined in PAR-22-216 by incentivizing the development of new
molecular targeting agents based on specific signaling pathways activated during the process of tumorigenesis
or tumor progression. This program proposes an important next step in reaching these goals by providing a
platform for the rapid development and characterization of heterobifunctional molecules capable of inducing
degradation of cancer related metalloenzymes with new molecular targeting agents. In this program, our team
will develop proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) containing state-of-the-art metal-binding
pharmacophores (MBPs) with the ultimate goal of achieving isoform-selective degradation of jumonji C-domain
containing lysine demethylases. Current strategies to inhibit conserved catalytic domain Jumonjis (JMJCs)
involve targeting the α-ketoglutaric acid (2OG) substrate-accepting active site of JMJCs with inhibitors that can
coordinate to the iron ion in the active site. Targeting the histone-binding helper domain of JMJCs generates
additional isoform selectivity. However, no inhibitor has been shown to be selective for only one isoform of
JMJCs. We have chosen to take a targeted degradation approach in order to increase the surface area of the
peripheral interaction by recruiting an E3 ligase. This program will demonstrate how the potential protein-
protein interaction induced by these chimeras can be leveraged to induce selective degradation of
metalloproteins (`MetalloPROTACs') through rational MBP and linker design and will serve as a platform for the
study of cancer biology, as well as laying the foundation for future development of therapeutic agents."

10922832,"Project Summary for the RCMAR CHIME Research Education Component
Building on a highly successful 20-year track record of developing scientists who conduct minority aging
research, the Research Education Component (REC) aims to develop faculty by supporting our theme of
“Developing, Adapting, and Evaluating Interventions to Improve the Health of Racial/Ethnic Minority Elders”,
which incorporates two RFA research objectives: i) identify and develop solutions to eliminate health disparities
and health inequities in the growing population of older adults, and ii) improve the health and well-being of
older adults. The REC Specific Aims are to: 1) Identify, recruit, and encourage URM faculty with demonstrated
research potential and interest in minority aging research to apply as RCMAR scientists, 2) Select, with input
from External Advisors, at least 3 outstanding scientists to receive 1-year pilot studies (up to $55,000 each
inclusive of UCLA CTSI funds), 3) Provide intensive individual mentorship, an educational plan and a broad
array of resources to enable scientists to complete, present, and publish their research and ultimately obtain
independent funding, and 4) Monitor the progress of the scientists using a program of progress reports,
mentorship committee meetings, and brief monthly progress review by the CHIME Executive Committee (EC).
For this application, the REC has identified 3 RCMAR scientists to lead pilot projects: 1) Utibe Essien, MD,
MPH, Assistant Professor of General Internal Medicine and Health Services Research, at UCLA (as of Jan
2023) will work with mentor Dr. Mangione to examine i) whether race and ethnicity are associated with frailty in
Veterans with incident Atrial Fibrillation (AF); ii) whether the presence frailty influences known racial and ethnic
inequities in the use of anticoagulation for Veterans with incident AF; iii) whether frailty is a determinant of
switching from warfarin to direct oral anticoagulant therapy for anticoagulation. 2) Chioun Lee, PhD, Assistant
Professor of Medical Sociology at UC Riverside, will work with Drs. Link and Brown, to examine the
progression of multimorbidity after age 50 and to quantify the mechanisms through which health disparities at
the intersection of race/ethnicity and sex are created, using data from the Health and Retirement Study
(HRS,1992–2020). 3) David Lee, MBA, MD, Clinical Instructor, Division of Geriatrics at UCLA, will work with
Drs. Lo and Hays using Kaiser Permanente Northern California data to study the association of dementia and
hip fracture and to understand differences by race and ethnicity, particularly among Asian American and
Pacific Islander subgroups. The 3 proposed pilots address socioeconomic, health care, cultural, social, and
psychological factors and physiological indicators across four levels of analysis (environmental, sociocultural,
behavioral, and biological) of the NIA Health Disparities Research Framework (See Figure 1 in Overall), along
with classifying race/ethnicity as a critical factor in addressing health disparities. All three pilot studies will
provide findings that inform the design of future interventions to improve the health of older adults. In 2018-23,

10762477,"ABSTRACT
 It is essential for the fate of an organism that key morphogenetic processes occur reproducibly even
under tissue damage or environmental perturbations. While much is known about how genetic redundancy and
regulation achieves robust development, less is understood about how a tissue mechanically ensures
reproducible shape change when perturbed. This project uncovers how populations of physically interacting
cells mechanically respond to challenging conditions and modify their collective behavior to still sculpt the
correct final shape.
 One way for cells to coordinate tissue-scale forces and movements is through direct mechanical
connections. In fact, many developing tissues exhibit supracellular networks of actomyosin connections that
link hundreds of cells. A large roadblock has been with the challenges of imaging and quantifying subcellular
protein at the tissue scale. I adapted a topological smoothing algorithm originally used to trace high-noise
filamentous structure of galaxies in the Universe to data to trace high-noise filamentous myosin structure in
confocal images. This allowed for the first quantification of a supracellular myosin network across an entire
tissue over developmental time. Subsequent analysis adopting techniques from network theory allowed me to
identify that the robust folding of the Drosophila fruit fly embryo during ventral furrow formation is mechanically
ensured by patterns in the supracellular network spanning its ventral cells.
 This newly discovered importance of supracellular networks in coordinating robust shape change
highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of how supracellular networks form, and how their
patterns impact the function and robustness of a population of cells. Deciphering robustness at the tissue-level,
where the displacement and fate of hundreds of cells must be considered, requires techniques at the interface
of cell and developmental biology, biophysics and computer science. The proposed project will take a highly
interdisciplinary approach to identify how supracellular network patterns are controlled molecularly, at the cell
level, and via tissue constraints. As well, how heterogeneity in tissue-level patterns impacts morphogenetic
robustness will be addressed. Together this comprehensive study of the structure and function of supracellular
networks will represent a new way to interpret mechanical robustness across diverse developing tissues. As
well, a generalized description of mechanical robustness has the potential to uncover new paths to predict and
control tissue malformation, which would represent a significant advance for both developmental biology and
fetal medicine."
10918334,"We are applying to continue participating as an APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Network
(APOLLO) Study Clinical Center (CC). The NIH-funded APOLLO Study is performing a national prospective
evaluation of deceased donor and recipient APOL1 risk variants in transplants from African American kidney
donors to determine effects on outcomes. In addition, APOLLO studies APOL1 genotypes in African American
living kidney donors for effects on their post-donation health. Kidney transplants from deceased African American
donors typically do not function as long as those from European American deceased donors. Reasons for this
are unknown, but retrospective reports suggest that presence of two apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene risk
variants in donors may contribute. The APOL1 risk variants are common in populations with recent African
ancestry (such as African Americans), where they are strongly associated with end-stage kidney disease. In
contrast, they are rare in other population groups. APOL1 genotype data may prove to be clinically useful in
those with recent African ancestry in the setting of allocation of deceased donor kidneys for transplantation and
assessment of prospective live kidney donors. Genotypic information may provide a more accurate assessment
of the likelihood for long-term graft function in donor kidneys, thereby improving matching of donor kidneys with
recipients to optimize graft and patient survival. Information may better inform physicians about organ quality
prior to decisions on allocation. Information lacking from prior studies will be analyzed, including recipient APOL1
genotypes, kidney histology, viral infection (BK, CMV, SARS-CoV-2), donor specific antibodies, medications,
cold ischemia time and acute rejection. Our investigative team, led by two PIs with complementary expertise,
recruited the second largest number of eligible kidney transplant recipients in APOLLO to date. Before APOL1
genotyping can be clinically useful, a prospective national study was required to evaluate transplant outcomes
from African American kidney donors and recipients of their kidneys based on their genotypes. This was the
rationale and setting for the landmark APOLLO Study. Our CC has worked closely with the Wake Forest APOLLO
Scientific and Data Research Center (SDRC) and the other participating CCs to recruit and prospectively follow
eligible kidney donors and transplant recipients based on the APOLLO Protocol. In Phase 2, we will continue
follow-up and measure urine albumin, as well as collect additional biosamples. APOLLO results have the
potential to transform the organ allocation and informed consent processes in kidney transplantation, optimize
renal allograft survival, reduce discard of good-quality kidneys, and protect the health of living kidney donors."
10895554,"ABSTRACT
Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) affects more than 20% of the older population and increases the risks of
multiple cardiometabolic diseases and mortality. Candidate gene and genome-wide association studies (GWASs)
have identified genes and pathways associated with SDB. However, the causality is not clear. Transcriptome-
wide Mendelian randomization (MR) studies have recently been conducted to elucidate molecular mechanisms
of complex diseases. However, the power is limited by the number of tested genes and tissues and small effects
of single genes. Building on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that pathway-level transcriptional MR will
have better power than single gene MR to identify causal molecular mechanisms for SDB. In this study, we will
leverage well-established canonical pathways and existing methods to calculate pathway expression scores, as
well as available transcriptomics and genomics data in population-based studies. We will address the following
specific aims: 1) To describe tissue-specific and cross-tissue pathway activities using pathway expression scores
and identify genetic associations for these scores by performing GWAS; 2) To identify causal associations
between pathway activities and SDB by performing MR using GWAS summary statistics of pathway expression
scores and SDB traits. Results of this study will advance our knowledge of the molecular basis of SDB, help
identify SDB biomarkers, and provide novel treatment targets. This study also will provide a new approach to
understand causal mechanisms for other complex diseases."
10929404,"This is an application for a Small Projects in Rehabilitation Research (SPiRE) award to Dr. David Ewart, MD, a
staff rheumatologist at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center and Assistant Professor at the University of
Minnesota. Dr. Ewart has a history of research and publications in biomechanics, immunology, and animal
models of arthritis and is transitioning to a focus on the treatment and rehabilitation of joint damage. Dr.
Ewart is an early career investigator with protected time to establish an independent line of investigation. This
SPiRE award will provide Dr. Ewart with the support to: 1) develop a unique interinstitutional collaboration to
build an orthosis with an integrated microphone to measure acoustic emissions from the knee at the point of
care 2) use acoustic emissions to identify patients with pre-radiographic osteoarthritis of the knee 3) establish a
mentored role in a busy research group and generate the preliminary data with which to apply for a career
development award (CDA-2). To achieve these goals, Dr. Ewart has established a mentorship team consisting
of Dr. Andrew Hansen, head of the Minneapolis Adaptive Design and Engineering (MADE) program at the
Minneapolis VA, and Dr. Omer Inan, PhD, Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at
Georgia Tech. Dr. Ewart will work with the MADE program to perform the technical construction of the knee
orthosis, integrate the microphone into it, and collaborate remotely with Dr. Inan to analyze the data from and
refine the microphone system for function in the wearable device.
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent and disabling disease. Pharmacologic and surgical treatments for symptoms
of OA are insufficient for many patients and there are no therapies which halt or even delay the structural
progression of disease. One difficulty in the study of such therapies is identification of patients at an early
enough stage of disease that the damage to the joint is potentially reversible. In patients at risk of OA but with
no signs of it on x-rays, MRI has been shown to be able to identify changes in the knee that are predictive of
subsequent development of OA. However, these findings are not specific in all circumstances and MRI is
expensive, time-consuming, and can’t be used at the point of care. Measurement of acoustic emissions from the
knee with a modern, miniature microphone can differentiate health in the knee from disease and would offer
novel method of screening for early OA. In Aim 1, Dr. Ewart will work with the MADE program and Dr. Inan’s
group to prototype and iteratively design a portable orthosis with an integrated microphone system for
measuring acoustic emissions from the knee at the point of care. In Aim 2, Dr. Ewart will identify patients at
risk for development of osteoarthritis of the knee but without radiographic signs of advanced disease and
compare acoustic emissions from their knees to healthy controls. If acoustic emissions are abnormal in the at-
risk group, MRIs of their knees will be obtained to assess for findings that predict development of radiographic
and symptomatic progression to OA, validating the ability of acoustic emissions to diagnose early OA. The
overall objective of the proposed project is to develop a portable orthosis capable of measuring acoustic
emissions from the knee at the point of care to identify patients with early pre-radiographic OA. Dr. Ewart’s
long-term goal is to develop technology for non-invasive monitoring of joint health and function that can
provide useful clinical information to providers that will result in patient-specific therapies, custom orthotics,
and ultimately improved symptoms, function, and joint longevity. This work will form the basis for further
mechanistic, clinical, and translational investigation into the basis for pathologic acoustic emissions and their
application to osteoarthritis. These studies will be proposed in a CDA-2 award application at the end of the
SPiRE funding period."
10731360,"Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a significant health issue which affects service members and Veterans
with combat-related exposure to blast. The sustained physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral deficits
directly impact the health and safety of many Veterans. mTBI is notoriously difficult to evaluate objectively. It
leads to neuronal and axonal damage, typically observed at the time of injury, with a complex secondary cascade
leading to white matter degeneration. mTBI-induced pathological changes include myelin alterations (e.g., loss
and clumping) and microhemorrhage (e.g., hemosiderin- or hematoidin-laden macrophages). Myelin alteration
disrupts axonal transport, integrity, and structural plasticity and greatly reduces signal transduction. Iron
accumulation can contribute to a host of neurodegenerative disorders. Unfortunately, conventional neuroimaging
techniques are unable to accurately assess myelin and iron, and fail to show abnormalities in the majority of
mTBI cases. By VA/DoD definitions, there are no conventional imaging findings in those with mTBI. The limited
diagnostic and prognostic value of current clinical MRI and CT techniques highlights the urgent need for more
advanced neuroimaging techniques to facilitate better detection and therapeutic monitoring of mTBI in the
Veteran population.
 Myelin imaging techniques may help resolve this dilemma, especially as myelin has emerged as a target of
treatment. However, current myelin imaging techniques are indirect, largely because myelin has an extremely
short T2 (<< 1 ms) and cannot be detected with regular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. Iron
accumulation also tends to reduce T2* and is difficult to quantify accurately with clinical MRI techniques.
Ultrashort echo time (UTE) MRI sequences with echo times (TEs) ~100 times shorter than those of clinical
sequences allow direct detection of signals from myelin and iron overload. The 3D Short TR Adiabatic Inversion
Recovery UTE (STAIR-UTE) sequence allows selective imaging of myelin and quantification of myelin T1, T2*
and proton density (PD). The 3D UTE Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (UTE-QSM) technique can map iron
distribution and quantify iron content. Multicomponent-driven equilibrium single pulse observation of T1 and T2
(mcDESPOT) can map myelin water, providing an indirect measure of myelin content. Diffusion tensor imaging
(DTI) has been used to assess axonal damage. Our goal is to validate STAIR-UTE imaging of myelin and UTE-
QSM imaging of iron, compare them with mcDESPOT imaging of myelin water and DTI imaging of axons in
human brain specimens and in mice subjected to open-field low-intensity blast (LIB) (Aim 1), then evaluate the
UTE techniques in Veterans with mTBI (Aim 2). Our central hypothesis is that the STAIR-UTE-measured
myelin loss and UTE-QSM-measured iron accumulation are associated with worse neurological function in
Veterans with mTBI. Ultimately, we hope these new MRI biomarkers may aid in the differentiation of neurological-
and psychological-based symptoms, thus allowing for more targeted treatment."

Malarial parasite sensitivity to chloroquine (CQ) as well as important artemisinin combination therapy (ACT)
partner drugs (notably piperaquine [PPQ], amodiaquine [AQ], and lumefantrine [LF]) and are affected by
mutations in the P. falciparum transporter PfCRT. Of the 61 known distinct PfCRT protein isoforms discovered
since 2000, some mediate emerging or evolving phenotypes selected for by relatively recent changes in front-
line antimalarial drug therapy. In drug resistant parasites, PfCRT protein harbors 4 to 10 amino acid
substitutions relative to wild type. These confer most of the ~ 10-fold shift in CQ IC50 seen for common CQ-
resistant (CQR) strains, with milder, variable resistance to other drugs often observed in these strains.
However, only a handful of the isoforms have been studied in molecular depth. The Dd2 (Asia/Africa) and 7G8
(S. America) isoforms both confer CQR, but 7G8 PfCRT confers lower CQR and also mediates AQR. Recent
data shows some rare mutant PfCRTs may not confer drug resistance at all.
 This project brings together expertise in protein biochemistry, transporter physiology, reverse genetics,
and structural biology by leveraging the established expertise of the Roepe (Georgetown), Fidock (Columbia),
Chang (UCSD), and Stowell (U.C.,Boulder) laboratories to comprehensively define how new mutant isoforms
of PfCRT influence currently evolving antimalarial drug resistance.
We have three aims: 1) we will use novel and previously validated antimalarial drug probes, engineered yeast
strains and purified recombinant protein to unambiguously define function of PfCRT isoforms expressed in
evolving P. falciparum resistant to both quinoline – based (chloroquine; CQ, piperaquine; PPQ) and Artemisinin
– based drugs, 2) we will characterize reverse engineered strains of P. falciparum expressing PfCRT isoforms
that are created in specific P. falciparum genetic backgrounds, in order to isolate and characterize the precise
contribution of PPQR-associated PfCRT function to evolving phenotypes, and 3) we will leverage our
considerable progress with purification of PfCRT, highthroughput production of PfCRT specific nanobodies,
cryoEM methods, molecular dynamics, and other physical chemical approaches to significantly expand recent
collaborative success at defining atomic level structure of PfCRT isoforms."

Glioblastoma (GBM) remains a fatal brain cancer for which there is no cure. Maximal safe tumor resection
combined with adjuvant therapies such as fractionated external beam radiation therapy (RT) and temozolomide
(TMZ) chemotherapy, known as chemoradiation (CRT), has provided the greatest benefit to GBM patients.
However, local recurrence occurs in most patients due to invasive therapy-resistant infiltrating cancer cells at
the tumor margin. Magnetic hyperthermia therapy (MHT) is a powerful nanotechnology-based treatment that
may enhance the effects of CRT. MHT consists of local heat generation in the tumor region through direct
delivery of magnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (MIONPs) that are activated by exposure to an external alternating
magnetic field (AMF) that is safe to normal cells. The AMF interacts with the magnetic dipoles of the MIONPs to
generate local heat and hyperthermia. Human clinical trials have demonstrated overall survival benefits of MHT
with fractionated RT in recurrent GBM resulting in European approval. Current MHT strategies, however,
require high concentrations of nontargeted MIONPs (>100 mg/ml; 50-100mg Fe/g of tumor) delivered by
injection with leakback and without image-guided control of energy deposition. As a result, normal tissue
injury limits MHT effectiveness and treatment of the infiltrative tumor margins is poorly defined, which
compromises MHT efficacy. Our proposal is designed to address these challenges and optimize the translational
potential for enhanced MHT of GBM in combination with CRT using both small and large animal models, with
clinical proof-of-concept demonstration in spontaneous canine gliomas. We have recently completed a pilot study
in spontaneous canine gliomas demonstrating feasibility and safety of image-guided MIONP delivery alone. We
hypothesize that image-guided MHT will enhance CRT of GBM. Key innovations of our proposal are to: 1)
evaluate the enhancement of CRT by MHT in mouse GBM models with an innovative proprietary MIONP
formulation that requires 20-fold lower Fe concentration in tumors for more effective treatment than current
approved MIONPs; 2) optimize image-guided MIONP delivery and MHT treatment planning with computational
modelling in a rabbit brain tumor model; 3) enhance thermal treatment at the infiltrative tumor margins by
controlling power deposition with innovative AMF power application that will also limit off target heating; and, 4)
complete a clinically relevant proof-of-concept study of our MHT approach in a spontaneous canine glioma
model. We have Preliminary Data that demonstrate intracranial hyperthermia with a 3-fold increase in TMZ
concentration within GBM tumors, leading to a robust antitumor effect with increased survival after MHT + CRT
in a therapy-resistant rodent glioma model. Overall, this interdisciplinary work will provide a solid foundation for
meaningful clinical translation of MHT with CRT for treatment of GBM. Imaging methods that correlate tumor
heat distribution after MHT will be developed for translation to human patients."
10891702,"Gliomas are a particularly aggressive type of brain cancer with poor prognosis that affect about 20,000 newly diagnosed
patients in the US annually. There is high interest in identifying predictive biomarkers of response to established
treatments such as Temozolomide, and to identify response and resistance biomarkers for new single and combinations
treatments for gliomas, as there is evidence that an effective adjuvant treatment strategy can improve survival
outcomes for patients. Few tools exist currently to identify such biomarkers and prioritize which agent(s) to administer
to individual patients in order to maximize the impact of drug treatment.
We will conduct a clinical study in which we measure the tumor responses to 20 distinct therapies across a cohort of
32 patients. Using only intrasurgical procedures, implantable microdevices (IMD) are placed into tumors placed into
tumors during already scheduled tumor resections, remain in the patient for the duration of surgery, and are extracted
along with the resected tumor specimen. IMDs enable readouts for each treatment that include immunohistochemical,
transcriptomic, immune and tissue biomarkers, thereby effectively performing 20 biomarker trials at minute drug
exposure levels in each patient with three-fold replicates.
Several key advances will be achieved in this project. First, safety, feasibility and clinical integration of the technical
workflow will be demonstrated in a statistically significant manner. This is key towards establishing broader clinical use
for this technology in the intrasurgical setting. Secondly, we will examine in a retrospective analysis whether the IMD
readout at Temozolomide (TMZ) reservoirs can serve as a predictive marker for standard systemic TMZ treatment
response and progression-free survival at 6 months for each patient. This would constitute a major advance for glioma
patients, as TMZ is the most frequently administered adjuvant treatment in this disease, and the MGMT promoter
methylation status is only a limited predictor of TMZ efficacy for a subset of glioma patients. Third, we will use
multiplexed state-of-the-art deep tissue phenotyping to characterize the biological response of each patient’s tumor
exposed to each of 20 drugs on the microdevice. This will result in a comprehensive catalogue of drug phenotypes for
20 distinct therapies in GBM patients, and we will use this data to systematically identify resistance pathways to
available therapies. In addition, by examining the tumor for genetic and physiologic changes, we can in vivo correlate
existing ‘omic’ biomarkers of tumor response to multiple drugs. This addresses a major knowledge gap in the field, as
such a dataset is not feasible to obtain with traditional systemic clinical trials. The drug phenotyping includes spatial
transcriptomics and metabolomics to identify specific biomarkers in the tumor microenvironment that correlate with
high and low phenotypic response to each therapy. This study will lay the ground work to prove that local intratumor
response to microdoses of multiple agents can be used to effectively screen for and tailor optimal treatment for glioma
patients. Assessing the predictive value of the IMD for therapy selection opens the door to broader use as a precision
medicine and drug development tool to improve outcomes in glioma."
10872296,"Pitch plays a fundamental role in auditory and speech perception. In music it defines melody and harmony; in
speech it carries prosodic and (in tone languages) lexical information; and in everyday complex acoustic
environments it plays a critical role in helping us to segregate and hear out important sounds against a
background of other sounds. Despite its importance, fundamental questions surrounding how pitch is perceived
and neurally encoded remain unanswered. There is, for instance, no consensus on how and why pitch accuracy
degrades with hearing loss and/or age. Similarly, despite cochlear implants’ many successes, pitch remains very
poorly conveyed for reasons that remain a matter of debate. This project combines behavioral studies in normal-
hearing and hearing-impaired adults across the lifespan (Aim 1), behavioral and EEG studies in infants (Aim 2),
and high-resolution neuroimaging (fMRI) studies in adults (Aim 3) with computational modeling to answer a
cohesive set of fundamental questions on how pitch is perceived and represented. These questions include
whether peripheral or more central (experienced-based) factors lead to the dominance of low-numbered
harmonics in everyday pitch perception (Aims 1 and 2), and whether the interactions between the perceptual
dimensions of pitch (based on fundamental frequency) and brightness (based on spectral centroid) follow a
developmental trajectory that is also reflected in their cortical representations (Aims 2 and 3). The first two
experiments of Aim 1 (Exp. 1A/B) use individual differences to determine the effects of age and hearing loss on
the accuracy of pitch perception. They test the hypotheses that the sharp transition between good and poor pitch
discrimination as lower harmonics are progressively removed is due to the limits of auditory filtering, as
influenced by cochlear hearing loss, and that overall pitch fidelity across all conditions is degraded by age, as
expected from age-related cochlear synaptopathy. Aim 1’s third experiment (Exp. 1C) utilizes recent signal-
processing developments to test the role of harmonicity of either the target or interfering speech in the perceptual
segregation of competing talkers. Aim 2 uses a developmental approach to test whether properties that are
currently believed to be innate, including interference between pitch and brightness (Exp. 2A/B), and poor
accuracy at high harmonic numbers and/or frequencies (Exp. 2C/D), are in fact centrally mediated developmental
traits that emerge after extensive exposure to natural sounds. Finally, Aim 3 uses ultra-high-field (7T) fMRI to
determine whether the perceptual interference observed in adults between pitch and brightness is reflected by
interdependence of cortical tuning (Exp. 3A); whether cortical mapping of pitch and frequency is affected by the
context in which the tones are presented (Exp. 3B); and whether cortical correlates of pitch interval size and
direction can be observed (Exp. 3C). By improving our fundamental understanding of the neural coding and
perception of pitch, we will be better placed to improve its representation in people with hearing loss and cochlear
implants."

Exposure to unpredictable and complex stress early in life increases the risk for developing anxiety disorder
and abnormal connectivity between the amygdala, the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and the hippocampus (HPC).
Exactly how early life stress (ELS) modifies fronto-limbic connectivity and how these changes contribute to
increased anxiety are questions that are difficult to investigate in humans. Specifically, the question of how
ELS interacts with sex to alter fronto-limbic connections and anxiety are not addressable with current human
studies. To clarify these issues we developed a mouse model of ELS that we have named Unpredictable
Postnatal Stress (UPS), in which mice are exposed to unpredictable and complex stress early in life. We found
that UPS caused robust increase in anxiety that was not seen in mice exposed to simple and predictable form
of ELS, known as limited bedding (LB). Moreover, we found that UPS and LB preferentially increased anxiety
in male mice. Using resting state fMRI (rsfMRI), high resolution diffusion MRI (dMRI), and retrograde tracing
we found increased connectivity in male UPS mice that was present during the juvenile period and adulthood
and was highly correlated with anxiety. Preliminary data with dMRI indicate that fronto-limbic connectivity is not
altered in females and that these sex specific effects are associated with abnormal synaptic pruning and
reduced levels of the transcription factor IRF8 in male microglial, but not female microglia. We hypothesize
that amygdala connectivity with the PFC and the HPC undergoes microglial-mediated pruning during the
postnatal period. This process requires high levels of the transcription factor IRF8 in postnatal microglia and is
critical for programming levels of anxiety during the juvenile period and adulthood. UPS reduces expression of
IRF8 in males, but not female mice. This in turn leads to increase fronto-limbic connectivity and anxiety in UPS
males, but not UPS females. Work in aim 1 will use rsfMRI, dMRI, and dual retrograde tracing to characterize
the effects of UPS, sex and age on fronto-limbic connectivity. Studies in aim 2 will test whether reducing IRF8
in postnatal microglia is sufficient to phenocopy the effects of UPS on anxiety, fronto-limbic connectivity,
microglial gene expression, and phagocytic activity. In aim 3 we ask whether overexpressing IRF8 in postnatal
microglia can normalize anxiety and fronto-limbic connectivity in UPS mice. Successful completion of this
application will define a novel role for microglial IRF8 in refining fronto-limbic connections and programming
anxiety in the mouse; an important finding given the conserved role that IRF8 plays in guiding immune
responses in humans and mice. In addition, this work will provide a new paradigm to explain how ELS
differentially affects microglial function, amygdala connectivity, and anxiety in mice."

 Multidrug-resistant bacteria have evolved into a global crisis on the shortage of available
antibiotics. Facing the mounting pressure, it is essential to discover and design next-generation
portfolios of novel antimicrobial compositions. Nonspecific interactions are among the most
promising approaches for evading antimicrobial resistance. Such interactions include Coulombic
attraction between oppositely charged groups and hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions. It
involves a series of coordinated and cascade events for antimicrobial agents to attack bacteria.
Because of non-specificity, it would be more challenging for bacteria to develop mechanisms for
resistance. On the other hand, strength and selectivity of such interactions are critical to efficacy
of antimicrobial killing against bacteria as well as cytocompatibility toward eukaryotic cells.
 We propose to design local facial amphiphilicity clustered along a macromolecular chain as a
new class of antimicrobial compositions that are particularly effective against Gram-negative
pathogens. This unique macromolecular composition overcomes many deficiencies of
antimicrobial peptides and antimicrobial polymers. First it adopts the facial amphiphilicity from
host defense peptides, but not necessarily possessing a helical conformation; second it does not
need to overcome a likely impossible global conformational arrangement that antimicrobial
polymers need to adapt to make facial amphiphilicity. This new design of macromolecular
antimicrobials is demonstrated with novel cationic polymers containing a series of multicyclic
natural products including abietic acid, cholic and ursolic acid, which are representatives of tri-,
tetra- and penta-cyclic compounds. We define a facial amphiphilic index (FAI) to understand a
combination of hydrophobicity and charged groups as well as cross-sectional areas that are
needed to penetrate through outer leaflets and further damage cell membranes of bacteria. The
most contribution is to correlate facial amphiphilicity with cell compositions for designing selective
antimicrobial therapies that could pave a new pathway to fighting vexing bacterial resistance."

Conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) are crucial for both innate and adaptive immunity. In general, cDCs can be
categorized roughly into two functionally and developmentally distinct subsets, cDC1 and cDC2, which
preferentially activate CD8T cells and CD4T cells, respectively. cDC2s are phenotypically and functionally
more heterogeneous compared to cDC1s, but how different cDC2 subsets acquire distinct phenotype and
function remains poorly understood. We previously showed that a mouse cDC2 subset expressing CD301b
(Mgl2) is functionally distinct and plays critical role in type 2 immune responses to allergens and helminth
parasites. CD301b+ DCs are present in nearly all peripheral organs and expand during type 2 inflammation, but
their differentiation mechanism is unknown. Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanism of CD301b+
DC differentiation at the cellular and molecular levels and explore its potential as a therapeutic targets for
diseases with type 2 inflammation such as allergies. In general, cDC2s are thought to originate from the pre-
cDC, a cDC-committed circulating precursor, through the action of the transcription factor IRF4. However, it
remains unclear whether the heterogeneity in cDC2s originates in their precursors, or is acquired later during
terminal differentiation. Likewise, while IRF4 seems to play a significant role in cDC2 development in general,
its role in diversification of cDC2 subsets remains elusive and additional factors may be responsible for their
heterogeneity. We hypothesize that pre-cDCs and/or monocytes acquire the CD301b+ DCs phenotype in a
context-dependent manner with context-dependent requirement of IRF4. Our specific aims in this proposal are
(1) to identify the precursor cell populations that give rise to CD301b+ DCs in peripheral organs, and (2) to
elucidate the role of IRF4 and CD301b+ DC-specific transcription factors in their differentiation, under both
naive and infected conditions. Understanding the mechanism of cDC2 differentiation might give us clues to
understand the etiology and to identify potential therapeutic targets in allergies and other diseases with type 2
inflammation."

Diabetic cardiomyopathy is the leading cause of complications in type-2 diabetes. The diabetic heart features
metabolic insults that promote its metabolic inflexibility and failure, particularly insulin resistance, impaired glu-
cose oxidation and loss of NAD+ biogenesis. The cardiomyocyte-specific glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is im-
portant for heart function, but the GR-dependent metabolic mechanisms of glucocorticoids (GCs) in cardiomyo-
cytes remain unknown. GR activity is regulated by the circadian clock but the extent to which the GR regulates
the cardiomyocyte clock is still unknown. The GR activates its co-factor KLF15, which regulates cardiac metab-
olism and promotes oscillating transcriptional programs in heart. However, a direct role for KLF15 in regulating
circadian clock genes is still unknown. The circadian clock factor BMAL1 promotes oscillating NAD+ repletion
and supports cardiac clock and function in a cardiomyocyte-autonomous fashion. However, the clock response
to GC signaling in heart remains unknown. Recently, we have shown two interconnected time dimensions that
harness benefits from detriments of GC pharmacology: circadian time-of-intake and chronic frequency-of-
intake. Circadian-specific prednisone intermittence has shown positive outcomes of safety and benefits in a pilot
clinical trial, underscoring relevance and feasibility in humans. Our preliminary findings with obese diabetic mice
suggest that light-phase intermittent prednisone rescues NAD+ biogenesis, glucose metabolism and ceramide
lipotoxicity in heart, blunting diastolic dysfunction. This raises the unanticipated idea of repurposing GC drugs to
treat diabetic cardiomyopathy, but the mechanism underpinning this action must still be identified. Based on our
findings in three cardiomyocyte-restricted inducible KO models, we discovered a new GR-KLF15-BMAL1
mechanism regulating clock and metabolism in cardiomyocytes. We test here the overarching hypothe-
sis that this cardiomyocyte-autonomous axis is triggered by specific GC timing and rescues cardiomy-
opathy in type-2 diabetes. In Aim 1, we will identify the circadian cue gating the circadian-specific effect of
exogenous glucocorticoids in heart. We will test the hypothesis that the rhythmic trough of endogenous GCs is
the circadian cue mediating the circadian-specific effects of exogenous GCs in heart. In Aim 2, we will determine
the extent to which the cardiomyocyte clock discriminates beneficial versus deleterious outcomes of chronic GC
frequency. We will test the hypothesis that cardiomyocyte-specific BMAL1 is the discriminating factor in the dia-
betic heart response to chronic GC effects. In Aim 3, we will identify the mechanisms promoting insulin sensitivity
and glucose oxidation by the cardiomyocyte-specific GR-KLF15 axis. We will test the hypothesis that the cardi-
omyocyte GR-KLF15 axis rescues metabolic flexibility in the diabetic heart through a concerted program of
ceramide reduction and pyruvate oxidation, dependent on timing-specific GC exposure. In summary, our study
resolves the role of cardiomyocyte GR biology in heart metabolism, while identifying translational cues and drug-
gable mechanisms of GR-clock interplay for diabetic cardiomyopathy."

The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex protein meshwork that constitutes the architectural scaffold of all
tissues. In addition to its structural role, the ECM conveys biochemical signals to cells interpreted by receptors,
like integrins, and controlling diverse cellular functions including adhesion and migration. The ECM is thus a key
regulator of developmental processes and tissue homeostasis. Consequently, alterations in the composition and
assembly of the ECM meshwork have been linked to a plethora of diseases including fibrosis, and cancer.
Important progress toward understanding how the ECM meshwork is built and how the ECM govern cellular
phenotypes have been made by studying major ECM proteins such as fibronectin and collagens. However, using
sequence analysis, we have predicted that nearly 300 proteins can contribute to the ECM meshwork. Knowledge
regarding the roles of these other ECM proteins remains preliminary. This represents a significant gap in our
understanding of the ECM and in our ability to correct disease-causing ECM defects. We have recently become
interested in one of these understudied ECM proteins, SNED1, after having found that it was associated with
more highly aggressive breast cancers. Of clinical relevance, we found that higher SNED1 expression correlated
with a worse prognosis for breast cancer patients. To gain insights into SNED1’s functions, we generated the
first knockout (KO) mouse model of Sned1 and showed that Sned1 is an essential gene, since its KO resulted
in early neonatal lethality due, in part, to craniofacial malformations. Importantly, we recently identified the first
patients with SNED1 variants and they present with craniofacial malformations. Despite these observations, the
mechanisms by which SNED1 contributes to embryonic development and cancer metastasis are unknown.
Using novel tools we developed (antibodies, mouse models, cell lines, purified proteins), we have shown that
SNED1 forms fibers within the ECM scaffold and contributes to its overall organization. In this proposal, we will
test the hypothesis that SNED1 assembly in the ECM and its role in regulating ECM architecture depend on
SNED1’s interactions with other ECM proteins and integrins. Leveraging our unique toolkit and combining our
unique expertise in ECM protein biochemistry and ECM proteomics with state-of-the-art microscopy, we will
conduct a time-resolved structure/function analysis to map which domains of SNED1 mediate its incorporation
in the ECM (Aim 1); determine the role of ECM proteins/SNED1 interactions in SNED1 ECM assembly (Aim 2);
and identify the SNED1 receptors at the cell surface governing SNED1-dependent ECM organization and
responsible for the adhesive property of SNED1 (Aim 3)?
Our goal is to fill critical gaps in our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms leading to ECM assembly,
with respect to SNED1. This is a necessary step toward deciphering how perturbations of these mechanisms
can lead to developmental defects and cancer progression. This work will also pave the way to the development
of future therapeutic strategies to correct disease-causing alterations in ECM structure."

Arsenic in food and drinking water is a major global health concern. It is estimated that over 200 million
individuals are exposed to inorganic arsenic (iAs) at levels above the WHO provisional guideline value of 10µg/L
(ppb). Epidemiological and laboratory studies have suggested that prenatal exposure to low-to-moderate levels
of inorganic arsenic (iAs) may increase the risk of adverse health effects during early childhood as well as later
in life. However, there are limited research examining how arsenic exposure promotes allergic airway diseases
such as asthma, although there is growing documentation that arsenic exposure is associated with respiratory
symptoms. Our previous work, demonstrated in animal model, suggests that maternal exposures to house
allergens affect the immunological sensitization and lung growth of the neonate through epigenetic modifications
of the fetal gene transcription; which determines the offspring susceptibility to allergic airway
hyperresponsiveness (AHR). Certainly, these findings point to the epigenetic mechanism a possible mediator of
the multigenerational effect of environmental stressors on offspring’s asthma disease susceptibility. It has been
demonstrated that in utero exposure to iAs modified the structure and function of the postnatal lungs, which may
predispose the offspring to pulmonary dysfunction in adulthood. Nevertheless, less is known about how early-
life exposure to iAs promotes epigenetic regulation of allergic airway disease. We hypothesize that maternal iAs
exposure increases offspring asthma risk, in part through placental stress, which modulates epigenetic
reprograming of fetal lung development and later-life AHR phenotypes. This novel hypothesis will be tested via
two specific aims.
Specific Aim 1 is: To examine the epigenetic effect of iAs exposure on offspring lung function across the life
course and subsequent generations. We will define the critical window(s) of iAs exposure that results in later
sensitivity in asthma via epigenetic modification at lung genome. Additionally, we propose Specific Aim 2: To
investigate the influence of placental oxidative stress on epigenetic regulation of fetal lung development. In this
proposal, we will assess maternal placental function throughout the gestation and offspring’s lung function across
the adult life, using state-of-the-art physiological, molecular and epigenomic approaches. We will also determine
if the inheritance of epigenetic changes and sensitivity in the AHR of their offspring could be attenuated by
reducing placental reactive oxygen species. Taken together, our findings will allow us to not only understand the
epigenetic mechanisms by which maternal exposure to iAs reprograms the lung genome, but also how these
epigenetic changes are inherited by subsequent generations. We will provide a unique set of lung epigenetic
signatures and placental signatures for asthma risk and iAs exposure assessment, as well as considerable
insight into improving an early intervention strategy to reduce asthma risk in affected community."
10845649,"The discovery of NOTCH1 as the most prevalent oncogene in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)
patients raised hopes for targeted therapy in this cancer. Unfortunately, in clinical trials, the pan-Notch inhibitor
GSI caused dose-limiting toxicities, particularly intestinal, due to abrogation of Notch functions. Our idea to meet
this challenge stems from Drosophila studies showing that Notch requires co-binding transcriptional factor
partners at its response elements to generate cell-type specific gene expression programs. If these “Notch-
collaborating” transcription factors are hijacked to help drive Notch-induced T-ALL, then inhibiting them might
oppose Notch signals and circumvent GSI toxicities. Thus, our long-term goal is to identify Notch-collaborating
transcription factors and determine their potential as safe, therapeutic targets. In our preliminary data, we show
that ETS1 is the top-ranked Notch-associated transcription factor in the context of T cells, but not intestinal cells.
Compared to GSI, the effects of Ets1 inactivation were just as deleterious to T-ALL cells but were much milder
on intestinal homeostasis and overall health in mouse models. Mechanistically, we show that CDC73, the
scaffold component of the polymerase-associated factor complex (PAF1C), binds ETS1 and is recruited to
activate ETS1 response elements. One of these elements is a previously unrecognized but highly conserved
superenhancer, which we have tentatively labeled “E-Me” for “ETS1-dependent MYB enhancer”. Our objective
is to determine the effects of Ets1-dependent trans-factors and cis-elements on the control of oncogenic
transcriptional programs in Notch-activated T-ALL. We hypothesize that disrupting the ETS1-dependent
combinatorial control of transcriptional elements by targeting CDC73 or the E-Me will safely repress Notch-
induced T-ALL. To test this, we will determine the effects of inhibiting Ets1-dependent factors like Cdc73 on
leukemia maintenance in mouse and human models of T-ALL. We will also determine the effects of inhibiting
Ets1-dependent factors on oncogenic transcriptional programs and cis-element activation. Finally, we will
determine the role of the E-Me element where trans-acting factors are recruited by ETS1 to collectively drive the
oncogenic MYB effector pathway. Our work raises the possibility of targeting co-binding Notch-collaborating
transcriptional regulators like Ets1 that create the chromatin context that directs Notch functions. Here we will
establish Cdc73 as the bridge that connects Ets1 to transcriptional machinery and chromatin modifiers that
activate promoters and enhancer elements and highlight E-Me as an important example. Therefore, if successful,
our project is significant because we target the #1 ranked Notch-associated cofactor in a cancer to disable Notch-
driven oncogenic signals without the toxicities of pan-Notch inhibitors seen in clinical trials. This project is
innovative because, to our knowledge, no other Notch cofactor besides ETS1 has been shown to physically
recruit Notch to chromatin genome-wide with strong statistical and orthogonal rigor and with a strikingly high
convergence of Notch cofactor and Notch binding motifs that was validated by chromatin profiling."

 Nonhealing skin wounds are a major source of morbidity worldwide and becoming more of a burden due to
an increase in health care costs, an aging population, and growing incidence of diabetes. Non-healing skin
wounds occur in nearly 25% of diabetic patients, and ~6% are admitted to the hospital for wound-related
treatment, which if not successful, can lead to limb amputation or death. More advanced treatments such as
synthetic, resorbable dressings that are placed into the wound to provide a scaffolding for cell infiltration and
new tissue formation have started to gain clinical impact. However, currently available polymeric biomaterial
wound dressings degrade by hydrolysis, releasing acidic byproducts, creating an autocatalytic degradation
process. This can lead to inconsistent degradation rate over time and poor matching between the timeline of cell
infiltration / new tissue formation and the timeline of polymeric scaffold resorption.
 The overall goal of the current project is to develop and apply a next generation cellular reactive oxygen
species (ROS) degradable, fully synthetic foam wound dressing. These scaffolds are formed by the reaction of
ROS-degradable polythioketal (PTK) diols with isocyanate-containing compounds in the presence of a small
quantity of water. This generates a crosslinked polyurethane (resultant bond from reaction of isocyanate and
hydroxyl) network that is highly porous in nature due to CO2 generation via the blowing reaction between
isocyanates and water. The properties of the resultant polythioketal urethane (PTK-UR) foams can be tuned
based on the composition of the PTK diol crosslinker which makes up the bulk of the foam.
 We propose to develop a library of PTK diols with controlled variation in degree of hydrophilicity, consistent
density of thioketal bonds in the backbone, and low potential for immunogenicity. This plan is based on highly-
promising preliminary data that PTK-UR scaffold hydrophilicity is a critical factor in the wound healing response
to the PTK-UR biomaterials. The proposed polymer series will fill previous gaps in our previous work by yielding
a well-controlled, highly-scalable chemistry for better fine tuning of PTK-UR hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance
across a broad range with diol chemistries that are not based on potentially immunogenic PEG. The aims of the
project will involve synthesis and screening of this new class of thioketal diols, benchmarking of the leading PTK-
UR formulations against clinical products for wound healing efficacy, and application of lead PTK-UR
formulations for cargo delivery to promote healing in the context of pathological (infected and diabetic) wounds.
 Our multidisciplinary team includes bioengineers, polymer and polyurethane material chemists, preclinical
wound healing model and histopathology expertise, expertise in immunology of wound healing / skin wound
infection, and clinical wound care. This group is poised to achieve the proposed goals toward establishing a new
clinically impactful, cell-resorbable, synthetic polymer-based foam wound dressing."

Defining who is likely to respond to cancer immunotherapy and who may not benefit, due to primary/secondary
resistance or adverse events, is of critical interest for improving immuno-oncology (IO) treatments. Most clinical
trials of novel combinations either fail to include any support for complex correlative biomarker discovery, often
due to costs of specimen collection and assays, or are performed in an idiosyncratic manner, making non-
standardized data difficult to integrate as part of a larger repository. There is a need to go beyond just PD-L1
tissue expression and tumor mutation burden as FDA-approved yet imperfect predictors of immune checkpoint
blockade, by generating high-dimensional datasets that characterize the tumor immune microenvironment,
systemic circulating immune and proteomic markers from blood, and host-level immune fitness information
(microbiome). The Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Centers, Cancer Immunologic Data Commons, and
Partnership for Accelerating Cancer Therapies (CIMAC-CIDC-PACT) is a Cancer Moonshot-funded network that
brings together laboratory, clinical, and computational scientists, administrators, and regulatory specialists from
four institutions, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS), MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC),
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), and Stanford University. Our unprecedented, coordinated effort to conduct
IO clinical trial correlative studies and define new candidate biomarkers to improve immunotherapy had resulted
in 37 clinical trials selected in the first funding period, with ongoing datasets resulted for 17 of them. This was
achieved using rigorously assessed SOPs and processes from trial selection to data sharing. We propose to
continue and expand these efforts as follows: A set of well-established, harmonized, high-dimensional tumor and
blood-based assays will be applied to all newly selected trials, with the aim of evaluating and validating novel
biomarker of treatment, clinical response, and/or adverse events (Aim 1). To spur innovation and increase
granularity of our understanding of mechanism of action, high-tech yet validated single cell and spatial
transcriptomic technologies as well as other omics will be proposed in exceptional patients for unbiased
phenotyping, tissue composition, architectural organization, and immune profiling (Aim 2). The resulting unified
data repository will be mined to define multi-omic and cross-trial markers, through biostatistical and
computational innovative design to integrate datasets from various assays into higher analytical archetypes
across studies (Aim 3). Together, our network is at the forefront of immune monitoring standards, by balancing
innovation with reproducibility, to comprehensively assess biomarkers and strive for precision cancer treatment.
We are poised to create an unparalleled resource of harmonized, clinically annotated datasets shared with the
public that will establish best practice guidelines with the research community. Through rigorous implementation
of state-of-the-art, cross-compared platforms, the CIMAC-CIDC initiative aims to accelerate identification of
clinically actionable biomarkers of response, resistance, and adverse events, and define mechanisms at play."

Prescription stimulant diversion ([PSD] i.e., the sharing, selling, or trading of prescription stimulants) and
prescription stimulant misuse ([PSM] i.e., use without a prescription, use in excess of a prescription, or use for
nonmedical purposes) are inter-related and co-occurring problems on college campuses. In addition, PSD and
PSM are not limited to students with a prescription for stimulants (Lam et al., 2020; Garcia et al., 2022). Thus,
there is a need to universally screen and intervene upon both behaviors. Prior research has shown college
health providers [CHPs] are concerned about PSM and PSD, yet feel they lack training in strategies to address
these behaviors (Loskutova et al., 2020). As such, CHPs serve as ideal professionals for training and
implementing PSM and PSD intervention efforts. To that end, our team has developed a research- and theory-
guided PSM and PSD screening and brief intervention [SBI] curriculum to be implemented by CHPs.
The purpose of the proposed, three-year, R34 study is to engage CHPs and college students in the refining
and piloting of a SBI to address PSM and PSD. After completing start-up activities to promote content validity
and face validity, we propose three studies to achieve our three aims. In Study 1, a geographically diverse
sample of CHPs recruited from the American College Health Association member directory will assess the
appropriateness and clarity of the curriculum content, as well as provide insights on potential implementation
barriers and strategies to overcome barriers. The feedback provided will be used to refine the existing
curriculum prior to pilot testing (AIM 1: Refine a novel PSM and PSD SBI curriculum by engaging CHPs in the
development process). The pilot test will be completed at the campus health center of one diverse university
where PSD and PSM are prevalent. Students will be randomized to control, e-SBI, or face-to-face SBI
delivered by trained CHPs. Study 2 will focus on the CHPs; all CHPs who receive training will complete an
evaluation of the curriculum, and CHPs who implement the SBI will complete indicators of feasibility,
acceptability, and implementation (via the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity tool, qualitative
interview, and quantitative survey; AIM 2: Pilot test feasibility, acceptability, and implementation of the
intervention). Study 3 will run concurrently with Study 2, and will focus on the student participants. Acceptability
of the intervention will be measured immediately after participation (AIM 2) and impact on student PSM and
PSD outcomes will be measured at one-month follow-up (AIM 3: Evaluate the short-term impact of the
and PSD). Our goal is to apply the knowledge gained to refine a
curriculum that can be widely disseminated. Attainment of this goal could be applied to reduce morbidity and
mortality related to PSM and PSD.

One of the underappreciated effect of obesity is the repression of gut innate immunity, as we recently showed
in overweight/obese patients, using Paneth cell phenotype (as a surrogate for Paneth cell function) as a proof-
of-concept. Wild type mice fed with western diet (WD) also developed Paneth cell defects. We further showed
that WD consumption results in microbiota-mediated increase in deoxycholic acid (a secondary bile acid),
which activates the FXR pathway in the ileum. FXR activation in the intestinal epithelium, as well as FXR-
mediated type I interferon activation in myeloid cells, collectively trigger Paneth cell defects. The critical
questions that need to be addressed before translating these findings to clinic include how individual dietary
components that impact Paneth cell function, and if long-term WD consumption renders Paneth cell defects
irreversible to dietary switch alone. Our long-term goal is to dissect the cellular and molecular mechanisms of
how WD consumption affect the intestinal stem cell (ISC) and Paneth cell biology. These discoveries will
facilitate design of trials for obese patients with gut innate immunity dysfunction. The objective of this proposal
is to determine how WD consumption induces Paneth cell abnormality. The central hypothesis is that long-term
consumption of dietary fructose result in Paneth cell defect due to diminished capacity of Paneth cell
replenishment (by Paneth cells themselves and/or intestinal stem cells [ISC]). Our rationale is that identification
of the mechanism(s) to restore Paneth cell function will offer new therapeutic opportunities for many patients,
such as those with inflammatory bowel disease and graft versus host disease, of which Paneth cells play a
critical role in pathogenesis. Our preliminary data suggest that dietary fructose consumption alone is sufficient
to trigger Paneth cell defects, and that Paneth cell defects after long-term (≥12 months) WD consumption are
not reversible by switching to standard diet. Our specific aims will test the following hypotheses: (Aim1) How
dietary fructose directly induces Paneth cell defects; (Aim 2) Long-term WD consumption will impair the
capacity of Paneth cells as well as ISCs to repair and replenish defective Paneth cells. Upon conclusion, we
will understand the role for dietary fructose in modulating Paneth cell and ISC function. This contribution is
significant since it will establish intestinal epithelial fructose catabolism and associated genes as therapeutic
targets. The proposed research is innovative because we investigate how long-term exposure to poor diet on
gut innate immunity, a heretofore-unexamined process. We also use state-of-the-art ISC culture system and
scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq techniques to identify molecular and cellular targets that affect Paneth cell and
ISC functions. Identifying the mechanisms of how diets regulate a key disease-relevant cellular phenotype will
provide insight into other inflammatory disorders."

Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of childhood blindness. A pivotal aspect of early ROP
is an arrest in physiologic retinal vascular development. The retinal avascularity and consequent hypoxia
leads to proliferative blinding neovascularization (NV). Ischemia induces retinal cell dysfunction and
irreversible cell damage. NV aggravates vision deterioration. However, current clinical standard-of-care
targeting abnormal retinal NV does not improve and may even impair vision. The driving concept in this
proposal is to create a favorable retinal environment for cell survival, vascular repair and revascularization
of ischemic retina. Multiple retinal cell types participate in shaping retinal environment, including vascular
endothelial cells (ECs), retinal myeloid elements/microglia/macrophages (RMCs), and neuronal elements
such as retinal photoreceptor cells (PRCs) and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). The underlying mechanisms
for these cellular and molecular activities remain poorly defined. Sigma 1 Receptor (Sig1R), a unique
molecular chaperone, offers a novel approach to favorably enhance the retinal environment under disease
states. Activation of Sig1R provides protection against two major facets of the ischemic retina: oxidative
stress and inflammation. The PI’s previous research indicated powerful retinal neuroprotection of Sig1R in
retinal neurodegenerative diseases. Sig1R activation showed profound neuroprotection in retinal neurons
including PRCs and RGCs. Most-recent independent research by the PI has explored the role of Sig1R in
retinal vascular diseases including ROP. The PI’s preliminary data showed that: i) activation of Sig1R by its
ligand (+)-pentazocine ((+)-PTZ) can markedly protect against avascularity and NV in oxygen-induced
retinopathy (OIR, model of ROP); ii) (+)-PTZ administration significantly rescues impaired visual function in
OIR mice; iii) (+)-PTZ treatment inhibits the release of proinflammatory and proangiogenic factors in OIR
retina; iv) Sig1R knockout delays retinal vascular development at postnatal day 3. The next steps to assess
this promising bi-functional (vascular and neuronal) therapeutic potential will be to characterize the novel
role of Sig1R in retinal normal vascular development and vascular damage in OIR model, and further to
identify which cell types/molecules are modulated/targeted by Sig1R in its reprogramming of the retinal
response to ischemia in OIR. I propose to test the hypothesis that Sig1R acts as a novel key modulator of
normal retinal vascular development and neurovascular damage in OIR, limits vascular injury by promoting
reparative microglia/macrophages via inhibition of proinflammatory and proangiogenic factors, and provides
a novel neurovascular therapy for ROP. We propose three specific aims. 1) Characterize the role of Sig1R
in normal retinal vascular development and vascular damage in OIR model. 2) Test the hypothesis that
Sig1R limits vascular injury by promoting reparative RMCs via inhibition of proinflammatory and
proangiogenic factors. 3) Test the hypothesis that Sig1R plays a critical role in neuroprotection during ROP."

Chickens and their embryos provide a valuable research model for the study of developmental biology and
human diseases. However, their application has been greatly limited due to the lack of tools to genetically
modify chickens and other avian species. Recently, we have developed methods for the derivation of germline
competent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from chickens. The availability of germline competent chicken ESCs
opens up a new avenue for producing genetically engineered chickens. In this project, we propose to establish
an ESC-based platform for the efficient generation of chicken germline chimeras (Aim 1). We will also optimize
methods for the generation of primordial germ cells (PGCs) from chicken ESCs. These chicken ESC-derived
PGCs will be used to produce genetically modified chickens (Aim 2). In Aim 3, by taking the advantage of the
chicken ESC culture condition we have established, we will develop methods for the generation of induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from chicken embryonic fibroblasts. Successful completion of these three aims
will provide the avian research community with a powerful genetic toolkit for the production of transgenic and
gene-targeted avian species and for the conservation of endangered avian species."

 ARDS accounts for one in ten intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. Mortality in ARDS is estimated at 30 –
50%. Decades of clinical trials have failed to identify targeted pharmacotherapeutics that significantly impact
disease course. New insights are needed to broaden our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that
lead to ARDS to promote the development of novel therapeutics.
 Transfer RNA (tRNA) constitutes 10 – 20% of the total cellular RNA content. Although classically thought of
passive translational machinery, more recent studies show that tRNA can be dynamically regulated in
response to the environment. The post-translation modification of tRNA by methylation is one mechanism by
which tRNAs respond to cellular stress. Methylation of tRNAs can alter translation, change the distinction
between ‘self’ and ‘non-self’, and protect tRNAs from fragmentation. Despite this, the role of tRNAs in infection
and critical illness is unknown. We identified a methyltransferase enzyme, termed TRMT1 that is upregulated
in the human lung in response to infection. We also find that the methylation of tRNA by TRMT1 is altered in
response to inflammatory stimuli. Our preliminary data suggest that the TRMT1 is vital for macrophage viability
and host defense in infection, and for maintaining cytokine responses. This application focuses on the role of
the TRMT1 in acute lung injury and the investigation of tRNA biology, unexplored territory in ARDS and critical
care illnesses.
 During the execution of these studies, we will examine how myeloid TRMT1 contributes to
immunopathology in experimental lung injury. We will determine how TRMT1 alters inflammatory signaling and
regulates cell death in vitro and in vivo. To examine the mechanistic role of TRMT1, we will measure the
methylation of tRNA in response to inflammatory stimuli and the production of tRNA fragments. To further
explore the regulation of TRMT1, we will examine how subcellular trafficking of TRMT1 differentially regulates
cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNA methylation and how this alters the inflammatory response. Finally,
because cellular concentrations of TRMT1 protein may be crucial in regulating macrophage behavior and
viability we will examine the E3 ligase mediated ubiquitination and degradation of TRMT1.
 These studies will be the first to elucidate the role of TRMT1 in acute lung injury. In addition, these studies
will provide new insight into the role tRNA methylation in lung injury. The execution of these studies will provide
significant mechanistic and biological advances in the field of acute lung injury and ARDS and lead to novel
interventional targets for therapeutics."

The goal of this project is to determine how ipsilesional premotor cortex facilitates recovery of motor function
after ischemic injury in primary motor cortex. When an individual suffers damage to primary motor cortex, they
often experience permanent reductions in motor function, including decreased motor coordination, muscle
strength, movement speed and movement accuracy. While some spontaneous recovery can occur during the
ensuing weeks to months, functional impairments often persist, leading to a reduction in quality of life and an
increase in prolonged medical complications and expenses. Over the past two decades, basic research studies
in pre-clinical animal models of brain injury, as well as clinical populations, have suggested that the brain can
undergo structural and functional reorganization within and between spared regions. This neuroplasticity is
thought to underpin functional recovery, however its manifestation as increases in task-related motor function
has yet to be established. We have proposed that when primary motor cortex is damaged through ischemic
injury, spared sensorimotor areas can take over some volitional control of motor function, and that the ipsilesional
premotor cortex plays the biggest role in this control. In this project, we will investigate the timing and contribution
of premotor cortex on both spontaneous motor recovery and recovery facilitated by rehabilitative intervention in
a rat model of ischemic injury. First, we will establish the time period when premotor cortex contributions are
necessary for spontaneous recovery to occur by temporarily inactivating premotor cortex after the ischemic injury
(Aim 1). We will then determine if the task-related activity within premotor cortex is altered following the injury,
whether these alterations impact the population level encoding of these tasks, the role rehabilitation has in
shaping any novel task related activity and, if PM is inactivated, if task-related motor encoding occurs in other
cortical areas (Aim 2). Finally, we will establish the relationship between the timing of premotor cortex
reorganization and the strength of functional connectivity between spared areas using a stimulation-evoked
cortical connectivity measurement and then determine if this physiological marker matches the novel anatomical
sprouting from premotor cortex that occurs after an ischemic injury (Aim 3). This project is innovative as it uses
a within-animal model to assess 1) how different cortical areas reorganize to restore motor function and 2) the
impact of rehabilitation therapy on this reorganization. This project has a significant potential health impact, as
the elucidation of location, timing and mechanisms related to functional behavioral recovery, especially when
coupled to rehabilitative therapy, will create a complete picture of the neural substrates of recovery. This
information is critical to maximize existing therapies and give rise to novel applications for the treatment of brain
injuries."
10917240,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In primates, including humans, the macula and especially the fovea, is critical for high-acuity vision. The
metabolic needs of the fovea and macula are primarily met by the choriocapillaris, the capillary network of the
choroid located immediately behind Bruch’s membrane. There is considerable evidence that compromised
choroidal perfusion contributes to many eye diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic
retinopathy, that affect these retinal regions. Importantly, choroidal blood flow is substantially controlled by
inputs from the parasympathetic nervous system. However, the parasympathetic circuitry controlling the
choroidal vasculature in primates is very poorly understood. The precise locations of the pre- and
postganglionic parasympathetic motoneurons supplying the choroid, as well as their premotor inputs have not
been established, nor have the functional roles of these neurons been fully defined. Therefore, the overall goal
of this proposal is to determine the location and function of the parasympathetic circuits controlling the
choroidal vasculature in non-human primates. We propose to perform neuroanatomical, electrophysiological,
and pharmacological experiments to address these questions. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will use retrograde
tracers, both conventional and trans-synaptic, to identify the motor and premotor circuitry controlling the
parasympathetic innervation of the choroid. In the functional part of the study, we will use infrared (IR) laser
doppler flowmetry, IR laser speckle flowgraphy (LSFG), and optical coherence tomography (OCT)/OCT
angiography (OCTA) to measure the choroidal vasculature. Specifically, in Aim 2, we will study the effects on
the choroidal vasculature of modulating preganglionic motoneuron activity by electrical microstimulation and of
modulating retinal activity by light. In Aim 3A, we hypothesize that pharmacological inactivation of
preganglionic motoneurons reduces overall choroidal blood flow and thickness in darkness, reduces choroidal
blood flow compensation for changes in blood pressure, and eliminates luminance induced changes in the
choroidal vasculature. In Aim 3B, we hypothesize that electrolytic or chemical lesions of preganglionic
motoneurons will result in reduced choroidal blood flow. In the long term, we hypothesize that the retina will
show evidence of outer segment loss and inflammatory markers. We will non-invasively assess retina, retinal
pigment epithelium, and choroid health in life by OCT/OCTA, LSFG, and electroretinogram (ERG)/multifocal
ERG. We will further assess retinal health postmortem by retinal histology. The proposed experiments will
constitute the first extensive and systematic investigation of the circuitry and role of the parasympathetic,
preganglionic neurons controlling blood flow in the choroidal vasculature of a primate. These results will set the
stage for future studies in which this circuitry is modulated in order to improve the survival of central vision in
human macular degeneration."

The quality of nursing home care is an essential issue for the health and well-being of the elderly. For decades,
there have been widespread concerns about the quality of nursing home care in the US, as well as disparities
in the quality of care received across different groups. Exacerbating these issues are worries about the ability
of patients (or their caregivers) to assess nursing home quality, an issue that is particularly acute for patients
with Alzheimer’s disease or a related dementia (ADRD).
We propose to document the extent of disparities in the quality of Medicare-covered nursing home care
received, to investigate the forces behind those disparities, and to evaluate the impact of potential policy
interventions. We will focus on disparities across racial groups (specifically Black non-Hispanic patients
compared to White non-Hispanic patients), ethnic groups (Hispanic patients compared to non-Hispanic
patients), socio-economic status (patients dually-enrolled in Medicaid at admission or not), and health groups
(patients with and without ADRD on admission).
To accomplish this, we will build on our existing work estimating average value-added for each nursing home.
We created a measurement framework for estimating this value-added that can be applied to any health
measure (or combination of health measures) in the rich data on patient physical health, mental health, daily
functioning, dementia, and cognitive capacity available in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’
Minimum Data Set; these assessments cover all patients in Medicare and Medicaid certified nursing homes.
We propose to expand our framework to allow value added to differ across different groups of patients within
each nursing home, and then to use it to document the extent of disparities in nursing home quality
experienced by group. Then we will examine the disparities in value-added to determine what can be attributed
to differential treatment of patients within the same nursing home as opposed to different allocation of patients
across nursing homes. We will analyze the likely impact of alternative public policies on these disparities and
the health outcomes of nursing home residents. We aim to shed light on both the sources of disparities and the
potential of different types of policies on reducing disparities."
10916488,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT – Pilot and Exploratory Studies Core (PESC)
The overall goal of the Pilot and Exploratory Studies Core (PESC) is to promote innovative and
promising research addressing the predictors, outcomes and amelioration of late-life disability, especially
in vulnerable populations. This renewal application builds on the success of the OAIC PESC over the
past 9 years in which we have supported scholars from across the academic spectrum of seniority, from
residents to senior faculty. The impact of the OAIC PESC Scholars to date has been significant, resulting
in over $16 million in federal funding. For this cycle, we are placing special attention on the intense
pressures placed on junior faculty transitioning to independence and opportunities to catalyze their future
projects and career growth in our OAIC theme area. As a result, we will focus on supporting junior
scholars who already have a K award and are preparing for the transition to independence – namely, by
supporting pilot, exploratory and preliminary studies to facilitate a first R01 or equivalent award. We will
additionally maintain flexibility to prioritize scholars from underrepresented backgrounds interested in in
equity research, though they may be at earlier stages in training (i.e., pre-K). The PESC specific aims
are as follows: (1) Identify promising junior scholars interested in or committed to aging research focused
on the medical and social determinants of late-life disability, and support their transition from career
development awards to R01/equivalent awards with pilot and exploratory funding; (2) Integrate training
and support activities of the PESC (which is focused on K to R transitions) closely with the REC (which
is focused on obtaining K-awards) to develop a seamless program of support from pre-K fellows to
Associate Professors; (3) Provide PESC Scholars support in study design, analysis, recruitment and
retention of diverse and vulnerable populations through use of the OAIC Cores, specifically the Data and
Analysis Core (DAC) and the Vulnerable Aging Research Core (VARC); (4) Integrate PESC studies and
scholars with resources from the UCSF Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI), the Center
for Aging in Diverse Communities, the Center for Vulnerable Populations, and other relevant resources
at UCSF; and (5) Promote diversity among researchers in aging, through offering specific support for
pilot award candidates from diverse backgrounds who apply for PESC funding."
10916489,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT—Research Education Component (REC)
The overall goal of the Research Education Component (REC) is to identify, support, and nurture talented
junior investigators who will become national leaders in aging research, especially within our theme of late-life
disability in vulnerable populations. This renewal application builds on the success of the UCSF REC over the
past 9 years in identifying and fostering the development of an incredible talent pool of junior investigators
across a wide range of divisions, departments and schools (e.g., Anesthesiology, Dermatology, Geriatrics, HIV,
Hospital Medicine, Hepatology, Internal Medicine, Nephrology, Neurology, Nursing, Oncology, Palliative
Medicine, Psychiatry, Physical Therapy, Social Science, Surgery, Urology) towards independence in aging
research. The REC continues to focus on supporting junior faculty with exceptional potential for leadership in
aging research during two crucial points in their career: (1) obtaining NIH K-award funding and (2) the K-to-R
grant transition. The REC Scholars Program supports early career faculty who need protected time,
mentorship and educational resources to accelerate their path towards NIA K awards. The REC also provides
mentorship and educational resources to PESC Scholars with NIH K awards to accelerate their path towards
their first R01. Scholars complete an Individualized Development Plan to tailor their research and educational
experiences to their needs for becoming a leader in aging research in their specialty or discipline. Principles of
aging and health equity are core competencies threaded throughout elements of data collection, analysis,
manuscript and grant writing, communication and leadership. Also, REC leadership will work with leaders of
the Resource Cores to provide each scholar access to additional services, which have been central to the
success of our scholars during our first two cycles. The REC will continue to build on its strength of developing
investigators from diverse disciplines and specialties, including investigators at the interface of basic and
clinical research, to give them the tools, resources and leadership skills to succeed in aging research and
provide a pathway towards independence. The REC also sponsors a Diversity Supplement Program to
increase the number of faculty from underrepresented backgrounds conducting aging research at UCSF and
sponsors a summer aging research program to increase the number of students underrepresented in health
professions and has a close partnership with the UCSF Resource Center for Minority Aging Research. We are
proud of the paradigm-changing work of our scholars who have published in the highest impact journals,
received prestigious grants and become valued collaborators and partners in our mission to improve the health
of vulnerable elders."

how data can be used to inform actions to improve community health; (5) creating the research designs; (6)
designing, implementing, and evaluating interventions; and (7) disseminating findings. The overarching goal of
the Community-Liaison and Recruitment Core (CLRC) is to communicate and collaborate with community
organizations to increase the translation of the preventive strategies and interventions that are developed.
Developing and sustaining community partners, as well as training and engaging JHAD-RCMAR Scientists in
community-engaged research will reflect collaborative and synergistic work with other JHAD-RCMAR Cores.
Specifically, the CLRC will work with the Leadership and Administrative Core to develop collaborative
relationships with communities of faith, and community-based organizations as partners in designing
interventions to ameliorate health disparities in cognitive impairment and ADRD in minority older adults;
and identify and develop culturally appropriate mechanisms for disseminating information about AD/ADRD and
about related research results. The CLRC will also be guided by the Research Education Component to
establish new or adapt evidence-based intervention models that embrace community participation and future
trial results for minority older persons; train RCMAR scientists, investigators, and lay consumers about
community-engaged research, including the ethical dimensions; and develop the JHAD HBCU Initiative. In
addition, the CLRC will collaborate with the Analysis Core to enhance the capacity of representatives of
community-based organizations, faith communities, and primary care practitioners to participate in research as
partners in inquiry; and study recruitment and retention of older participants in ADRD-relevant research,
particularly minority older adults. By blending features of ‘clinical’ and ‘community’ approaches, we can better
address health disparities and have a significant public health impact on the health and well-being of an aging
population."

Longevity studies in mice are expensive and time-consuming, and there are currently no
measures that can predict mortality in a mouse at an earlier time-point. Additionally, there are
very few measures of the overall health of mice that can be assessed longitudinally. In
humans, frailty can predict mortality with greater power than the DNA methylation clock. In my
early postdoctoral work I have validated a mouse frailty index, that increases with age, is
associated with mortality and age-related pathologies, and is sensitive to interventions. In the
Sinclair lab I have used machine learning modelling of this mouse frailty index to make the
Analysis of Frailty in Death (AFRAID) clock that can predict the lifespan of male C57BL/6 mice
aged 21 months or older with accuracy of approximately 1.7 months. We hypothesis that a
frailty clock that includes a range of measures including physiological and molecular measures
(blood-based Analysis of Frailty in Death, bAFRAID) will accurately predict lifespan in younger,
female mice of a different strain. To test this hypothesis I will complete a battery of health
assessments, including blood collection for novel peptide biomarker detection, in male and
female UM-HET3 mice every 3 months from 15 months of age until death. I will use regression
modelling of all measured outcomes to develop an optimized `bAFRAID clock' that predicts
time to death in mice. I will complete this part of the project at Harvard Medical School in the
lab of Dr David Sinclair, who will act as my mentor and is an internationally recognised expert
in the biology of aging. I will receive additional training in biomarker modelling and peptidomics
from experts Drs Steve Horvath and Steve Gygi. For the independent phase of this award, I
will use longitudinal assessments, and cutting-edge epigenetic tools to investigate the
relationship between epigenetic changes and the AFRAID clock. This will increase our
understanding of whether epigenetic mechanisms underly the onset of frailty in aging. The
completion of this project and the proposed training will position me in an ideal position to
achieve my career goal of becoming an independent researcher with a lab focused on
understanding the mechanisms of frailty in aging."

The purpose of the University of Arizona’s (UA) Industrial Hygiene (IH) Program is to provide master’s level
graduate training in the core occupational safety and health area of IH. The Program began in 1978 and is
housed in the Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health (MEZCOPH). There are three tracks: MPH, MS,
and PhD; NIOSH support is requested only for the master’s degree programs. The Program is guided by 14 (11
regular and three adjunct) faculty members and an Industrial Advisory Committee made up of OSH/IH
professionals from the region. There are currently ten masters’ students and twelve doctoral students in the
program. The purpose of this NIOSH Training Project Grant funding application is to financially support IH
master’s students.
A unique strength of the UA IH program is our focus on mining health and safety and relationship with the recently
formed School of Mining and Mineral Resources (SMMR). Arizona and the Southwest have one of the richest
endowments of copper and related commodities on the planet. The mineral resource development industry has
a long history of occupational exposures that lead to workplace injury and illness. Solving these problems and
providing a healthy and safe workplace is the role of the professional IH. The UA IH program is the only program
of its kind in the Southwest so it must provide the bulk of the new IHs for the region. The master's’ programs
require forty-two credit hours to graduate, usually accomplished in two years. Comprehensive coursework is
provided in the key areas of IH including air monitoring theory and practice, occupational safety, physical
exposures, toxicology, and environmental health. Program graduates find employment as OSH professionals in
industry, government, and academia. With education obtained in the program, and depending on their previous
background, they can expect to sit for the CIH and/or CSP exam early in their career.
The program goals for the next budget period are: 1) to continue to provide MPH and MS level IH training to
increase the number of trained IHs, with a particular focus on the Southwest; 2) to continue to provide training
specific to exposures in the mining industry with opportunities for student internships and research projects; 3)
to maintain CEPH accreditation; 4) and to expand training, internship and student research opportunities focused
on microbiological exposures. Diversity is a priority for the program, and the University will continue to support
this through its emphasis on diversity recruiting throughout the southwest."

Genetic variants in APOL1 commonly found in people of Western Sub-Saharan Africa ancestry
are associated with kidney diseases such as Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis, Hypertension
Attributed-End Stage Kidney Disease, and HIV-Associated Nephropathy. The presence of 2
APOL1- renal risk variants (RRV) in deceased donors is associated with 2-to-4-times higher risk
of renal graft loss in the recipient. Living donors with APOL1 risk alleles may be at risk for kidney
disease. The NIH established the “APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes”
(APOLLO) U01 Consortium in 2017. The APOLLO Consortium includes 13 clinical centers
(CCs) with 4 paired core Centers to study the role of APOL1. The Johns Hopkins/Saint Louis
University CC is CC3. The primary objectives of the APOLLO Consortium are to assess
outcomes in patients across the entire United States who receive a kidney from an AA donor, or
other individuals with recent African ancestry, and to evaluate the association of APOL1 genotype
with renal allograft function-related outcomes. The primary outcome is time to graft failure in the
recipients. Other outcomes include the rate of change of kidney function in recipients, rates of
acute rejection of the kidney transplant, and proteinuria. The APOLLO Consortium also ascertains
meaningful longitudinal outcomes in AA living donors (LDs), focusing on vital status and renal
function, as well as proteinuria. While APOLLO enrolls LDs, their relative numbers have been
limited, highlighting the need for additional studies designed to more thoroughly define the
relationships of APOL1 genotype with long-term LD outcomes This application seeks to build on
and extend the findings of the APOLLO study to inform clinical practice by a) providing data
regarding the effects of APOL1 genotype on outcomes of the recipients of kidneys from AA
donors, b) providing data regarding the effects of APOL1 genotype on long-term survival and
renal functional outcomes of AA LDs and their recipients, and c) establishing a resource of clinical
and genetic data and biological specimens for the APOLLO Consortium and other future
researchers through the NIDDK Central Repository."

pathogenic viruses that limits viral replication, induces apoptosis/autophagy of infected cells, and mobilizes
other immune responses. Although strategic circumvention of IFN responses is a hallmark of many viruses, it
has not been fully defined in HSV-1 infections. Using recombinant viruses to dissect of the roles of individual
cytokines in the context of the complex in vivo immune response environment, we have generated compelling
preliminary data that indicate that circumvention of the type 1 IFN response plays a key role in both primary
HSV-1 infection and subsequent induction of latency in mouse models of ocular infection and implicate the
latency-associated transcript (LAT) of HSV-1 in modulation of the effects. IFN and IFN transcripts are
significantly downregulated in the trigeminal ganglia (TG) of wild-type mice after ocular infection with LAT(+)
virus as compared with LAT(-) virus. HSV-1 recombinant viruses expressing anti-apoptotic genes in place of
LAT restore the LAT(+) survival phenotype to IFNAR1-/- infected mice, which are more susceptible to HSV-1
infection than wt mice. These activities of LAT map to an 811 bp region of LAT, which encodes small non-
coding RNAs (sncRNAs). These and other data suggest a highly innovative hypothetical model in which HSV-1
LAT promotes HSV-1 evasion of clearance by the IFN system during both primary ocular infection and
reactivation in the TG by: (i) Suppressing the production of IFN2 and/or IFN; and (ii) Limiting the apoptotic
effects of IFN production. This hypothesis will be tested in mouse models by: (1) Determining if HSV-1 down-
regulation of IFN2 and IFN, but not IFN, affects primary infection, establishment of latency, and reactivation
in the TG after ocular HSV-1 infection; fine mapping of the regions of LAT involved in these processes; and
analysis of the binding of the sncRNAs to IFN2 and IFN promoters in vitro; (2) Identification of the specific
roles of LAT in protecting against infection in IFNAR1-/- mice through analysis of apoptosis induction and
interference with replication together with fine-mapping of the regions of LAT that mediate these effects; and
(3) Analysis of the differential and combinatorial roles of LAT-dependent IFN2 and IFN regulation in latency-
reactivation and primary HSV-1 infection using IFN-/-, IFN2-/-, and IFN2-/-IFN-/- mice. The results
generated will identify the primary mechanisms utilized by HSV-1 to evade the host IFN system and provide a
basis for strategies that can be used to prevent infection and minimize recurrent disease."

 Brucella spp. cause one of the world’s leading zoonotic diseases and are a major public health threat in
areas of the world where brucellosis is endemic in food animals. The Zn finger protein MucR is a global
regulator and essential virulence determinant in Brucella, but precisely how MucR contributes to virulence is
unresolved. Studies in our laboratory have provided compelling evidence that MucR is a novel type of H-NS-
like gene silencer and identified multiple virulence genes that are direct targets of MucR repression. H-NS and
H-NS-like gene silencers play critical roles in coordinating the proper temporal expression of virulence genes in
other bacterial pathogens. This tight regulation is crucial because the gratuitous expression of virulence genes
causes fitness defects that can lead to attenuation in the host. The studies described in this application will use
genetic and biochemical approaches to – a) directly test the hypothesis that MucR is a novel type of H-NS-like
gene silencer; b) identify the antagonistic transcriptional activators that serve as ‘counter-silencers’ and
override MucR-silencing of specific Brucella virulence genes; and c) test the hypothesis that coordinated
regulation of specific virulence genes by MucR/counter-silencer pairs is required for the wild-type virulence of
B. abortus 2308 in mice and cultured mammalian cells. The same biochemical properties that allow H-NS and
H-NS-like proteins to serve as gene silencers also allow them to play major roles in condensing bacterial
chromosomes and maintaining nucleoid structure. We have recently used chromosome conformation capture
studies (Hi-C) to show that MucR also has nucleoid-structuring activity, and we plan to use this approach in
combination with global and gene-specific transcriptional analysis to evaluate the impact that MucR’s nucleoid-
structuring activity has on its capacity to function as a gene silencer. Our proposed research will provide a
much better understanding of how MucR functions as a genetic regulator and virulence determinant in
Brucella. It will also allow us to further examine a previously uncharacterized role for a Zn finger protein in
prokaryotic biology."

Nucleotide excision repair (NER) protects human cells by removing harmful DNA damage, but repair of
damaged DNA by NER can reduce the efficacy of some antitumor drugs such as cisplatin. NER genes are
frequently missense mutated in cancers and decreased expression or loss of function mutation of NER genes
ERCC1 and ERCC2, respectively, has been shown to correlate with improved patient outcomes after cisplatin
treatment. This proposal investigates the hypothesis that reduced NER capacity arising from tumor mutations
correlates with greater sensitivity to platinum (Pt) agents. It focuses on the NER scaffolding protein XPA, which
is required for proper assembly and organization of the NER machinery. XPA is an “Achilles Heel” of NER
because it interacts with the DNA substrate and nearly all core NER proteins. Our recent publications (i) show
NER is suppressed by XPA mutations that inhibit interaction with its partner scaffold RPA, and (ii) identify XPA
mutations from tumor genomes that disrupt NER, including some that our current work suggests are highly
likely to disrupt the interaction of XPA with RPA. Thus, XPA represents the ideal factor to investigate the
hypothesis that reduced NER capacity correlates with sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. Aim 1 will test the
hypothesis that missense mutations in XPA can lead to NER defects that reduce repair capacity and sensitize
tumor cells to Pt agents. XPA mutations will be screened for reduced NER capacity using a high throughput
reporter assay to select those for which NER deficiency will be further characterized in cells expressing XPA
mutants. We will then determine the mechanism of their dysfunction and test their sensitivity to Pt agents. Aim
2 will use a fragment-based discovery approach to develop small molecule inhibitors that disrupt the XPA-RPA
interaction to enable further tests of the correlation between NER capacity and sensitivity to Pt agents. A highly
curated library of small molecular fragments will be screened by NMR and the binding location and orientation
of ‘hits’ will be defined by X-ray crystallography. After cycles of optimization involving structural analysis, design,
and evaluation, linked fragment compounds will be validated for physically inhibiting XPA-RPA interaction,
suppressing NER, and eliciting sensitivity to Pt agents in cancer cell lines. Together, these aims will not only
test the correlation between NER deficiency and sensitivity to Pt agents, but also generate tool compounds
that lay the foundation for testing the therapeutic value of inhibiting NER. They will also provide valuable insights
to move closer to the use of Pt sensitivity predictors in the clinic and explore how NER inhibition affects
sensitivity to other DNA damaging agents. Ultimately, we seek to understand how the tumor genomic landscape
predisposes cancer cells to drug sensitivity to enable identification of patient tumors that will be sensitive to
DNA damaging agents alone or require combinatorial treatment with NER inhibitors."

The over-arching goal of this project is to address several major challenges to biologic interpretation, functional
validation, and clinical translation of genetic association findings for quantitative red blood cell traits and non-
malignant blood cell disorders in the post-genomic era. We seek to significantly advance the work that we have
done over the current funding cycle to define how genetic variants can impact erythrocyte (red blood cell) traits
and to functionally define mechanisms through which these variants act. In Aim 1, we will apply state-of-the-art
statistical genomic and computational tools to extremely large human multi-ethnic datasets containing nearly 1
million individuals with red blood cell traits (hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC count, MCV, MCH, MCHC, red cell
distribution width or RDW) and whole genome sequence (WGS) or exome sequence data (the NHLBI TOPMed
WGS project, UK Biobank, All of Us, and deCODE) to provide updated analysis, discovery, and interpretation of
results, particularly for rare and ancestry-specific genetic variants associated with red blood cell counts and
indices. We will include analysis of genomic regions missed by prior GWAS efforts such as large structural
variants, variants on the X chromosome, and mitochondrial DNA copy number. Validation of new red blood cell
phenotype-associated genomic loci and genetic variants will occur through imputation and replication in
independent data sets using TOPMed WGS as imputation reference panel. We will also continue to provide
functional annotation, fine-mapping, and prioritization for new and existing red blood cell trait-associated variants
and genes, with an emphasis on utilization of newer multi-omic data sets derived from African and Hispanic
individuals that are becoming available through the TOPMed project. In Aim 2, we will assess the contribution
of polygenic variation (across the entire allele frequency spectrum) as phenotypic modifiers of red cell disorders
such as anemia and erythrocytosis, phenotypic expressivity of high-impact Mendelian red cell disorders, and the
contribution of red cell polygenicity to other complex disorders such as venous thromboembolic disease, stroke,
and COVID-19 disease severity. In Aim 3, building on previous integrative genomic and functional analyses to
define relevant hematopoietic cell states and mechanisms, we will develop comprehensive maps of how genetic
variation associated with red blood cell traits can impact human hematopoiesis using emerging single-cell
epigenomic chromatin accessibility and RNA sequencing atlases to provide predictive assessments of regulatory
non-coding variation and function. We will disseminate all genomic, annotation, and functional information
derived from Aims 1, 2, and 3 to ensure knowledge dissemination to the clinical and scientific community, for
discovery, fine-mapping, and investigation of causal genes that underlie red blood cell traits and hematological
disorders."

Children’s exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV), often perpetrated by fathers, has been described as a
gateway to other adversity, with more than a 50% co-occurrence of direct forms of child maltreatment (CM).
IPV exposure can wreak havoc on children, with risk for psychosocial impairments, including posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), that can emerge early and cascade across development. Lacking are interventions
that adequately address the complex nature of IPV in families, including fatherhood and coparenting. This gap
reflects a bias towards excluding offending fathers from child-focused work and an overreliance on batterer
intervention programs (BIPs), which have shown negligible effects in meta-analyses and fail to address the
roots of offending behaviors in fathers. Consequently, IPV exposed children remain at risk and fathers’
personal and interpersonal functioning, including the father-child relationship, does not improve. In effect, there
is an urgent need for effective interventions for fathers and their families. Fathers for Change (F4C) is a novel
fatherhood-focused intervention with a dual focus on IPV and CM that focuses on identifying, understanding,
and managing emotions to reduce aggression and improve partner and parent-child interactions. F4C has a
growing evidence-base demonstrating significant reductions in family violence, improved father-child
interactions, and in one open trial, improved child mental health. Proposed therapeutic mechanisms of F4C
include reflective functioning (RF), the capacity for parents to understand their own and children’s actions as a
function of underlying states and motivations, and emotion regulation (ER), the capacity to exert control over
emotional states and reactions to threat. Poor RF and ER have been associated with increased family violence
and stress-related psychopathology, suggesting key focal points for intervention. To date, there have been no
empirical examinations of ER and RF as therapeutic change mechanisms for reducing family violence and
improving father-child interactions and child mental health. Proposed is a dual-site, multi-modal examination of
ER and RF in fathers (of children 4-7 y.o.) randomized to F4C (N=180) or the Duluth Model (N=180), a BIP
serving as active control. In-session observational coding will assess adaptive and maladaptive ER and RF
across treatment. Weekly self-ratings will assess at-home ER and RF. Aims will (1) assess efficacy of F4C
compared to a standard BIP in reducing family violence and child mental health impairment, (2) identify and
compare trajectories of therapeutic change targets across interventions, and (3) examine the mediating role of
father’s ER and RF on child-related outcomes. This proposal will grow the evidence-base for F4C and advance
our understanding of therapeutic mechanisms through which F4C exerts its effects."

Sleep plays a critical role in a vast array of physiological and pathophysiological processes, including executive
brain functions, immune and metabolic functions, and neurodegenerative diseases. An improved understanding
of sleep mechanisms is important to developing new treatment strategies. Sleep circuits can be manipulated
with numerous techniques to infer causal relationships to physiology and behavior. Effects of these
manipulations are generally sleep stage or brain state dependent. Thus, closed-loop interrogation provides a
powerful paradigm, whereby a temporally precise manipulation (optogenetic, electrical, or sensory stimulation)
is delivered in a brain-state dependent manner. This paradigm has been used successfully in mice and humans
tethered to data acquisition, state classification, and stimulation hardware. However, tethering can adversely
affect natural sleep behavior and prevents use in larger animal models. Here, we propose to develop a fully
integrated, wireless, sleep modulation system-on-chip (SoC) with the capability to deliver state-dependent,
temporally-precise optical, electrical, and auditory stimulation. In Aims 1 and 2, Co-PI Dr. Liu will iteratively
develop an ultra-low-power SoC for polysomnography (PSG) signal acquisition and multi-modal closed-loop
stimulation. The final SoC will have five modules: (1) a low-noise, high-precision PSG acquisition module, (2) a
programmable mixed-signal data compression module for energy efficiency, (3) a low-power ultra-wideband
wireless transmitter, (4) a machine learning-based sleep stage classification module, and (5) a fully
programmable multi-modal stimulator. Full integration of the system will result in a small (2 cm3), light (2 g)
battery-powered device able to operate continuously for over 10 h on a single charge. In Aim 3, running
concurrently with the first two aims, Co-PI Dr. Richardson will validate performance of the SoC with sleep studies
in both small (rats) and large (macaques) animal models. Interleaved recordings from the wireless SoC and a
tethered commercial system will assess fidelity of compressed PSG acquisition and the impact of tethering on
sleep architecture. Real-time 2-stage and all-stage classifiers will be compared to offline ground truth labels.
Finally, in-phase closed-loop auditory stimulation will be used to enhance slow wave activity. Our team is
uniquely qualified for this proposal since we have extensive experience developing the key modules in the
proposed SoC and using wireless electronics for free behavior electrophysiological experiments in both animal
models. Once developed, two industry partners, CMC Microsystems and Open Ephys, Inc., will facilitate
distribution of the SoC to the worldwide community. The closed-loop SoC will enable unprecedented hypothesis-
driven research on sleep-stage specific neural circuits and interventions in models spanning from mice to
monkeys, thereby accelerating the mechanistic understanding of sleep and treatment of sleep disorders."

 Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic pathogen of humans. It is the principal cause of
morbidity and mortality in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients, a major cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia and is
particulary problematic in burn wound infections. Hfq is a conserved global post-transcriptional regulator that is
required for the virulence of P. aeruginosa. In other organisms Hfq is best known for its ability to promote the
base-pairing between small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) and their target transcripts. Hfq-promoted interaction
between an sRNA and its mRNA target typically functions to repress translation of the target, although Hfq can
also inhibit translation in an sRNA-independent fashion. We have found that in P. aeruginosa Hfq associates
with hundreds of transcripts as they emerge from RNA polymerase. Because transcription and translation are
coupled in bacteria, the interaction of Hfq with these nascent transcripts presumably allows this RNA-binding
protein to exert its regulatory effects on translation at the earliest possible opportunity. In Aim 1 we propose to
identify the targets of all the sRNAs that interact with Hfq in P. aeruginosa and determine whether these
sRNAs frequently work in conjunction with Hfq on nascent transcripts. The interaction of Hfq with nascent
transcripts has important implications for how transcript abundance can be controlled; specifically, Hfq-
dependent inhibition of the translation of nascent transcripts would render them accessible to the transcription
termination factor Rho or to ribonucleases. In Aim 1 we will determine whether Hfq reduces the abundance of
those nascent transcripts it binds through effects on Rho-mediated transcription termination or through effects
on RNA degradation. We have found that a second global post-transcriptional regulator in P. aeruginosa called
RsmA also targets hundreds of nascent transcripts, including many of those that are targeted by Hfq. RsmA is
a key regulator of the switch between acute and chronic infection phenotypes in P. aeruginosa and in Aim 2 we
will investigate whether Hfq and RsmA modulate each other’s activities through competition or cooperation on
common targets. Like Hfq, the binding of RsmA to target mRNA species typically inhibits their translation. In
Aim 3 we propose to determine whether the interaction of RsmA with nascent transcripts influences their
abundance through effects on Rho-mediated transcription termination or effects on RNA degradation. The
experiments outlined in this proposal are expected to illuminate how Hfq and RsmA control gene expression
through their widespread targeting of nascent transcripts. The co-transcriptional activities of these global post-
transcriptional regulators have been underexplored and our proposed studies may have implications not only
for how Hfq and RsmA impact the virulence of P. aeruginosa, but also for how their orthologs influence
virulence gene expression in other pathogenic bacteria that contain them."
10891717,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The project goal is to understand how age-associated changes to the lymph nodes contribute to decreased
survival of naïve T cells, a hallmark of immune aging. Naïve T cells are essential for resolving infections caused
by newly encountered pathogens, but their number and frequency within the T cell population decrease
dramatically with age. This contributes to reduced magnitude and delayed timing of the aged immune response
against infectious disease. Naïve T cell survival requires constant signaling from the tissue environment, and it
has been well-supported that the aged environment is defective in its ability to maintain naïve T cell homeostasis.
Naïve T cells primarily interact with the tissues of the lymph nodes, organized tissue compartments strategically
located throughout the body that serve as coordination centers for the immune response. Broad changes to the
size and structure of the lymph nodes have been described with age, for both mice and humans; however, the
mechanisms driving these changes, and how they impact naïve T cells, are unknown. Our data have revealed
changes with age to the lymph node stromal cell type known as the fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC). Naïve T cells
adhere to FRCs and crawl along the FRC network to navigate the lymph nodes. FRCs differentiate in situ in a
process that requires continuous lymphotoxin-beta (LTβ) signaling. Mature FRCs express homeostatic cytokines
that are essential for naive T cell survival and chemokines that promote interactions and motility within the lymph
nodes. Homeostatic chemokines such as CCL21 have well-appreciated roles in promoting naïve T cell
recruitment to and migration within the lymph nodes, but how their expression and distribution are impacted by
age is not clear. In our preliminary work, we determined that lymph node stromal expression of Ltbr (lymphotoxin-
beta receptor) and Ccl21 were significantly decreased with age. We also found evidence that FRC differentiation
is impaired with age, in that early FRC precursors were decreased in frequency, and that there was an
accumulation intermediate FRC precursors. The perturbation to FRC precursors was correlated to decreased
expression of LTBR, suggesting that aged FRC precursors were unable to receive the LTβ signals necessary to
complete maturation. We hypothesize that with impaired FRC differentiation, FRCs become fibrotic and spatially
redistributed within the lymph node, which inhibits the interactions necessary for naïve T cell survival. In this
project we will determine the role of age-associated inflammation in impairing signals through LTβR and
promoting lymph node fibrosis (Aim 1), and whether increased fibrosis of the lymph node microenvironment
impairs naïve T cell survival (Aim 2). Our experimental approach uses live-cell 2-photon microscopy, which
enables us to visualize the interaction of naïve T cells with FRCs in real time within intact tissues. The completion
of the project will support a mechanism by which the aged tissue microenvironment drives the attrition of naïve
T cells. Establishing this link can lead to development of therapeutics to restore the aged lymph node stroma
and promote the survival and function of naïve T cells in older individuals."

This proposal tests a novel approach to treating hyperadrenergic autonomic crises in patients with a rare ge-
netic disease – familial dysautonomia (FD). FD is caused by an autosomal recessive mutation in the ELP1
gene and manifests in developmental delay, musculoskeletal abnormalities, labile blood pressure, chronic lung
infections, difficulty swallowing, and optic nerve atrophy. There are no disease-modifying therapies for FD. Hy-
peradrenergic autonomic crises are the most frequent and severe symptoms of FD, occurring as often as once
per day, with a median occurrence of once per month, are triggered by either physical illness or emotional exci-
tation, and entail acute elevation in blood pressure and heart rate, accompanied by continuous vomiting and
retching. Autonomic crises can be deadly or lead to secondary complications (i.e., bronchoaspiration; infec-
tions). Current approaches towards autonomic crisis resolution at home involve non-pharmacologic treatments
to decrease the sympathetic surge followed by benzodiazepines and clonidine, which may produce sedation
and carry severe side effects, such as hypotension and respiratory depression. Effective and safe therapies
that could abort or prevent autonomic crises in the at-home setting are desperately needed.
This study will test a novel approach toward autonomic crisis resolution at home. At the core of this approach is
the administration of sublingual dexmedetomidine (IGALMI™; BioExcel Therapeutics, Inc). IV dexmedetomi-
dine is the standard of care for aborting refractory autonomic crises when delivered intravenously (IV) but can
only administered in the ICU. The innovation of this new presentation lies in its mode of drug delivery, a sublin-
gual fast-absorbing film that can circumvent a patient’s swallowing difficulties and vomiting episodes, allow for
easy administration of the medication at home, and prevent hospitalizations. This study hypothesizes that
IGALMI™ film is more effective than placebo and non-pharmacologic treatments in terminating autonomic cri-
ses at home. Concurrently with IGALMI™ treatment, FD patients will undergo non-pharmacological interven-
tion via telemedicine and help manage symptoms and vital signs monitoring. An exploratory aim of this study is
the development of a methodology for predicting autonomic crisis onset 24 hours before the event to prevent
the crisis through early intervention. This will be achieved by collecting continuous data on patients’ trend
changes in vital signs through wearable device and AI analytics. In Aim 1 of this clinical trial, fifteen FD patients
will be randomized 2:1 into active treatment (IGALMI™) and placebo groups to receive medication/placebo at
the onset of the autonomic crisis in addition to non-pharmacological assistance through video. In Aim 2, we will
evaluate if patients had fewer hospital stays than the previous year by using IGALMI™ at home for crisis man-
agement. In Aim 3 of this study, data collected through a wearable Biobeat® device will be analyzed to identify
early signs of AC for each patient."
10890832,"Project Summary/Abstract: The pathologic hallmarks of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus) are
altered immune responses to nuclear autoantigens with autoantibody production and subsequent tissue injury.
Studies have suggested a pathogenic role for innate immunity in lupus. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells and
monocytes (MO) of innate immunity recognize ssRNA of the self antigen U1-small nuclear ribonucleoprotein
(U1-snRNP) and dsDNA via TLRs 7/8 and 9, respectively, leading to the production of IFN-α, IL-1β and IL-18
which are linked to lupus pathogenesis and clinical manifestations. Regulated cell death can occur in distinct
forms including pyroptosis and necroptosis. Pyroptosis and necroptosis cause inflammation by releasing
inflammatory molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs).
Pyroptosis is induced by the activation of the caspase-1-containing inflammasomes that cleave pro-IL-1β and -
IL18 into IL-1β and IL-18, as well as gasdermin D (GASDMD) into the active form gasdermin D amino-terminal
fragment (GASDMDN), the essential molecule for membrane pore formation in pyroptosis. Necroptosis that
occurs independently of caspases is regulated by TNF-α, receptor-interacting protein kinases 1 and 3 (RIPK1
and RIPK3), and downstream substrate pseudokinase mixed-lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL), the critical
molecule for membrane disruption with the release of inflammatory molecules in necroptosis. RIPK3 and MLKL
can also activate the NLRP3 inflammasome with IL-1β release, raising the possible interface of pyroptosis and
necroptosis. Studies, including our own, support the implication of the inflammasome activation, pyroptosis, and
necroptosis in lupus. We showed IL-1β and IL-18 production from human MO exposed to lupus U1-snRNP/anti-
U1-snRNP antibody (Ab) or dsDNA/anti-dsDNA Ab immune complex (snRNP IC or dsDNA IC, also lupus IC
refers to both) through the NLRP3 inflammasome activation which is enhanced by the cytokine macrophage
migration inhibitory factor (MIF). However, there is a substantial scientific gap in our understanding of how
pyroptic and necroptic pathways become activated, interface, and synergize to promote inflammation in lupus at
molecular levels with contributing to unique clinical manifestations. Thus, we will test the hypotheses that lupus
IC activate pyroptic and necroptic pathways in MO with synergistic interface in promoting inflammation and tissue
injury and that the activation of such pathways alters in lupus contributing to clinicopathologic manifestations.
The goal of the proposal is to address this hypothesis with: 1) Aim 1. Elucidate the mechanism and significance
of the activation and interface of pyroptic and necroptic molecules in lupus; 2) Aim 2. Elucidate the “functional”
alteration in monocytes that enhances pyroptosis- and necroptosis-mediated inflammation in lupus patients; and
3) Aim 3. Elucidate the role of macrophage migration inhibitory factor in promoting inflammation in lupus via
regulating pyroptic and necroptic molecules. Our study would be highly informative in understanding lupus
pathogenesis as well as in developing new approaches in evaluating and treating lupus patients."

Blindness can be caused by many genetic mutations that lead to degeneration of the retina, but most of these
diseases have no treatments. The development of safe and effective treatments critically depends on the
ability to test them in appropriate animal models before using them in human patients. Because nonhuman
primates are the only animals with retinal structure like humans, including the macula that underlies central
vision, they have the potential to provide the most accurate and informative models of blinding diseases.
Indeed, the lack of such models has been identified as a major impediment to the rapid translation of promising
therapies to clinical use for preventing and treating blindness.
We have spent many years screening the large macaque colony at the Oregon National Primate Research
Center for naturally-occurring retinal diseases. We recently discovered a family of rhesus monkeys with
Bardet-Biedl syndrome, an inherited disease resulting in severe retinal degeneration combined with kidney
disease, which closely resembles the human form of this disorder. We identified the cause as a mutation in the
BBS7 gene, genotyped a pedigree including at least 50 carriers, and examined the nature of the retinal
degeneration by histopathology. We now propose to propagate this model, and use it to test a novel gene
therapy with high potential to preserve and restore sight in this and similar diseases in human patients.
The specific aims of this proposal are:
1. To breed animals with Bardet-Biedl syndrome and determine the characteristics and time course of the
disease.
2. To deliver a gene therapy to animals with this disease and evaluate its ability to preserve or restore central
vision.
This spontaneously-occurring monkey disorder closely mirrors Bardet-Biedl syndrome as seen in human
patients. In addition to providing a model of this specific genetic disease, it also provides a model for the large
family of similar retinal degenerations called retinitis pigmentosa that together are a major inherited cause of
blindness. This discovery provides us with a unique opportunity to propagate and characterize a primate model
of an inherited retinal degeneration and to use these animals to test gene therapy approaches to therapy for
this entire class of blinding disorders. Our goal is to develop a method to preserve and restore vision in human
patients with this and many other blinding diseases."

The human microbiome is integrally related to a vast range of human disorders and represents an imperative
gateway toward mitigating the burden of these diseases, particularly as the microbiome is eminently modifiable.
This has culminated in microbially oriented risk reduction and clinical interventions, which have proven
efficacious in diverse situations ranging from infections to cancer immunotherapy. However, despite some high-
profile successes, many other studies have failed. A central theme underlying these failures, and even many of
the success stories, is our fundamentally limited understanding of how microbes interact with each other, with
host genomics, and with outcomes. Recently, efforts to assess and map these relationships are taking place
within large-scale profiling studies, but unfortunately, the tools used for elucidating these connections may be
underpowered, difficult to interpret, or even subject to severe false positives due to strong underlying
assumptions. Therefore, motivated by problems within three of the largest and richest microbiome profiling
studies, this proposal seeks to fill critical gaps in the methodological literature by addressing four major areas.
Specifically, we aim to develop a comprehensive suite of tools for (1) enhanced microbial co-occurrence network
construction; (2) enhanced discovery of SNPs and rare variants associated with individual microbial taxa; and
(3) assessing the role of microbes through Mendelian Randomization. These approaches are all based on
rigorous prior data emphasizing the importance of the problems as well as the limitations of existing strategies.
Our work is motivated by and will directly enable analyses in three of the largest and richest microbiome profiling
studies, including the MEC and SOL cohorts which study the gut microbiome, and the PIN cohort, which explores
the vaginal microbiome in pregnancy. Accordingly, the methods we develop have the potential to improve our
fundamental knowledge of the microbiome and propel the field towards enhanced risk reduction and clinical
interventions."

Histopathological examination of tissue is a pillar of modern medicine and biological research. Commonly
used bright-field microscopy requires prior preparation of micrometer-thick tissue sections mounted on glass
slides and stained with dyes, a process that takes hours or days, delaying access to critical information for
interventions. This project aims to develop a new type of high-throughput digital cytopathology tool with
intrinsic molecular contrast for label-free and slide-free histology. This tool will be built based on lensless
high-throughput coded ptychography operated at the 260-nm and 280-nm deep ultraviolet (DUV)
wavelengths. DUV light directly interacts with and is absorbed by biomolecules of nucleic acids (nucleus) and
amino acids (protein) of cells. Absorption spectra are different for these two types of biomolecules. By
measuring the specimen profiles at the 260-nm and 280-nm DUV wavelengths, we can recover the
quantitative mass maps of cell nucleus and protein without any dye labeling. In contrast, there is no
absorption for these biomolecules in the visible light regime.
 In the proposed DUV coded ptychography tool, we do not use any optical lens as in a conventional
microscope platform. Instead, we fabricate a disorder-engineered coded layer on top of an image sensor.
This coded layer serves as a large-scale scattering ‘lens’ for imaging specimens placed on top of it. When
light diffracts from the tissue samples at a large angle, the coded layer redirects the diffracted light into
smaller angles that are detectable by sensor pixels. As such, the otherwise inaccessible high-resolution
object details can be acquired using the pixel array underneath the coded layer. Our preliminary data show
that the image throughput is greater than the fastest whole slide scanner in the world: resolving 308-nm
linewidth over a 240-mm2 effective field of view in 15 seconds. By using the dual wavelength DUV LEDs for
sample illumination, the proposed tool will provide both phase-based quantitative morphology measurement
and amplitude-based intrinsic chemical specificities for different biomolecules. It can be used for rapid onsite
evaluation of cytology smear obtained from fine-needle aspirate. It can also reduce sample preparation time
and provides intraoperative pathology guidance on surgical margins. The cost of the entire device will be
similar to that of an iPad, making it a handheld, high-throughput ‘personal’ whole slide scanner for most
individual pathologists and researchers worldwide."

 Uterine fibroids are smooth muscle tumors that occur in >80% of Black women and 70% of white
women by age 50 years. Fibroids cause heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain or pressure, urinary and bowel
dysfunction, infertility, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Major surgery with hysterectomy and myomectomy is
the most common fibroid treatment, but surgery generally requires 2-6 weeks of recovery with substantial time
off work and the inability to perform usual activities. To avoid surgery, many women prefer medical therapy for
fibroids, but few options are available. There are only two FDA approved oral medications to treat fibroids,
GnRH antagonists that block gonadotropins and diminish ovarian estrogen production akin to menopause.
These medications require concomitant use of estrogen and progestin “add-back” therapy to mitigate hot
flashes and other side effects and risks of low serum estrogen. Many women aim to avoid this long-term
hormone therapy or have contraindications to hormone use. New medications that alleviate fibroid
symptoms but avoid low serum estrogen are needed to improve care for women with fibroids.
 Fibroids are hormonally responsive tumors that decrease in volume when deprived of estrogen. The
ovary is the primary source of estrogen in premenopausal women, but fibroid cells also produce local estrogen
through activity of the aromatase enzyme. Through both autocrine and paracrine action, estrogen produced by
fibroids demonstrates local control over fibroid growth. Letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor (AI) that blocks
estrogen synthesis within fibroid cells. Therefore, letrozole may decrease fibroid volume and improve
symptoms. Low doses of letrozole will inhibit the modest aromatase activity within fibroids, but not significantly
block the robust aromatase activity in the ovaries of premenopausal women. Letrozole may serve as a novel
therapy that improves fibroid symptoms without adverse effects of low serum estrogen.
 Despite a biologic mechanism to support AIs as a fibroid treatment, clinical data is very limited. In a few
small uncontrolled studies, fibroid volume decreased 35-55% during 8-12 weeks of treatment. We recently
completed a pilot, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of letrozole. The letrozole group had greater
improvement in fibroid symptoms and quality of life compared with the placebo during 2 months of treatment
and reported few side effects. Building on this preliminary data, we propose a full scale randomized, blinded,
placebo-controlled trial that is powered to detect clinically meaningful changes in fibroid symptoms and fibroid
volume. We will enroll 140 racially and ethnically diverse premenopausal women randomly assigned to oral
letrozole 2.5mg/day or an identical placebo for 3 months and assess clinical outcomes and the development of
adverse events. We will also evaluate long-term letrozole use with an open-label follow-up phase for up to 6
months of letrozole therapy. This trial will provide gold standard evidence to evaluate the efficacy of a
novel treatment for uterine fibroids that has significant advantages over existing medication."

 Brain metastases (BM) are the most commonly diagnosed type of central nervous system tumor, more
frequent than primary intracranial neoplasms. Progress on various therapies have accelerated over the past
decade through ongoing clinical trials, and the historically poor outcomes for patients with BM have been
markedly improved. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI is routinely applied to depict BM with the size of the
enhanced lesions for assessing treatment response. Lesion enhancement due to the disruption of blood-brain
barrier is rather nonspecific of the functions of brain tumors. The most studied MRI methodology for perfusion
measurement is dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion weighted imaging (DSC-PWI), which measures
cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV). CBV is the widely adopted perfusion measure as
a sensitive marker of tumor vascularity. However, its clinical applicability in BM studies is hampered by its lack
of absolute quantification, the contrast-leakage effect, and frequent susceptibility artifacts. Arterial spin labeling
(ASL) is ideal for frequent non-invasive longitudinal monitoring of tumor vascularity. The standardized spatially
selective ASL technique for CBF mapping is the pseudo-continuous ASL (PCASL) method using a single post-
labeling delay, which may render underestimation of CBF due to transit time delay caused by slow arterial flow
typical in elderly patients. Velocity-selective ASL (VSASL) was proposed to remove the time-delay sensitivity.
Our group has implemented the first velocity-selective inversion (VSI) based VSASL with 3D segmented
GRASE acquisition and demonstrated its higher sensitivity to perfusion signal over conventional ASL methods.
Additionally, our group first developed VSASL based CBV mapping by removing labeling delay, which delivered
much higher SNR than ASL based CBF mapping. Furthermore, our preliminary data showed that VSASL
with 3D stack-of-spiral based FLASH acquisition delivered better perfusion image quality with less artifacts
than using GRASE, and high temporal resolution potentially allowing adequate retrospective motion correction.
The purpose of this study is: Aim 1, to conduct further technical developments for VSASL based CBF and CBV
mapping protocols with accelerated acquisitions; Aim 2, to evaluate the sensitivity of the two optimized VSASL
protocols to CBF and CBV changes within a month after the radiation therapy, and assess their early prediction
to treatment outcomes; Aim 3, to compare the specificity of VSASL derived CBF and CBV values in the
distinction of metastatic recurrence from radiation-induced effects; Aim 4, to ensure high reproducibility of the
VSASL protocols between multiple scanners with different vendors and field strength. By completing the
proposed aims, the advanced VSASL based CBF and CBV mapping methods are expected to demonstrate
important values for monitoring treatment response in BM, will be readily available for large-scale clinical studies,
and can benefit for studies of all primary and metastatic tumors in the body."

Identification of renal progenitor cells holds promise for elucidating their contribution to developmental defects
and for isolating human renal progenitor cells as a prerequisite to evaluating their therapeutic potential.
Whether an adult kidney harbors progenitor cells is a hotly debated issue. Because mammalian kidneys can
regenerate new cells following normal shedding and injury, we have published a strict definition of an adult
renal progenitor cell requiring in vivo demonstration of 1) self-renewal, 2) clonogenicity, 3) multipotency, and
participation in 4) tissue maintenance and in 5) injury repair. We have identified a subset of Aqp2+ cells that
were also positively stained with an antibody recognizing both V-ATPase subunits B1 and B2 (Aqp2+B1B2+) as
the first potential candidate that strictly meets these 5 requirements. These Aqp2+ progenitor cells (AP)
exhibited the capacity of self-renewal, clonogenicity, and multipotency, and generated 5 types of cells including
principal cells (PC) and intercalated cells (IC) to form DCT2, CNT, and CD during development. Adult AP also
possessed these capabilities and regenerated all cell types in DCT2, CNT, and CD during tissue maintenance
and after unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). AP express IC-selective Jag1 and PC-selective Notch1, and
mediate repair correlating with Notch activation. Others have reported marked sex bias in the transcriptome
profile of PC. All of these findings have laid a solid foundation for this project. In this proposal, we propose to
test our central hypothesis that AP possess a unique molecular signature and their regenerative potential
differs between males and females and is regulated by Jag1. The specific Aims are to identify and validate the
AP's unique molecular signature (Aim 1), to investigate the AP's regenerative potential (Aim 2) and AP's
regulation by Jag1 (Aim 3) during tissue maintenance and during UUO-induced injury repair. We will explore a
combination of cutting edge techniques/approaches including RFP-based cell sorting to enrich Aqp2+ lineage
cells, single cell RNA-Seq, Aqp2ECE/+-based lineage tracing, unbiased thymidine analog labeling, and a set of
innovative tests that have been proven to be effective for vigorously validating B1B2 as a marker of AP.
Successful completion of the project will likely 1) reinforce AP as a novel concept, which differs from what has
been reported for the proximal tubules and could shed new light into the developmental, homeostatic, and
regenerative mechanisms; 2) yield deeper insights into the differential behavior of AP vs. PC and IC; 3) identify
and validate a unique molecular signature of AP for their isolation in the future; 4) link AP-mediated repair to
Notch signaling; 5) establish both sex and Jag1 as potential regulators of AP; and 6) answer many
fundamental questions regarding the origins of PC and IC, how these cells respond to injury through Notch,
and how disruption of this pathway leads to kidney fibrosis. In short, the findings are significant for human
pathology and stem cell biology in general, and for improvement of in vitro organoid generation."

SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19, has been responsible for more than 600 million reported
infections and 6.5 million deaths globally. Although several antivirals, monoclonal antibodies, and
immunomodulatory treatments improve patient outcomes, mortality from COVID-19 remains unacceptably high.
Moreover, despite mitigation measures and development of several highly effective vaccines, SARS-CoV-2 has
continued to spread globally, making it almost certain that the virus will become endemic in human populations.
There is therefore a critical need to identify host factors that modify SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and severity to
guide infection prevention strategies and inform future vaccine and therapeutic development studies. SARS-
CoV-2 human challenge experiments provide an unprecedented opportunity to study these host factors by
standardizing the viral inoculum, the precise timing of viral exposure, and environmental conditions, thereby
controlling for factors that inevitably confound natural infection studies. The overall objective of this proposal is
to identify upper respiratory microbiome features and host gene expression profiles that modify susceptibility to
and symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This research will leverage previously collected clinical data and
samples from a first-in-human SARS-CoV-2 challenge study conducted in healthy adults without serological
evidence of prior infection or vaccination. We will perform shotgun metagenomic and RNA sequencing of serially
collected mid-turbinate nasal samples from 34 adults who were inoculated with a wild-type virus (SARS-CoV-
2/human/GBR/484861/2020), 18 (53%) of whom developed PCR-confirmed infection. In Aim 1, we will use nasal
samples collected at baseline and immediately following viral inoculation (days -1 to +3) to identify microbiome
features and host transcriptional responses associated with resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In Aim 2, we
will use nasal samples collected between days -1 and +14 to characterize changes in the upper respiratory
microbiome and host transcriptome that occur during SARS-CoV-2 infection and correlate microbiome and
transcriptome profiles with the presence and severity of specific symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In both
Aims, we will use innovative multi-omics analyses to identify relationships between patient characteristics, upper
respiratory microbiome-transcriptome profiles, and SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and symptoms. This research will
identify upper respiratory bacterial species associated with susceptibility to and symptoms of SARS-CoV-2
infection and could lead to development of rationally designed probiotics that prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Further, a detailed understanding of the host responses that occur in the upper respiratory tract following SARS-
CoV-2 exposure and infection could inform development of nasal vaccines and identify novel targets for host-
directed diagnostics or therapeutics. Finally, analyses integrating microbiome and host transcriptome data will
elucidate mechanisms by which the upper respiratory microbiota and host immune system interact to influence
susceptibility to and severity of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses."
10910151,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Lung cancer is primarily a disease of aging. Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer death in the
United States, with 127,000 deaths annually. Lung cancer screening (LCS) can prevent lung cancer death
among older adults ages 50-80 without advanced comorbidities. Screening must balance the risk of immediate
harms against the potential to prevent death years in the future. There is a fundamental knowledge gap in how
to identify older adults who are “healthy enough” for LCS, among the 14.5 million who are currently eligible.
My long-term goal is to maximize the benefit of LCS for older adults by providing them individualized estimates
of net benefit from LCS based on health status, and become an expert on preventive health interventions for
older adults. The objective of the proposed project is to examine the association between health and use of
LCS and then measure risks of immediate harms after LCS by health status. I will define health in various ways
and identify a metric of health that best predicts harms of LCS. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that
LCS is common among those in the poor health, which undermines its benefit and increases the risk of harm
(e.g., complications of invasive procedures after abnormal lung scans).
I will leverage national data from Veterans Health Affairs (VHA), which has pioneered a tool to systematically
assess LCS eligibility via detailed smoking history. I will test my central hypothesis in the following specific
aims. Aim 1: Determine the associations between use of LCS and pre-screening health as measured by three
health metrics – (1) life expectancy, (2) life years gained by screening, and (3) advanced chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease. Aim 2: Determine the rates of complications from diagnostic procedures prompted by LCS
across pre-screening health status measured with the same three health metrics, using advanced quantitative
methods (i.e., joint modeling) to account for the interrelated nature of procedure choice and complication risk.
This project is methodologically innovative because I will (1) apply a novel, validated algorithm to exclude
diagnostic imaging to provide unbiased estimates of LCS use and harms, (2) apply joint modeling to identify
older adults at higher risk of adverse screening outcomes, and (3) utilize detailed smoking and health data in
the VHA which is not available elsewhere and has been a persistent barrier to prior work. This project is
conceptually innovative because I will use health metrics uniquely relevant to LCS.
The proposed project is significant in that it will provide a rich understanding of how LCS is currently used
across categories defined by health and advance our knowledge by identifying those most likely to benefit from
LCS. This knowledge could guide older adults and their clinicians towards informed, individualized screening
decisions that prioritize LCS among competing health needs. This project directly responds to the National
Institute on Aging’s priorities to meet the needs of older adults with multiple comorbidities and to optimize their
health by personalizing decision-making based on their unique health status."

Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for patients with ESRD undergoing dialysis by the Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Non-experimental studies suggest that inactivated, seasonal,
standard-dose vaccines are not effective or minimally effective at reducing influenza-related hospitalizations or
mortality in the dialysis population, and the high-dose vaccine provides little to no additional protection beyond
the standard-dose vaccine for these outcomes. Two vaccine formulations using advanced technologies have
been licensed in recent years. The adjuvanted influenza vaccine, licensed in 2015, enhances the magnitude of
the immune response to vaccine antigens and broadens the response to include similar mismatched viruses
through heterotypic protection. The recombinant influenza vaccine, licensed in 2013 (trivalent) and 2017
(quadrivalent), uses the baculovirus-insect cell system to produce recombinant influenza antigens. Evidence
suggests that both the adjuvanted and recombinant influenza vaccines have higher vaccine effectiveness
compared to standard-dose vaccines in the general population. Despite increasing uptake of the adjuvanted
and recombinant influenza vaccines among the dialysis population in recent years, no large-scale studies have
been conducted to evaluate the utilization, effectiveness, or safety of these newly licensed vaccines in the
vulnerable population of patients on dialysis. A large study is needed to compare the newly licensed
adjuvanted and recombinant vaccines versus other vaccines and to inform influenza prevention approaches in
the dialysis population. We propose a large, non-experimental study using existing data from the United
States Renal Data System (USRDS) to examine the use, effectiveness, and safety of various influenza
vaccines among adult patients with ESRD undergoing dialysis. The large size of our study will allow us to
characterize small differences in vaccine effectiveness and safety between adjuvanted or recombinant
vaccines vs. standard or high-dose vaccines during the same influenza seasons. Vaccine effectiveness
analyses will incorporate a broad range of influenza-related outcomes, including markers of severity of illness.
Safety analyses will focus on a priori identified adverse events after influenza immunization. Study design and
analyses will use robust methods to measure and account for confounding bias. Our findings will inform
dialysis patients and their providers about the risks and benefits of different vaccines and influence vaccine
policy, with the ultimate goal of reducing the burden of respiratory disease in this vulnerable population."

 Age is a major risk factor for cardiovascular associated diseases which are leading causes of death
globally. Accordingly, 80% of all cardiovascular deaths occurred in patients aged 65 and over. Endothelial cell
senescence, characterized by cell cycle arrest and a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), is a
major contributor to age related cardiovascular dysfunction. However, the mechanism by which endothelial
cells are subjected to senescence is still unclear.
 We have recently made novel findings that endothelial cell HSPA12B deficient (eHSPA12B-/-) mice exhibit
cardiac endothelial cell senescence accompanied by severe cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and persistent
inflammation when compared with age- and gender-matched WT controls. Our findings suggest that senescent
endothelial cells play an important role in the regulation of cardiac hypertrophy and fibroblast activation and
that endothelial cell HSPA12B limits senescence of endothelial cells. Therefore, understanding the
mechanisms by which HSPA12B regulates endothelial cell senescence would be important for seeking an
approach to prevent or reverse senescent endothelial cells, thus reducing age-related cardiovascular disease.
 To elucidate how HSPA12B limits senescence of endothelial cells, we examined the effect of HSPA12B on
ATF6 (Activating transcription factor 6) transcriptional activity and its target gene MANF (Mesencephalic
Astrocyte Derived Neurotrophic Factor) expression. ATF6 is an important transcriptional factor that regulates
the expression of genes involved in proper protein folding and cellular senescence. MANF is an evolutionarily
conserved protective modulator for the maintenance of tissue immune and metabolic homeostasis.
Interestingly, we observed that HSPA12B is critical for sustaining ATF6 transcriptional activity and MANF
expression. The data suggest that ATF6 and MANF may be involved in the HSPA12B mediated protective
effect on endothelial cell senescence.
 To investigate how endothelial cell senescence contributes to cardiac hypertrophy, we examined cardiac
mitochondrial glucose oxidation (MGO) which is one of the major contributors to myocardial energy production.
Compromised mitochondrial glucose oxidation leads to the development of cardiac hypertrophy and eventually
heart failure. We observed that eHSPA12B-/- resulted in decreased Acetyl-CoA and increased lactate
accumulation. The data indicate that eHSPA12B-/- impairs cardiac mitochondrial glucose oxidation. Our
observation also suggests that senescent endothelial cells induce cardiac hypertrophy via impairment of
cardiac myocyte MGO (mitochondrial glucose oxidation).
 To address how endothelial cell senescence impairs cardiac MGO, we induced endothelial cell senescence
by ETO (etoposide), collected the medium as the senescent conditioned medium (SCM), and treated adult
cardiac myocytes with the SCM. We observed that SCM promotes metabolic reprogramming from glucose
oxidation to glycolysis in adult cardiac myocytes by increasing PDK4 (Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Kinase 4) and
decreasing TFAM (Mitochondrial transcription factor A). PDK4 is a key enzyme in the regulation of glucose
oxidation by inhibiting the conversion of pyruvate into Acetyl-CoA via promoting PDH phosphorylation and
inactivation. TFAM is a core mitochondrial transcription factor for mitochondrial biogenesis by regulating
mtDNA replication and transcription.
 This application is to decipher the role of HSPA12B in age-related endothelial cell senescence and how
endothelial cell senescence results in cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction. Based on our novel findings, we
hypothesize that: i) HSPA12B limits endothelial cell senescence is mediated by activation of ATF6/MANF
signaling and that; ii) endothelial cell senescence contributes to cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction via
impaired mitochondrial glucose oxidation in cardiomyocytes. To critically evaluate this hypothesis, we propose
the following specific aims. Aim 1. Define the mechanisms by which HSPA12B regulates ATF6 transcriptional
activity and limits endothelial cell senescence. Aim 2. Investigate the role of endothelial cell senescence in
age-related cardiac hypertrophy and its underlying mechanisms.
 Successful completion of the proposed studies will result in a wealth of novel data showing the novel role
of HSPA12B mediated ATF6 in the regulation of endothelial cell senescence. The senescent endothelial cells
contribute to age-related cardiac metabolic disorders and hypertrophy. These new findings will be the basis for
the development of innovative therapies for age-related cardiomyopathy."

Almost nothing is known about the prevalence of comorbidities among American Indian and Alaska Native
(AIAN) cancer survivors, and how comorbidities impact cancer treatment and survival in this population. Yet,
AIAN people have higher incidence of several potential comorbid conditions, relative to their non-Native
counterparts. Comorbidities impact the clinical management of cancer, including which cancer treatments a
patient receives and when they receive that treatment. As a result, cancer patients with comorbidities are more
likely to have poorer survival and quality of life than their comorbidity-free counterparts. There is a critical need
to understand prevalence and impact of comorbidities on cancer treatment and outcomes among AIAN people;
without this information, our ability to address known cancer disparities in this underserved minority population
will remain limited.
 The objective of this research is to understand the landscape of comorbidities among AIAN cancer
patients, and how they influence cancer treatment and survival. The central hypothesis is that comorbidities
play a central role in the undue burden of cancer among AIAN people. The rationale for this study is that
understanding the prevalence of comorbidities among AIAN cancer patients, and how they impact cancer
treatment delivery and outcomes, will provide critical opportunities for multi-level intervention targeting health
systems, providers, and/or patients. This research supports a long-term goal to reduce the burden of cancer
among AIAN people by reducing the impact of comorbidities on treatment and survival.
 To address this objective, this research will pursue three specific aims, and one exploratory aim. The
specific aims will use the SEER-Medicare linked database to 1) Determine the prevalence of comorbidities
among AIAN people aged over 65y; 2) Determine impact of comorbidities on receipt of timely and evidence-
based services during diagnosis, staging and first-line treatment among AIAN people aged over 65y; and, 3)
Evaluate impact of comorbidities on cancer survival among AIAN people aged over 65y. An exploratory aim
will determine the feasibility of reproducing these analyses in the Indian Health Service (IHS) National Patient
Information Reporting System (NPIRS) data warehouse. This research is innovative because it uses
underutilized datasets to explore questions about which nothing is known for AIAN people. Further, we
propose a community engaged approach to this secondary data analysis that will inform this and future work.
 Upon the successful completion of this research, the role that presence and number of comorbidities
plays in cancer diagnosis, treatment, and survival among AIAN people will be known. This information will
provide critical information to understand causes of AIAN cancer disparities that will be used to drive future
healthcare-based structural and programmatic interventions."

Cystic fibrosis (CF)-related liver disease (CFLD) is the third-leading cause of mortality in CF, an autosomal
genetic disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)
gene. Approximately 20% to 40% CF patients suffer from CFLD, and the number is on the rise in the past
decade. Of concern, the recently approved Trikafta, although significantly improves the pulmonary functions,
worsens liver related disorders in CF patients, supported by emerging clinical reports. Treating/curing CFLD in
the post-Trikafta era now becomes a top priority research topic. A lack of appropriate preclinical animal models
for CFLD has been a limiting factor for drug development. Recently, we produced CF rabbits and
demonstrated that they manifest many typical CF phenotypes. Importantly, liver phenotypes including
abnormal bile secretion, NASH-like phenotypes, and impaired lipid and glucose homeostasis were observed,
presenting them as a promising model for CFLD and drug testing. Further, we obtained strong preliminary
evidence that treatments of sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibitors (SGLTi) exerted
surprising therapeutic effects on CFLD phenotypes of CF rabbits. Based on these, we hypothesize that “CFTR
mutation -> inflammation & ER stress -> SGLT1 upregulation -> metabolic disorder -> CFLD” form a vicious
circle and that disruption of this circle by SGLTi drugs is beneficial for CFLD. To test this hypothesis, we will
utilize our recently developed CF rabbits carrying the dominant patient mutation CFTR-F508del (dF) to pursue
two specific aims: in Aim 1, we will determine the effects of Trikafta with a focus on the livers of dF rabbits,
followed by experiments to determine if SGLTi drugs, such as Sotagliflozin and Empagliflozin, bring any
benefits to dF rabbit livers on top of Trikafta. In Aim 2, we will investigate the molecular mechanisms by which
SGLT inhibition benefits CF liver disease by determining the effects of SGLTi drugs on the ER stress and
inflammation pathways in dF rabbit livers and in human dF cholangiocytes and hepatocytes. Our work will
provide preclinical and mechanistic evidence for expanding (or not) the use of this class of extraordinary
successful drugs, i.e., SGLT inhibitor drugs, for an unmet medical challenging: CFLD in the post-Trikafta era."

Clinically there are examples of small molecules including finasteride and dutasteride that can reduce the risk of
prostate cancer and potentially may be effect in minimal low risk disease. AR targeting drugs can prove
extremely beneficial for a patient, however, the benefit is short as many of these agents are only effective for
approximately 1 year. In our data collected during the initial 5-year R37 MERIT award we are characterizing
the AR degradation properties of α-mangostin against known AR polymorphisms associated with resistance.
Briefly, PC3 cells were transfected with AR constructs expressing the following Polymorphisms including E256K,
T818D, and T878A. A second biological target for prostate cancer we have evaluated during the initial 5-year
R37 MERIT award was the role of binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), also known as GRP78 or HSP70. Our
central hypothesis is that xanthones including α-Mangostin from the mangosteen are SARDs that promote
proteolytic degradation of the AR and this mechanism is critically regulated by the multi-functional chaperone
protein BiP. Furthermore, the multi-functional BiP protein in addition to promoting AR degradation is able to
serve as a receptor on the cell surface for the apoptotic ligand Isthmin-1. Importantly, we have observed that
benign prostate epithelial cells when treated with alpha-mangostin do not increase the UPR pathway or the
expression of BiP [2, 4]. Our objective in this proposal is identify opportunities to exploit the multi-functional
properties of BiP that are involved in AR degradation and receptor properties of BiP when localized to the cell
surface involved in apoptosis using xanthones and recombinant Ishthmin-1. Our objective herein will be to
identify key domains of BiP that bind to AR in prostate cancer cells involved in AR degradation. A second
objective will be to functionally characterize the interaction BiP and Isthmin-1 in prostate cancer in combination
with xanthones from the mangosteen fruit. Our third objective will be to optimize the pro-apoptotic properties of
the BiP ligand Isthmin-1 in combination with isoprenylated xanthones."
10846821,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Walking over natural terrain with skill and flexibility requires the nervous system to adapt limb movements to
environmental demands on each step. To drive the limbs over an obstacle without stumbling, the brain must
generate commands to modulate the appropriate muscle synergies at a specific phase of the ongoing
locomotor rhythm. The loss or impairment of these commands in disease can result in falls, which are common
in older adults and impose a significant burden on the healthcare system. While previous studies have
demonstrated that the motor cortex is critical for skilled locomotion, two key gaps currently impede progress in
developing models of cortical control. First, because gait modification is controlled by coordinated patterns of
activity across the motor cortical population, it is necessary to measure these population-level patterns in
behaving animals, and to identify how these patterns relate to specific aspects of movement. Second, because
motor cortex generates descending commands by integrating multiple sources of input from other brain
regions, it is critical to determine how these inputs influence motor cortical dynamics along specific,
behaviorally-relevant dimensions. Our long-term goal is to identify the dynamical principles governing the
interactions across distributed neural populations, and to determine how these principles enable the adaptation
of the locomotor pattern in a complex environment. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine how
neural population dynamics in motor cortex are generated during skilled locomotion by identifying the impact of
cerebellar and posterior parietal inputs on specific motor cortical dimensions. Our central hypothesis is that the
cerebellum selectively drives step-entrained dimensions of motor cortical population activity that are
synchronized with the rhythm of lower motor centers, while the posterior parietal cortex selectively drives motor
commands for gait modification in obstacle-modulated dimensions. To directly test this hypothesis, we will first
record from motor cortical ensembles in unrestrained mice performing skilled locomotion and use
computational techniques to isolate step-entrained and obstacle-modulated dimensions of neural population
activity (Aim 1). Next, we will use optogenetic perturbations to identify the effect of disrupting inputs from the
cerebellum (Aim 2) and posterior parietal cortex (Aim 3) on activity in these dimensions. The proposed
research is significant because the identification of how inputs to motor cortex generate its dynamics in healthy
animals is expected to provide a foundation for future studies of how these dynamics degrade in
neurodegenerative disease and aging, and to support the improvement of closed-loop deep brain stimulation
strategies for movement disorders. The proposed research is innovative because it integrates the dynamical
systems framework for the analysis and interpretation of data with the optogenetic toolkit for neural circuit
perturbations, enabling a transition beyond the measurement of cortical population trajectories toward a
definition of the underlying dynamical principles that generate them."

APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Clinical Center
We submit this application in response to RFA-DK-22-506. The University of Miami, Miami Transplant Institute,
Jackson Memorial Hospital is the Clinical Center 11 which is a current member of the APOLLO Consortium. This
Consortium was established in 2017 to work seamlessly with the Association of Organ Procurement
Organizations (AOPO) to enroll participants in the largest observational study to date of kidney transplant
recipients and donors to evaluate APOL1 gene mutations in kidney donor as a risk factor for graft loss. Our
Clinical Center has been a leader and top enroller for eligible recipients and living kidney donors in the state of
Florida, Puerto Rico and 2 transplant centers in California. This has been achieved through a very close
collaboration between all site PIs and research coordinators. The following transplant centers are part of CC11:
participating as engaged centers are: The Miami Transplant Institute, Tampa General Hospital, Mayo Clinic
Jacksonville, the University of Florida; participating as non-engaged centers are: Advent Health Orlando Florida,
Memorial Healthcare System Broward Hospital Florida, Auxilio Mutuo Hospital in Puerto Rico, California Institute
of Renal Research and University of California, Irvine. In Phase 1 of APOLLO, we have successfully consented
241 kidney transplant recipients and 20 living donors, with DNA on hand in 220 recipients (91%) and 20 donors
(100%), across all centers. Our site has overseen the careful collection of clinical data from the electronic
medical record at our own site and subsites to complete the APOLLO Consortium Data Forms accurately and
entirely, with 97% to 100% of the data entry at various data points. In Phase 2, we will continue to obtain critical
follow-up data on all participants and ensure completion of data abstraction from electronic medical record, to
provide patient-level detail not available in databases maintained by United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)
and the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR). We will ensure a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio
is measured in all participants, at all sites, at a longitudinal follow-up time point of at least two years from original
enrollment in APOLLO Phase 1. The University of Miami, Miami Transplant Institute, will continue to collect
additional biospecimens for contribution to the biorepository as well as unstained biopsy slides as we have been
doing through Phase 1. We will work with the Scientific Data and Research Center (SDRC) to ensure return of
genotype results to all participants who desire this information. We will also continue to recruit living donors at
the Miami Transplant Institute. Continuation of the APOLLO Consortium will lead to important advances in our
understanding of APOL1 high-risk status and its influence on graft function as well as the biology of APOL1 gene
effects."

Spending time outdoors increases children’s physical activity and promotes engagement with nature, which
has been shown to have positive benefits on children’s mental, cognitive, and behavioral health. However,
outdoor time is difficult to quantify, with most studies relying on self- or caregiver-reported outdoor time. One
solution is to use accelerometers equipped with ambient light sensor technology. The light sensor delivers an
estimate of light exposure (i.e., lux values) that can be used to objectively quantify children’s outdoor time.
Despite the ubiquitous use of accelerometers, most researchers have not taken advantage of this tool. Of the
studies that have used ambient light data, analytic approaches have varied. Specifically, studies have used
different lux cut points to distinguish between indoor and outdoor time, and have not considered placement of
the accelerometer (i.e., hip vs. wrist worn) or the potential error due to seasonality or weather conditions.
Therefore, the objective of this project is to develop and disseminate a set of best practices for analyzing
accelerometer-derived ambient light data in order to provide an objective assessment of outdoor time in
children. The proposed project will analyze secondary data from two NHLBI funded intervention trials targeting
physical activity promotion in the child care setting. Both trials included accelerometer data with the ambient
light sensor enabled as well as data from the Environment and Policy Assessment and Observation (EPAO)
tool, an observational measure that contains detailed time stamped data of the child care day including indoor
and outdoor time. In Aim 1, accelerometer data will be harmonized to facilitate comparisons between hip- and
wrist-worn devices and then combined with the corresponding EPAO data. In Aim 2, receiver operator
characteristic curve analysis will be used to identify the optimal lux cut point to distinguish between indoor and
outdoor time, comparing accelerometer lux values to the documented indoor and outdoor time from the EPAO.
Then, we will compare how well the identified lux cut point performs in distinguishing outdoor time in wrist vs.
hip worn accelerometers. Finally, we will compare how seasonality and different weather conditions (i.e.,
cloudy vs. clear days) affect lux readings. In Aim 3, we will examine the association between objectively
measured outdoor time and children’s physical activity while at child care using the newly developed analytic
guidelines. In order to promote consistency in the field, we will disseminate the best practices by developing
open source code for other researchers that can be applied to existing datasets and repositories of
accelerometer data. Overall, this project will address key measurement gaps in assessing young children’s
physical activity and outdoor time. Improving measurement of outdoor time will further add to research into the
health impact of spending time outdoors, aid in the identification of disparities regarding access to the
outdoors, and provide support for policies and regulations promoting youth outdoor time."

Stuttering is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with profound psychosocial consequences. Individuals
who stutter commonly experience peer rejection, social isolation, and debilitating emotional responses to their
stuttering. These hidden features of stuttering vary widely across individuals and are challenging to treat, but
underlying causal mechanisms are not well-understood. The proposed project addresses this critical gap by
focusing on attentional processes that may drive psychological responses to stuttering. The project draws upon
the extensive literature on threat-related attention bias (AB), examining the extent to which such attentional
patterns are associated with stuttering. Threat-related AB refers to preferential allocation of attention toward
threatening stimuli and is a well-established finding in adults and children with clinical and subclinical anxiety.
Cognitive models attribute AB to imbalances in early processes that detect threat, or late processes that
modulate reactivity to threat, which manifest as faster detection of threat (vigilance), difficulty disengaging from
threat (maintenance), threat avoidance, or combinations of these tendencies. AB may feed anxiety by promoting
heightened sensitivity toward threat and hypervigilant scanning of environmental stimuli. Individuals who stutter
show analogous anticipatory behaviors related to speaking, suggesting that similar AB patterns may underlie
stuttering. The proposed project investigates threat-related AB in adults who do and do not stutter using a multi-
paradigm approach that combines behavioral and eye-tracking indices of AB. The primary aim is to establish
group differences in AB and identify the stage of processing at which differences emerge based on three widely-
used tasks associated with different stages of information processing and AB tendencies (Aim 1). Aim 2 is to
determine the extent to which threat-related AB in adults who stutter is general (consistent with anxiety) or
disorder-specific (reflecting personal lived experiences of stuttering) by comparing three categories of threat
stimuli representing increasing content specificity (general, stuttering-related, and personally-feared threat
words). Aim 3 applies mediation analyses to examine the role of AB as a critical mediating factor between
subject-level risk factors (related to temperament and attention control) and individual differences in stuttering
outcomes (impact and anticipation). The project is innovative in that it applies novel conceptual and experimental
approaches from AB research, uses eye-tracking methodologies that reveal dynamic attention patterns, and
includes mediation analyses to clarify contributions of AB and related factors to stuttering outcomes. Results will
increase our understanding of operative mechanisms shaping responses to stuttering and can provide a means
to identify individuals most vulnerable to adverse stuttering impacts. The long-term goal of the project is to
generate key data for future intervention studies designed to reverse AB through AB modification paradigms that
train attention away from threat. The proposed research thus supports the mission of NIDCD by advancing our
understanding of stuttering and providing a foundation for new approaches to its assessment and treatment."
10870045,"Inbred laboratory mouse strains have proven essential for research into systemic autoimmune diseases because
the inbred genotype provides a genetically uniform animal for experimental purposes. However, there is
restricted genetic heterogeneity among common laboratory strains primarily due to the origination from two
original Asian and European fancy mice. This has significantly reduced the diversity of common genetic variants
that are thought to contribute significantly to complex traits such as systemic autoimmunity. We propose that the
Collaborative Cross (CC) Recombinant Inbred (RI) panel is the best suited to model the range of phenotypes in
complex diseases because it is the only experimental mammalian resource with genome-wide genetic variation
randomized across a large, heterogeneous and reproducible population. Significantly, the CC RI panel adds the
genomes of three wild strains from three different continents that are not represented in the common inbred
strains. Consequently, the CC strains provide a powerful tool to model autoimmunity in a much more genetically
diverse panel than previously available. We therefore hypothesize that the much greater genetic heterogeneity
of CC strains, including contributions from wild-derived strains, will allow development of a wide range of
immunological and pathological features from apparent good health to systemic autoimmunity. Furthermore, we
posit that this will be amenable to genotyping and quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in a way not possible
with previous approaches. This is supported by our preliminary studies, which show that CC strains exhibit
differing levels of spontaneous anti-nuclear autoantibodies (ANA) and inflammatory biomarkers, allowing them
to be grouped into a number of phenotypes. Furthermore, the presence of wild-derived strains contributed to the
mapping of ANA positivity to loci on chromosomes 1 and 17. We believe that investigation of the profiles of
immune mediators, cellular inflammation, autoantibodies, and pathology in the CC RI panel will lead to the
identification of a more diverse spectrum of autoimmune phenotypes than currently available. Additionally, we
argue that analysis of the different autoimmune phenotypes among CC RI strains will enhance our ability to
identify specific genes and molecular and cellular pathways that discriminate steps in the progression from
apparent good health, to sub-clinical inflammation and/or autoimmunity, to systemic autoimmune disease. We
will address this in two aims. Specific Aim 1: Development of systemic autoimmunity in CC RI strains, and
Specific Aim 2: Genetic mapping of systemic autoimmunity in CC RI mice.
Successful completion of these studies should result in identifying new strains of mice to study the progression
of autoimmunity from apparent good health to systemic disease, a better understanding of the genetics,
biomarkers, and pathogenesis of systemic autoimmunity, and identification of potential therapeutic targets."
10900650,"Project Summary/Abstract
Reactivation of fetal hemoglobin expression in adult erythroid cells is a validated approach to genetic
therapy of both b-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD). As currently practiced, however,
genetic therapy (either lentiviral delivery or CRISPR/Cas9 editing) cannot meet the large disease
burden due to its reliance on myeloablative preconditioning of patients for hematopoietic
reconstitution and the medically intensive nature of the procedure. Drug (small molecule)
therapeutics are needed to treat the many patients with these disorders. The vision of our research
is to use small molecule therapeutics to reactivate y-globin gene expression, and do so both robustly
and safely. The most potent, validated repressor of g-globin expression is BCL11A. In this project
we will extend our recent studies in which we leveraged new chemical methods of targeted protein
degradation (TPD) to deplete BCL11A and reactivate HbF production. The project consists of two
broad aims. First, we will determine the dynamics of globin gene transcription using a platform in
which erythroid cells at different phases of the cell cycle can be isolated for nascent transcription
analyses. Using acute TPD of BCL11A, we will then ascertain at which stage(s) of the cell cycle g-
(HBG) globin is reactivated upon loss of the repressor. These data will provide temporal resolution
of globin gene transcription at unprecedented resolution. In a second aim, we will explore the use of
erythroid-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases, TRIM10 and TRIM58, to target degradation of BCL11A. The
TRIM proteins will be directed to BCL11A with BCL11A-specific nanobodies. We will initiate discovery
of ligands for the TRIM proteins in order to develop tool compounds for cell-specific TPD of BCL11A
as a new therapeutic strategy. Our work will lay the groundwork for novel small molecule approaches
for robust and safe reactivation of HbF for the hemoglobin disorders."

Education impacts health by improving access to socioeconomic resources and high-quality care (SES
mechanism) and by improving literacy and numeracy, which aids in self-care and navigating the healthcare
system (cognitive mechanism). But education does not just involve the acquisition of knowledge or cognitive
skills. Education encompasses the experiences of being in a school environment, shaped by teachers, peers,
and the “culture” of the school. Also referred to as school climate, these characteristics shape socioemotional
factors that influence resilience and one's health trajectory (resilience mechanism).
Almost all prior studies of education and health have relied on observational methods. In 2013, we began the
Reducing Inequities through Social and Educational Change Follow-up (RISE Up) Study, a natural experiment
using the admissions lottery of several high-performing public charter high schools to identify comparable
groups of adolescents “randomized” into high- and lower-performing schools. We recruited students upon high
school entrance and continue to follow this cohort currently (now age 22) with average annual retention rates
of 96%. We found the impact of schools on self-reported health and health behaviors was immediate,
substantial, and persistent beyond adolescence. By age 21, those who had attended a high-performing high
school had a 50% lower rate of alcohol use disorder, 40% reduction in reporting fair or poor physical health,
and 33% reduction in obesity/overweight. However, the improvements in physical health and obesity were only
among males. Among females, attending a high-performing schools was associated with lower rates of alcohol
use disorder, but substantially worse physical health and obesity. Surprisingly, intermediate academic
outcomes (high school graduation, grade point average, test scores, and college matriculation) did not explain
the impact of high-performing schools on substance use or physical health outcomes.
Understanding how education influences health will inform the development of future interventions and school
policies to make schools “healthier” for all students. Furthermore, our results to date are based on self-report.
Thus, we proposed to follow the RISE Up cohort from age 23-28 to better understand how schools impact
physiologic health perhaps through changes in socioemotional factors and resilience. We will measure blood
pressure and body mass index and obtain blood samples to measure glycohemoglobin and C-reactive protein.
We will examine epigenetic aging (DNA methylation), chronic stress (hair cortisol), and physiologic resilience
using the Conserved Transcriptional Response to Adversity (CTRA). CTRA is a gene expression profile
activated by fight-or-flight signaling from the sympathetic nervous system and related to greater inflammation
and lower Type I interferon innate antiviral responses. Furthermore, we will explore sex differences in the
relationship between education and physiologic health, stress, and resilience."
10889276,"ABSTRACT
Increased oncogene expression mediated by focal amplifications is a common mechanism for oncogene
activation in human cancers. Two major mechanisms leading to oncogene amplification have been described:
chromosomal amplification and non-chromosomal amplification. The latter mechanism is characterized by the
presence of multiple copies of circular DNAs that are thought to originate following the fragmentation and
subsequent circularization of pieces of chromosomes. These “extrachromosomal circular DNAs” (ecDNAs) have
long been known as “double minutes” for their appearance in metaphase spreads and by the lack of centromeric
sequences.
In the past few years renewed interest in this class of cancer-associated chromosomal rearrangements has been
fueled by technological advances and by the realization that, due to their random segregation at mitosis, ecDNAs
can accelerate tumor evolution, mediate drug resistance, and generally promote a more aggressive phenotype.
Despite substantial progress, however, several key questions regarding the biology of ecDNAs, their dynamics
during the early stages of tumor formation, and their contribution to tumor initiation and progression, remain
unanswered. This is in part due to the lack of effective means to engineer and track ecDNAs in normal cells and
in model organisms.
Our group has extensive expertise in the generation and characterization of germline and somatic mouse models
of human cancers, and we have pioneered the use of somatic genome editing to engineer chromosomal
rearrangements in mice. In this grant application, supported by strong preliminary data, we describe a novel
general strategy to model ecDNAs in cells and in mice.
We have already generated three new genetically engineered mouse strains in which the formation of ecDNAs
containing the oncogenes most commonly amplified in human cancers can be induced in a temporally and
spatially controlled manner. Using a similar strategy, we have also generated cell lines in which formation of
specific ecDNAs can be induced and tracked non-invasively using fluorescent reporters and selectable markers.
We propose to use these innovative tools and reagents to address the following key questions:
1) Can oncogenic ecDNAs initiate tumor formation and/or accelerate tumor progression and metastasis in vivo?
2) How do oncogenic ecDNAs respond to changes in intracellular and extracellular environment?
3) Are there mechanisms preventing ecDNA formation and propagation in primary cells?
4) Is the presence of ecDNAs in cancer cells associated with unique therapeutically actionable vulnerabilities?
5) Can ecDNAs be transmitted horizontally between cells?"

Community Services Navigation to Advance Health Equity in Breast Cancer Screening
Persistent inequities in breast cancer outcomes can be traced in large part to inequities in breast cancer
screening follow-up care among underserved women. While U.S. breast cancer mortality rates have decreased
approximately 2% per year since 1990, socially and economically disadvantaged women have experienced
increasing breast cancer mortality over that time. Many of these deaths are preventable. Mammography is
evidence-based screening that, when fully implemented with appropriate follow-up care, improves outcomes
for millions of women who are screened each year.
Many services, including financial coverage, exist to improve breast screening rates among underserved
women. Now, to address health disparities and promote health equity we must remove persistent barriers to
appropriate follow-up of abnormal screening exams – the point of care with the most potential impact to
decrease late-stage disease and mortality. Women with a higher burden of social needs (e.g., for food,
housing, utilities, transportation), are about half as likely to follow-up after an abnormal mammogram than
women who experience minimal social needs. There is a critical need to implement programs that will help
women overcome barriers to follow-up, including access to community service resources, which is a known
barrier.
The SINCERE intervention, a validated screener and referral process for social needs (e.g., for transportation,
housing, utilities, food), was found in our prior studies to be feasible and acceptable in Emergency Department
settings. Building on this prior work, we now propose to adapt and extend the implementation of this
intervention by adding community services navigation – an active outreach intervention to connect breast
screening patients with social services. We aim to address the needs of underserved women that act as
barriers to follow-up of abnormal breast screening and reduce breast cancer disparities.
Our overarching objective is to improve health equity, and the goal of this study is to evaluate if adding
community services navigation to the standard referral process for social needs is an effective and scalable
strategy for addressing disparities in follow-up to abnormal breast cancer screening results. With statewide
community service providers, existing health information technology, and validated methods, we will determine
the effectiveness of social needs referrals combined with a community services navigation intervention in the
screening mammography setting to improving breast screening outcomes in underserved women.
We expect that outreach to underserved women, who represent a large proportion of late-stage and higher
mortality breast cancers, will improve breast cancer screening follow-up and outcomes for underserved
women."

Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability among adults in the United States, with half of all stroke
survivors experiencing moderate to severe impairment in motor, sensory, or cognitive function that require
specialty care. Despite advances in the acute (< 24 hour) care of stroke, such as thrombolysis and
recanalization, stroke patients still experience progression of brain injury that negatively affects patient
outcomes. Cerebroprotection, the mitigation of damage to the entire neurovascular unit of the brain, is an
extremely high priority in stroke care research. Torpor, a state of hypothermia and hypometabolism, has long
been hypothesized to represent a cerebroprotective state. We have identified a previously under-studied,
conserved population of GABAergic neurons expressing the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) in the medial
preoptic area (POA) termed POAKOR+. In preliminary studies, we found that chemogenetic activation of
POAKOR+ neurons induced a hypothermic and hypometabolic state that we refer to as synthetic torpor.
Preliminary data suggest that induction of synthetic torpor immediately after experimental stroke reduces
infarct size and decreases mortality in mice at 72 hours post-stroke. The data also suggest that induction of
synthetic torpor alters metabolism of nucleotides, lipids, and the citric acid cycle, while altering metabolites
such as ceramides and succinate that are associated with the progression of brain injury after stroke. While
promising, these preliminary data highlight several key knowledge gaps that will be addressed in the proposed
research study. First, we will investigate whether the cerebroprotective effects observed 72 hours after stroke
also improve long-term behavioral outcomes (Aim 1). Second, our preliminary data suggests that the
hypothermic depth and duration of synthetic torpor predicts stroke size, thus, we will investigate whether the
cerebroprotective effects of synthetic torpor following stroke are dependent or independent of hypothermia
(Aim 2). Third, while the metabolic pathways that are altered during synthetic torpor overlap with those altered
by stroke, it is unknown if these metabolic changes occur independently of hypothermia and if the altered
pathways and metabolites are related to cerebroprotection. We will investigate these metabolic changes,
identify the pathways and metabolites that are uniquely altered in response to synthetic torpor, and
characterize the temporal-spatial dynamics of cerebroprotection (Aim 3). Identified metabolites and metabolic
pathways may represent targets for future cerebroprotective interventions. Succesful completion of the
proposed research study will characterize the mechanistic underpinnings underlying synthetic torpor-mediated
cerebroprotection and address the knowledge gap on whether induction of a torpor-like state through
modulation of specific neural circuits represents a novel cerebroprotective strategy for the treatment of
ischemic stroke."
10931533,"Resolving the intoxication mechanism of botulinum neurotoxins using single molecule structural
biology.
The toxins produced by Clostridium botulinum are some of the deadliest known yet are also revered for
their pharmaceutical utility. C. botulinum is classified into seven serotypes (A-G) based on the
neurotoxins that they produce. Currently, pharmaceutical development has relied on botulinum
neurotoxin type A1 (BoNT/A). However, botulinum neurotoxin type E (BoNT/E) is currently in clinical
trials because it provides different pharmacokinetics, faster onset and shorter duration, which enable
new treatment regimes. The BoNT proteins are members of the two-component, “AB toxin” family (e.g.
tetanus, cholera, and diphtheria toxins), which inject a toxic cargo enzyme (part A) using a
proteinaceous transmembrane delivery system (part B). As such, their structure and activity has been
well studied. However, several fundamental open questions remain regarding the BoNT delivery
mechanism, such as the number of toxins required to deliver the cargo. Additionally, while numerous
structures have been solved of the dormant toxins, there is little structural information on the active
delivery state(s). AB toxins deliver their cargo across cellular membranes, typically triggered by low pH,
which causes structural changes of both parts A and B along with insertion into the membranes. The
presence of aggregation at high protein concentrations and membranes provide many experimental
challenges for techniques that rely on ensemble averaging. In contrast, single molecule fluorescence can
observe individual proteins on single liposomes to revist these classic problems in AB toxin structural
biology. These novel approaches will answer long-standing questions in the field and lead to new
understanding of the differences between two clinically relevant isoforms."

Human sensory systems cannot process all available inputs in a structured and meaningful way. Thus, selecting
relevant information and filtering out irrelevant and distracting information is critical to survive and thrive.
Decades of research on selective attention have investigated the neural mechanisms underlying the ability to
focus processing resources on relevant information, demonstrating that processing of information within the
focus of attention is enhanced. Much less clear is how task-irrelevant and distracting information is effectively
ignored, albeit major theories of attention proposing that efficient filtering of irrelevant information is essential for
many aspects of higher-level cognition. Thus, there is a critical need to identify the mechanisms that support the
effective ignoring of distracting information. Without such knowledge, models of attention are incomplete, and it
will remain difficult to help people avoid distractions in everyday lives. This proposal aims to identify the cortical
processes involved in effective distractor suppression, focusing on two modes of attention: Experience-based
attention, where based on statistical regularities in the environment processing resources are biased towards or
away from relevant or irrelevant information, respectively, and volitional attention, where processing resources
are allocated towards relevant or withdrawn from irrelevant information based on an individual’s intentions and
explicit task goals. Recent theories of cortical information processing indicate the importance of dissociating
between these two types of attention because they each influence information processing in distinct ways.
 Here, we test the hypothesis that experience-based attention induced via statistical regularities will be
more effective relative to volitional attention when ignoring distracting information. Our approach will combine
psychophysics, electrophysiological methods (EEG) and computational modeling to determine how experience
and intentions influence the temporal dynamics of cortical information processing and how they shape the quality
of the perceptual representations of to-be-ignored inputs. Critically, these neural measures will be directly linked
to behavioral performance with the goal to identify the neural mechanisms responsible for successful distractor
ignoring. Collectively, this work will provide key insights into how different modes of attentional control processes
interact to shape perception and behavior, and will more broadly test general models of attention and cognitive
control. Furthermore, the results of this proposal have the potential to help support people’s abilities to reduce
distraction in everyday tasks, such as driving and at the workplace, and elucidate on why certain populations
have particular difficulties in avoiding distractions, thereby enabling more targeted diagnoses and interventions
in clinical settings."
10844646,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 During severe COVID-19, immune hyperactivation contributes to tissue injury and worsened patient
outcomes. Complement (C’) proteins are believed to centrally mediate COVID-19-related immune
hyperactivation. C’ are a conserved set of immune proteins involved in host defense that become activated on
various cell types in the lung during severe COVID-19. Upon terminal activation, C’ proteins assemble to form
pore-like membrane attack complexes (MACs) that insert into target cell surfaces as transmembrane
structures. The presence of MACs in pulmonary tissues strongly correlates with immune hyperactivation, but
underlying mechanisms are unknown.
 The immune effects of MACs have been widely attributed to their cytolytic properties. However,
widespread MAC deposition occurs on alveolar endothelial cells (ECs) during severe COVID-19 in the absence
of significant EC death or vessel rarefaction. Instead, MAC-bound ECs show signs of EC dysfunction with
dysregulated NF-B activation and elaboration of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These patient-level observations
suggest immune effects of MACs that are separable from their cytolytic properties.
 In this application we examine a novel role for intracellular MAC proteins as alarmins. We used a
SARS-CoV-2-derived antigen, S protein, to induce non-cytolytic MAC assembly on human ECs. Following
assembly on ECs, surface-bound MACs became rapidly internalized and transferred to Rab5+ endosomes.
The pool of intracellular, but not extracellular or surface-bound MACs, activated NF-B to induce elaboration of
inflammatory cytokines. The intraluminal milieu of Rab5+ endosomes caused a MAC protein, C9, to form
insoluble aggregates that stimulated aggrephagy, a specialized form of selective macroautophagy, to activate
NF-B. Via proteomic profiling of solubilized MAC complexes (Sc5b-9) in COVID-19 sera, we identified
guanylate binding protein 4 (GBP4) as a C9-binding protein regulating aggrephagy and NF-B activity.
 Based on these exciting preliminary data we propose 2 Specific Aims to explore the hypothesis that
intracellular MAC proteins act as alarmins to initiate inflammatory signaling. We will consolidate role(s) for
GBP4 as an immune sensor by examining binding interactions with C9 using COVID-19 patient sera.
Secondly, we will identify mouse orthologs for human GBP4 that mediate C9 sensing and MAC-induced
immune hyperactivation in vivo in response to S protein-induced MAC and following infection by replication
competent SARS-CoV-2. Our studies introduce a new paradigm for understanding MAC-related immunity and
contribute to our long-term aim of understanding C’-induced inflammation. By doing this, druggable targets
ameliorating MAC-induced immune complications of severe COVID-19 may emerge."
10930916,"SUMMARY: OUTREACH CORE
The goals of the scientific portion of this proposal are directed towards bringing personalized medicine to the
clinic for glioblastoma patients through integrative mathematical methods. Effectively bringing computational
results into the clinic requires a broader understanding of the methods and general principles by scientists,
clinicians, and patients alike. More scientists need to be aware of these non-traditional techniques in order to
build additional models and enhance methodology for the clinic. Interpretation of model output for use in therapy
will require clinicians to have a solid understanding of a given model’s strengths and limitations. Also, for patients
to choose and feel confident in therapies directed by these techniques, they will require a broader awareness of
the existence, potential benefit, and value of these therapies. The primary goal of the Outreach Core is to
disseminate knowledge of mathematical oncology and cancer systems biology to students, colleagues, and the
general public. To accomplish our goal, we will strive to appeal to each target group through the following:
Training new cross-disciplinary scientists. We will recruit undergraduate and graduate students along with
postdoctoral trainees at our various institutions, providing them with opportunities for research and improving
cross-disciplinary understanding. For undergraduates, this will take the form of internships, senior thesis projects
and summer research experiences. For graduate students and postdoctoral trainees, this will take the form of
longer-term research projects possibly culminating in master’s thesis and/or doctoral dissertation projects.
Inform the research community. Beyond presenting our work at conferences targeting many different
audiences, we will design conferences and workshops to attract clinicians and research scientists from multiple
disciplines to inspire and update them about emerging research at the interface of oncology, mathematical
modeling, and imaging.
Engage with the general public. We will develop an online, easily accessible presence by creating a website
and using social networking platforms including Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook. We will work with Mayo Clinic
patient advocacy groups to engage brain tumor patients and their families by hosting informational workshops
for brain tumor advocacy groups in our PNT lab at Mayo Clinic. In addition, we will partner with the Mayo Clinic
Cancer Education Center to host the general public through evening and weekend workshops designed for a lay
audience.
Outcome assessment We will assess the success of our outreach efforts across each sphere of influence."

The major objective of the Biospecimen Core is to obtain, process, image, and analyze glioblastoma (GBM)
patients’ biopsies for use in both Projects of our Mayo/Columbia CSBC Mathematical Oncology Systems
Analysis Imaging Center (MOSAIC). Patient biopsies are central to our CSBC’s primary goal: building a
conceptual framework to understand sensitive response to therapy through the represented tissue states in
clinical and experimental settings. The duties of the Biospecimen Core are spread across both sites: Mayo
Clinic Arizona (MCA) and Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC).
The Biospecimen Core will assist the Center by operating under two specific aims. In Aim 1, we collect, process,
and analyze image-guided biopsies from pre-and post-treatment GBM. For Aim 2, we perform histopathological,
immunohistochemical (multiplex-IHC), and molecular analyses (bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq) of image-guided
biopsies.
The Biospecimen Core will provide support for both projects.
Project 1: Targeting Glioma Tissue States will utilize the RNAseq and single cell sequencing data from the
biopsies collected and analyzed by the Biospecimen Core to assess the compositional landscape of
glioblastoma along with the cross-talk between different subgroups that influence phenotype.
Project 2: Imaging the Dynamic Tissue State in Patients In Vivo will utilize the bulk histology and RNAseq
along with the imaging of the image-localized biopsies collected from the Biospecimen Core. Project 2 will
also incorporate these histologic and molecular cell lineage data into ML and mechanistic models that map the
relationship of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features to cellular composition. These data will drive the
training and validation of machine learning models and the parameterization of mechanistic mathematical
models.
The data generated by the Biospecimen Core will be transferred to the Data Integration and Computation
Core, where it will be stored, further processed including batch correction and atlas alignment, and integrated
into computational modeling tools."

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory autoimmune disease of the CNS that results in demyelination,
axonal injury, and neuronal loss. Abnormal immune responses involving the trafficking of peripherally activated
immune cells into the CNS are major drivers of inflammatory disease activity in relapsing multiple sclerosis, as
underscored by the success of immune-targeting therapies. By contrast, the biology of non-relapsing
progressive disease is thought to involve CNS-compartmentalized inflammation and degenerative disease
mechanisms, which remains more refractory to therapy, due in part to the complexity of gene regulatory network
coupled with cell-type-specific mechanisms of MS lesion progression. What types or subtypes of cells are
affected by this process and their spatial heterogeneity in the tissue context as well as how these cells impact
the tissue environments remain poorly understood, which precludes the development of strategies to target
these cells to improve healthspan/lifespan or harnessing these cells or secreted factors to promote tissue
remodeling and repair, highlighting a pressing need for tools to map cells and the surround environments in the
tissues lesion and generate biomarkers to define spatial and phenotypic heterogeneity. This project aims to
develop novel molecular barcoding scheme and downstream biochemistry in combination with novel
microdevices for spatial multi-omics that allows simultaneous profiling of multi epigenomic modalities, whole
transcriptome, and a panel of proteins at tissue scale and cellular level in a spatially resolved manner. We will
apply the spatial multi-omics to map human brain tissue dissected from the edge of demyelinated white matter
MS lesions at different stages of inflammation as well as the demyelinated lesion core, the white matter
periplaque and normal white matter from neurologically healthy brains. Spatial omics data will be integrated with
single-cell data to identify signatures of different affected cells and perform the tissue neighborhood analysis to
define the cellular composition and molecular signatures in MS lesions. The expected outcomes and the major
contributions include: (1) Fundamental knowledge on diverse cell types and their epigenomic, transcriptional
and phenotypic (protein) characteristics in the context of 3D tissue organization in the MS brain lesions and (2)
Offer the possibility of testing new therapeutic approaches for MS that are not targeted by currently approved
treatments. The resulting data will lead to a better understanding of the relationship between tissue organization,
function, and gene regulatory networks in MS."

More than 6.5 million Americans suffer from Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), and by 2050 this number is expected to
double. Yet the development of effective therapies remains an urgent unmet need. In a scenario of highly
complex AD pathophysiology and costly and long drug development process, repurposing of drugs approved for
other indications is an attractive complementary approach. The rationale for repurposing a drug initially relies
on observational studies demonstrating that the cumulative drug exposure is correlated with either a reduction
in the risk of developing AD dementia, or with a slowing of the rate of cognitive decline based on serial cognitive
evaluations, or with milder AD neuropathological changes at autopsy examination, after adjusting for covariates
including age, sex, education, family history of dementia and APOE genotype, and vascular and other modifiable
risk factors. However, the vast majority of such published longitudinal studies have ignored the truncation or
interval censoring associated with the covariate of interest (e.g., cumulative drug exposure), which is due to
either termination of observation by death or non-continuous observation visits in longitudinal studies. Building
upon our extensive prior work in the areas of truncation and censoring as well as AD, here we propose to develop
methods to more appropriately treat these sampling and measurement problems to avoid bias. We will apply
them in two case studies of drugs with opposite purported associations with AD risk -- statins (protective) and
proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs, deleterious) -- but mixed findings from longitudinal studies. To this end, we will
leverage the strengths of two high-quality publicly available longitudinal datasets: the National Alzheimer’s
Coordinating Center (NACC) cohort study and the Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS). In Aim 1, we propose
analytic methods that remove biases arising due to covariate measurements that are truncated in AD studies,
such as cumulative statin exposure, including inverse probability weighting, pseudo-observations and reverse
regression approaches. In Aim 2, we develop pseudo-observation methods for time-to-event regression with
interval-censored covariates. In Aim 3, we conduct and report analyses of NACC and HABS datasets using
proposed methods, and develop publicly available R packages for implementation of our proposed methods.
Successful completion of these specific aims will produce new statistical methodology that will eliminate the bias
that may arise with truncated and interval-censored covariates, which are inherent to longitudinal cohort studies
in AD and related dementias. Our proposed research is responsive to the NIA Notice of Special Interest (NOSI):
Maximizing the Scientific Value of Secondary Analyses of Existing Cohorts and Datasets in Order to Address
Research Gaps and Foster Additional Opportunities in Aging Research (NOT-AG-21-020)."

10912800,"PROJECT SUMMARY—ANALYSIS CORE
The overall goal of the Analyses Core (AnC) of the of the Longevity, Equity, and Aging Research Network
(L.E.A.R.N) Consortium is to provide biostatistical, epidemiological, and methodological training, mentoring and
assistance, and to guide junior investigators from diverse and underrepresented groups (collectively called
RCMAR Scientists) in the conduct of transdisciplinary ethnogeriatrics health disparities research that
integrates biological, social, behavioral, and cultural considerations. We will train them to use various
innovative techniques, including emerging methodologies (i.e., biomedical data science, digital health methods,
precision medicine techniques and virtual reality and simulation-based interventions), qualitative research,
mixed methods research, and implementation science. The AnC will review, monitor, and provide guidance
and continuing biostatistical, bioinformatics and database support for all our RCMAR Scientists. We will closely
collaborate within our center with the Leadership and Administration Core and the Research Education
Component to provide continuing individualized consulting, training, and education for RCMAR Scientists. We
will also collaborate and share resources with the L.E.A.R.N Consortium faculty, the RCMAR Coordinating
Center and our sister RCMAR centers across the nation. The strength of our core lies in our experienced core
investigators with complementary expertise/experience and exceptional devotion to mentoring and education
of early career researchers. Along with mentoring and consulting, the AnC will provide formal education
through statistics and methods classes in the Stanford Psychiatry Department. The AnC and the Research
Education Component will work closely to direct RCMAR Scientists to the appropriate courses based on the
needs of their pilot projects and their personalized training plan. The AnC will also assist the RCMAR Scientists
with safe and high-quality database management for the pilot projects. As the RCMAR Scientists are early
career researchers, special care will be taken to ensure that, regardless of the nature of pilot projects, they will
be mentored to exercise great caution in handling the human subject data, which will also provide a crucial
opportunity for them to train with and learn from experts on proper management of human subject data. In
addition to supporting RCMAR Scientists, the AnC will actively develop cutting edge statistical and research
methods with the common goal of advancing care of and research on older adults from diverse backgrounds.
Taking advantage of the interdisciplinary forum that will be naturally formed under the proposed RCMAR
program, the AnC will lead and encourage project investigators to collaborate on various statistical and
methodological research topics pertinent to ethnogeriatrics, such as biomedical data science approaches,
bioinformatics, digital health, virtual reality and simulation study design, personalized (precision) medicine,
qualitative and mixed methods, comparative effectiveness, behavioral interventions, effect heterogeneity, and
joint utilization of multiple analytical traditions to effectively handle multitude of information."
10897307,"This Program-project (PPG) application is focused on conducting preclinical studies to understand the molecular
basis of immune programming by the rhesus cytomegalovirus vaccine against SIV infection (RhCMV/SIV
vaccine), and on defining the role and actions of IL-15 in eliciting vaccine protection against persistent SIV
infection. These studies are highly relevant for HIV vaccine development. RhCMV/SIV elicits high frequency and
persistent effector-differentiated T cell responses in diverse tissues. Using of this vaccine in the rhesus macaque
(RM) model of Simian immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) infection has demonstrated superior efficacy against highly
pathogenic SIV challenge over conventional SIV vaccines (overall 59% of RhCMV/SIV vaccinated RM with
abrogation of progressive SIV infection). The RhCMV/SIV vaccine response mediates early SIV intercept and
replication arrest followed by eventual viral clearance. Vaccine protection is mediated by an MHC-E-restricted
immune response of effector memory-differentiated CD8+ T cells unique to CMV-vector vaccination. We have
revealed also that interleukin (IL)-15 and the IL-15 response are correlates of protection by RhCMV/SIV
vaccination. The IL-15 response is rapidly induced following vaccination, with low prevaccination baseline IL-15
expression/response in blood, followed by rapid induction of IL-15 response networks linked with vaccine
protection. This IL-15 dynamic serves as RhCMV/SIV vaccine efficacy outcome predictor. We have defined an
inclusive whole blood predictive protective signature (wbPPTS) biomarker of RhCMV/SIV vaccine efficacy, and
we will monitor this wbPPTS across RM vaccina cohorts within vivo studies to define the molecular mechanisms
of vaccine immune programming. We hypothesize that RhCMV/SIV vaccine and IL-15 together direct expression
of specific gene networks across tissues and cells to program effective vaccine immunity and establish the
wbPPTS biomarker signature of vaccine protection. To investigate this hypothesis we have designed our PPG
with two projects and three service cores including: Project 1. Systemic analysis of the origin and tissue effects
of the 68-1 RhCMV/SIV vaccine efficacy-predictive whole blood transcriptomic signature; Project 2: Systems
vaccinology of RhCMV/SIV and IL-15 mechanisms of immune programming; Core A, Administration, Core B,
Nonhuman primates, and Core C, Systems biology. We feature in vitro/ex vivo and in vivo studies within a
Systems Vaccinology design using multiomics 4-platform RNAseq applications (bulk RNAseq,
scRNAseq/CITEseq, GeoMx/CosMx, Nanostring) and bioinformatics and statistical modeling approaches to
define the systems response across tissues and cell types revealing the molecular basis of immune programming
by IL-15 and RhCMV/SIV vaccine."
10918210,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Deep South of the United States has a disproportionate burden of kidney, urology and non-malignant
hematology (KUH) diseases as well as disparities in health outcomes related to these conditions. To reduce or
eliminate these disparities, it is imperative to grow the scientific workforce of investigators who can generate
new insights into mechanisms underlying KUH diseases and develop interventions for their prevention,
treatment and cure. The mission of the Deep South KUH Premier Research and Inter-disciplinary
Mentored Education (PRIME) program is to develop a modern workforce of investigators in the Deep South
who have the training, skills and drive necessary to advance KUH health through science and medicine. We
will do so by leveraging the distinct research strengths and complementary training assets at Augusta
University, Tulane University, and the University of Alabama at Birmingham to form a cohesive training
network. These institutions have long-standing research partnerships such as the CTSA-funded Center for
Clinical and Translational Science Partner Network and a track record of collaborations that have made
seminal contributions to KUH science. The Administrative Core (AC) will provide oversight of the entire
program and amalgamate the other cores (Network, Professional Development, and TL1) to facilitate the
development of future KUH scientists. The AC will be the center point of the organizational structure and
governance of the entire program, leveraging the collaborative spirit and established relationships between
KUH scientists at the three institutions to form a cohesive training network. In this capacity, the AC will deliver
timely and efficient communication regarding overall program activities, initiatives, and proposed changes;
assure quality of the network by development and assessment of milestones based on specific metrics; and
solicit input from internal and external sources to enhance programmatic evaluation. A full-time Program
Manager will facilitate communication between the aforementioned entities and individuals; be responsible for
coordinating and scheduling meetings across all cores; collate evaluations; and manage budgetary data. This
will allow us to accomplish the following Aims: (1) integrate KUH-focused training mechanisms throughout the
Deep South into a new, unified KUH training ecosystem; (2) establish an evaluation program for the Deep
South KUH PRIME and all of its Cores, trainees and mentors, including reviews from internal and external
evaluation boards; (3) assure that diversity, equity and inclusion are key components of the overall network;
and (4) organize a yearly “Building the KUH community” symposium, which will provide a platform for trainees
to present their investigative findings and grow a fertile networking environment. Our multiple PI team has an
exemplary record in leading collaborative research programs and training KUH scholars ensuring that we will
accomplish our overall vision to create and nurture a community of scholars that is diverse, inter-disciplinary,
inter-connected, and well-equipped with skills to transform and advance scientific discovery."
10918211,"PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT CORE SUMMARY
Augusta University, Tulane University, and the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) have a strong well-
recognized culture of KUH investigators who promote professional development. The Deep South KUH Premier
Research and Inter-disciplinary Mentored Education (PRIME) Professional Development Core (PDC) will
implement a strategy for the inter-institutional and inter-disciplinary basic, translational, and clinical KUH
workforce with innovative programs. The overall goals of the PDC are to inspire and motivate the next
generation of scientific leaders, and, to sustain leadership within the Deep South KUH community. The PDC
provides an inclusive culture for all scholars and faculty underrepresented in medicine to succeed in an inter-
disciplinary environment. Aim 1. Establish a multi-dimensional, inter-disciplinary professional
development program of KUH trainees and early career investigators. The PDC will create a
multidimensional mentorship model for the Deep South KUH community to expand resources that includes
career coaches, near-peer activities and mentoring training at the KUH symposium, career development in team
science and entrepreneurship, and preceptor training in promoting a DEI culture. These personalized programs
include engaging coaches, role models, and mentors committed to participating in development of KUH trainees
and early stage investigators. To facilitate engagement, we developed inspirational forums and summer career
trajectory workshops to inspire and motivate KUH-themed career development that will sustain involvement in
the KUH community. Aim 2. Cultivate an inter-institutional KUH research culture for KUH trainees by
establishing an inter-disciplinary Scientific Mentoring And Research Training (iSMART) program. We will
enrich professional development of trainees through the iSMART program that will enhance scientific writing and
peer review effectiveness for KUH research. To sustain involvement in the KUH community, trainees will be
engaged as near-peer mentors, facilitators, and study section members for the subsequent cohorts of trainees.
Aim 3. Establish inter-disciplinary KUH scientific and mentoring development for early career
researchers through protected time for research training and research support. We will ensure
professional development of early stage investigators through the KUH Research Investigator Training (KUHR-
IT) institute providing one-on-one guidance that will enhance extramural applications for career development
awards and improve research methodology as well as establish the GAp year INternship (GAIN) program for
early career investigators. Early career investigators will serve as mentors, facilitators, and study section
members for the subsequent cohorts. The PDC provides innovative, immersive, and inter-disciplinary programs
for professional development with the NC, AC, and TL1 training core. In doing so, the Deep South KUH PRIME
will meet our mission to develop a diverse modern workforce of investigators who have the training and skills
necessary to advance KUH health through science and medicine."
10918213,"NETWORK CORE SUMMARY
In order to fully engage scholars at Augusta University, Tulane University, and the University of Alabama at
Birmingham in the Deep South KUH Premier Research and Inter-disciplinary Mentored Education (PRIME)
program, it is necessary to provide opportunities for scholars to come together, in a supportive environment, to
cultivate meaningful interactions. The overall goal of the Network Core (NC) it to help scholars develop and
maintain their professional networks and in doing so it will give them a solid foundation to establish roots in their
scientific and healthcare communities. AIM 1: Develop networking activities that connect scholars with their
peers, role models, and mentors and provide the opportunity to enhance networking skill development
including the optimal use of social media for professional engagement. The NC will host quarterly hybrid-
format workshops by a networking expert to teach our scholars how to develop their professional brand and build
their networks. We will bring together scholars and role models/established faculty at our annual “Building the
KUH community” symposium with events such as lunch with assigned seating. The NC will build the KUH novice,
graduate student, postdoctoral/fellow, and early career peer groups where scholars will work together to host 1-
2 in person events and a virtual cross-institutional networking event annually. The NC will leverage current
seminars and the new KUH PRIME Crosstalk virtual journal club and works in progress program to include
gatherings with invited role models. All TL1-trainees will record a podcast in our Role Model Engagement
program that will be included in our quarterly digital newsletter and shared on our website and @KUHPRIME
social sites. AIM 2: Engage in regional and national outreach and advocacy activities to increase
networking opportunities and enhance the participation of a diverse cohort of scholars. The NC will
harness activities supported by our institutes’ advocacy groups and national organizations to develop
approaches to increase awareness of the KUH PRIME and the importance of increasing diversity in training. The
NC will establish the Personal Experiences in PRIME (PEP) outreach initiative with visits between PRIME
trainees and faculty and scholars in high schools, community colleges, and historically black colleges and
universities near Augusta, GA, Birmingham, AL, and New Orleans, LA. These in person gatherings will introduce
biomedical research and the benefits of a career in science or medicine to students who lack such exposure on
their local campus. The unifying vision is that the NC works closely with the TL1 and other training programs in
our institutions to build and connect the membership of the KUH community, while the Professional Development
Core develops the hard and soft skills of the membership to optimally position them for career success and
advancement. In doing so, the Deep South KUH Prime will meet our mission to develop a modern workforce of
investigators in the Deep South who have the training and skills necessary to advance KUH health through
science and medicine."

ongoing and stable funding for four high quality and productive vision research resource/service
Modules: Instrument Design, Research Computer Programming, Biostatistics Support, and
Biological Imaging. These Modules are directed by established vision scientists, and run by an
exceptionally talented staff with considerable long-term experience in supporting and advancing
innovative vision research at UH. The Modules provide needed research resources and services,
with prioritized and equitable access, to the present group of 22 Core vision scientists who come
from three departments at the University (Biomedical Engineering, Vision Sciences and Clinical
Sciences in Optometry). These Core vision scientists have diverse training and research interests;
they collaborate effectively with one another, as well as with other vision researchers at this
University or other institutions. Together, 11 of the Core investigators hold 16 active NEI R01
grants, with three other core investigators as Co-Is. Core investigators also have other NEI, NIH
and nonfederal vision research funding. The College of Optometry and University provide
substantial additional commitments in support of vision research. During the past five years of
P30 funding at this university, the Core Grant and the University have created a favorable vision
research environment, including new instrumentation and collaborative arrangements that have
contributed directly to 170 out of 300 published papers by UH Optometry. Core modules have
facilitated competition for six entirely new NEI R01 grants by four investigators. The Core Grant
also was instrumental for recruiting eight investigators, established and new, to the UH Core
group of vision scientists, three of whom brought NEI R01 funding, and two, other NEI support.
These accomplishments reflect the Core's previous and current aims reinforced by the oversight
of the Administrative Core, that focus on advancing collaborative and innovative vision research
to increase knowledge and prevent or cure diseases that impair vision. Through these aims the
Core grant provides stable funding, quality research services, new independent vision
researchers, and new projects attracting NEI and other NIH support. Especially emphasized in
the coming five years will be innovative research and recruitment of vision researchers to fill
existing and future open positions."
10886775,"Abstract
For this CIMAC renewal, the Stanford Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center
(CIMAC) will continue to collaborate with NCI and the CIMAC/CIDC network to identify and,
where appropriate, lead correlative studies for trials testing novel immunotherapy regimens. We
will participate in working group calls, network meetings, and coordination with clinical teams.
The Stanford CIMAC performs highly comprehensive assays of immune phenotype and
function for NCI-identified clinical trials. These will include already validated and harmonized
Tier 1 assays, validated Tier 2 assays, and newly proposed exploratory Tier 3 assays. For Tier 1
assays, we propose CyTOF, singleplex IHC, Olink, TCRseq and RNAseq. For Tier 2, we
propose single-cell TCRseq, MIBI, ATACseq, and CyTOF proteomics. For Tier 3, we propose
single-cell glycan imaging (by MALDI-ToF), spatial transcriptomics (Nanostring DSP platform),
and single-cell genomics/proteomics (Mission Bio Tapestri and BD Rhapsody platforms). We will
use longitudinal reference materials for tracking inter-batch and inter-project consistency. We
will assess quality control measures on all assays before uploading data to the Cancer Immune
Data Commons (CIDC) according to their specifications.
We will also perform biostatistical analysis of results for all assays performed, in relation to
clinical outcome data. For those trials where Stanford is the lead CIMAC, we will perform
integrative analysis across assays, using appropriate machine learning techniques and
multivariate regression algorithms such as LASSO or Elastic Net. We will work closely with the
clinical teams to obtain standardized clinical data, and to disseminate and publish results in
accordance with NCI guidelines."
10930132,"The Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) Study is a multi-center cohort study of children aged 6 months
to 16 years with mild to moderate impaired kidney function. Two clinical coordinating centers (CCCs; Children's
Hospital of Philadelphia and Children's Mercy Kansas City) and a data coordinating center (Johns Hopkins
Bloomberg School of Public Health) have formed a cooperative agreement to conduct a prospective study of
chronic kidney disease in children. During the 2018 to 2023 funding cycle, we established links with the University
of Minnesota for measurement of iohexol GFR which will be maintained and expanded to all centralized
measurements were they to be selected as the Central Biochemistry Laboratory for the 2023-2028 cycle, but
infrastructure is in place to work with whichever institution is selected. Since its inception in 2003, CKiD aims are
to determine the risk factors for decline in kidney function and define how progressive decline in kidney function
is associated with cardiovascular health; neurocognitive function and behavior; and growth. The purpose of this
application is to propose new initiatives to continue the cohort study from August 2023 to July 2028. The
substantive scientific aims are described in the application from the collaborating CCCs. This application
describes the role that the KIdney Disease in children data Management and Analysis Center (KIDMAC) will
perform as the data coordinating center. We will continue to provide leadership in study design, coordination and
conduct, data management and analytical methodology and thereby enhance the scientific scope of CKiD. The
specific aims of KIDMAC are: 1) to provide biostatistical and epidemiological study design expertise including
the recruitment of 14-17 year olds with pediatric chronic kidney disease (CKD) to follow through the transition to
adult care, remote data collection from a variety of sources to complement in-person study visits, and a targeted
design for iohexol GFR measurement among those with higher kidney function to validate and refine the newly
proposed Under 25 (U25) eGFR equations; 2) to provide the Steering Committee, the two CCCs, the CBL and
the scientific subcommittees with an infrastructure to coordinate and conduct CKiD research activities; 3) to
transition to web-based Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) to capture and manage CKiD data; 4) to
provide biostatistical and epidemiological leadership in the analysis, interpretation and presentation of study-
wide initiatives including the development of methods for the appropriate analyses of the CKiD data (e.g., mixture
models to identify distinct clinical subgroups, machine learning methodology for prediction) to understand the
impact of childhood CKD on kidney function decline in children and young adulthood and incidence of
cardiovascular outcomes in young adulthood; and 5) to implement a quality assurance program that integrates
expertise in data management, study coordination, statistical methodology and scientific disciplines. KIDMAC
investigators have expertise in research design, coordination, data management, quality assurance and
epidemiological and biostatistical methods for complex longitudinal and survival data."
10922864,"An excess burden of chronic kidney and end stage renal disease is experienced by Black Americans.
Risk variants in the apolipoprotein-1 (APOL1) gene, found almost exclusively in individuals of African ancestry,
are associated with several forms of non-diabetic kidney disease in Black Americans, including focal
segmental glomerulosclerosis, HIV-associated nephropathy, and hypertension-related kidney disease. These
APOL1 risk variants explain up to 70% of the excess risk in Black Americans with these kidney diseases.
However, presence of these risk variants does not guarantee development of kidney disease, with secondary
genetic or environmental hits required. This along with lack of targeted therapies makes the value of genetic
screening for APOL1 risk variants unknown. The impact of APOL1 risk variants in kidney transplantation, for
both donors and recipients, is understudied. It is unknown if living kidney donors with APOL1 risk variants are
at increased risk for development of kidney disease post donation. For recipients, initial studies have
suggested that recipients who receive donor kidneys with two APOL1 risk variants may have worse graft
outcomes. Due to both biological and social-economic factors, Black Americans have been historically
disadvantaged in receiving kidney transplants, and the theoretical practice of APOL1 genetic screening and
excluding donors with risk variants could further disadvantage this population. These multiple questions
highlight the need to thoroughly examine the impact of APOL1 risk alleles on transplant outcomes. The NIH-
sponsored APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Network (APOLLO) is addressing this
important question by uniting transplant centers, organ procurement organizations (OPOs), and the United
Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) to enroll donors of African ancestry and their kidney recipients, then follow
their transplant outcomes. In Phase 1 of APOLLO, we have functioned as an ideal clinical center in direct
response to original request for application by enrolling 154 qualifying deceased donor recipients, living
donors, and living donor recipients through partnerships with 8 transplant centers in addition to our primary
Vanderbilt University Medical Clinical Center, providing DNA, biospecimens, and essential longitudinal clinical
data. Our aligned transplant centers include large academic programs as well a small community programs to
strive for the goal of universal enrollment. We have worked seamlessly with the other Clinical Centers and the
SDRC, as well as partnered with OPOs and UNOS, to build a strong foundation for APOLLO. For Phase 2, we
will continue the important work of the APOLLO Consortium through accomplishment of several aims. In Aim 1,
we will prospectively collect long-term follow-up data on all APOLLO participants and enroll additional living
donors. In Aim 2, we will provide detailed clinical data and biospecimens on APOLLO participants as well as
kidney transplant biopsy slides from our Clinical Center. In Aim 3, we will facilitate return of APOL1 genotype
results. Once completed, these Aims will advance our knowledge of APOL1 in kidney transplantation."
10848474,"Project Summary
 BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) associated nephropathy (PVAN) is the leading cause of kidney transplant
loss (~10%/year). BKPyV infects approximately 80-90% of people during childhood and is kept in check by
the host immune system. However, in transplant patients BKPyV reactivation causes PVAN due to
suppression of their immune system. The current treatment is reduction of immunosuppression, which
increases the risk of graft rejection, but untreated PVAN will result in allograft loss. Patients are routinely
monitored for BKPyV in the urine and the plasma, providing an opportunity to treat early with antivirals,
before decreasing immunosuppression is required. Based on our mechanistic studies, we have identified
two host pathways required for BKPyV production in primary kidney cells that, when inhibited by existing
drugs, reduce viral titers.
 We discovered that bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, potently decreases viral titers by 3 logs, at
low doses and without affecting cell fitness. We will also test newer generation proteasome inhibitors that
are less toxic and/or orally available, carfilzomib and ixazomib.
 Given that the proteasome is required early during infection, we sought to inhibit a second host
target that would reduce viral production late in infection, or could potentially eliminate virally infected cells.
BKPyV requires activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) for cell cycle arrest, to prolong S phase for
viral replication and assembly. Inhibiting the DDR activating kinases (ATM and ATR), forces BKPyV
infected, but not mock infected, cells exit S phase, and viral titers are reduced.
 Our studies revealed two potent targets, the proteasome and the DDR, which both have known
inhibitors, one is already FDA approved, and the other is in clinical trials (both are being used for other
indications). The proposed aims will determine the effects of these inhibitors, and combinations of them, on
viral titers, cell viability and cell cycle regulation, using clinical viral isolates to infect primary renal proximal
tubular epithelial cells, which are the natural cell type infected in humans. We will sequence the virus before
and after inhibition studies to determine if there are changes to the viral genome. This proof-of-concept data
is required in order to test the inhibitor(s) in clinical trials (beyond the scope of this study) as antivirals that
can protect against graft loss caused by BKPyV reactivation. There is an urgent need for antivirals that can
either prevent or treat BKPyV reactivation prior to or in conjunction with immunosuppression."
10764329,"The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a comprehensive plan of research training and career development to enable the principal investigator to successfully complete her PhD and acquire a competitive postdoctoral position performing translational research in the fields of aging and cancer. Phase I focuses on completion of ongoing PhD training investigating the role of the aging microenvironment in ovarian cancer (OvCa) metastasis. OvCa is the most fatal gynecologic malignancy and the 5th leading cause of overall cancer death among American women with a low 5-year survival rate, as 75% of women are diagnosed with disseminated intra-peritoneal (IP) metastasis. OvCa metastasis differs from most other cancers in that cells detach from the primary tumor, shed into the peritoneal cavity, adhere to the peritoneal mesothelial cell (MC) monolayer, intercalate within this layer, and invade into the submesothelial matrix, where they proliferate and form secondary lesions. Aging is the biggest risk factor for the development of OvCa. Half of OvCa diagnoses are in women over the age of 63, and older OvCa patients have a higher risk of mortality. Despite this, age is understudied in the OvCa field. Even though the peritoneum has near the same surface area as the skin, the effect of age on the peritoneum has not been systematically evaluated. Using three distinct murine pre-clinical models of aging and OvCa metastasis, our lab previously demonstrated enhanced metastatic seeding of peritoneal structures in aged mice accompanied by altered immune cell infiltration. Current preliminary data in this application show that there are distinct differences observed when comparing peritoneal collagen ultrastructure in young and aged animals at major metastatic sites. Moreover, using purified collagen from young versus aged mice in a panel of in vitro assays, we showed increased invasion of OvCa cells through aged collagen relative to young, despite no difference in adhesion or proliferation. Differential susceptibility to proteolytic remodeling was also observed. This data supports our hypothesis that age-related changes to the metastatic environment enhance ovarian cancer metastasis in aged patients. The Phase I goal of the proposed research is to identify small molecules that can target these age-related structural modifications in collagen with the goal of reducing metastatic dissemination in aged mice. Additional studies will evaluate the other major component of the peritoneal cavity, the visceral adipocytes, with characterization of age-related changes in the adipocytes proteome. The Phase II goal will focus on the immune landscape of an aging cancer. Studies will focus on T cell infiltration and immunosenescence with aging. The emphasis on multi-disciplinary aspects of aging throughout the training, combining a predoctoral focus on the tumor metastatic microenvironment and a postdoctoral focus on the tumor immune system will position the candidate for a translational career investigating the role of aging on immunotherapy and mechanisms by which to improve immunotherapy responses in aged cancer patients."
10897286,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This application is submitted by the Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of
Pennsylvania to serve as the Scientific and Data Coordinating Center (SDCC) for Phase 5 of the Chronic
Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study. Since its inception in 2001, the CRIC Study has enrolled and
followed a racially and ethnically diverse cohort of 5,625 individuals with reduced kidney function at 7 Clinical
Centers across the United States. As the landmark prospective evaluation of CKD, the CRIC Study has
performed extensive and deep biological, physiological, and social phenotyping, and ascertained longitudinal
clinical and patient-centered outcomes across multiple domains. Findings from the CRIC Study have defined
trajectories of CKD progression, catalogued development and evolution of comorbidities in CKD, and identified
a diverse array of factors and pathways that explain the progression and complications of CKD in adults.
Through its highly productive Ancillary Studies and Opportunity Pool Programs, both the scientific scope of the
CRIC Study and the community of kidney disease researchers have been markedly expanded. During the
most recent funding cycle (Phase 4: 2018-2023), three innovative subprotocol studies were implemented to
enrich CRIC data with highly granular home-based assessments of kidney function and cardiovascular
measures. During the fifth and final phase of the CRIC Study, the major goals will be to (1) ascertain the
clinical outcomes for all participants including those enrolled in the Phase 4 subprotocols, (2) perform analyses
linking the subprotocol measurements to clinical outcomes, (3) integrate data from multiple domains to identify
subphenotypes underlying the heterogeneity in CKD progression outcomes, (4) conduct final study visits for
the full CRIC cohort eligible for Phase 5, (5) create mechanisms for future data collection via linkages with
external sources of health data, and (6) generate tools and resources to facilitate ongoing use of CRIC data
and biospecimens by a broad group of investigators after the CRIC Study has formally ended. An important
product of the Phase 5 analytical activities will be a data-driven holistic CKD framework that will depict the
complex interplay of contributors to CKD progression and cardiovascular complications, inform patient care,
and guide the design of future clinical trials. The SDCC, led by a highly experienced team of investigators from
the University of Pennsylvania, Tulane University, and Northwestern University, will provide scientific and
operational leadership to ensure that the CRIC Study Group achieves these goals. The proposed activities,

10844420,"Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) arise from stratified epithelia, the most relevant organ sites in the veteran
population are the skin and oral cavity where high exposure to UV irradiation and tobacco carcinogens make
the total and high-risk SCCs significantly higher than the civilian population. SCC’s worst outcome is death
through metastasis, most commonly in the lung. SCC deaths exceed melanoma deaths due to the high
number of SCC cases. The lack of spontaneous SCC lung metastasis models has hindered identification of
SCC lung metastasis mechanisms and therapeutic targets. We developed several genetically engineered
mouse models that target driver mutations frequently found in human SCCs to keratin K15+ stem cells. These
models develop spontaneous lung SCC metastasis with different frequencies. Together with their derived cell
lines, they are unique tools to study mechanisms of SCC lung metastasis in different immune tumor
microenvironments (TME). We have shown that a subpopulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs), i.e., the Hoechst
dye excluding side population (SP), have the ability to metastasize, suggesting that CSC properties dictate the
lung metastasis route. Our preliminary data revealed that cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) derived from
metastatic SCCs enhanced CSC expansion and invasion in vitro and seeding to the lung in vivo. Further, CAFs
undergo unique changes in gene expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, and candidate markers for
SCC CAFs are distinctive from other metastatic cancers. Lastly, targeting myeloid cells reduced SCC
metastasis. Taken together, we hypothesize that CSC properties predispose them to travel via blood vessels
and survive in the lung. Additionally, SCC-CAF crosstalk has local and systemic effects preparing the
metastatic TME and premetastatic (prior to metastasis)/metastatic (after SCC cell seeding) niche. Using our
mouse models as well as patients’ SCC specimens, the proposed studies will identify prognostic markers and
therapeutic targets for high risk metastatic SCCs and develop interventional therapies that will be brought into
clinic in the near future. Aim 1 will assess if molecules associated with multipotent CSC properties contribute
to CSCs invasion and intravasation to blood vessels. Aim 2 will identify metastatic SCC-specific CAF ECM
signatures and molecular markers that enhance metastatic CSC properties. Aim 3 will identify systemic effects
of CAF-SCC interactions that establish a metastatic TME in primary SCC and pre-metastatic/metastatic niche
in the lung. Our unique mouse model systems and cross-species comparisons with human SCCs, multiple high
throughput assays and innovative approaches will significantly accelerate discovery of SCC metastasis
mechanisms and simultaneously test therapeutic interventions."

Abstract
 Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related mortality in both men and women in the United States.
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) constitutes 80% of all lung cancers and immune checkpoint blockade has
emerged as an effective therapeutic strategy, but only 20% of NSCLC patients respond to these agents. Among
veterans both the rate of incidence and the rate of mortality are twice higher than the entire population, making
this an urgent unmet clinical need among veterans particularly for those who do not respond to current therapies.
 NK cells are innate lymphoid cells fundamental to host defense against viral infections and malignancies.
In humans, low NK cell cytotoxicity in peripheral blood correlates with increased cancer risk. Conversely, NK cell
infiltration into tumor tissue is associated with better patient prognosis in multiple malignancies, including
NSCLC. Our preliminary data show that depletion of NK cells in a genetic mouse model of lung cancer
significantly promotes tumor progression, increases tumor burden and decreases survival of mice, demonstrating
a critical role for NK-mediated immune surveillance in lung tumorogenesis
 Cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily of calcium independent
cell adhesion molecules, capable of both homophilic and heterophilic interactions. Interestingly, CADM1
expression is frequently lost in 20-40% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) either by loss of heterozygosity
or promoter hypermethylation. However, the mechanism(s) by which CADM1 regulates tumor progression is not
known. CADM1 is one of seven proteins in mammals that undergoes an unusual glycosylation known as
polysialylation. The other notable Polysialic acid (polysia) carrier is the protein CD56 expressed on NK cells.
Polysia is a unique carbohydrate structure known for its potent anti-adhesive properties preventing two
polysialylated proteins from interacting with each other. On the other hand, a cell surface protein known as
CRTAM (Class-I MHC-restricted T-cell-associated molecule) was identified as the strongest heterophilic binding
partner of CADM1. CRTAM is expressed on activated NK cells and the CADM1/CRTAM axis has been
implicated in immune surveillance.
 Our recent study showed that, in cells expressing CADM1, its induction renders cancer cells susceptible
to NK-mediated cytotoxicity. Inhibition of CADM1 expression promoted metastasis by evading NK mediated
immune surveillance. In contrast, restoring CADM1 in cells with promoter hypermethylation was sufficient to
make cancer cells susceptible to NK-mediated toxicity, suggesting that suppressing CADM1 may be an immune
evasive strategy of tumors. Consistently, increased expression of CADM1 directly correlated with prolonged
patient survival and inversely correlated with higher stage and metastatic disease. We show that polysialylation
of CADM1 on tumor cells modulates their susceptibility to NK cells. Based on these observations, we
hypothesize that CADM1 mediates an immunological synapse between tumor cells and NK cells promoting
tumor immune surveillance and its function is regulated by a unique glycosylation modification. Strategies to
enhance CADM1-mediated NK surveillance may be an effective immunotherapy against NSCLC, particularly for
tumors that are CADM1 positive. The three specific aims of this project are: 1) Define the role of CADM1 in the
regulation of lung tumor progression. 2) Determine the mechanism(s) by which CADM1 function is regulated to
modulate tumor immunosurveillance 3) Design and develop CADM1 targeting CAR-NK cells for lung cancer
immunotherapy."
10909307,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
MS is an immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the CNS, and despite first line drugs that
limit symptoms, disease progresses over time and is incurable. Given its early onset and rise in
prevalence for nearly 1 million Americans, MS presents immense health and economic burdens
on the United States. Given the success of B cell depletion therapy (BCDT), understanding the
pathogenic roles of B cells during disease is of high interest. Because of the CD20-targeted nature
of BCDT, it is understood that B cells contribute to MS pathology through mechanisms beyond
antibody production, likely through support of autoreactive CD4 T cells. Most animal models of
MS (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis or EAE) are B cell-independent, which limits
impactful insights into pathogenic B:T interactions in vivo. To circumvent this, we have recently
developed a B cell-dependent, antibody-independent animal model of MS featuring CD4 T cell
immunoreactivity to the extracellular domain sequences of the highly abundant and 100%
conserved myelin proteolipid protein (PLPECD). Through rigorous preliminary studies, we have
identified B cell-mediated antigen presentation to CD4s through MHC class II as the required
pathogenic B cell mechanism in PLPECD-induced EAE, where B cells engage PLPECD through the
B cell receptor and are superior vs. non-B cell antigen presenting cells at processing and
presenting immunodominant residues from within PLPECD to PLP178-191-reactive CD4 T cells.
Further mimicking the sustained pathogenic B cell involvement seen in MS and unlike B cell-
independent EAE driven by PLP178-191, BCDT robustly ameliorates established PLPECD disease.
B cells’ role in supporting CD4s during neuroinflammation and shaping the diverse T helper cell
(Th) profiles observed in MS remains unclear. Understanding these dynamics in MS may prove
significant in identifying which patients will respond to BCDT and thus modeling pathogenic B cell
involvement in vivo is becoming increasingly important. Our objective is to use this powerful B
cell-dependent EAE model to understand how B cells shape the CD4 response and to investigate
B cell-mediated support of CD4s in the CNS. These are key aspects of B cell-mediated pathology
that are not currently understood and difficult to model appropriately in vivo. Our model put us in
a unique position to answer these questions. We hypothesize that B cell-provided cytokines shape
a biased Th profile and that CNS B cell:CD4 interactions are critical in promoting demyelination
in PLPECD EAE. Specific Aim 1 will determine how B cells shape pathogenic CD4 T cells by testing
B cell-provided cytokines’ impact on Th1/17 bias. Specific Aim 2 will determine CNS B cells’ role
in PLPECD-induced EAE and visualize B cell-supported neuroinflammation."
10931503,"The major cause of bladder cancer deaths is due to metastasis, yet to date metastatic bladder cancer
(mMIBC) has not been extensively studied and many salient issues remain unresolved. One of the major
challenges that has hampered progress in studying mMIBC is the lack of suitable models to investigate
metastatic progression in vivo. We have now generated novel genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs)
that develop highly penetrant mMIBC. These new are based on our established GEMM, in which bladder-specific
co-inactivation of the Pten and p53 tumor suppressors leads to invasive disease with a low incidence of
metastasis. Crossing these Pten; p53 mice with mice harboring loss-of-function of Arid1a, an epigenetic regulator
that is dysregulated in a high percentage of human bladder cancers, results in lethal bladder cancer with >80%
incidence of metastasis. In addition, treatment of the Pten; p53 mice with a low dose of the carcinogen N-butyl-
N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine (BBN) leads to mMIBC with >60% incidence. In parallel, we have implemented
state-of-the-art systems biology approaches to identify mechanistic determinants—master regulators (MRs)—of
metastatic progression in the GEMMs. MRs enriched in metastatic tumors in the GEMMs are conserved with
human bladder cancer, and are enriched for those associated with lineage plasticity. To identify drugs that target
these conserved MRs, we implemented OncoTreat, a computational algorithm that prioritizes drugs based on
their ability to invert the activities of biologically-relevant MR. To validate these drugs, we have generated an
extensive biobank of human patient derived organoid models. Leveraging these GEMMs, human patient derived
organoids and systems approaches, we are ideally poised to investigate the hypothesis that the transition from
pre-invasive to metastatic disease is driven by the sequential activities of master regulators, including for lineage
plasticity, which can be elucidated and targeted by studying metastatic progression in these GEMMs. We will
pursue three Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will leverage our GEMMs of mMIBC to systematically investigate the
biological processes and molecular mechanisms underlying metastatic progression in vivo. In Aim 2, we will
elucidate master regulators of metastatic progression, focusing on those associated with the transition from pre-
metastatic to metastatic MIBC, and/or that distinguish tumors from their corresponding metastases, metastases
to different organ sites, and, as feasible, pre-metastatic clusters from overt metastases. We will prioritize MRs
that are conserved with human bladder cancer, as well as those associated with lineage plasticity. In Aim 3, we
will seek to identify new drugs for mMIBC using the OncoTreat algorithm to identify compounds that invert the
activity of MRs of metastasis. We will prioritize candidate drugs that (1) target lineage plasticity mechanisms,
and/or (2) are inferred for patients that do not have evident actionable driver mutations. Altogether, our studies
will provide a comprehensive analysis of the biology, mechanisms, and treatments for mMIBC, with the
translational goal of identifying new therapeutic targets that may improve patient outcomes."
10904954,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Genetic alterations in the tumor suppressor p53 gene (TP53) are found in most colorectal adenocarcinomas
(CRC) and contributes to poor prognosis. The p53 protein encoded by TP53 is a key element of DNA damage
checkpoints that are activated by DNA damage response and control genome integrity. Although decades of
research generated immense information on the functional consequences of p53 mutations, therapeutic efforts
targeted to mutant p53 have proven largely unfruitful. Existing therapeutic options for p53-deficient CRC are
ineffective and cause toxic side effects stressing the need for better therapeutics. We developed a
conceptually novel treatment strategy for selectively targeting p53-deficient cancer cells that takes advantage
of their unique DNA repair deficiencies. Our preclinical research revealed that p53-deficient tumors accumulate
DNA damage upon incorporation into DNA of a thymidine analogue (i.e., trifluorothymidine, a component of
FDA-approved drug called TAS102). The thymidine analogue does not interrupt DNA replication but rather
prompts DNA repair that requires p53-dependent checkpoint. We found that p53-deficient cells lacking the
p53-dependent checkpoint selectively accumulate DNA breaks. Importantly, this DNA damage is strongly
enhanced by inhibitors of poly (ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP) leading to cell death. This novel inducer-
amplifier strategy was extensively validated in multiple preclinical models. Our preclinical data demonstrated a
superior anti-tumor activity of TAS102 in combination with PARP inhibitor (PARPi) compared to either drug
alone in p53-deficient cancer models. Based on our preclinical data, we developed a first-in-human Phase I
clinical trial for advanced CRC with two FDA-approved drugs TAS102 and PARPi talazoparib. Thus, we
hypothesize that the combination of TAS102 with PARPi talazoparib is an effective biomarker-driven treatment
for patients with p53-deficient CRC. The current proposal is aimed to define the efficacy of our combination
therapy strategy for the first time in humans with advanced CRC in a collaborative effort of basic, translational,
and clinical scientists. The study will generate the biomarkers to guide clinical implementation and further
development of our inducer-amplifier strategy by using patient-derived material from our ongoing clinical trial.
The study will employ state-of-the art next-generation sequencing approaches to define genome-wide changes
in response to the TAS102-PARPi combination in CRC models. Importantly, we will examine the antitumor
efficacy of our novel two-drug therapy in p53-deficient CRC patients. Together, this work will provide
mechanistic insights in the action of our two-drug therapy and will serve as a platform for development of better
treatments. Our study matters for thousands of patients with aggressive p53-deficient CRC."
10912778,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The objective of this proposal is to study how a new human-derived biomaterial with granulated structure,
NatruLage, stimulates adult stem cell differentiation for integrative cartilage repair. Recent advances in the
treatment of articular cartilage and bone injuries have shown exciting potential to address matrix degeneration
associated with osteoarthritis (OA), a joint disease afflicting millions of people in the United States. New
candidate therapies utilize animal- or human-sourced materials to formulate unique microenvironments
favorable to stem cell responses that promote healing and integration. In healthy osteochondral tissue, the
extracellular matrix is organized into interstitial and pericellular domains with specialized cells and signaling
molecules. Together, these components define tissue-specific and structure-function relationships which are
lost during disease progression. Unfortunately, integrative cartilage repair still remains as a major medical
need, and new products are required for enhanced and improved therapies. Successful adoption of
osteochondral tissue therapies requires extensive technical and manufacturing de-risking to meet stringent
regulatory approval requirements. New innovations must meet current good manufacturing practice (cGMP)
specifications and demonstrate pre-clinical evidence of positive cellular and biological responses as well as
lack of toxicity prior to submission of an investigational device exemption (IDE) package and, later, execution
of a clinical trial. To improve integrative cartilage repair, we developed a novel granulated extracellular matrix
with a proprietary crosslinking technology, termed NatruLage, that is injected into the defect in bone and
cartilage layers to form osteochondral tissue that closely mimics the natural zonal tissue structure. Our device
is ‘flowable’ to deliver densely-packed tissue particles, and enable forming and shaping after delivery through
unique crosslinking via thiol-functionalized macromolecules. We have evaluated the same NatruLage
technology, using porcine instead of human tissue, and found promising regeneration and integration in a 12-
month large animal (goat) study of osteochondral repair. We are now focused on the development of
NatruLage using human-derived allograft tissue for delivery of distinct layers of osteochondral tissue. We will
define the appropriate chemistry, manufacturing, and quality controls to support the cGMP production of
NatruLage for future clinical trials, and we will contribute to understanding the stem cell responses to
NatruLage. We will pursue three related specific aims. In Aim 1, we will adapt established cGMP facilities for
production of human NatruLage. In Aim 2, we will define specifications for NatruLage reproducibility and donor
variability. In Aim 3, we will quantify NatruLage stimulation of adult stem cell proliferation and differentiation. If
successful, we will create an ideal secondary osteochondral repair market for otherwise discarded or nonviable
allograft tissue, and the grant will support the submission of an IDE package for NatruLage."
10930094,"Project Summary/Abstract
A growing literature suggests autistic adults feel pain in a different manner than non-autistic adults and may
experience more persistent pain than the general population. As pain is often the first sign of injury or illness,
individual differences in pain perception or communication can significantly impact diagnosis and treatment of
many health conditions. Alternatively, when pain is not addressed, this can lead to a pro-nociceptive pain profile,
where endogenous systems facilitate pain instead of inhibiting it, potentially contributing to persistent pain.
Autistic adults often experience sensitivity in other sensory domains that could extend to pain. For example,
hyper-responsiveness can include pain-like reactions to everyday tactile stimuli like tags on clothing. At this point,
several studies have demonstrated increased pain sensitivity2,3, increased pain-related anxiety2, and altered
neural responses to pain1 in autistic individuals. Yet, several important questions remain that present barriers to
improving pain treatment in autistic individuals. In this project, we propose to address several gaps in our current
understanding, building a framework to investigate pain sensitivity in autism. First, we will address pain
assessment and expression of pain in autistic adults. Currently, there is no consensus recommendation on pain
assessment in autism. It is not clear if autistic individuals express pain in specific ways that differ from non-
autistic individuals and if better pain assessment tools would improve pain management. In Aim 1, we propose
to test different pain scales in self-reporting autistic adults to determine reliability. Additionally, we will assess
how pain ratings on these scales correspond to observable pain behaviors. Secondly, we will address potential
factors that may predict persistent pain in autism. It is currently unknown if hypersensitivity to pain extends from
a general sensory hypersensitivity for autistic adults. In Aim 2, we will explore individual profiles of sensory
reactivity to identify important relationships between pain and sensitivity in other sensory domains. We will also
explore relationships with social and emotional factors that may impact persistent pain. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will
address potential brain mechanisms of pain sensitivity in autistic adults. Our previous work indicated that autistic
adults have a different neural response to heat pain across somatosensory and affective brain regions, but the
functional connectivity of these regions and the relationship between neural responses and pain reports is not
clear. Overall, we hypothesize that autistic adults have difficulty communicating their pain, leaving them at a
greater risk for mismanagement of pain. Additionally, we hypothesize that autistic adults likely have a pro-
nociceptive profile increasing the magnitude of pain. This combination of difficult pain communication and a pro-
nociceptive profile leaves autistic individuals at risk for persistent pain and is a detriment to their overall health.
At the conclusion of this project, our work could inform how clinicians assess pain in autism (Aim 1), identify
autistic individuals at most risk for persistent pain (Aim 2) and spark new mechanisms to improve pain
management in autistic adults (Aim 3)."
10857192,"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a cell death and inflammation-associated nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD), is the leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and end-stage liver failure worldwide. There is
no effective therapeutic drug for NASH to date, highlighting an urgent need for the identification of novel targets
for this devastating disease. Evidence cumulated over the past decade strongly suggest that the innate immune
system, specifically the liver-resident macrophages (Kupffer cells) and recruited monocyte-derived
macrophages, play a key role in NASH progression and pathogenesis. The current study aims to elucidate the
mechanisms by which macrophage cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING)
pathway regulates liver fibrosis and NASH pathogenesis. We found that macrophage-specific knockout of cGAS
or STING promotes liver inflammation, apoptosis, and fibrosis, suggesting this DNA sensing innate immune
pathway protects, rather than promotes, NASH progression in mice. However, how cGAS or STING deficiency
leads to NASH pathogenesis remains unknown. Our preliminary study suggests that macrophage cGAS may
suppress NASH development by facilitating macrophage phagocytosis via both STING-dependent and
independent novel mechanisms. To test this hypothesis, we will 1) delineate the STING-independent molecular
mechanism by which cGAS promotes macrophages phagocytosis; 2) Elucidate the STING-dependent signaling
mechanism by which cGAS regulates macrophage phagocytosis; and 3) Explore the physiological role of
cGAS-regulated phagocytosis in preventing liver fibrosis and NASH. Our study will dissect a novel role
mechanism by which cGAS regulates macrophage phagocytosis and prevents NASH. The comprehensive
understanding of the fundamental functions of the innate immunity and macrophage biology will not only provide
a proof-of-concept for rethinking the nature of this devastating liver disease, but also open a new therapeutic
avenue for developing therapeutic treatment of NASH."
10865081,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Aortic dissection (AD) is a disease characterized by sudden tearing of the inner layers of the aortic wall creating
a false lumen (FL) channeling aortic blood flow. The vast majority of acute AD patients survive into the chronic
phase, although long-term outcomes are poor with about 50% of patients experiencing aorta-related mortality or
requiring surgical repair by 10 years. A major contributor to poor long-term outcomes is growth of the FL. Thoracic
endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is a minimally invasive surgical therapy which can halt FL growth and reduce
AD mortality; however, this treatment comes with cost, risk of procedural complications, and is less effective over
time owing to increased tissue stiffness. Accurate prediction of disease trajectory at early phases is limited with
current metrics but is highly desirable as this would allow TEVAR to be targeted to high-risk patients in a timely
manner, sparing those at lower risk from potentially unnecessary procedures. Current methods for estimating
risk in AD are largely based on anatomic metrics (e.g., aortic diameter), which poorly capture functional aspects
of AD. To overcome these limitations, we propose to apply advanced imaging techniques, namely 4D Flow
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 4D computed tomography angiography (CTA), to characterize and
quantify functional processes such as FL pressure and FL wall stiffness, which elude current imaging approches
and have been implicated as important factors in predicting long-term behavior of AD. We hypothesize that
assessments of these functional metrics will, improve our prediction of false lumen growth rate (FLGR) compared
to standard anatomic metrics. We plan to prospectively recruit patients with either uncomplicated type B (n=30)
or surgically repaired type A (n=45) aortic dissection to undergo baseline 4D Flow and 4D CTA imaging in the
subacute period (1-3 months post-dissection) as well as follow-up studies at 1- and 2-years post-dissection, with
the primary outcome being FLGR. To achieve these goals, the Aims of this proposal are: 1) Identify baseline
hemodynamic and biomechanical metrics in the subacute period of AD that predict FL growth rate over time. FL
pressure will be quantified from 4D Flow MRI using indirect and direct methods based on physics-based image
analysis, with regional FL wall stiffness quantified by merging FL pressure with cyclic aortic wall deformation by
4D CT; 2) Determine the trajectories of functional metrics over time that best predict progressive FL growth.
Longitudinal changes in pressure and wall stiffness between baseline and 1- and 2-year follow-up scans will be
assessed to identify patients who achieve a new equilibrium versus those who continue to progress; 3) Develop
a clinical assessment tool to predict risk of progressive FL growth combining functional metrics, anatomic
parameters and patient characteristics with a focus on simplicity and accuracy for dissection-type specific
prediction of the FLGR at the earliest possible time point. This work seeks to shift the paradigm of AD assessment
from pure anatomic characterization by integrating functional imaging biomarkers to provide accurate predictions
of disease trajectory and allow for optimal determination of surgical candidacy and timing."

Sexually transmitted infections (STI) continue to be a major public health problem for Black girls in the United
States. Each year 1 in 4 Black girls, 14-19 years-old acquires an STI, placing them at risk for poor sexual and
reproductive health outcomes (SRH) (i.e., pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, HIV/AIDS). In Chicago, STI
rates are highest among 13- to 29-year-old Black girls and they represent 56% of new HIV diagnoses,
compared to other racial groups, making adolescence an exceptionally vulnerable period. These racial
disparities require new and innovative strategies to reduce Black girls' negative SRH outcomes. Familial
protection is seen as critical to mitigating risk, particularly exposure to sexual violence which is linked to girls'
HIV/STI risk. Interventions that strengthen family relationships and communication as strategies to protect
Black girls have demonstrated success improving Black girls SRH outcomes. Yet, with few exceptions, these
programs engage only female caregivers, whereas male caregivers may amplify the protective effects of
families on Black girls' SRH. We systematically adapted IMARA (an evidence-based program designed for
Black girls and their female caregivers) to create IMARA for Black Male caregivers and Girls Empowerment
(IMAGE), adding drivers of structural violence (i.e., stereotype messaging and lack of protection) aligning with
the Becoming a Sexual Black Woman framework and the Health Disparities Research Framework. Preliminary
data (interviews, focus groups, theatre, and pilot testing) with Black girls, male and female caregivers justify the
proposed randomized control trial (RCT). We will simultaneously conduct an effectiveness RCT with individual-
level randomization and examine implementation processes at five community-based organizations. Aim 1 is to
conduct a 2-arm RCT (IMAGE vs. a health promotion control) with 372 14-18-year-old Black girls and their
male caregivers and compare girls' sexual risk behavior (condom use, sexual debut, and sexual partners) and
STI incidence at baseline, 6- and 12-months. We hypothesize Girls in IMAGE will report more condom use,
later sexual debut, fewer sexual partners, and have lower STI incidence at 6- and 12- months (primary
outcome) compared to the control group. Aim 2 is to examine change in the theoretical mechanisms posited by
the Becoming a Sexual Black Woman. Aim 3 is to identify processes, barriers, and facilitators associated with
primary outcomes to inform future implementation into community-based organizations. The long-term
significance and impact of this application is high. By including Black male caregivers in the protection of girls,
this study leverages a long-neglected yet important resource in Black girls SRH, thereby amplifying the
protective effects of family-based programs and pushing the science of health disparities forward."

 Last year in the United States there were more than 1.9 million medical-device-associated infections resulting
in approximately 98,000 deaths. Antibiotic-resistant biofilm-forming bacteria create many problems in medicine
and have detrimental implications for public health. To tackle this problem, “smart” antibiotic-free, anti-infection
cross-linked nanocoatings (sCLNs) designed specifically for catheters have been developed. We have used
argon plasma technology for the construction of sCLNs. These smart nanocoatings consist of acrylic acid
polymer brushes that are cross-linked to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in a layer-by-layer fashion with an AgNP
concentration of 2.46 µg/cm2. This was achieved by using a plasma-initiated “grafting-from” approach, coupled
with in situ argon plasma-assisted reduction. These biocompatible anti-infection nanocoatings can sense and
target bacteria and biofilms effectively and specifically. Mechanistic studies involving sCLNs demonstrate
complex activity, triggered by adherent bacteria and biofilms, rather than mere sustained antimicrobial release.
We propose that our sCLNs may be the future for the prevention of medical implant contaminations. Preliminary
data suggest that sCLNs are efficacious for eradicating antibiotic-resistant, biofilm-forming bacteria including
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli on biomaterials
used to make catheters. Several potential advantages of sCLNs, compared to traditional surfaces loaded with
antibacterial agents, are their (1) broad activity against antibiotic-resistant bacteria, (2) ability to reduce bacterial
adhesion, (3) rare provocation of bacterial resistance, (4) longevity, (5) specificity, (6) biocompatibility, and (7)
stability.
 Three integrated specific aims are proposed to test the hypothesis that sCLNs can be constructed using
plasma technology and are effective at preventing bacterial biofilms in a medically relevant environment. In
Specific Aim 1, experimental variables will be explored to construct stable sCLNs with increased sensitivity to
biofilm formation. In Specific Aim 2, the anti-infective efficacy of sCLNs will be evaluated against several different
gram-positive and gram-negative biofilm-forming strains of bacteria in vitro, under both stationary and
microfluidic cultivation conditions, specifically to model the actual environment of catheters. An exploration of the
mechanism of action with a focus on the induction of bacterial cell lysis in complex biological systems will be
studied by using various viability assays. In Specific Aim 3, the first two aims will be augmented by evaluating
the in vitro safety of sCLNs for human tissue cells in bacterial co-culture. This research seeks to improve upon
existing techniques for the eradication of infections associated with medical and biomedical devices. This work
and program funding will also enhance the research program at Fairleigh Dickinson University by providing
students with opportunities to apply theoretical knowledge to practical, real-world scientific applications."

The primary focus of the MIT/DFCI Center for Systems Biology of Glioblastoma is to understand the
intersections between neurons, immune cells, and tumor cells in this deadly tumor. The lack of response to
immunotherapy strategies despite prominent infiltrates of immune cells in many GBM highlights the immuno-
suppressive nature of the GBM microenvironment and the importance of more clearly understanding the
dynamic interactions at the tumor/immune interface. Similarly, interactions between tumor cells and neural
cells in the tumor microenvironment have emerged as driving forces in tumor progression and invasion, with
electrical signals from neurons providing growth and migration stimuli to tumor cells, while tumor cells lead to
aberrant electrical signaling in local neurons. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that developing a
systems-level understanding of the dynamic interactions between tumor cells, neurons and immune cells will
provide unprecedented insights into glioma tumor biology and foster development of novel therapeutic
strategies to abrogate tumor invasion, enhance the efficacy of cytotoxic therapies, and increase clearance of
tumor burden by the innate and adaptive immune system. The planned analyses will enable building an
integrated computational model of tumor-neural-immune interactions for GBM tumors. The model will be based
on a foundation of in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo model systems, and then validated in dozens of human patients.
Image-registered biopsies from different tumor regions within each patient will be analyzed to test predictions
of this model against the ‘ground truth’ of human tumors. The ultimate goal of the MIT/DFCI Center for
Systems Biology of Glioblastoma is to improve patient care by using systems biology and computational
modeling to identify therapeutic strategies to specifically disrupt critical tumor cell – microenvironment

 Over the last two decades, three highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, have
emerged, arguing that future deadly pandemics of new or re-emerging coronaviruses and other RNA viruses are
almost inevitable. The urgent need to treat these fatal infectious diseases has prioritized the discovery and
development of novel effective antivirals. However, despite the unprecedented efforts to address the COVID-19
crisis, highly effective COVID-19 therapeutics are severely limited due to the lack of a mechanistic understanding
of coronavirus replication and pathogenesis. Most of the current research and therapeutic development efforts
focus on SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase (RdRp) or spike protein, but their success can be severely undermined
by a unique SARS-CoV-2 proofreading mechanism that excises incorporated RdRp inhibitors or by the rapid
emergence of drug-resistant spike protein mutants. Therefore, it is imperative to develop innovative antiviral
strategies targeting distinct, and in some cases yet to be identified, essential components of the viral life cycle.
The intricate virus-host interplay constitutes a sophisticated regulatory network that dictates the outcome of virus
infection, affording promising opportunities to be explored for innovative antiviral therapeutics. However, current
knowledge of coronavirus-host interactions is mostly limited to the virus-host arms race in activating or blocking
the interferon-dependent signaling pathways or in competing for host translation machinery. By contrast, virus-
host interplay in coronavirus gene expression and regulation is largely uncharted territory. This major gap greatly
hinders the design of novel antiviral agents targeting these much-overlooked coronavirus-host interactions that
are critical for viral survival and host antiviral responses. The central objectives of this proposal are to define
novel molecular mechanisms and functional roles of multiple recently discovered SARS-CoV-2-host interactions
in modulating the viral replication and transcription processes and to identify new SARS-CoV-2-host interactions
linked to novel mechanisms of viral gene regulation. With a combination of structural biology, protein-RNA
biochemistry, single-molecule biophysics, cell virology, and computational approaches, we will accomplish these
tasks through three tightly interwoven aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the molecular and structural basis of
these newfound interactions between host factors and the viral replication-transcription machinery. In Aim 2, we
will delineate the biological functions of these crucial host factors in modulating viral replication and transcription.
In Aim 3, we will develop an innovative capture-identification-visualization experimental pipeline to discover new
host factors and novel viral replication-transcription-regulating mechanisms. Together, these studies will
establish an innovative conceptual framework to study coronavirus-host interactions and reveal new targets
for the development of novel anti-coronavirus therapeutics."
10852933,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Opioid abuse has become a growing epidemic in the US, causing tens of thousands of overdose deaths every
year especially because of fentanyl-related opioids. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that acts as an agonist on the
μ-opioid receptors at various sites and is estimated to be 100 times more potent than morphine. This has led to
the classification of potent synthetic opioids as Pharmaceutical Based Agents (PBAs) that could be used as a
potential offensive chemical weapon, indicating the critical need for effective medical countermeasures (MCMs).
Naloxone is a non-selective competitive opioid receptor antagonist that is given to reverse the symptoms of
opioid overdose or toxicity. It is highly effective, but also has several disadvantages. For example, it has low
efficacy against potent opioids like fentanyl and can require multiple doses to avoid renarcotization, but may then
precipitate opioid-withdrawal syndrome. Bioscavengers are an attractive MCM strategy for both post-exposure
therapy and prophylaxis against toxic agents such as organophosphate nerve agents. Recently, monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs) were shown in mice to be fentanyl and carfentanil bioscavengers, and to reduce blood opioid
concentrations. However, since a stoichiometric bioscavenger is needed to neutralize the fentanyl molecules,
and since mAbs are large (~150 kDa), the dose of the mAbs required for protection from or treatment of opioid
toxicity is large and difficult to administer. Therefore, an urgent need exists for new MCMs that can be used in
conjunction with receptor antagonists like naloxone to overcome the limitations of current treatments.
This exploratory research program seeks to develop synthetic scavengers for fentanyl for opioid overdose and
toxicity reversal utilizing SRI’s proprietary Fiber-optic Array Screening Technology (FAST) and protein-like
synthetic molecules (Techneins). We developed this platform to enable the design, synthesis, screening and
sequencing of large combinatorial “one-bead one-compound” Technein libraries. FAST enables screening
against multiple targets in complex biological matrices to yield lead compounds with specific biological
functionality and high selectivity. This approach has been validated as a drug discovery tool for inhibitors of
protein-protein interactions and for small molecule binders. In preliminary studies, when a small portion of a
library was screened against fentanyl, several Technein hits were identified and confirmed to bind. Their
relatively small size (4-6 kDa), high stability, lack of immunogenicity and a good terminal half-life (~22 hours),
make Techneins ideal candidates as opioid scavengers.
Here we aim to develop synthetic scavenger Techneins for fentanyl and test and optimize their ability to block
fentanyl activity in functional cellular assays (Aim 1) and provide basic PK and pre-clinical efficacy data for the
top anti-fentanyl lead (Aim 2). These studies will enable new avenues for the development of efficacious MCMs
against fentanyl and related synthetic opioids, as well as paving the way for coping with other types of toxic
agents. Moreover, the project may further demonstrate utility of an innovative new drug discovery platform."

(L.E.A.R.N) Consortium is to enhance the diversity of the research workforce by training promising scientists
from diverse and underrepresented groups for sustained careers in research on aging with a specific focus on
‘ethnogeriatric health disparities’. Through an annual pilot award program, we seek to advance the career
trajectories of early career faculty from underrepresented groups (collectively “RCMAR Scientists”) from the
L.E.A.R.N Consortium of organizations, which includes Stanford University, San Jose State University and
Palo Alto University (both Minority Serving Institutions), the VA Palo Alto Health Care System, and our
community organizational partners. Our REC will provide training, mentoring, and support to enable RCMAR
Scientists to conduct transdisciplinary research on aging that integrates biological, social, behavioral, and
cultural considerations using various innovative techniques (e.g., biomedical data science, digital health,
precision medicine, virtual reality/simulation-based interventions, qualitative research, mixed-methods
research, and implementation science). We will fund three 12-month mentored pilot awards per year, designed
and implemented with the guidance of committed and skilled research mentors. Each RCMAR Scientist will
choose a primary mentor (from their organization) and a secondary mentor from any of the L.E.A.R.N
Consortium organizations. Training will include didactic instruction on ethnogeriatric health disparities research
methods as well as, embedded within, a customized selection of courses that will enhance knowledge in
domains important for future success. RCMAR Scientists will attend a weekly seminar series that includes
scholar research-in-progress, faculty research, professional guidance, peer-to-peer advising, and professional
development topics and complete training in Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusiveness (J.E.D.I) issues,
research ethics, rigor and reproducibility, compliance, and good clinical science practices. We will provide
ongoing mentoring and support to RCMAR Scientists after the funding period, including technical assistance in
research grant writing toward independent NIH funding. RCMAR Scientists will gain much of the knowledge,
attitudes, and skills necessary to transition into viable research careers, including conduct of transdisciplinary
aging research, authoring manuscripts, competing for external funding, developing mentoring and team
building strategies, and how to design and implement their career development plans. We aim to enable them
to successfully step into research-based positions in academia, industry, government, or the not-for-profit
sector. Our RCMAR Scientists will learn in an environment that emphasizes teamwork and teaches that the
most innovative research is a product of team science that bridges all disciplinary areas spanning the aging
research landscape, from the identification and mitigation of ethnogeriatric health disparities to discovery of
novel approaches that promote health equity and wellness for diverse older Americans."

HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) are currently under clinical evaluation for their ability to prevent
transmission. Until a conventional vaccine is realized, repetitive dosing of a bNAb would be necessary to
maintain protective antibody concentrations. An alternative to passive infusion of bNAbs is to use adeno-
associated virus (AAV) vectors that can turn muscles into antibody production factories. This one-time
treatment would have clear cost advantages over the continuous production, purification, and administration of
recombinant monoclonal antibodies. However, host immune responses limit the efficacy of AAV vectors.
CD8+ T cell clearance of AAV transduced muscle cells limits the total number of cells producing the antibody,
and pre-existing immunity to AAV capsids limit the number of possible individuals that can receive AAV
vectors. We and others have previously shown that host immune responses are detrimental to AAV-delivered
HIV-1 antibodies resulting in low to no detectable serum concentrations. Thus, overcoming the host immune
response to the AAV vector and expressed transgene is critical for future evaluation of AAV-delivered antibody
studies in non-human primates. One area of investigation for limiting a host immune response would be to
utilize immune checkpoints that regulate immune system pathways. To this end, in a pilot study, we have
observed about a 21-fold increase in concentrations of an HIV-1 antibody in rhesus macaques when
macaques were co-inoculated with an AAV vector encoding rhesus macaque PD-L1. PD-L1 functions in
binding T cell expressed PD-1 to inhibit the cytolytic and degranulation functions. It also helps in the
development of regulatory T cells. Thus, we hypothesize that expression of PD-L1 on muscle cells transduced
by AAV vectors to express antibodies will avoid T cell clearance and maintain expression of the antibody.
Here we seek to demonstrate that co-inoculation of vectors encoding PD-L1 will result in serum concentrations
of a bNAb that will protect rhesus macaques from repetitive, low-dose SHIV challenges. Additionally, we will
develop this system by evaluating strategies to reduce the dose of AAV vector. Furthermore, we will engineer
AAV transgene cassettes and assess novel a novel AAV capsid for increasing expression from intramuscular
inoculation. Together, the results from these studies will provide a foundation for AAV gene therapy studies in
non-human primates as well as lead to the development of novel AAV vectors for expressing HIV-1 bNAbs."
10729853,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite remarkable progress with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains a
serious global public health problem with over 1% of the world’s population and about 3 million in the United
States (U.S.) infected. The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services recently renewed the Action Plan to
Prevent, Care and Treat Viral Hepatitis to eliminate viral hepatitis infection as a public health threat and the WHO
introduced global targets for the care and management of HCV. While the highest uptake of HCV treatment
occurred in 2017 and 1.5 million people were cured, 1.6 million new infections occurred. Due to many treatment
barriers, only an estimated 21% of infected patients are diagnosed and only 2% of total infected patients are
being treated for the disease annually. DAAs alone are unlikely to achieve HCV elimination; as such, the
development of a vaccine to prevent HCV infection is an important focus of ongoing research.
 Vaccine clinical trials for HCV infection will need to recruit from high-risk populations, such as persons
who inject drugs (PWID), who contribute an estimated 60% of all new HCV infections in the U.S. and have an
increasing incidence of HCV, especially among young PWID. Additionally, limited access to DAA treatment,
syringe service programs (SSP), and continued injection drug use poses challenges among PWID even as
treatment with medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) is expanding. Factors contributing to transmission and
successful intervention (DAAs, MOUD, SSP) among PWID are dynamic and complex and occur at the individual
(e.g., pathogen-host interplay, risk behaviors), social (e.g., injection network, social norms), structural (e.g.,
access to SSP and MOUD), and geographic (e.g., interaction locations) levels. As such, performing HCV vaccine
randomized clinical trials (RCT) in the PWID population presents major challenges. We propose to develop an
integrated comprehensive computational modeling approach to examine these challenges systematically and
assess the impact of specific RCT modifications on clinical trial success.
 To explore vaccine trial design and outcomes, our interdisciplinary team will: (1) design and evaluate
clinical trials in low incidence PWID sites, using metropolitan Chicago as the model, which reduces the chance
of someone becoming exposed before being fully protected; (2) design and evaluate clinical trials in high
incidence PWID sites, using San Francisco as the model, which increases the chance of someone becoming
exposed before being fully protected; and (3) discover effective HCV vaccine-based intervention strategies to
achieve WHO elimination goals in the context of a licensed vaccine. The literature supports that non-sterilizing
vaccines are expected to be the focus of future trials, reminiscent of recent COVID-19 vaccines, therefore we
will simulate their effect on transmission to reach elimination. We will account for SSP and MOUD and their effect
on outcomes in two cities with disparate HCV epidemic profile among PWID—Chicago and San Francisco."
10917371,"The NIH APOL1 Long-term Transplantation Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Collaborative U01 is performing a
national prospective evaluation of donor and recipient apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) risk variants in US kidney
transplants from African American donors to determine their effect on transplant outcomes. In addition, post-
donation health and kidney function of African American living kidney donors will be assessed. We are applying
to continue serving as the APOLLO Scientific and Data Research Center (SDRC). Shorter renal allograft survival
is observed for transplantations from deceased African American kidney donors, relative to deceased European
American kidney donors. Reasons for this are unknown, but retrospective reports suggest that presence of two
APOL1 risk variants in kidney donors may contribute to the disparity. These variants are common in populations
with recent African ancestry (such as African Americans), where they are strongly associated with chronic kidney
disease, but rare in other racial/ethnic groups. APOL1 genotype data may provide more accurate assessment
of the likelihood for long-term renal allograft function in donor kidneys, thereby improving matching of donor
kidneys with potential recipients in order to optimize renal allograft and patient survival. This information may
better inform physicians about organ quality prior to making decisions on allocation. It may also inform the safety
of living kidney donation. Before APOL1 genotypes can be used clinically, the prospective national APOLLO
study was required to evaluate kidney transplant outcomes from African American donors and recipients of their
kidneys based on APOL1. APOLLO collects information lacking from retrospective studies, including recipient
APOL1 genotypes, renal histology in engrafted kidneys and presence or development of BK viral infections,
donor specific antibodies, and acute rejections after kidney transplantation. We apply to continue to perform
these activities for the APOLLO Network: overall study coordination, assist with ensuring compliance with the
Protocol and Manual of Procedures, maintain data tracking tools and the study website, collect and archive
clinical and outcomes data, perform genotyping, statistical analyses, assessment of outcomes including the
primary outcome “time to allograft failure in transplanted kidneys from African American donors based on donor
APOL1 genotypes”, and complete the bio-repository. We will longitudinally assess vital status, kidney function
and proteinuria in living African American kidney donors based on APOL1 genotypes and prospectively assess
effects of donor APOL1 genotypes on serum creatinine concentration, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and
proteinuria in kidney transplant recipients with functioning grafts. APOLLO results have the potential to transform
the organ allocation and informed consent processes in kidney transplantation, optimize renal allograft survival,
reduce discard of good-quality kidneys, and protect the health of living kidney donors."
10723105,"Remarkable advances with hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection therapy have been made over the past 5 years,.
At the same time, the peak of morbidity for the HCV epidemic, including outcomes such as cirrhosis and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) will not occur until 2030. In fact, HCC is one of the fastest growing cancer
related causes of death in the US. Certainly, at some point successful therapy for HCV will reduce the
incidence of HCC. Though when this will be realized is unclear, in part due to the fact that the chronic HCV-
infected patient population is aging, and older age HCV-infected patients do not appear to derive the same
reduction in morbidity after successful HCV therapy as do their younger counterparts. At present, our local VA
station (Station 541, Cleveland) follows 3,428 HCV patients, and over the past 3 years has treated over 1,500
of these with IFN-free therapy. Still, we accrue 25-43 new HCC cases/year, running at a steady rate over the
past 6 years. Better strategies to more precisely identify those at high risk for HCC, and treat early HCC are
much needed to curb this morbidity/mortality. PD1 blockade is an emerging therapy, and while a role for T cells
in mediating effects of PD1 blockade have been defined, a role for NK cell activity is less defined. At the same
time NK cells are a dominant lymphocyte population within the liver, NK cells are known to contribute to control
of HCV infection itself, and NK cells have anti-cancer effector function. We will follow our well characterized
HCV infected patient population, taking an NK cell, pathway focused approach to evaluate the anti-tumor host
immune response that precedes HCV associated HCC diagnosis, to help identify both predictive markers and
new treatment strategies. We hypothesize that NK cells play an integral role in host defense against HCV
associated HCC, that selective enhancement of NK cell immune function through modulation of the IFN
response or PD1 signaling can be harnessed to improve host anti-HCC immunity with therapeutic potential.
Defining NK cell immunity that precedes HCC diagnosis will inform when and how to best inform PD1 or NK
targeted clinical trial design, and potentially provide biomarkers of disease risk or onset. We will investigate this
hypothesis with the following aims: Aim 1: Determine the role of PD1 on NK cell expansion and anti-HCC
activity. Aim 2: Determine the effect of selective targeting the Long Non-Coding RNA (lncRNA) NRIR
(negative regulator of interferon response) in enhancing IFN-dependent anti-HCC activity. Aim 3:
Define NK cell activation state, function, PD1 pathway engagement and IFN regulatory pathway
engagement prior to diagnosis of HCC."

Organelle contact and communication are important for the health of cells. Alteration of the
relationship between organelles, such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria,
influences the transfer of ions, lipids, and proteins, impacts inter-organelle dynamics and is
associated with diseases. Our hypothesis is that defects in mitochondria and ER contact result
in decreased mitochondrial clearance by autophagy (mitophagy), increased cell stress, and
inflammation that underlie age-associated and progressive movement disorders. In support of
our hypothesis, we discovered the previously uncharacterized lipid transfer protein VPS13D as
a regulator of mitochondrial size and mitophagy, and showed that VPS13D influences ER and
mitochondria contact. Importantly, these phenotypes are conserved between diverse taxa,
including fruit flies and humans. In addition, we have recently discovered that VPS13D mutant
cells possess elevated markers of stress and inflammation. Loss of VPS13D results in
progressive and age-associated human disease, including spastic ataxia and paraplegia.
Significantly, our recently developed VPS13D conditional knockout mutant mouse model
exhibits phenotypes that are consistent with observations in patients and patient-derived cells.
Our goal is to characterize the role of VPS13D mutation-associated mitochondria and ER
contact in fibroblasts that were derived from patients and our recently developed knockout
mouse model. Here we propose to: (1) determine if altered organelle contact in VPS13D
patient-derived fibroblasts influences age-associated cell defects in mitophagy, stress and
inflammation, (2) examine VPS13D conditional knockout mutant mice for defects in organelle
contact and neurological phenotypes, and (3) investigate VPS13D pathway genes for
suppression of disease phenotypes. The association of altered organelle contact, autophagy,
stress, and inflammation with age-associated disorders illustrates the importance of
investigating the relationship between these processes in cell and animal health."
10888393,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 High-grade gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors in adults that continue to have poor
median 5-year survival rates despite maximal safe resection and chemoradiation. Over the last 20 years, the
standard treatment for high-grade gliomas has not changed drastically; therefore, attention has shifted to
developing virotherapies to improve outcomes from this lethal disease. Viral based gene therapies are preferred
biological agents that selectively deliver transgenes to tumor cells and are not permissible in normal cells. The
first clinical candidate retroviral replicating vector (RRV) (DB107, vocimagene amiretrorepvec) delivers a
transgene, cytosine deaminase, to convert the non-toxic prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) to an intracellular
chemotherapeutic, 5-fluorouracil. Recently, phase III randomized clinical trials (Toca 5, NCT02414165) using
the first clinical candidate DB107 (formerly named Toca511) demonstrated an improvement in survival in a select
subgroup of patients with a novel biomarker, DGM7 compared to patients receiving standard of care alone (SOC)
(18.3 vs. 12.0 months, HR: 0.5, p<0.0167). Since DGM7 is highly predictive of a positive response to retroviral
gene therapy, we are conducting a Phase II, biomarker-driven trial to a priori identify “responders” to DB107+5-
FC. Additionally, we have previously shown that DB107+5-FC suppresses myeloid derived suppressor cells and
recruits tumor infiltrating CD8+ T-cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that DB107+5-FC will not only improve
outcomes in patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas, but will also induce a robust anti-tumor immune
response. To non-invasively characterize the immune response, we plan to employ an multiplex immuno-ELISA
in treated patients before and after exposure to DB107+5-FC. Additionally, we will validate these in vivo immuno-
ELISA signatures with single-nuclei RNA-seq of HGG ex vivo. The fundamental goal of this study is to 1)
prospectively validate DGM7 as a novel biomarker to identify patients who will respond to DB107 and 2)
comprehensively characterize the anti-tumor immune response after viral-based gene therapy through serum-
based ELISA and transcriptomic approaches. The proposed clinical trial may not only validate clinical DGM7 as
a prognostic marker for DB107 in recurrent high-grade gliomas but also set the foundation for the clinical
translation of biomarker-driven clinical trials in neuro-oncology."

Remote data collection will be coordinated and conducted through national laboratory contractors who can
assess vitals and obtain labs in the participant’s home. Data will be obtained between CKiD study visits by
conducting data extraction through electronic health records. The Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)

for harmonization with external cohorts including CureGN and NEPTUNE. Most importantly, it will enable the
study to collect data through web-based entry by computer or mobile phone directly by participants.
Important research questions will include (a) methods to identify risk factors for decline in kidney function during
childhood through young adulthood including acceleration of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline during
puberty and the effect of acute kidney injury (AKI) on chronic kidney disease (CKD); (b) statistical-based machine
learning prediction methodology to characterize the joint predictive value of clinical markers and social
determinants of disease progression for individualized inference; (c) analytic strategies to describe risk factors
for cardiovascular changes and outcomes via home blood pressure monitoring and assessing cardiac and
vascular target organ damage, including characterizing changes in biomarkers like trajectories of indicators of
metabolic bone health; (d) statistical methods to validate and refine GFR equations in young adulthood for
consistent estimates during the transition from pediatric to adult care; and (e) methods to assess effects of
therapies and exposures on outcomes including constructs of social function and emotional well-being."

Somatic mutations in DNMT3A and TET2 are common in the hematopoietic lineages of elderly individuals,
estimated to affect more than 10% of adults over the age of 65. These mutations increase the risk for
age-related comorbidities, including severe infection, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis,
chronic kidney disease and hematologic malignancies, nearly doubling the mortality rate of affected individuals.
DNMT3A and TET2 encode enzymes essential for remodeling DNA methylation during cellular differentiation.
Animal studies suggest that mutations in these genes drive aberrant activation of immune cells, such as
macrophages, which may underlie the disease associations. We recently developed a human pluripotent stem
cell (hPSC)-derived macrophage model, where the differentiation-dependent effects of DNMT3A or TET2
perturbation can be precisely delineated. We discovered that DNMT3A- and TET2- perturbations impaired
DNA methylation remodeling at thousands of regulatory loci, altering enhancer activities and expression of
genes important for macrophage function. Our study highlighted the need for engineering approaches, and
mathematical modeling in particular, to unravel the complex effects of DNMT3A and TET2 perturbations on
cellular function and disease risk.
Here, we pair novel computational modeling approaches with unique experimental resources to
mechanistically connect site-specific changes in DNA methylation to aberrant immune responses and disease
risk. Aim 1 builds deep neural network models (and requisite training data resources) to predict the effects of
DNA methylation on chromatin binding of 100+ transcription factors (TFs), the “readers” of DNA methylation
patterns that ultimately recruit RNA polymerase and co-activators to drive gene transcription. In Aim 2, we
predict genome-scale TF-binding patterns from chromatin accessibility, transcriptional activity and DNA
methylation data in our contexts of interest: DNMT3A- or TET2-perturbed human macrophages in response to
viral and bacterial infection-induced immune activation. To discover links between existing and novel disease
associations, we will intersect the TFBS predictions with curated sets of age-related disease risk variants, to
nominate TFs and contexts where DNMT3A- or TET2-perturbation and downstream alterations in TF binding
might mediate disease risk. In Aim 3, we will construct gene regulatory network (GRN) models of DNMT3A-
and TET2-perturbed human macrophage to identify TFs driving differential gene expression responses to
infection, hypotheses that (1) we will experimentally test and (2) could eventually lead to therapies that mitigate
the negative, pathogenic consequences of common DNMT3A and TET2 mutations. Furthermore, we build
significant generalizable resources (models, modeling methodologies and training data) that will enable future
discoveries in new cell types and disease contexts where alterations in DNA methylation drive phenotypes."
10840878,"Project Summary. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) of a synthetic phenotype meet their energy
requirements largely via aerobic glycolysis. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (Hif-1α) induces a complex
transcriptional program that facilitates glycolysis in the setting of low oxygen tension. In normoxia, Hif-1α
undergoes proteasomal degradation via prolyl hydroxylation and ubiquitination. In VSMCs engaged in
aerobic glycolysis, however, Hif-1α is stabilized by mechanisms that remain unclear. Preliminary data
provide insight into the mechanism of this normoxic stabilization of Hif-1α, showing that Hif-1α-dependent
aerobic glycolysis remains the primary source of ATP; that conditioned media obtained from VSMCs
contains low-molecular-weight factors that stabilize Hif-1α; and that initial identification of these factors
indicates that they comprise the family of branched-chain keto-acids (BCKAs), α-ketoisocaproate (KIC), α-
keto-β-methylvalerate (KMV), and α-ketoisovalerate (KIV), derived from their parent branched-chain
essential amino acids (BCAAs), leucine, valine, and isoleucine, respectively. Given these preliminary
results, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that synthetic VSMCs engage in aerobic glycolysis
through the effect of BCKAs on Hif-1α stabilization. To address this hypothesis, we propose the following
specific aims: 1) we will examine the determinants of BCKA synthesis in VSMCs and their regulation; 2)
we will examine the effect of BCKAs on Hif-1α stabilization and explore potential underlying molecular
mechanisms; and 3) we will examine the effect of BCKAs on VSMC phenotype and examine the

phenotype and metabolism will also be studied in animal models of pulmonary hypertension. The results
of these studies should provide useful insight into molecular mechanisms underlying Hif-1α stabilization
and aerobic glycolysis in VSMCs, the role of BCKAs in that process, and the relationship between BCKA-
dependent aerobic glycolysis and VSMC phenotype and pathophenotype."

 Vasculo-thrombosis and altered hemostasis are associated with several organ pathologies, the disease-
specific mediators of which remain poorly understood. This aspect is particularly relevant in chronic kidney
disease (CKD), which affects 30 million Americans. Patients with CKD suffer from high cardiovascular disease
burden, making CKD patients in need of frequent vascular interventions, such as endovascular procedures or
vascular surgery. A CKD milieu (uremia) is a strong and independent risk factor for thrombosis after such
procedures. Given the upward trend of CKD in general, and high frequency of interventional procedures in them,
investigating such post-interventional complications and means to control them is a worthy pursuit.
 CKD is characterized by retention of a host of uremic solutes. Although studies in humans and animal
models implicate the uremic solutes indoxyl sulfate and kynurenine as CKD-specific risk factors and are,
therefore, perceived as tantalizing therapeutic targets for cardiovascular disease, their exact mechanism of
actions remains poorly understood. This underpinning will be addressed in the current proposal. Our work in
recent years elucidated prothrombotic propensities of indolic uremic toxins, partially mediating their toxicity
through upregulation of tissue factor in vSMCs. Here, building on new data, we propose an integrative approach
to study newly identified converging pathways that augment thrombosis in CKD, consisting of Indoleamine 2,3-
dioxygenase-1 (IDO1), a key enzyme in kynurenine production, and lysyl oxidase (LOX), a key enzyme regulator
of extracellular matrix remodeling and thrombosis. Aim 1 examines a novel regulation of IDO1 level and activity
by indoxyl sulfate and/or kynurenine, and its contribution to uremic thrombosis, using genetic and
pharmacological manipulation of IDO1 in a CKD mouse model. Aim 2 builds on our new findings suggesting
LOX expression as a target of indoxyl sulfate and kynurenine, thereby contributing to uremia-induced vasculo-
thrombosis. This aim employs molecular and gene knockout approaches to understand the control of LOX
biogenesis in VSMCs in a uremic milieu, and its contribution to thrombosis in context of CKD. Both aims of
research will utilize arterial and venous thrombosis models in CKD mice. Successful completion of this proposal
will define CKD-associated common mediators of thrombosis. Along with mechanistic advances, our proposed
investigations might pave ways to repurposing advanced clinical compounds for the management of vascular
occlusion in CKD patients."
10932919,"Assembly of nanoaggregates by amyloid beta (Ab), as a widely accepted model for development of Alzheimer’s disease
(AD), has recently gained additional support. The vast majority of in vitro studies are performed at Ab concentrations
several orders higher than the physiologically relevant concentrations of Aβ in the brain; no nanoscale assembly of Aβ is
observed at the low nanomolar concentration found in vivo. This suggests that the assembly of Aβ in vivo utilizes pathways
different from those used in vitro. We discovered that spontaneous assembly of Aβ42 oligomers from monomers, within
the physiological concentration range, can occur by utilizing the on-surface aggregation mechanism. Here, the surface acts
as a catalyst for the aggregation process. We developed a model that explains the surface catalytic effect of the amyloid
aggregation from monomers, at low nanomolar concentrations. In the model, the membrane effectively catalyzes amyloid
aggregation by stabilizing aggregation-prone conformations. According to our preliminary data, this process depends on the
membrane composition; therefore, we hypothesize that the change of the membrane composition is the factor that defines
the assembly of the disease-prone Aβ aggregates. This hypothesis is supported by findings that aging is associated with
changes in lipid composition and alterations of fatty acids at the level of lipid rafts were found in the early stage of AD. A
thorough testing of this hypothesis is the major goal of this application. The rationale is that understanding the fundamental
mechanisms of membrane-mediated Aβ nanoscale assembly will guide the development of practical approaches to control
the aggregation process. The objective of this proposal is to characterize the on-surface formation of Aβ nanoscale
assemblies, identify the aggregation-prone composition of cellular membranes, and develop a quantitative molecular model
for future use in translational studies. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will test our central hypothesis through the
following three specific aims: Aim 1: Characterize the nanoscale assembly processes of Ab monomers catalyzed by cellular
membranes with different lipid compositions. Aim 2: Evaluate contributions of free lipids on the membrane catalysis of
amyloid nanoassembly. Aim 3: Develop a molecular model for the membrane catalysis phenomenon using multi-scale
theoretical and computational approaches. Aim 1 is focused on testing our hypothesis that the lipid composition of the
membrane bilayer is the defining factor in spontaneous aggregation of Ab proteins at physiological concentrations. Under
Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that free lipids contribute further to the membrane catalysis of amyloid aggregation. Aim
3 proposes the use of various theoretical approaches and computer modeling to gain structural insights into the molecular
mechanism of aggregation by the cellular membrane. The predictions of the theory will be tested under Aims 1 and 2. The
proposed research plan, combining experimental studies with extensive computational modeling, will provide a molecular
model for the Aβ nanoassembly process catalyzed by membranes at physiological concentrations of monomers. The
development of preventative measures for the interaction of monomeric amyloids with membranes can help to control the
aggregation process. This is a paradigm shift, which opens prospects for the development of new efficient treatments, early
diagnostics, and preventive therapies for AD."

Approximately 1 in 7 US adults have chronic kidney disease (CKD), and >800,000 patients are in full kidney
failure also called end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). The optimal treatment for ESKD is living kidney donor
transplantation (LKDT); however, the standard of care continues to be ongoing dialysis, which has poor clinical
outcomes in comparison to LKDT. CKD continues to increase among Hispanics and low-income patients. Black
and Hispanic/Latino persons are respectively 3.1- and 1.3-times more likely than White persons to develop
ESKD. Many individuals are curious about becoming a living donor, but some decide not to donate for unknown
reasons. This prevents transplant centers and kidney organizations from improving their kidney donation process
and tailoring donor care to overcome barriers, particularly for vulnerable and underserved populations. Drop-out
is especially common for potential donors who are Black and Hispanic, specifically those who face greater
socioeconomic challenges to donating, and those who are not biologically related to their kidney patients. Drop-
out from these groups of potential donors contributes to known disparities in LKDT. To reduce disparities in living
donation and increase LKDT, we propose a multi-step study that includes:
Aim 1a: Early identification of patients of all races/ethnicities at higher risk of dropping out from the donor
evaluation process via secondary data analyses of multiple regional and national donor databases. A tailored
risk prediction index (LD-DROP) will be developed and tailored to characterize the risk of drop-out among
potential donors at the time of initial screening or contact, including subgroup analyses by race, ethnicity, and
socioeconomic status; Aim 1b: Validation of the LD-DROP index by prospectively tracking a large, diverse group
of individuals presenting for living kidney donor evaluation at two large and geographically diverse transplant
centers; Aim 2: Individual interviews of potential living donors of various race, gender, and level of risk for drop-
out will be conducted to explore their decision-making and readiness to donate, what vulnerabilities and barriers
to donation they face, and what financial, psychosocial, peer mentoring, and educational interventions might be
most helpful for overcoming these barriers; Aim 3: An intervention to address donation barriers will be piloted
for potential donors at high drop-out risk through a national online peer support program and transplant center-
based education programs for potential living donors.
Project deliverables will be made freely available nationwide via partnerships with the Scientific Registry of
Transplant Recipients Living Donor Collective initiative and the National Kidney Foundation."
10731728,"Each puff of an e-cigarette generates micromolar amounts dihydroxyacetone (DHA) from the combustion of
propylene glycol and glycerol. Up to 40-55% of e-liquid content is converted to DHA in each puff from an e-
cigarette, making DHA a high-volume component found in all e-cigarette vapors, which the vaper inhales with
each puff of the e-cigarette. DHA is approved for external use as a sunless tanning agent, but serious
concerns have been raised about inhalation exposures through spray tanning and now e-cigarette use. We
have shown that DHA is genotoxic, cytotoxic, and induces mitochondrial dysfunction in skin and kidney cells,
but the effects of inhalation exposures to DHA are currently unknown. The long-term goal of the proposal is the
identification and validation of markers for cellular and metabolic stress induced by DHA exposure that can be
examined in tissues from vapers to understand the consequences of repeated inhalation exposures to DHA.
The objective of this proposal is to address the gap in existing studies, which have only focused on skin
models, by examining the exposure effects of DHA at both acute and chronic doses in pulmonary and
cardiovascular cells. Our central hypothesis is that exposure to DHA alters metabolic pathways, promotes
oxidative stress, disrupts Ca2+ homeostasis, and leads to mitochondrial dysfunction. The rationale for this
work is that DHA exposures to the lung and cardiovascular system allow direct absorption of DHA into cells.
DHA-induced changes in metabolism and mitochondrial function would compromise overall cellular function,
leading to disease. Three specific aims will test the central hypothesis: 1) DHA incorporation into metabolic
pathways alters glycolysis and induces glycosylation protein damage; 2) DHA exposure alters NAD(P)H pools
inducing oxidative stress, and 3) DHA exposure alters cytosolic Ca2+ levels and disrupts mitochondrial
function. The first aim will test the sub-hypothesis that DHA alters metabolic pathways by tracing DHA
metabolism using isotopologues of DHA and identifying metabolite disequilibrium. The second aim will test the
sub-hypothesis that an excess of DHA changes cofactor pools and induces oxidative stress. The third aim will
test the sub-hypothesis that DHA alters Ca2+ signaling to induce mitochondrial dysfunction, in addition to
causing metabolic stress and oxidation-reduction imbalance. The study is innovative because it extends
beyond the genotoxic and cytotoxic characterization of DHA to measure DHA’s ability to reprogram pulmonary
and cardiovascular cells metabolically. The research is significant because e-cigarette users are chronically
exposed to DHA, which will directly impact pulmonary and cardiovascular cell homeostasis and cause severe
declines in cellular function or even induce cell death. This work will establish essential markers for DHA
exposure to allow future epidemiological work to associate DHA exposure to disease."
10731731,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The neural crest and ectodermal placodes, unique and defining features of the vertebrate embryo, arise from
the region of the ectoderm termed the neural plate border, which is juxtaposed between the neural plate and the
non-neural ectoderm of the gastrula. They constitute the origins of the craniofacial structures as well as the
cranial ganglia, in addition to other diverse cell and tissue types. Malformation of these cells or their derivatives
can have devastating effects on embryonic development, resulting in pathologies including craniofacial
syndromes, congenital heart defects, and cancers. Nonetheless, exceedingly little is known of the genetic and
epigenetic mechaniasms by which neural crest and ectodermal placode cells become specified. The goal of this
proposal is to investigate the epigenetic regulation of micro RNAs (miRNAs) during specification of neural plate
border cells in order to understand how this diverse pool of progenitors becomes differentially primed for the
acquisition of distinct fates. Importantly, we will address this question in the context of developmentally critical
vitamins, folate and Vitamin C, which are essential cofactors for DNA methylation and demethylation upstream
of miRNA expression. We will combine advanced sequencing technologies with classical techniques in
embryology to test the hypothesis that Vitamin C and folate are required for establishing proper DNA
methylation patterns on miRNA regulatory elements to prime neural plate border cells for fate
specification. Specifically, we will (1) perform transcriptome-wide profiling of miRNAs in progenitors of the
neural plate and neural plate border at different developmental timepoints to uncover spatiotemporal miRNA
signatures underlying differential specification, (2) perform scATAC-seq to identify differential chromatin
accessibilty (i.e. putative regulatory elements), and perform oxBS-seq to reveal differential mehtyation states of
these elements, and (3) determine the respective roles of the essential DNA (de)methylation cofactors folate and
Vitamin C in regulating methylation states on miRNA regulatory elements during fate specifcation. This proposal
seeks to provide the first transcriptome-wide analysis of miRNAs and the corresponding mRNA targets that they
regulate, and the first comprehensive assessment of chromatin landscape (i.e. chromatin accessibility revealed
by ATAC-seq and 5hmC/5mC revealed by oxBS-seq) in neural plate and neural plate border tissues. Moreover,
results from the proposed experiments will contribute fundamental knowledge of the complex mechanisms
regulating fate specification at the neural plate border. Our findings will also have important implications for the
understanding of birth defects arising from malformation of the neural tube, neural crest, and ectodermal
placodes. The proposed project will be carried out under the guidance of Dr. Marianne Bronner who is a leader
in the field of developmental biology and an expert in neural crest development. She is the director of Caltech’s
Beckman Institute where her lab has access to outstanding core facilities (e.g. advanced microscopy and
sequencing centers) that will be instrumental to the successful completion of the proposed study."

SUMOylation is an essential post-translational modification that adds small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO) to
protein lysine residues. SUMOylation regulates many cellular functions, including cell proliferation, DNA repair,
and stress response. Deregulation of SUMOylation contributes to genome instability and cancer development.
Attachment of single SUMO to proteins often creates scaffolds to nucleate macromolecular interactions. On the
other hand, attachment of chains of SUMO (polySUMOylation) often triggers protein ubiquitination and extraction
from a macromolecular complex. Recent works demonstrate polySUMO-dependent relocation of damaged DNA,
which facilitates damage repair. However, the function of protein polySUMOylation and its regulation during cell
cycle remain poorly defined. Our long-term goal is to uncover the molecular mechanisms that control genome
stability to provide fundamental knowledge that will help develop treatment strategies for diseases resulting from
genome instability, such as cancer. The objective of this project is to investigate how polySUMOylation controls
the relocation of two key mitotic regulators during the cell cycle: the RENT (regulator of nucleolar silencing and
telophase) critical for mitotic exit, and the CPC (chromosomal passenger complex), essential for chromosome
bipolar attachment. We recently found that polySUMOylation induction in yeast cells triggers relocation of these
two critical mitotic regulators. Our preliminary data support the central hypothesis that polySUMOylation
promotes relocation of some key mitotic regulators for successful anaphase initiation, and activation of polo-like
kinase triggers polySUMOylation by phosphorylating a deSUMOylase. Our objective will be attained via the
following specific aims: 1) Elucidate the mechanism of polySUMOylation-triggered nucleolar protein
delocalization that promotes mitotic exit. 2) Determine how polySUMOylation of CPC subunits promotes CPC
translocation. 3) Investigate the temporal control mechanism for polySUMOylation during the cell cycle. To test
our hypothesis and achieve our aims, we will combine budding yeast genetics, cell biology, and biochemistry.
Successful completion of this research will provide a comprehensive understanding of how polySUMOylation
controls subcellular localization of protein complexes in the context of cell cycle. Given the exceptional
conservation of both the SUMO system and the cell cycle machinery, principles proved in budding yeast are
highly likely to translate to human and other eukaryotes. The results will have an important positive impact on
the cell biology field because they will uncover new mechanisms critical for genome stability and unveil new
targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy."
10847454,"This proposal is to delineate the novel function of apical polarity complex proteins in cortical progenitor mitosis
and uncover a new pathogenic mechanism of microcephaly caused by genetic mutation of Pals1 (protein
associated with Lin7 1, also known as MPP5). PALS1, which has been incriminated only recently as a gene
responsible for microcephaly in humans, encodes a component of the evolutionarily conserved apical polarity
complex. Our multiple Pals1 genetic models using different Cre drivers consistently demonstrate overwhelming
cortical cell loss because of compromised cell viability. However, the cellular and molecular defects behind the
massive cell death found in Pals1 mutants remain unknown. Through extensive time-lapse imaging, we found
that Pals1 loss causes abnormally lengthened mitotic progression, consistent with accumulating evidence that
anomalies of mitosis are a significant cause of microcephaly. Remarkably, analyses of mitotic cells in static
images and time-lapse imaging of Pals1-deficient progenitors revealed the emergence of internalized cells with
nuclei inside of mitotic cells. This unusual cellular behavior mimics entosis, which is cell cannibalism utilized by
tumor cells to engulf live neighboring cells for pro- or anti-tumorigenic purposes. It is unknown whether this
extraordinary cellular event can be pathogenic in other diseases such as microcephaly. Therefore, the mouse
model with an entosis-like process in its cortical progenitors will provide important new insights into the
pathogenic mechanisms of microcephaly. Our preliminary study demonstrated that cell-in-cell (CIC) structures
represent a dynamic and mobile cellular entity that is highly associated with lengthened mitosis and abnormalities
in cytokinesis. As in tumor cells, ROCK inhibition completely abrogates CIC structures and restores the normal
length of mitosis. Furthermore, we detected a striking increase of the P53 target, P21, in the Pals1 mutants and
found that genetic elimination of P53 produces a remarkable rescue of cortical size along with substantial
reductions of CIC structures and cell death. These observations lead us to hypothesize that Pals1 loss
induces CIC pathology responsible for mitotic defects that compromise genomic content and cortical
cell viability through the abnormal activation of Rho-ROCK and p53. To test this, we will determine the
biogenesis, maintenance, and elimination of CIC structures and how they impact mitosis and subsequent
genomic integrity and fate of cortical cells (Aim1). Next, we will study how Pals1 deletion/reduction causes
entosis through abnormal Rho-ROCK activation (Aim2). Finally, we will delineate the effect of P53 activation on
CIC formation and Rho-ROCK regulation in Pals1 mutant progenitors (Aim3). The current study provides an
important molecular and cellular clue as to how Pals1 mutation causes such a dramatic cortical phenotype as
the complete absence of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Furthermore, for the first time, our study will
establish that an entosis like process can occur in cortical progenitors, providing a novel pathogenic mechanism
by which entotic cell cannibalism produces microcephaly."
10843894,"ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease, is the most common major complication of preterm
birth affecting at least one fourth of infants born with a birth weight less than 1500g. Many premature infants with
BPD will continue to have persistent respiratory symptoms and decreased lung function into adulthood. These
life-long complications of BPD create significant health burden and necessitate extensive health care utilization.
Currently, there is no effective prevention or personalized treatment for BPD. Not every premature infant
develops BPD, and this individual variability in BPD susceptibility is likely explained by complex interactions
between environmental, cellular, genetic, and epigenetic factors. Supplemental oxygen administration, while
lifesaving in the neonatal period, remains a key determinant of BPD pathophysiology. Exposure of the immature
lung to increased levels of oxygen elicits an inflammatory response resulting in abnormal lung development.
However, the lung immune cells, specifically those involved in the innate immune response, and their
accompanying gene expression programs that provide protection against BPD are not completely known. The
overall objective of this proposal is to identify and characterize specific lung myeloid cells and their gene
programs that provide protection to oxygen-induced lung injury. Our hypothesis is that the innate immune
response activated in the lung differs between premature infants who develop BPD and those that are resilient
to disease. Based on our novel finding that genetic loss of function of Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid
cells 2 (TREM2) is protective in hyperoxia-induced lung injury, we propose that inhibition of TREM2 signaling
may be exploited to modulate the innate immune response to prevent abnormal lung development. In Aim 1 we
will employ single cell RNAseq and TREM2-deficient mice to define how TREM2 regulates gene expression and
severity of lung injury after neonatal hyperoxia exposure. In Aim 2 we will apply novel approaches using myeloid
p53-deficient mice exposed to neonatal hyperoxia and interrogate epigenomic modifications using ATACseq and
ChIPseq to identify the regulatory mechanisms by which TREM2 directs a pathogenic immune response on a
transcriptional level. Lastly, to establish proof-of-principle for the translational potential of therapeutic targeting
of TREM2 we will test a TREM2 blocking antibody in vivo and assess recovery from hyperoxia in room air (Aim
3). Further investigations of the conservation of gene regulatory pathways between mice and humans will provide
a sound rationale to use these gene pathways to develop targeted therapies. This project will identify unique
gene regulatory networks of lung myeloid cells that support a regenerative immune response in the developing
lung. These findings will elucidate novel pathways of neonatal lung resilience after hyperoxia, which will inform
the development of more targeted management of multifactorial BPD."

Corneal blindness due to corneal scarring affects millions of people worldwide. Corneal transplantation is
effective but has limitations. This Multi-PI project is aimed to establish a new stem cell-based approach to
reduce the need for corneal allograft transplantation. The scopes of work in this project are to validate and
confirm procedures to generate Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) stem cells, verify the cell safety, and
analyze clinical data towards a cell-based therapy for corneal scarring disorders. The Yam Lab and the
Corneal Task Force at the University of Pittsburgh, following the innovative work by the late James L.
Funderburgh, have confirmed the regenerative effects of human corneal stromal stem cells (CSSC) in animal
models of corneal scarring. The Hsu Lab and the Immunologic Monitoring and Cellular Products Laboratory
(IMCPL) at UPMC Hillman Cancer Center have immense experience in establishing Investigation New Drugs
(IND) manufacturing procedures, quality assurance systems and documentation to support GMP cell product
manufacturing and processing for FDA-registered clinical trials. This proposal is a joint force of the two
expertise to pave a route to stem cell-based therapy in future clinical trials and clinical applications treating
corneal scarring. Specific Aim 1 will establish Chemistry and Manufacturing Control (CMC) for GMP grade
CSSC for allocation towards Investigation New Drugs (IND) in FDA. We will characterize and compare the
quality of GMP raised CSSC and lab-generated cells, and establish a complete GMP production protocol.
Specific Aim 2 will elucidate the pharmacological and toxicological effects of GMP-CSSC. We will study cell
safety and efficacy using our established mouse corneal injury model and will determine CSSC distribution,
metabolism, absorption, excretion, metabolism, and tumorigenicity. Specific Aim 3 will run clinical data mining
and analysis that will direct future clinical trial design. We will do retrospective data analysis using corneal
keratitis and scarring patient database at the UMPC Eye Center and obtain statistical data to direct future
clinical trial design on patient eligibility and treatment outcome analysis. This project is established based on
our solid basic and translational studies and data, and will lead to establish GMP-grade CSSC ready for clinical

Polymorphisms within major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) genes confer significant risk for
developing type 1 diabetes (T1D) in both murine models and humans. MHC class II molecules function to present
processed antigens to CD4 T cells, and recent studies have identified a number of different post-translational
modifications (PTM) of self-antigens in T1D including peptide fusion, deamidation, citrullination, and disulfide
bond formation (S-S). Autoimmune T cell responses to neoantigens formed in peripheral tissues may explain
how and why T cell responses are not subject to usual thymic education and tolerance mechanisms. Disulfide
bond formation is an important PTM, with implications for structure, function, and stability of numerous proteins.
We have shown that an epitope from islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), which is co-secreted with insulin by
pancreatic beta cells, forms a disulfide bond that activates diabetogenic CD4 T cells when presented by the non-
obese diabetic mouse (NOD) MHC class II molecule, IAg7. Our overarching goal is to study the pathogenicity of
CD4 T cells responding to disulfide modified self-peptides in mouse and human T1D. The first 20 amino acids
of IAPP, termed, is the target antigen for a highly diabetogenic CD4 T cell clone, BDC-5.2.9. KS20-reactive CD4
T cells can be detected in the pancreatic islets of prediabetic and diabetic NOD mice. We showed that the KS20
N-terminal disulfide loop contributes to a large portion of TCR contact, necessary for T cell activation. Increasing
evidence indicates that pancreatic beta-cells undergo oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress during T1D
development that can lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are capable of inducing
post-translational modifications including disulfide bond formation. Thus a potential mechanism exists to form
disulfide modified antigens within pancreatic beta-cells that are capable of activating diabetogenic CD4 T cells.
Taken together, this leads us to hypothesize that disulfide bonds are a common post-translational modification
formed during T1D development that activate islet-antigen specific CD4 T cells. Understanding T cell responses
to disulfide modified antigens will enhance our understanding of T1D disease development and identify
therapeutic targets to prevent tissue-specific disulfide bond formation and potentially prevent T1D. We propose
to determine epitopes for disulfide-reactive CD4 T cells and their necessity for NOD diabetes development and
identify T cells responding to disulfide modified self-antigens in patients at-risk and with newly diagnosed type 1
diabetes."

Radiculopathy is a common spinal condition resulting from compression and irritation of the spinal nerve roots,
leading to sensory deficits, muscle weakness, and pain. Dermatomal maps are a key component of the clinical
exam and provide information on the correspondence between cutaneous sensations and the nervous system.
Dermatomal sensory deficits can help localize neurological injury in spinal conditions and guide treatment.
Dermatomal maps, however, are limited—they contain uncertainty in the neuroanatomy mapped (spinal nerve,
dorsal root ganglion, dorsal horn, or spinal cord (SC) segment), assume left-right symmetry and no sex
differences, provide no information on between-subject variability, and remain to be validated. SC functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) permits the non-invasive in vivo spatial mapping of human SC activity.
Here we will use SC fMRI to test hypotheses central to dermatomal maps, investigate the effects of
neurological injury on SC sensory processing, develop markers of SC sensory activity, and test their diagnostic
value in cervical radiculopathy while improving our SC fMRI methods. To accomplish this, we will first enhance
our existing SC fMRI methods by building a research-grade 64-channel head-neck coil, testing a novel spatial
normalization method that accounts for SC segment location, and exploring the use of surface
electromyography to monitor and remove motor-related noise during fMRI experiments. We will compare the
improved SC fMRI methods against our currently operational methods while characterizing the SC correlates
of sensory stimulus intensity encoding using electrocutaneous sensory stimulation of the third digit of the right
hand (C7 dermatome) in 30 healthy volunteers (HV) (20-79 years old, 15 females, 15 males). Then using the
enhanced SC fMRI methods, we will quantitatively map the spatial distribution of SC activity in 120 right-
handed HVs (20-79 years old, 60 females, 60 males, stratified by age) during electrocutaneous sensory
stimulation of the first, third, and fifth digits (C6, C7, and C8 dermatomes, respectively) of the left and right
hands. We will develop probabilistic maps of the spatial distribution of SC activity, assess the superior-inferior
localization of activity, contrast the activity between left and right stimulation and sexes, and quantify between-
subject variability. We will use machine learning algorithms to develop normative SC sensory markers by
predicting the stimulation site. Finally, 40 right-handed patients with right-sided C7 cervical radiculopathy (30–
79 years old, 20 females, 20 males) and 40 age- and sex-matched HVs will also undergo the same SC fMRI
experiment, and we will investigate group differences in SC activity to uncover the effects of neurological injury
on SC sensory processing and then assess the diagnostic value of the SC sensory markers. Completing our
aims will improve SC fMRI methods, validate/refute hypotheses central to dermatomal maps to better inform
their use in clinical practice, advance our scientific knowledge of SC sensory processing in healthy and injured
states, and provide preliminary validation of MRI-based diagnostic markers for cervical radiculopathy."
10847457,"Malaria continues to be among the world’s most virulent infectious diseases accounting for the death of ~0.4
million people a year. Unlike many viral infections, children usually have repeated clinical episodes, but by
adulthood, the majority of individuals living in endemic areas are protected against disease, not parasite
carriage. The reasons for this gradual response to the parasite are not well established. Eventually antibodies
are produced in adults that reduce parasitemia and fever when passively transferred to children with malaria,
indicating a role for antibody-mediated immunity. However, it has been difficult to study this slow development
of immunity to natural infection in the field, since there is no way to control for parasite strain or exposure
timing. Animal studies, while allowing controlled inoculations of specific parasite strains, are complicated to
apply to human infections due to differences across host and parasite species. To address these limitations,
we carried out a clinical trial to systematically evaluate the immune response of malaria-naïve volunteers to an
initial exposure to uninfected mosquitoes, followed 2 months later with Plasmodium falciparum (Pf)-infected
mosquito bites and then 2-3 subsequent challenges each with the mosquitoes infected with the same strain of
Pf. The use of the controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) model allowed control of the timing of parasite
exposure and therefore the early response to sequential infections could be directly monitored. As observed
with children in malaria endemic countries, the initially naïve volunteers continued to be susceptible through
the multiple infectious challenges, but the time to a positive blood smear, termed patency, increased
significantly overtime. Symptoms decreased significantly by the 3rd and 4th challenges indicating the beginning
of clinical immunity and preliminary data indicates plasma from the two subjects with the longest patency delay
reduced liver cell invasion consistent with the development of pre-erythrocytic immunity. This unique, well-
controlled infection model allows us to carefully follow the production of antibody-secreting plasma cells and
parasite-specific memory B cells from before parasite exposure through 3 to 4 challenges with mosquitoes
infected with the same strain of P. falciparum. Our preliminary analysis of the antibody repertoire of circulating
plasma cells demonstrates marked clonal expansion followed by population collapse and the appearance of
distinct clones. We hypothesize that B cells stimulated by the parasite proliferate and differentiate preferentially
into plasma cells, not memory cells. Such a model could explain the lack of a sustained memory response to
infection and subsequent delay in the acquisition of immunity. The specific aims are 1) Characterize parasite-
specific memory B cell production through repeat challenges. 2) Evaluate parasite-specific memory B cells
isolated after each CHMI to parasite stimulation in vitro. 3) Assess the Pf liver and blood stage growth inhibition
through repeated CHMI. Together the results will advance our understanding of the memory response to
Plasmodium, which is critical for the development of protective immunity."

This proposal requests funding for the Mesoamerican Migration Project to gather and disseminate high quality
data on authorized and unauthorized migration to the U.S. from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and
Honduras. The first two decades of the twenty-first century mark a new period in Mexico-U.S. migration. From
2007 to 2016, the estimated number of unauthorized Mexicans in the U.S. declined from 6.95 to 5.45 million.
Mexico-U.S. migration has also changed from a largely circular flow of unauthorized men to a settled
population of families and increasingly authorized migrants. As unauthorized migration from Mexico has
declined, migration from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras has steadily increased. From 1990 to 2015,
the number of persons from these three countries resident in the U.S. grew from 975,000 to 3.0 million. The
majority of this migration, like the earlier stages of Mexican migration, is unauthorized. Also similar to the case
of Mexican migration, what started largely as male-led migration has increasingly involved women and
children. The prospect for continued migration from Mexico and Central America remains high. The
Mesoamerican Migration Project will fill an important void in the data available for studying these new migration
flows. The public use data provided by this study can be used to describe, monitor and analyze current
developments and long-term trends in migration, as well as inform new theory with respect to the migration of
children, women and families, and the impact of adverse climatic events, crime and violence. The proposed
Mesoamerican Migration Project builds on many of the core study design features of the NICHD-funded
Mexican Migration Project which conducted household surveys in 174 Mexican communities from 1987 to
2019. It will provide migration data that is comparable across the four countries and backwardly comparable
with four decades of survey data collected in Mexico by the Mexican Migration Project (MMP) and in Central
America by the Latin American Migration Project (LAMP). Innovative features of the Mesoamerican Migration
Project include: a stratified sampling plan that leverages municipal variation in levels of violence and drought;
the use of referral sampling, social media, and telephone interviewing for U.S immigrant samples; parallel
questionnaire content for household heads and spouses; questions on family migration and the migration of
children; questions on multiple border crossings, transit through Mexico, and experiences of abuse; questions
on violence and gang intimidation, crop and livestock loss, and food insecurity; compilation of weather, climate
and homicide data at the municipal level; compilation of Twitter tweets on violence, weather, climatic events
and migrant caravans."

Glaucoma is a common cause of severe vision loss, characterized by the progressive loss of retinal ganglion
cells. Several large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) have
been performed to date and have discovered over 127 risk factor genes. The mechanism by which these
genes lead to POAG is almost completely unknown. Our proposal seeks to 1) translate these risk factor gene
discoveries into useful data for patients and their doctors and 2) determine the mechanisms by which risk
factor genes confer risk.
This proposal will leverage the results of prior GWAS studies along with the unmatched, 20-years of
prospective clinical data from the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) to develop a POAG risk
calculator that includes both clinical and genetic risk factors that will be useful to patients and doctors (AIM1A).
We will also conduct association studies of the OHTS cohort to identify genetic risk factors for rapid
progression of POAG as measured by visual field parameters, with validation in a local Iowa cohort (AIM1B).
Identifying genes associated with progression of glaucoma has great potential to personalize and guide
glaucoma management.
We will also investigate the functional consequences of specific glaucoma risk alleles with a range of
complementary technologies. AIM2A will test the effects of risk alleles on gene expression and pathways with
studies of genotyped human donor eyes using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq).
Immunohistochemistry and ELISA of genotyped human donor eyes will also be used to determine the effects
of risk alleles on the abundance and localization of the proteins they encode. Finally, in AIM2B will use BiT-
STARR-seq to locate the specific variants (SNPs) in glaucoma loci that confer risk for glaucoma. These studies
will begin to define the precise molecular steps that connect the presence of specific genetic risk factors in
one’s genome to the development of glaucoma.
Our proposal will lead to improved tools for ascertainment of a patient’s risk for POAG or risk for rapid
worsening of POAG that can be readily transferred to clinicians in the form of better diagnostic and prognostic
tools. Our proposal will also define the specific mechanisms by which risk factor alleles alter gene expression
in key tissues (retinal ganglion cells), which will identify disease mechanisms and new therapeutic targets to
facilitate development of targeted treatments. Our proposal has great potential to improve glaucoma care and
reduce vision loss."

For the millions of bilingual parents around the world, and in the US specifically, one of the most pressing
questions in the face of the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis is how to reconcile it with bilingualism.
The choice is most frequently framed in terms of whether to maintain the home language or to switch to the
community language (English in the US). Existing studies on bilingual children with ASD take the approach of
comparing them to monolingual children with ASD in order to establish whether bilingualism carries additional
risks to the development of an autistic child10,22,28,62,110,116,121,122,126,131,141,143,152. However, comparisons between
bilinguals and monolinguals can be deeply biased, and equally importantly, such a group-comparison approach
says little about the best way to support dual language development in young bilingual children with autism. In
this proposal we ask: What are the patterns of dual-language development in young bilingual children
with ASD, and how does dual-language input shape their language outcomes? An especially significant
and innovative aspect of this proposal is its combination of tightly-controlled experimental tasks testing early
English and Spanish skills via highly sensitive eye-gaze measures and ecologically-valid measures of
language input, obtained via parent-child interactions. Our participants are young children (18-36 months)
exposed to Spanish in the home, with and without ASD. We will provide the diagnosis of ASD in-lab, using the
family’s preferred language, thus shortening the evaluation timeline, and yielding an immediate benefit to
Hispanic and Latine families that are drastically underserved, both in terms of service access and in terms of
research participation. Aim 1 is to examine the development of Spanish and English skills in young bilingual
children with and without ASD, defining trajectories of dual-language development. Aim 2 is to examine whether
dual-language input can be optimized in young bilingual children with and without ASD. Studies under this Aim
will offer first evidence for the need to separate dual-language input into distinct streams to optimize language
outcomes in bilingual children with ASD. Aim 3 is to characterize input parameters in the linguistic environment
of bilingual children with and without ASD over time, and to test the effects of dual-language exposure on
language outcomes. This will be the first prospective longitudinal study to examine how families adapt their
language practices when they receive a diagnosis of ASD and to investigate how dual-language input shapes
language outcomes in bilingual children with and without ASD. Proposed studies are highly innovative in their
focus on very young children, use of dynamic processing measures that can capture language skills in children
with varying levels of ability, and longitudinal approach. Recruitment of a neurotypical group that is distribution-
matched to children with ASD allows for important insights into the effects of ASD diagnosis vs. maturation on
input and language outcomes in bilingual children with ASD. Together, the proposed studies are foundational
to any future efforts aimed at developing intervention approaches for this high-needs population."
10912782,"Project Summary / Abstract
 Each year, over 63,000 U.S. infants are born very preterm, prior to 32 weeks of gestation. With >90% now
surviving to discharge due to better obstetrical and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) management, the
present challenge is to reduce short- and long-term morbidities experienced by survivors, including the two- to
four-fold increased risk of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome that manifest by young
adulthood. The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) framework posits that chronic
conditions result from adverse exposures during vulnerable developmental stages known as “critical” or
“sensitive” periods. Of particular importance is the first 1000 days of life, when key developmental processes
set the stage for lifelong health. Very preterm infants are an especially vulnerable population, as they require
NICU support for 2-4 months after birth, coinciding with the 3rd trimester – an established sensitive period for
programming of obesity and cardiometabolic risk. In this context, the most highly modifiable and relevant
exposure is diet during the NICU hospitalization, which may contribute to the accelerated accretion of fat mass
relative to fat-free mass. Hospitalized very preterm infants typically experience impaired weight gain, stunted
linear growth, and excess fat accretion relative to the typical fetus. To offset these issues and support brain
development, dietary fortification of human milk is provided as standard of care. However, the consequences
of dietary fortification for cardiometabolic health in this population are poorly understood. This proposal seeks
to uncover the extent to which diet-based interventions that promote physical growth and brain development
during a sensitive period may also contribute to cardiometabolic risk. We will study 130 infants born 24-31
weeks of gestation who are participating in the Nourish Study (R01HD097327l; PI: Belfort), an ongoing
randomized controlled trial testing the effect of individually targeted human milk fortification vs. standard of
care during the NICU hospitalization. By extending follow-up of this cohort and adding cardiometabolic
biomarkers at 2 and 5 years of age, we have a unique opportunity to investigate how macronutrient and energy
delivery during a sensitive period contributes to, or protects from, cardiometabolic risk during childhood. We
are further poised to address key questions about NICU growth patterns in relation to cardiometabolic health in
this population. Findings from this work have strong potential to impact clinical care by informing dietary
strategies during a sensitive window in development to optimize lifelong health for a vulnerable population."
10842404,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Abnormalities in sensory perception are prevalent features in individuals with autism spectrum disorders
(ASD), accompanying the core social deficits. A central challenge in autism research is to identify alterations in
neurobiological mechanisms that underlie processes as distinct as sensory perception and social cognition. As
such, our long-term goal is to understand common developmental and circuit mechanisms shared by sensory
and social information processing. Considerable evidence indicates that the neuropeptide oxytocin significantly
contributes to a wide range of social behaviors, and more recently, it has been linked to synaptic plasticity in
sensory cortices during development. These findings raise an exciting but untested possibility that oxytocin
signaling is associated with both tactile processing and social function. In our preliminary studies, we found that
oxytocin receptors (OXTRs) are expressed abundantly and specifically in the somatostatin-expressing
interneurons (SST INs) in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) during development. Activating OXTRs
selectively and strongly depolarizes SST INs, while OXTR deletion in these neurons leads to hyperpolarization
of the resting membrane potential and reduced in vivo network activity in the developing S1. In addition, mice
with targeted OXTR deletion in SST INs show impaired texture discrimination and sensory sensitivity, as well as
deficits in social preference. Based on these preliminary results, we hypothesize that oxytocin is required for
establishing proper synaptic connectivity in the developing somatosensory cortex, and that impairment in
oxytocin signaling leads to both tactile sensory abnormalities and social deficits. We will leverage our novel
longitudinal 2-photon imaging technique, electrophysiological and genetic approaches to identify the cell-type
specific role of oxytocin in the development of S1 and during acute social interactions through three aims. We
will assess the effects of oxytocin on the growth and survival of SST INs, as well as the maturation of circuit
connectivity in the developing S1 (Aim 1). We will dissect the role of oxytocin signaling in general tactile sensory
processing, and in encoding social cues during social contacts (Aim 2). We will explore the behavioral outcomes
of oxytocin signaling dysfunction and their neural corelates, and test if developmental tactile dysfunction as a
result of OXTR deletion exacerbates social deficits (Aim 3). Together, the results are expected to reveal common
neural mechanisms underlying sensory and social information processing, providing insights into basic rules for
brain circuit development, as well as identifying early diagnostic markers associated with ASD and other mental
disorders that can guide novel therapeutics."

 Children tend to experience more frequent asymptomatic infections and milder illnesses associated
with SARS-CoV-2 infections than adults, but the reasons for these age-associated differences are unclear.
While typical patterns of respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, and other viruses were markedly disrupted
during the early pandemic, human rhinoviruses (HRVs) remained prevalent. Unlike other respiratory viruses,
HRVs, consisting of species A, B, and C, are detected frequently year-round, and HRV infection is often
asymptomatic, especially in children, who frequently undergo frequent re-infections with new HRV strains. The
immunological consequences of these frequent HRV reinfections are unclear. Studies have suggested a role
for HRV infection in rendering individuals less susceptible to infection with heterologous respiratory viruses,
including SARS-CoV-2, with recent studies reporting that infection with HRV may trigger interferon responses
that block SARS-CoV-2 replication and reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
 While insightful, many prior observations of HRV interference with SARS-CoV-2 or other viruses are
derived from ecological studies or animal models of infection, in which the experimental conditions are closely
controlled. Observations from individuals in real-world conditions with detailed information on the sequence of
infections, specimen collection prior to development of symptoms, and clinical features of illness are scarce.
We aim to overcome these limitations by leveraging an intensive case-based longitudinal SARS-CoV-2
household surveillance platform, with daily nasal sampling and symptom assessment for 14 days following a
positive test of the index SARS-CoV-2 case, to test the innovative hypothesis that interactions between HRV
and SARS-CoV-2 may reduce the risk of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, reduce clinical symptoms among
symptomatic infected individuals, and reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. We further hypothesize
that these interactions may be HRV species-specific. We propose to build upon supportive experimental and in
vitro studies to evaluate the clinical relevance of HRV and SARS-CoV-2 interactions in real-world settings by
studying two Specific Aims: 1) To test the hypothesis that prevalent HRV infections reduce susceptibility
to SARS-CoV-2 infection among exposed household members, and 2) To test the hypothesis that
prevalent HRV infection reduces the risk of symptomatic infection or reduces symptom intensity upon
SARS-CoV-2 infection. By assessing the impact of HRV co-infection on the individual variability observed in
SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to infection and disease severity, findings from the proposed study may yield new
insights into ARI pathogenesis and development of enhanced prevention strategies."
11066700,"Abstract:
Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a debilitating disease characterized by irreversible morphological changes (fibrosis)
and persistent inflammation in the pancreas. Abdominal pain is one of the predominant symptoms and presents
in up to 90% of CP patients and is associated with the heavy use of opioids. Chronic pain can cause opioid
dependence, anxiety, depression and reduced quality of life. Although opioids are effective for acute pain, they
are not effective as a long-term treatment strategy. There is a critical need for more effective, safer, and non-
addictive therapeutic options for people who suffer from chronic pain associated with CP or other diseases.
The use of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in treating pain represents a promising novel intervention as
increasing evidence demonstrates that MSC therapy can effectively target several injury pathways in a variety
of fibroinflammatory diseases while reducing pain, something that most pharmacological interventions cannot
accomplish. MSCs exert protective effects through the release of pro-mitotic, antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory,
and immunomodulatory soluble factors, to mitigate metabolomic and oxidative stress imbalance. Data from
animal models and clinical trials support the outstanding and durable effects of MSC infusion in the suppression
of chronic inflammation and neurological pain associated with various diseases. Our own animal study
demonstrated that MSC infusion significantly reduces pain and improves fibrosis and pancreatic volume in
mouse models of CP. However, whether the infusion of MSCs can be used as a novel approach to relieving
chronic pain and improve pancreatic function in CP patients has not been tested and will be the focus of this
study.
Based on compelling data, our hypothesis is that treatment with MSCs reduces chronic pain and improves
pancreatic fibrosis and function by their ability to target multiple injury pathways. The objective of this study is
two folds: (i) prepare for the clinical trial (UG3 phase, year 1), and determine the safety and efficacy of MSC
therapy in patients with painful CP (UH3 phase, year 2-5). Another critical part of the clinical trial phase will be
to define the mechanisms by which MSCs relieve multiple injuries in the pancreas by measuring changes of
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), especially monocyte subsets and serum proinflammatory cytokine
profiles of treated patients, with the goal of identifying biochemical pathways and serum biomarkers of response
to MSC therapy. This study may help develop novel non-addictive cellular therapy for chronic pancreatitis and
pain."

10886135,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, type 2
diabetes and stroke. Although it is well documented that EC dysfunction is present in most forms of CVD, the
mechanisms by which obesity shapes the development of EC dysfunction remains poorly understood. Further
complicating the understanding of EC dysfunction is the heterogeneity of ECs throughout the vasculature.
Recent studies have demonstrated a large degree of divergence between EC subtypes in the macrocirculation
(aorta) that can be further altered with obesogenic diets over a short period of time. Our lab and others have
shown that the microvasculature is particularly susceptible to obesity induced dysfunction and is a key predictor
of end-organ damage. In the microvasculature of obese mice, we have shown a striking increase in NADPH
oxidase 1 (NOX1) and histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9), two molecules that have been shown to be important
contributors to endothelial dysfunction and phenotypic changes, respectively. As of the writing of this proposal,
no studies have been conducted to elucidate the heterogeneity of EC in the microcirculation, not to mention the
effect of obesity on these populations or whether or not NOX1 and HDAC9 are preferentially expressed in certain
populations over others. To perform these experiments in a time and cost effective manner, we have developed
an AAV approach to deliver AgRP, an orexigenic peptide, specifically to the brain to induce hyperphagia and
obesity. This novel approach in conjunction with endothelial specific lineage tracing mice and endothelial specific
HDAC9 knockout mice will facilitate testing of our central hypothesis that obesity alters EC heterogeneity in the
microcirculation to favor inflammatory EC phenotypes expressing NOX1. Aim 1 will define, through an obese
endothelial specific lineage tracing model, the transcriptomic and phenotypic changes underlying loss of
endothelial function in the microcirculation of obese mice. Using single cell RNA sequencing of fate mapped ECs
from lean and obese mice, we will elucidate the subtypes of ECs expressing NOX1 and interrogate co-expression
patterns. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that HDAC9 has a causal role in increased expression of NOX1 and
microvascular endothelial dysfunction and that weight loss reverses the expression of HDAC9 and NOX1 and
restores endothelial function. We will assess in vitro and in vivo, whether HDAC9 drives the expression of NOX1
and whether its deletion ameliorates endothelial dysfunction in obesity. We will also investigate the effects of
weight loss on microvascular endothelial function using a novel floxed AgRP AAV that enables cessation of
AgRP expression with the goal of promoting weight loss. We anticipate the findings of this proposal will reveal
new mechanisms contributing to endothelial dysfunction in obesity and will provide insight into potential
therapeutic targets to improve cardiovascular health."
10724266,"Approximately 33% of adults in the U.S. have used complementary health approaches (NHIS, CDC [4-6]).
In doing so, 59 million Americans spend $30.2 billion out-of-pocket/year. The most commonly used
complementary approach are natural products ($12.8 billion-almost one fourth of the out-of-pocket amount
spent on all prescription drugs combined). Moreover, recent studies have found that CAM use is highly
prevalent in this and many other countries with 36-52% of the population using CAM at some time [29]. Despite
their frequent use and significant impact in healthcare dollars, scientific research has provided scant evidence
for benefit of natural products in cancer therapy.
 An aqueous extract of wheat germ fermented with Saccharomyces cerevisiae (FWGE) is sold in the U.S.
as a dietary supplement (trade name: Avemar). FWGE is cytotoxic to several human cancer cell lines [7-16]; in
vivo efficacy has been reported for colorectal carcinoma [17-21], melanoma [22] and squamous cell carcinoma
[20] and preliminary clinical data is promising [17, 22, 23]. FWGE reportedly has “immune-reconstructive”
effects [17, 22, 24, 30-32]. These conclusions, however, are mostly based on single-experiment studies devoid
of rigorous follow-up. It has been proposed that FWGE activity is based on its content of
dimethoxybenzoquinone (DMBQ) [24-27]. However, this has not been proven, and indeed early studies
indicated that DMBQ alone cannot be responsible for the immunostimulatory properties of FWGE [24] and may
in fact have significant toxicity [33-35].
 We have confirmed that FWGE has remarkable anti-tumor activity in NHL models in vivo especially when
used in combination with the monoclonal antibody (mAb) rituximab. The efficacy of FWGE was comparable to
that of the aggressive R-CHOP regimen, but FWGE had no appreciable toxicity. Our published results suggest
that a protein fraction from fermented wheat germ (FWGP), not DMBQ, is responsible for this activity by, at
least in part, stimulating natural killer (NK) cell-mediated tumor eradication in vivo [28]. This is a significant
observation since abnormal NK cytolytic activity has been described in hematological malignancies [36].
 The overall goal of this proposal is to isolate active component(s) in FWGP and to understand its
tumoricidal effects by examining activity/toxicity in vivo in canine NHL and ex vivo in humans in anticipation of
human clinical trials.
Significance for the VA population
 We have shown that FWGP is effective against NHL, both in vitro and in vivo [28]. NHL is the sixth most
common cause of cancer-related death in the United States [1-3]. The fastest growing segment of the
population acquiring this disease is elderly males (a substantial segment of the VA patient population). Given
this, and the fact that NHL is an agent orange-associated malignancy, the impact on veterans is substantial.
 We also have substantial preliminary data suggesting that FWGP is effective in pre-clinical models of non-
small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). NK cell anti-tumor activity in lung cancer is increasingly being recognized
as an actionable clinical target [44-47]. While the focus of this proposal is on NHL, our results could have
substantial impact in the treatment of NCSLC. Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-death world-
wide world [48, 49] in both men and women. NSCLC represents ~85% of all lung cancers. Approximately 2/3
of the patients have advanced or metastatic disease at the time of initial presentation [50]. Survival rates are 2-
20% depending on stage [51, 52]. Current chemotherapy bears significant toxicity. Checkpoint inhibition has
revolutionized oncology, but up to two thirds of NSCLC patients fail to respond or eventually relapse. This
proposal lays the groundwork for development of new, effective, and non-toxic treatment approaches for NHL
and NSCLC , which are directly applicable to the VA patient population."

As scientific practice evolves in response to exponential increases in data volume, availability of
rapid computational statistics, and the so-called “reproducibility crisis”, researchers are
developing new methods for collecting and analyze data in rigorous and responsible fashion.
The aim of this proposal is to develop three training units for researchers in the neurosciences
that will bring learners up to speed on these developments, improving the rigor and quality of
their scientific research by deepening their understanding of the role of statistics in biomedical
research. Each unit, developed iteratively in a cycle of testing, evaluation, and revision will be
designed for online or classroom use suitable for diverse learning styles. Units will comprise a
series of short video segments and interactive exercises that lead learners in a process of
guided discovery and self-reflection as they move toward a set of well-specified learning goals.
Our units will teach neuroscientists to avoid common pitfalls in designing and analyzing data. In
the first unit, we address a set of easy-to-make mistakes wherein a researcher alters her plans
midway through the process of data analysis. The practice of HARKing—hypothesizing after the
results are known—involves testing hypotheses that are formulated after viewing research
outcomes. Outcome switching occurs when a study yields negative results based on the pre-
specified outcome measures, but other measures are reported instead. The Garden of Forking
Paths refers to the latitude that researchers have in shaping a statistical analysis as they go
along. The second unit addresses the problem of publication bias, which arises when authors
and journals prefer to publish positive results in favor of negative one, and can lead researchers
to reduplicate efforts or draw mistaken inferences from published data. The aim of this unit is to
make students aware of problem, teach them how to adjust when reading the literature, and
suggest strategies for avoiding publication bias in their own work. The third unit will train
students how to figure out whether when a statistical analysis rigorous and reliable. Students
will learn how to ask “Are the data appropriate what we want to learn?” “Is the choice of
statistical test reasonable?” “Are the inferences supported by the evidence?”
By developing this set of units, to be included in a broader neuroscience curriculum, we can
train a new generation of biomedical scientists who are well-equipped to work with the vast
datasets that are becoming available thanks to new research tools and technologies. These
scientists will be able to work more accurately, make new discoveries more efficiently, and
advance our knowledge in the health and life sciences at a faster rate than ever before."
10912780,"Project Abstract
 Co-use of alcohol and cannabis (using both substances, either simultaneously or concurrently) represents a
significant public health concern among young adults (YAs), as co-use of these substances is common and
worsens alcohol-related harms. However, YAs are unlikely to seek treatment for their substance use, and
existing brief interventions (BIs) for alcohol and cannabis misuse produce modest effects. Thus, there is a
critical need to explore novel treatment components to increase participant engagement and maximize effects.
From a social-developmental perspective, romantic partners have the strongest social influence on YA
substance use, and an underexplored area for intervention. Dyadic research suggests romantic couples
mutually influence each other’s substance use, increasing risk for greater substance use involvement and
more negative interpersonal consequences. Whether these associations extend to or are exacerbated by co-
use remains understudied. Crucially, there is no known BI for co-use among YA couples.
 This innovative study seeks to fill these gaps in two phases. Phase 1a: 75 YA couples will provide 30 days
of daily reports on alcohol and cannabis use, co-use, negative (e.g., conflict) and positive interpersonal
consequences (e.g., intimacy), and relationship outcomes (e.g., satisfaction). Multilevel models will test
whether a person’s co-use is associated with a greater likelihood of their partner co-using. Multilevel Actor
Partner Independence Models will test if couples experience greater negative consequences, fewer positive
consequences, and poorer relationship functioning on days when both partners report co-use than on days
when only one partner reports co-use, and vice versa (consequences → next day co-use). Phase 1b: 15
participants from Phase 1 will participate in qualitative interviews to assess treatment need and inform
intervention content. Data and rapid prototyping (Phase 1 c) will inform development of an online, couples-
based BI aimed at decreasing co-use and promoting healthy relationship skills. Phase 2: A second cohort of
co-using YA couples will be randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 15 couples) or control (n = 15 couples)
and complete baseline, post-assessment, and 3-month follow-up surveys testing feasibility, acceptability, and
initial support. Completing this research will support my development as an independent alcohol and cannabis
researcher with a focus on developing novel interventions for high-risk YA populations. To achieve my career
objectives, I require additional training in 1) social-interpersonal influences that impact etiology, maintenance,
and treatment of alcohol and cannabis use among YAs in romantic relationships, 2) couples-based intervention
delivery, 3) dyadic ecological momentary assessment research and dyadic data analysis, 4) user-centered
design, and 5) randomized control trial (RCT) design. The project will provide pilot data for an R01 submission
to NIAAA which will test efficacy of the intervention in a full-size RCT."

The Overall Objective of this application is to enable in vivo dosimetry during radiation therapy in cancer patient to
the end-user– the medical physicist. Our Hypothesis is that X-ray-induced Acoustic Computed tomography
(XACT) can be used for 4D in vivo dosimetry in patients. In XACT, pulsed x-rays are absorbed and converted to
heat. The resulting thermoelastic expansion generates a 3D acoustic wave, which can be detected by acoustic
detectors to form images. The amplitude of the acoustic waves is proportional to X-ray absorption, and therefore
encodes dose information. Our overall strategy is to design/construct a 3D XACT dosimetric scanner, and to
test/refine the imaging prototype under clinical conditions based on an Academic-Industrial partnership among
University of California, Irvine (UCI), University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC), and PhotoSound
Technologies Inc. Our original specific aims in year 1-5 are: (Specific aim 1) Evaluate the basis of the XACT
imaging in radiotherapy dosimetry; (Specific aim 2) Develop a 3D XACT imaging system for clinical
implementation; and (Specific aim 3) Validate the performance of XACT under clinical conditions. For year
6&7, we propose to develop dual-modal XACT/US imaging system that combines both XACT and pulse-echo
ultrasound imaging. It can be used for 1) real-time monitoring the misalignment between the targeted tumor and
the delivered radiation beam during radiotherapy, and 2) quantitative dose measurement in vivo, which will push
the current paradigm to high-precision radiotherapy. This discovery is the first time in history that radiation dose in
tissue could be directly visualized with high spatial and temporal resolution. If successful, the ability to localize the
radiation beam and map the radiation dose will enable a paradigm shift towards high-precision radiotherapy."

 HPV vaccination rates remain below target levels among adolescents in the United States, which is
particularly concerning in safety-net populations with persistent disparities in HPV-associated cancer burden.
There are numerous evidence-based strategies (EBS) designed to encourage HPV vaccination, but few
programs are routinely used, much less sustained when research studies come to an end. The major research
challenge we now face is not the lack of scientific knowledge about what works, but about how to integrate and
sustain effective EBS for HPV vaccination within dynamic, real-world settings. Significant disruptions due to the
COVID-19 pandemic further support the need to understand implementation context and processes for long-
term sustainability and equity requirements of EBS for HPV vaccination in clinics serving safety-net populations
(underinsured, low-income, marginalized communities). The R37 Parent Award consists of a four-year sequential
mixed-methods study that identifies multilevel, community and clinic factors associated with implementation EBS
for HPV vaccination within a multi-site Federally Qualified Health Care (FQHC) system. Guided by the Reach,
Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework and Rapid Assessment
Procedure Informed Clinical Ethnography (RAPICE) process, our multidisciplinary team will evaluate
longer-term sustainability, maintenance and equity requirements for use of EBS for HPV vaccination and
identify factors that impact broader system-level adoption in this R37 Merit Extension Award. We also
explore factors required for scaling-out and optimization for other settings and contexts. Specific aims include:
Aim 1: Assess longer-term sustainability, maintenance and equity of HPV Vaccine EBS in demonstration clinics;
and Aim 2: Identify factors and core strategies needed for broader FQHC system-wide adoption (scale-up) of
EBS and inform requirements for spread to other safety-net settings (scale-out). There is a dearth of data on
sustainability, adaptation, and scale-up/out within implementation science as it relates to integrating EBS for
HPV vaccination in safety-net settings, as most intervention and hybrid trials have limited timeframes to
rigorously examine these longer-term outcomes. This R37 MERIT Extension request will leverage two additional
years of funding to carry out a logical extension of the four-year funded parent award to fill a critical research
gap in longer-term sustainability and equity in EBS for HPV vaccination in safety-net settings. Data obtained will
also inform a larger pragmatic trial to advance the science in adaptation and fit of EBS in diverse contexts and
settings in future research."

Cachexia is a debilitating metabolic disorder that affects 50% of all cancer patients. Numerous clinical trials
confirmed that the wasting of skeletal muscle mass is the hallmark of cachexia. During the course of the R37
parent grant, the research team developed the first messenger RNA (mRNA) therapy for metastatic ovarian
cancer and cachexia-induced muscle wasting. It is based on lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that deliver follistatin
mRNA predominantly to cancer cells following intraperitoneal administration. The secreted follistatin protein,
endogenously synthesized from delivered mRNA, efficiently reduces elevated activin A levels associated with
aggressive ovarian cancer and ameliorates cachexia in this condition. By altering the cancer cell phenotype,
mRNA treatment prevents malignant ascites, delays cancer progression, induces the formation of solid tumors,
and preserves muscle mass in cancer-bearing mice by inhibiting negative regulators of muscle mass. Finally,
the mRNA therapy provides synergistic effects in combination with cisplatin, increasing the survival of mice and
counteracting muscle atrophy induced by chemotherapy and cancer-associated cachexia.
Recent literature demonstrates that activin A increases the metastatic potential and decreases survival in head
and neck cancers. Therefore, the research team will assess the efficacy of the developed mRNA therapy to
reduce metastasis and preserve muscle mass in a new preclinical model of metastatic head-and-neck carcinoma
that readily metastasizes to the lung and exhibits all the hallmark features of human cachexia.
Whilst the loss of lean muscle mass is the hallmark of cancer cachexia, treatment for cachectic patients must
also comprise therapeutic strategies that target systemic inflammation and stimulate appetite to ensure adequate
energy and protein consumption. The research team will also develop the appetite-stimulatory therapy based on
the above-discussed LNPs loaded with mRNA coding for both ghrelin and its specific O-acyltransferase (GOAT,
required for full ghrelin activation). Previous reports suggest that ghrelin, a gut-secreted hormone, is a potential
therapeutic agent for the treatment of appetite and weight loss in patients with cachexia. The proposed study will
evaluate the efficacy of ghrelin mRNA-based therapy to improve food intake, body composition, and survival in
a murine pancreatic cancer model of cachexia. Finally, anti-inflammatory therapy for the treatment of systemic
inflammation in cancer cachexia will be developed using anti-inflammatory drug-loaded nanoparticles that
accumulate efficiently at the site of inflammation following systemic administration. The research team has
already constructed polymeric nanoparticles equipped with peptides as a targeting moiety for vascular cell
adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) that is overexpressed in endothelial cells during inflammatory insults, with
particularly high expression in hypothalamic centers regulating appetite. The efficacy of these IRAK4 inhibitor-
loaded nanoparticles to reduce hypothalamic inflammation and increase food intake will be evaluated in the
above-discussed murine pancreatic cancer model."

Candida auris has recently emerged as a cause of invasive infections worldwide that are associated with high
mortality rates despite treatment with echinocandins, the frontline class of antifungal agents, and other drugs.
C. auris poses unique challenges due to its propensity for antifungal resistance, and ability to persist in hospital
environments and cause long-tern outbreaks. C. auris are haploid yeasts that are evolutionarily divergent from
diploid Candida like C. albicans and most pathogenic spp. Strains fall in 5 phylogeographic clades. Most
infections are caused by clade I, III or IV strains. There is mounting evidence for genetic diversity within clades,
including core genome single nucleotide polymorphisms, karyotype alterations, gene copy number variations,
polyploidy and aneuploidy. Strains within a given clade also demonstrate differences in antifungal susceptibility,
virulence attributes and pathogenicity. To date, few specific genes have been validated as virulence
determinants, and pathogenesis and echinocandin tolerance remain poorly understood. Mechanisms of
tolerance, resistance, virulence and pathogenesis cannot necessarily be extrapolated from other Candia spp.,
or between C. auris clades. The long-standing paradigm is that almost all Candida infections of blood or other
normally sterile sites stem from a single, clonal organism. However, in preliminary studies, we have shown that
at least some C. auris and C. glabrata strains recovered from positive blood cultures from individual patients at
our center exhibit unrecognized genotypic and phenotypic diversity. Our data suggest a new, population-based
paradigm for Candida infections. The objectives of this project are to characterize the genetic and phenotypic
diversity of C. auris strains recovered from individual patients, and to implicate specific C. auris genes and gene
variants in echinocandin tolerance and resistance, and in virulence. In aim 1, we will perform short- and long-
read whole genome sequencing and establish phylogeny of multiple clade I and III C. auris recovered from
cultures from each patient, including at baseline and during persistent and recurrent infections despite
echinocandin treatment. We will then test phenotypes of genetically distinct strains from each patient, including
echinocandin tolerance and resistance, and virulence-associated phenotypes. In aim 2, we will prioritize genes
and gene variants, and create isogenic mutant C. auris strains in clade I and III backgrounds. Isogenic strains
will be assessed for echinocandin responses and virulence in vitro and in a mouse model of bloodstream
infection. Results will afford new insights into echinocandin responses and pathogenesis by C. auris, and identify
genes that contribute to these processes. Our results will provide a foundation for mechanistic studies of
echinocandin tolerance, resistance and virulence, and for trials establishing the clinical significance of C. auris
genotypic and phenotypic diversity. Our paradigm of microbial genetic diversity has potentially profound implications
for patient care, clinical microbiology practice, and understanding of antifungal treatment responses and pathogenesis."
10844440,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) affects 1/100 babies and is the leading cause of infant mortality in the U.S.
Pulmonary artery (PA) stenosis is common in CHD patients and is particularly challenging to treat when occurring
in the periphery of the PA tree. Peripheral pulmonary stenosis (PPS), often consisting of numerous vessel
narrowings at proximal and distal bifurcation levels, can lead to persistent RV hypertension, RV failure, and even
death. Most institutions treat PPS patients with stenting and angioplasty limited to the proximal (central and lobar)
PAs only. These catheter-based interventions, however, are often ineffective at reducing right ventricular
pressures and are associated with poor and unpredictable outcomes. Comprehensive surgical reconstruction,
involving patch augmentation of ALL stenoses (central, lobar, segmental PAs), can achieve long-term RV
pressure reduction with low morbidity and mortality, but requires >10-hour procedures and specialized expertise
available only at select institutions. Because treatment strategies continue to be debated nationally, and
outcomes remain poor, there is a pressing unmet need for novel clinical decision support tools. We aim to
develop two complementary modeling methods to support clinical decision making in CHD patients with
PPS: 1) a mechanistic multiscale model of pulmonary fluid solid growth melding fluid structure
interaction (FSI) and vascular growth and remodeling (G&R), and 2) a real-time uncertainty-aware digital
twin model for virtual treatment planning to aid clinicians in identifying optimal treatment strategies. To
accomplish these goals, we propose three specific aims: (1) Characterize mechanical and immunohistochemical
properties of PA tissue in human PPS patients via biaxial testing and histology; (2) Develop and validate a
computational modeling framework (melding hemodynamics and G&R) capable of predicting post-treatment
hemodynamics in PPS; and (3) Develop and validate a fast, interactive Bayesian modeling framework for virtual
treatment planning under uncertainty to aid near real-time clinical decision making for PPS, leveraging reduced
order models. Our proposed study will tightly integrate modeling and experiments to improve physiological fidelity
and clinical relevance of patient-specific models in an understudied patient population. The biaxial mechanical
characterization of pediatric human PA tissue will provide much needed data on tissue properties in CHD which
are currently absent from the literature. This project assembles an interdisciplinary team of engineers with
expertise in hemodynamics modeling, cardiovascular biomechanics, mechanical characterization of biological
tissues, and uncertainty quantification, and clinicians with expertise in pediatric cardiology/pulmonary vascular
abnormalities, cardiothoracic surgery, and cardiac catheterization. Our translational objectives are to: (1)
systematically compare treatment options for PPS and thus challenge the current standard of care and, (2)
ultimately optimize treatments for individual patients, thus reducing unnecessary procedures and potential harm
and improving long-term outcomes in this complex pediatric population."

in SCD women. In low and middle-income countries, the odds ratio of maternal death associated with SCD
is 22.81, 95% CI 14.67–35.46.1 From 2012-2014, the Obstetrics Department, Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital
(KBTH), Accra, Ghana, established an obstetrician-led SCD Obstetrics (OB) clinic. The Institutional maternal
mortality for SCD over these three years (2012-2014) was approximately 12%. In January 2015, a
multidisciplinary SCD OB team was established. The team conducted a combined retrospective/ prospective
case series of all maternal deaths in women with SCD at KBTH over seven years (2010-2016).2 This
retrospective data collection highlighted failures and challenges to delivering improved care. Acute chest
syndrome, preceded by acute pain episodes, was the leading cause of death in nearly 87% of women.2 In
May 2015, the team implemented a joint obstetrics/ hematology clinic, instituted close maternal and fetal
monitoring, and implemented clinical guidelines/ protocols. In addition, the SCD OB team established a
weekly communication system to adjudicate the management of challenging cases. These interventions
resulted in an 89.1% risk reduction in maternal mortality (from 10,791 to 1,176 deaths per 100,000 live births;
p=0.007) over 13 months.3 Since initiating our multidisciplinary SCD OB program, we have consistently
decreased maternal mortality in this cohort by approximately 90% compared to before the team was
established.4,5 This physician-mentored application aims to conduct an Effectiveness-Implementation
Feasibility Study to extend our results of decreasing maternal mortality from an academic hospital to a non-
academic hospital setting in Accra, Ghana with a current maternal mortality rate of 5,940 deaths/ 100,000
live births in SCD women. Over five years, the applicant will acquire the skills to use the Consolidated
Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR)6 and the RE-AIM framework (Reach, Effectiveness,
Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance)7 to inform the stages of the study. The applicant will test the
hypothesis that "" In a before and after study design, the applicant will test the hypothesis that multi-
disciplinary care and task-shifting in a non-academic hospital for pregnant women with SCD will have

10734780,"This application is on Human African Trypanosomiases (HAT), one of the most neglected diseases of sub-
Saharan Africa. Despite the anticipated elimination of the gambiense disease by 2030, control in conflict-ridden
and remote areas where HAT typically occurs remains challenging. Interruption of the rhodesiense disease is not
yet envisioned at this time due to the presence of wild and domestic animal reservoirs. Because related tsetse-
transmitted parasites also cause devastating wasting diseases in domestic animals, our studies stand to also
improve nutrient availability and agricultural productivity on the continent. While considerable progress has been
recently made on therapeutics to cure patients, the tool box for disease prevention remains inadequate. Recent
discoveries on the mammalian bite site biology opened up a new frontier for the development of novel methods
to prevent transmission early in the infection in the mammal when very few parasites are introduced in saliva.
Here, we will develop the foundation on the molecular and immunological dialogues and the influential factors that
ultimately shape disease progression at the bite site. This information will help evaluate the feasibility of a
transmission blocking vaccine (TBV) strategy that target metacyclic parasites transmitted in tsetse saliva.
Aim 1. Understand the mechanistic basis of the tsetse-trypanosome dialogue in salivary glands (SG). Our data
indicate that trypanosome infections modify tsetse SG gene expression and saliva components (sialome). To
understand the parasite-SG molecular dialogue, we will: 1) characterize the miRNA populations in normal and
infected SGs, 2) validate the functional involvement of candidate miRNAs in the regulation of products in the
infectious inoculum, and 3) determine parasite infection mediated effects on SG physiology and saliva
composition in natural tsetse populations.
Aim 2. Characterize metacyclic trypanosome dissemination at the bite-site and elucidate vector-derived factors
that orchestrate this process. Our data indicate that the different tissues of infected mammals harbor distinct
populations of bloodstream form trypanosomes. To better understand the factors that mediate parasite infection
dynamics in the mammalian host, we will determine: 1) the temporal and spatial host-parasite dialogue during
dissemination from the bite site to blood and peripheral organs, and 2) the immunological dialogue at the bite
site together with multiple factors transmitted in saliva (exosomes and saliva-borne symbionts).
Aim 3. Investigate a family of surface proteins (Fam10) to block parasite development at the mammalian bite
site. Our studies identified a family of proteins (Fam10) expressed on the surface of mMC cells and demonstrated
that vaccination against one Fam10 member reduces parasitemia early in the infection. To evaluate the feasibility
of TBV methods, we will: 1) investigate the diversity of Fam10 proteins in natural trypanosome populations, 2)
screen for conserved immunogenic peptides, 3) test vaccine efficacy of peptide antibodies that target multiple
conserved Fam10 antigens, and 4) identify the determinants of protective immunity at the bite site."
10734791,"PROJECT SUMMARY
HIV-1 spreads mainly through mucosal exposures. Dominant in mucosal secretions, IgA has long been the class
of antibodies desired at the portal of entrance to block infection. However, due to a paucity of IgA responses to
HIV-1, compared to IgG, previous antibody isolation efforts and antibody repertoire analyses have focused on
IgG+ B cells and missed IgA+ B cells. With a novel vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based platform, we displayed
the membrane-embedded HIV-1 envelope (Env) trimer to probe Env-specific memory B cells and isolate HIV-1
broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) from infected individuals. During this process, we included IgA antibody
repertoire analyses and identified two HIV-1 bNAb lineages that class-switched to both IgG and IgA, thus for the
first time identified bona fide IgA bNAbs produced during HIV-1 natural infection. Additionally, we have isolated
two Env-directed IgA monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that exhibited partial virus neutralization and potent
antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) function to eliminate HIV-1-infected cells. As recent VRC01
prevention trials showed no overall efficacy and only 75% efficacy to VRC01-sensitive strains, it calls for
improved bNAb-mediated prevention. Given the unique properties of mucosal SIgA, such as dimerization, high
stability, and resistance to enzymatic degradation, we aim to test whether IgA (dimer) bNAb passive infusion is
better than IgG to block infection. Supported by these scientific premises and the need to improve bNAb-
mediated prevention, we propose to identify additional HIV-1 IgA bNAbs and ADCP IgA mAbs from peripheral
blood of clade-B and non-clade-B infected individuals, including those followed longitudinally, and from breast
milk cells of HIV clade C infected mothers from the BAN cohort (Aim 1), then structurally define and characterize
the IgA targeted epitopes (Aim 2), and finally test a representative IgA bNAb and ADCP IgA, using an IgG bNAb
as benchmark, for protection efficacy in a rhesus macaque SHIV mucosal challenge model (Aim 3). We aim to
test the hypothesis that 1) significant IgA bNAbs and ADCP responses are elicited in systemic and mucosal
compartments during HIV-1 infection; 2) IgA bNAbs and ADCP IgAs may target epitopes distinct from those of
previously known IgG bNAbs; 3) IgA bNAb is comparable to or better than its IgG bNAb counterpart to protect
against SHIV mucosal challenge, and ADCP IgA may also protect from SHIV mucosal challenge. If successful,
the project will unveil and validate the potential antiviral functions of IgA to fight against HIV-1."

facilitating interactions across the network, (b) providing administrative infrastructure to support the activities of
the Can-ACT Network, and (c) the coordination of the restricted collaborative funds and administrative
supplements for the network. Scientific coordination of this network will include several different critical
components, including (a) identifying and establishing strategies for facilitating reagent and specimen sharing,
(b) identification and harmonization of process development and manufacturing steps for cell product
management and utilization for the functioning of the network between centers and the ICN Core, (c)
biostatistical support and collaboration for preclinical and clinical research studies and centralized data
management and shared data governance, and (d) bioinformatics and data science support and collaboration.
The infrastructure, expertise, and experience of the individuals at Mayo Clinic with national coordination of

10914269,"Abstract Mucosal tissues like the intestine harbor trillions of antigenically foreign microbes. Unavoidable
approximation with commensal microbes in this context highlights the need for expanded peripheral immune
tolerance. However, fundamental gaps in knowledge remain as to how this physiological imperative is
achieved. Filling these knowledge gaps have enormous potential to reveal novel insights on the immune-
pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease and other human autoinflammatory disorders. Our current
framework for investigating how tolerance expands to accommodate commensal intestinal microbes is
primarily focused on the FOXP3+ suppressive subset of CD4+ T cells called regulatory T cells (Tregs).
However, several inconsistencies also highlight the limitations attributing commensal tolerance exclusively to
FOXP3+ cells. With these considerations, our preliminary studies pivoted to investigate commensal specific
CD4+ T cells, without a FOXP3 bias, using an instructive model whereby CD4+ T cells with commensal
specificity can be precisely identified. Using recombinant Candida albicans to establish intestinal colonization
and tracking endogenous CD4+ T cells with MHC class II tetramers, our initial analysis of gene expression
profiles (single-cell RNA-seq) shows minimal (<5%) Treg differentiation amongst CD4+ cells with commensal
specificity. Instead, RNA profiling showed nearly half of peripheral cells that expand in response to commensal
stimulation are not classified based on expression of other lineage-defining markers, and unified by expression
of the zinc finger transcription factor Kruppel-like factor-2 (KLF2). Antigen-experienced KLF2+ CD4+ T cells are
further shown to potently suppress responder T cell proliferation during in vitro co-culture. The necessity for T
cell expressed KLF2 is further highlighted by spontaneous intestinal inflammation that develops in mice with
conditional KLF2 deficiency in T cells, or the rapid (within 10 days) onset of disease in mice with induced
KLF2-deficiency in CD4+ cells. Intestinal inflammation that occurs in the absence of KLF2+ CD4+ T cells is
triggered by commensal microbes since their elimination using a cocktail of antimicrobials averts intestinal
inflammation, efficiently bypassing the necessity for T cell expressed KLF2. Thus, our overall hypothesis is that
KLF2 identifies a FOXP3-negative immune-suppressive subset of CD4+ T cells essential for sustaining
tolerance to intestinal microbes. Three inter-related aims designed to further develop this potentially ground-
breaking hypothesis are proposed which include establishing the molecular basis for how KLF2+ CD4+ T cells
mediate suppression, and whether KLF2 is necessary and/or sufficient to promote functional suppression (Aim
1), the molecular basis for how KLF2+ CD4+ T cells protect against intestinal inflammation in vivo (Aim 2), along
with gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and KLF2 DNA binding distinctions between KLF2+ CD4+ T cells
compared with FOXP3+ Tregs, and other CD4+ T cell differentiation subsets in intestinal and lymphoid tissue
as a basis for their unique biological functional properties (Aim 3)."
10763024,"Project Summary / Abstract
Within 10 years, most persons living with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD; PLWD) will
die, creating 13+ million new bereaved AD/ADRD caregivers. 25% of bereaved AD/ADRD caregivers have
clinically ‘complicated grief’, which impairs nearly all aspects of their lives. Among bereaved AD/ADRD
caregivers who are not clinically impaired, millions still suffer from higher depressive symptoms and loneliness
as well as reduced well-being, physical function, self-care, and personal growth. Researchers may be tempted
to treat bereaved AD/ADRD caregivers as a homogenous group, but bereavement differs between key kin
subgroups of spouses and adult children. Unfortunately, how bereavement differs for extended family is difficult
to discern. The long-term goal of this research is to develop interventions to meet the needs of bereaved
AD/ADRD caregivers. The objective of this proposal is to test a comprehensive model of bereaved AD/ADRD
caregiver needs and identify need satisfying experiences within key kin subgroups that are amenable to future
intervention. The central hypothesis is that bereaved AD/ADRD caregivers have a common set of needs that
influence clinical and subclinical outcomes, but that subgroups meet those needs in different ways, based on
evidence from self-determination theory and 10 months observing bereaved AD/ADRD caregivers. Autonomy,
competence, and relatedness are hypothesized to form a common set of needs essential to clinical and
subclinical outcomes for bereaved AD/ADRD caregivers (Aim 2; tested in a survey of 400 bereaved AD/ADRD
caregivers). Key subgroups are hypothesized to meet these needs differently (Aim 3; tested in semi-structured
interviews with 36-45 bereaved AD/ADRD caregivers). Through a tailored training plan and world-renowned-
expert mentorship in one of the nation’s foremost schools of public health, the candidate will gain expertise in
bereavement, stakeholder engagement, qualitative methods, and mixed methods to facilitate completion of the
long-term goal of this research. Complementing the research team, a Community Advisory Board (CAB) of
bereaved AD/ADRD caregivers and stakeholders will advise the present project and the PI’s broader research
program aimed at helping bereaved AD/ADRD caregivers. CAB members represent different races, ethnicities,
sexes, genders, ages, clinical specialties, types of dementia, time since bereavement, community
organizations, and geographic locations. After this award, the CAB will help guide development of interventions
based on the findings of Aims 2 and 3. The proposed research is innovative in its focus on key subgroups,
application of self-determination theory, and diverse CAB focused on bereaved AD/ADRD caregivers. The
work will address the NIA’s goal to increase understanding of bereaved AD/ADRD caregivers’ needs, informing
future interventions that reduce the clinical and subclinical consequences of bereavement. Together the
integrated research strategy and training plan will also facilitate a successful transition to independence for a
researcher committed to helping PLWD and their caregivers thrive throughout the dementia caregiving journey."
10735883,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Scholars have called for greater attention to the etiologic role of social identity-related stressors in the
creation and maintenance of health disparities. In this domain, a focus on emerging and early adulthood is
warranted given that identity-related concerns peak during this developmental period. Among
underrepresented college students attending elite predominantly white institutions, the confluence of
heightened needs for identity supports and influx of marginalizing experiences may yield the perfect storm of
stressors, resulting in negative health consequences, particularly among underrepresented students who
persist in the face of adverse exposures. The proposed research aims to document 1) the role of specific
identity-related stressors in undermining the health of vulnerable groups as they pursue educational and
career advancement and 2) the role of social supports and resources in mitigating potential harm resulting
from marginalizing experiences. The proposed research will be conducted with a sample of 340 early adults
who previously participated in a five-wave longitudinal study across four years (96% retention rate). All
participants were recruited during their first year of college at an elite predominantly white institution and were
eligible to participate if they were a member of an underrepresented racial/ethnic group, a first generation
college student, or received the full amount of the Federal Pell Grant (i.e., demonstrated substantial financial
need). In the proposed research, established indicators of physical health and epigenetic aging will be
collected from this sample of young adults (ages 25-30) to assess how their previous and concurrent
experiences of marginalization (i.e., risk) and support (i.e., protection) may “get under the skin.” Biomarker
measurements will be utilized in order to identify health risk prior to disease onset. During early adulthood,
most chronic diseases are still asymptomatic and have not yet been detected via routine health screens. Thus,
the period of early adulthood allows for identification of prognostic indicators of future disease. Notably, the
proposed research aligns well with the scientific vision of the National Institute on Minority Health and Health
Disparities in that it aims to help explain disparities in disease by illuminating physiologic processes
resulting from social inequities. Additionally, the proposed research seeks to identify mechanisms of
resilience with attention to nuance across outcomes being studied (e.g., “skin-deep resilience”). A more
comprehensive understanding of risk and resilience processes and variability in how they play out among
marginalized groups can inform interventions to facilitate social mobility while also preserving and bolstering
the health of minority groups. Given that the emerging and early adulthood years hold great consequence for
the life course, interventions targeting this developmental period hold tremendous potential for reducing
health disparities, particularly health disparities that may be exacerbated counterintuitively by social mobility."
10735884,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Factors such as food, transportation, and housing instability, social
isolation, and neighborhood conditions profoundly impact health outcomes. Shaped by a long history of
racial, social, and economic inequity in the US, such factors also underlie health inequities. Many healthcare
leaders now recommend systematic documentation of these social risk factors. Yet while social risk data are
increasingly available in electronic health records (EHR), research is lacking on how healthcare teams
can use these data to improve patient health and decrease health inequities. Social risk-targeted care
(referrals to service agencies) can improve health outcomes, but recent research suggests that such
improvements are not solely the result of addressing social conditions. Another path to improved outcomes
involves social risk-informed care: modifying care plans to account for patients’ social risks (e.g., adjusting
insulin prescribing so that when food benefits run out at the end of the month, patients are less likely to be
hospitalized with hypoglycemia). Such social risk-informed care may seem intuitive, but very little research
has examined how care teams can effectively and systematically make such adaptations. This study will be
the first to examine how EHR-based clinical decision support (CDS) could support the provision of
contextualized, social risk-informed care. Our Aims are: 1. Obtain stakeholder input from community
health center (CHC) staff and patients on care plan adaptations that could mitigate social risks’ impact on
patient health and ability to adhere to care recommendations. Develop and pilot-test EHR-integrated CDS
tools that present social risks and suggest relevant care plan adaptations. 2. Randomize 12 CHCs to
receive: Arm 1) a CDS tool with a social risk summary, links to social service information, and a reminder to
consider social risks in care planning; or Arm 2) a CDS tool with the same summary, reminder, and links,
plus specific care plan adaptation suggestions tailored to a given patient’s social risks. Assess each tool’s
impact on selected national Care Quality Measures (CQM), accounting for secular trends. 3. Assess
enactment of the tools’ suggested care plan adaptations, and patient / staff perceptions of the tools’ usability
and impact on care quality and patient-provider interactions. Our setting is the nation’s largest group of
CHCs on a single EHR. The PIs’ work on an upcoming National Academies report directly informed the
social risk-informed CDS proposed here. This proposal addresses PAR-19-093’s calls for research on “using
HIT to reduce disparities by increasing ... higher quality care, & improving patient-clinician communication,
and health outcomes,” and on “models for the inclusion and utility of SDoH in EHR systems/CDS tools that
… improve health equity.” The tools developed here will be made available immediately for
implementation in any EHR system, enabling rapid dissemination and greater impact of study findings."
10895423,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Advanced age in the majority of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients limits the use of aggressive
chemotherapy leading to poor overall survival. Alternative treatment strategies for AML are highly sought after.
Our research has revealed vitamin C (ascorbate) to be a potential non-toxic therapeutic adjuvant for the
treatment of AML. Ascorbate is an essential micronutrient in humans that, in addition to its role as a cellular
antioxidant, participates as a direct cofactor of Ten-eleven (TET) enzymes. Mammalian TET proteins (TET1-3)
are tumor suppressors of the hematopoietic lineage that catalyze the oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC)
leading to DNA demethylation and the reversal of gene silencing. TET2 loss-of-function mutations are frequently
observed in AML patients and are associated with a worse overall prognosis. Importantly, TET2 mutations are
almost always heterozygous, suggesting that enhancing residual TET2 activity (encoded by the remaining wild-
type TET2 allele) could be a viable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of TET2-mutant AML. We have shown
in cellular and animal models that ascorbate, in a TET-dependent manner, reprograms the AML epigenome by
increasing DNA hydroxymethylation, leading to DNA demethylation, a block in aberrant self-renewal, increased
differentiation, and slowing of leukemia progression. We hypothesize that ascorbate will be an effective
therapeutic agent in the treatment of TET2 mutant AML by enhancing residual TET tumor suppressive function.
There are currently no other therapeutic agents that target TET proteins for functional restoration. We propose
to understand the mechanistic basis of how physiological or pharmacological doses of ascorbate influence TET
activity, and whether uptake capacity through sodium-dependent vitamin C transporters or total residual TET
activity influences ascorbate treatment efficacy (Aim1). AML progression in the context of TET2 mutation and
diverse oncogenic drivers will be tested for sensitivity to ascorbate in combination with standard AML
chemotherapy, and data already obtained from our loss of function genetic screens in AML cells will be used to
design rational combinatorial treatment strategies that maximize the efficacy of ascorbate as a therapeutic
adjuvant (Aim2). Finally, we will explore approaches to enhance the bioavailability of ascorbate as a TET2
cofactor using lipophilic ascorbyl analogs and genetic or pharmacological modulation of vitamin C transporters
on AML cells (Aim3). The goal of this proposal is to understand the dose and AML context in which ascorbate
treatment will be most efficacious, how to combine ascorbate with existing therapies to improve treatment
outcome and identify novel approaches to enhance ascorbate bioavailability for increased TET-activating
potential. We believe these studies will provide a strong foundation for clinical translation of ascorbate as a non-
toxic adjuvant in combination therapies for the treatment of AML."

Over 100 million US adults have hypertension, a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, and 70% of them
cannot achieve adequate blood pressure control with monotherapy alone. Although recent clinical practice
guidelines suggest initiating therapy with two drugs, more than 50% of people currently treated for hypertension
start with a single medication. For these patients, clinical guidelines propose adding a second antihypertensive
drug for treatment escalation. The absence of head-to-head comparison in randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
has limited the ability of clinical guidelines to provide evidence-based recommendations about which drug to add
next for which patients. Our long-term goal is to produce real-world evidence to inform decisions about RCTs for
hypertension treatment escalation and to provide the highest quality non-randomized evidence to support
guideline recommendations. The overall objective in this application is to determine the comparative
effectiveness and safety of the second antihypertensive agents added to monotherapy in patients with
hypertension. The central hypothesis is that there is heterogeneity in the effectiveness and safety of the second
antihypertensive agents, and the optimal choice depends on patient characteristics and the initial therapy. Our
preliminary data demonstrate a large variation in the choice of the second agents added to monotherapy,
providing ample opportunity to leverage practice variation to test our hypothesis. We will first determine the
comparative effectiveness of the second antihypertensive agents added to monotherapy on major cardiovascular
outcomes, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure (Aim 1). We will then
determine the comparative risk of the second antihypertensive agents on potential drug-related adverse events,
such as acute renal failure, angioedema, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hyperkalemia (Aim 2). Finally, we will
assess heterogeneity in effectiveness and safety among key patient subgroups defined by age, sex, race, and
comorbidity (Aim 3). We have assembled experts in observational methods for causal inference,
pharmacoepidemiology, clinical informatics, hypertension management, and implementation science, and will
use real-world data from over 100 million US adults in five electronic health record (EHR) databases (i.e., Optum,
Department of Veterans Affairs, Columbia, Yale, and Sentara Healthcare EHR databases). We will employ state-
of-the-art observational research methods, including an active comparator new-user design, large-scale
propensity score modeling, negative control outcome experiments, and empirical calibration, to emulate RCTs
and to compare drug combinations. The proposed research is innovative because it will be the first study that
applies massive real-world datasets and state-of-the-art observational research methods to comprehensively
investigate the effectiveness and safety of the second antihypertensive agents added to monotherapy. The
proposed research is significant because it provides critical evidence to inform decisions about RCTs for
hypertension treatment escalation and to support guideline recommendations."

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder characterized by the loss of nigral
dopaminergic neurons and the presence of fibrillar cytoplasmic inclusions composed of alpha-synuclein (αS)
known as Lewy bodies. Neurodegeneration in PD is not limited to only the nigral dopaminergic neurons but also
involves cells located in other regions of the neural network. Besides motor symptoms, cognitive impairments
are one of the essential non-motor manifestations of PD that severely affects the quality of life and has substantial
economic consequences. The emerging view suggests that the abnormalities in αS are a strong pathological
correlate for motor and neurocognitive dysfunction in PD and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), a disease
clinically and pathologically related to PD. While the mechanism by which αS pathology leads to neuronal
dysfunction is unknown, existing evidence suggests that compromised redox homeostasis, defects in protein
quality control, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation cause αS aggregation and neurodegeneration
in PD and DLB. Oxidation resistance 1 (Oxr1) has emerged as a vital protein that orchestrates a multifaceted
response to modulate many of the etiological pathways involved in PD and α-synucleinopathies. The mechanism
underlying this process, however, remains poorly understood. Our studies show that Oxr1 overexpression is
neuroprotective in preclinical PD models due to its regulation of the lysosomal proton pump vacuolar-ATPase
(V-ATPase) which is critical for lysosomal function. We show that Oxr1 interacts with V-ATPase and that neurons
lacking Oxr1 exhibit an increase in lysosomal pH, reduce lysosomal proteolytic activity, and exacerbate
neurodegeneration in PD preclinical models. We employed innovative systems biology approaches to compare
similarities in affected pathways between single-nuclei transcriptomic data from human DLB patients and
proteomic data from preclinical models of α-synucleinopathy overexpressing Oxr1. Our analysis revealed that
besides lysosomal pathways, Oxr1 overexpression modulated novel non-canonical pathways involved in
neuronal survival due to the overabundance of pathway drivers in preclinical PD and human DLB. We
hypothesize that Oxr1 is a key mediator of intrinsic protective pathways in PD and DLB. Using rodent models of
α-synucleinopathy, we propose to test the hypothesis that Oxr1 overexpression ameliorates αS-induced PD and
DLB by modulating both lysosomal and non-canonical neuroprotective pathways. The proposed studies will
provide novel insights into molecular mechanisms underlying Oxr1-mediated neuroprotection and identify new
targets for therapeutic interventions in PD and DLB."
10898908,"Microbial communities are complex systems whose emergent metabolic properties play a key role in
determining human health. Metabolic processes enabled by host-associated microbiota play a defining role in
individual health outcomes, and the emergent metabolism of microbial consortia affect environmental
processes from eutrophication to climate change, impacting human health on a global scale. Therefore,
humanity would benefit from a quantitative understanding of the rules by which the genomic composition of a
microbial community, and the environment in which it resides, determines its emergent metabolism.
Discovering the principles by which environmental variation alters community structure and determines
metabolic function is a necessity if we are to manipulate or design communities to improve health outcomes.
However, this task is challenging for existing methods.
 In preliminary work, we establish a new quantitative framework for predicting the emergent metabolism
of a bacterial community from its genomic composition using denitrification as a model metabolic process.
Combining quantitative bacterial phenotyping, modeling, and a simple statistical approach we demonstrated a
method that quantitatively maps gene content to metabolite dynamics in microbial communities. This insight
provides a route to quantitatively connecting the genes present in a community to metabolite dynamics. The
next challenge is to use this insight to understand how community function and structure depend on the
environment.
 We propose to extend this success by understanding how environmental gradients, complexity, and
dynamics impact community structure and function. We accomplish this by developing denitrification as a
model metabolic process. The outcomes of the proposed work will be three-fold. First, microbiome studies
have documented ubiquitous associations between environmental conditions and community composition, but
we do not understand the ecological or physiological origins of these emergent patterns or their metabolic
consequences. Using denitrifying communities across a pH gradient I will show that such patterns emerge from
ecological interactions. I will show that these interactions arise generically from the presence of physiological
trade-offs on microbial traits, providing a generalizable route to understanding the functional impact of
environmental variation on communities. Second, our preliminary study connected genomes to community
metabolism for a simple metabolic pathway acting. I will extend this success to complex pathways and
environmental conditions by constructing a method for predicting carbon utilization by communities in complex
nutrient conditions directly from genomes. I will utilize a powerful blend of genome-scale metabolic modeling
and multi-view machine learning, with impacts from host physiology to climate change. Third, I will use
denitrifying communities to test the idea that, like cells and organisms, microbial communities exhibit predictive
behaviors in dynamic environments. I propose that communities assembled in environments with distinct
schedules of aerobic respiration and anaerobic respiration (denitrification) adapt to facilitate the prompt
utilization of electron acceptors. I will test the hypothesis that community-level learning emerges from
ecological interactions and distinct gene regulatory programs, providing a new conceptual lens through which
we can view community adaptation to dynamic environments."

 Many people who have experienced a stroke have language and/or speech impairments. These
impairments alter how a person communicates, and significantly impacts their participation in life in both major
and minor ways. Clinicians who work with individuals with communication impairments, called Speech-
Language Pathologists or SLPs, often use questionnaires to learn about their clients’ participation in different
communication situations. One such questionnaire is the Communicative Participation Item Bank, or the CPIB.
This questionnaire helps SLPs understand the impact of the client’s communication impairment on their daily
life, and they use this information to help create treatment plans and goals. However, research evidence tells
us that factors other than the speech/language impairment may contribute to how a person answers questions
on the CPIB. Some factors that may influence responses to the CPIB include psychosocial factors such as
chronic stress, depression, resilience, and self-efficacy. If the SLP does not ask about these factors in addition
to providing the CPIB, they may misinterpret CPIB scores and miss important needs of their client. The
connection between each individual’s communicative participation and psychosocial factors is often neglected
because SLPs have little training on measuring these factors or how they impact treatment and its outcomes.
This misunderstanding about clients’ needs may influence treatment plans and goals in a way that does not
help individual clients. To address this problem, this research project will examine how responses to the CPIB
are related to these psychosocial factors for people with communication impairments after stroke. The project
is divided into 2 studies. The purpose of Study 1 is to examine the CPIB and psychosocial factors of chronic
stress, depression, resilience, and self-efficacy with individuals with post-stroke communication impairments to
understand how these factors may influence their participation in daily life. The research team will ask
participants to provide basic information about themselves (age, stroke date, etc.), complete speech and
language tests, complete the CPIB and questionnaires that ask about the psychosocial factors, and answer
interview questions about the topics presented in these questionnaires. Nine months later, the research team
will ask these individuals to repeat the questionnaires and part of the interview to help understand how these
factors change over time. The purpose of Study 2 is to examine how SLPs use the CPIB to understand the
participation and other experiences of their clients, and how they consider psychosocial factors in treatment
goals and activities. The research team will ask SLPs who use the CPIB to complete a survey and follow-up
interview about how they use this questionnaire, including how they consider the psychosocial experiences of
their clients in treatment planning. The results of this research project will clarify the important but neglected
connection between communicative participation and psychosocial factors following a stroke, and provide
critical information about how SLPs can use the CPIB to create better treatment plans for individual clients."

Transducer and Activator of Transcription 5 (STAT5) is a transcriptional factor and has been
proposed as an attractive cancer therapeutic target. However, successful of targeting STAT5
has proven to be very challenging. In recent years, induced protein degradation has emerged as
an effective strategy for targeting those traditional “undruggable” or difficult therapeutic targets.
In this R01 award, we propose to design and develop small-molecule degraders of STAT5. Our
preliminary data have demonstrated that our designed STAT5 degraders potently and
selectively induce STAT5 degradation in human cancer cells and in xenograft tumor tissue in
vivo, leading to effective inhibition of STAT5 function. Importantly, our best STAT5 degrader is
effective in inhibition of cell growth in human CML and AML cell lines with hyperactive STAT5
and is capable of inducing tumor regression in mice at well tolerated dose-schedules.
Determination of co-crystal structures of both STAT5 ligands and degraders in complex with
STAT5 provides us with a solid structural basis for further optimization. Our ultimate goal of this
R01 award is to develop a highly potent, selective, and optimized STAT5 degrader for the
treatment of human CML, AML and other types of human cancers with hyperactive STAT5. To
achieve our goal, we propose to the following specific Aims:
Aim 1: Structure-based design and synthesis of new STAT5 degraders to further optimize
degradation potency, selectivity, pharmacokinetics, and in vivo efficacy.
Aim 2: Investigation of the in vitro activity, specificity, and mechanism of action of new STAT5
degraders using human cancer cell lines containing different levels of activated STAT5 protein.
Aim 3: Determination of the metabolic stability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and in
vivo anticancer activity of STAT5 degraders in mouse models and their potential toxicity in mice.
To the best of our knowledge, our laboratory is the first to develop PROTAC small-molecule
STAT5 degraders. Successfully performed, this project will bring a first-in-class, highly optimized
STAT5 small-molecule degrader into advanced preclinical development and clinical trials as a
new therapy for the treatment of human cancers with activated STAT5."

Aortic stenosis (AS), is common and progression to symptomatic, severe AS is universally fatal without treatment
with aortic valve replacement (AVR), though only 1/3 of individuals receive AVR, due in part to concerns about
high perioperative risk and rapid valvular calcification/degeneration. Despite more than half a century of
research on this topic, comparatively little is known about risk factors for hemodynamic progression of
AS and there are no medical therapies of proven benefit for slowing or preventing AS progression. In
this setting, chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents an attractive model to study AS progression due to rapid
and premature valvular calcification, yielding mechanistic insights that could be applied to non-CKD population.
This proposal leverages the unique and granular phenotyping of participants in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency
Cohort (CRIC) and Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Studies. CRIC is a large, multicenter,
prospective, well-phenotyped observational study, begun in 2003 and funded by NIDDK, enrolling adults (aged
21-74) with varying severity of CKD, with a goal to examine progression of cardiovascular disease amongst CKD
patients. A total of 3,552 CRIC participants had comprehensive transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs) at years
1, 4, and 7 post-enrollment and upon initiation of dialysis, making it the only prospective population-based
cohort enrolling a large number of adults with CKD with serial TTEs, and thus uniquely allows us to test
several important biologic hypotheses in Aims 1-3 (to be additionally tested in individuals without CKD
who received TTEs in visits 5 [2011-2013] and 7 [2018-2019] of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities
[ARIC] Study in Aim 4). Preliminary data from CRIC indicate that progression of aortic peak velocity was greater
than the general population but lower than prior estimates in the dialysis population. As this measure is only one
of several AS severity measures and is influenced by transvalvular flow, we propose to review existing CRIC
TTE images (7,317 TTEs) to calculate all AS severity parameters, and then analyze existing and newly
measured data to address several questions. In Aim 1, we will evaluate if AS progression in CKD varies
according to two measures of kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration and albuminuria) and quantify the
inter-individual variability in AS progression rate. In Aim 2, we will identify clinical and biomarker risk factors that
associate with progression of AS, and whether these associations vary by kidney function. In Aim 3, we will
determine the relationship between rapid AS progression in CKD and adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and
whether this varies by kidney function. In Aim 4, in the ARIC cohort, we will examine if similar clinical and
biomarker risk factors identify an analogous risk of AS progression in a cohort without CKD. Doing so, we will
leverage the unique physiology of CKD to improve understanding of AS progression, providing biologic
insights into the mechanisms of progression of this serious and important valvular disease."

Plasticity mechanisms endow the brain with immense capacity to adapt to a wide range of experience and
exposures. Protein synthesis, including locally at synapses, is a requirement for many forms of synaptic
plasticity. The Integrated Stress Response, ISR, is a highly conserved biochemical pathway that regulates
protein synthesis. The ISR markedly shifts which proteins are made by phosphorylating the initiation factor,
eIF2alpha. The ISR was named for its effects body-wide - in which it provides a cell stress response
mechanism. However, in the brain, the ISR has also been found to be a potent modifier of synaptic plasticity,
learning and memory. At a high level of summary, ISR inhibition in the normal brain has been shown to lower
the thresholds of experience needed to instantiate long-lasting memory and in some disease settings, such as
traumatic brain injury, it rescues cognitive behavioral deficits. Mechanistically, ISR-inhibiting manipulations
have been associated with long-lasting potentiation (LTP); while ISR activation is necessary for forms of
synaptic depression (LTD).
While trying to understand how the ISR contributes to diseases like dementia and dystonia, we recognized
major gaps in the basic understanding of brain ISR actions, including when and where it was normally
activated. We therefore developed a brain-wide viral reporter, SPOTlight, that gives a two-color readout for ISR
activation state. Using SPOTlight, we uncovered a wholly non-canonical modality for the ISR in the brain –
involving its constitutive activation in a class of neurons (striatal cholinergic interneurons) where it influences
dopaminergic modulation of their firing response. Additionally, cell autonomous ISR inhibition in these cells
recapitulated previous “learning enhancement” effects observed with systemic manipulations. These findings
either upend, or at least substantially add to, working models for the ISR in plasticity, learning and memory.
Here, we propose to advance understanding of how the ISR acts in the brain for neuromodulation, synaptic
plasticity, learning and memory. We will focus on 3 knowledge gaps: (1) To what extent does ISR action in
neuromodulatory cells, instead of at local synapses undergoing plasticity, explain ISR effects on synaptic
plasticity and behavior? (2) What are the molecular mechanisms by which the ISR changes dopamine (D2R)
signal transduction outcomes in cholinergic neurons? and (3) Can new ISR reporters be developed with the
spatiotemporal resolution needed to resolve when and where the ISR activates protein synthesis under
synaptic plasticity conditions? We expect the outcomes of this work to impact both general cell biological
principles and specific striatal mechanisms and to have translational relevance for ISR-targeting therapeutic
efforts that are underway."

 Hematopoiesis is a continuous process of blood-cell production occurring through the orchestrated activity
of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Although HSCs have tremendous clinical utility due to their ability to
reconstitute the hematopoietic system by transplantation, their benefit remains limited by the lack of matched
donors. Direct reprogramming of endothelial cells into HSCs via induction of reprogramming factors has recently
emerged as a promising alternative. The overall goal of our proposal is to reveal the molecular mechanisms by
which the reprogramming factors FOSB, GFI1, RUNX1, and SPI1 (FGRS) revert endothelial cells to functional
reprogrammed HSCs (reHSCs). Understanding the basis by which the genetic networks become rewired for this
profound cell type conversion will provide insights into diverse forms of reprogramming, development, and
disease. We discovered that early in the reprogramming process, FGRS directly coordinate two tasks: selection
and activation of multipotent HSC enhancers and disruption of endothelial enhancers and transcription factors
(TFs). We hypothesize that the effect of FGRS on endothelial TF binding is as crucial for reprogramming as the
activation of multipotency enhancers, and we propose to dissect the underlying molecular mechanisms for these
processes. Using single-cell multiomic (scRNA & ATAC-seq) profiling, we further discovered that in intermediate
reprogramming, the relatively homogenous starting endothelial cells are replaced by heterogeneous HSC
populations. How the transition from somatic (endothelial) to multipotent (HSC) regulatory programs occurs in
individual cells undergoing in vitro reprogramming remains unknown. To potentiate in vivo reprogramming, we
generated a novel transgenic mouse model that allows constant FGRS expression in all somatic tissues and
facilitates the recording of all key bifurcating events that lead to HSC establishment and maintenance. Based on
our studies, we propose to dissect the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which FGRS promote cell fate
changes in the context of endothelial-to-HSC reprogramming. In our first aim, we will uncover the molecular
mechanisms by which FGRS target and modulate endothelial and HSC gene regulatory networks. In the second
aim, we will delineate the intrinsic and extrinsic signaling pathways that promote endothelial-to-HSC
reprogramming. We expect that our program will yield fundamental insights into the control of mammalian cell
identity and may lead to novel strategies to generate therapeutically relevant HSCs with high efficiency."

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has induced dramatic and durable clinical
responses in melanoma and other cancers. Despite the success of ICB, effective treatment strategies to
overcome resistance to cancer immunotherapy are lacking. TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is a versatile innate
immune protein kinase nominated as a candidate immune evasion gene in a number of pooled genetic screens.
Using genetic and pharmacologic tools across multiple experimental model systems, we have confirmed a role
for TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) as an immune evasion gene. Targeting TBK1 enhances response to ICB by
lowering the cytotoxicity threshold to effector cytokines (TNFa/IFNg) secreted by immune cells. Tumor cells
lacking TBK1 are primed to undergo RIPK1-dependent cell death in response to TNFa/IFNg. Beyond its effect
on cancer cells, targeting TBK1 in immune cells appears to augment this effect as TBK1 inhibition +/- PD-1
blockade not only promoted accumulation of effector/progenitor exhausted CD8 T cells and M1-like
macrophages, but was sufficient to enhance production of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFNg, TNFa) from these
cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that targeting TBK1 is a novel and effective strategy to overcome
resistance to cancer immunotherapy and raise important questions about the function of TBK1 in cancer cells
versus immune cells in tumor immunity. In this proposal, we aim to confirm and extend these initial observations
and resolve the cell type specific roles of TBK1 in tumor immunity.
In Aim 1, we will determine the cancer cell-specific roles and regulation of TBK1 in resistance to cancer
immunotherapy, by defining the downstream substrates of TBK1 in the setting of ICB resistance and defining
upstream the mechanism(s) of TBK1 regulation promoting immune evasion.
In Aim 2, we define the T cell-specific role of TBK1 in anti-tumor immunity by examining the effect of conditional
deletion of TBK1 in CD8+ T cells. We will use CD8+ T cell specific TBK1 conditional knockout mouse models to
define the effect of TBK1 deletion in T cells on the efficacy of ICB and profile of tumor-infiltrating immune cells,
and CD8+ T cell effector function/dysfunction.
In Aim 3, we will dissect the role of TBK1 in regulating intratumoral myeloid cells. Using myeloid-specific TBK1
conditional knockout mouse models, we will define the effect of myeloid-specific TBK1 deletion on the efficacy
of ICB and the landscape of tumor infiltrating immune cells, as well as the effector function of macrophages and
other myeloid cell populations."
10845660,"Restrictive Cardiomyopathy (RCM) is an autosomal dominant form of cardiomyopathy characterized by profound
diastolic dysfunction yet normal or near-normal ventricular dimensions, wall thickness, and systolic function.
RCM patients have fewer treatment options and notably poorer outcomes than those with other forms of
cardiomyopathy. This is especially true in pediatric-onset RCM, for which the only definitive therapy is heart
transplantation, often in childhood.
Mutations that cause RCM predominate in the sarcomere, which is the contractile unit of cardiac muscle cells.
Since the dysfunction is intrinsic to cardiomyocytes, human in vitro induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived
cardiomyocytes are well-suited to modeling the RCM and evaluating therapeutics strategies. To date, however,
there are no reported investigation of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocyte models of RCM. This proposal, therefore,
seeks to use hiPSC-based models of familial, pediatric RCM to elucidate pathological features, determine
whether certain mutations cause distinct pathogenetic mechanisms, and evaluate the therapeutic potential of
two newly approved drugs that have shown promise for treating diastolic dysfunction in other forms of heart
disease.
Preliminary studies generated a patient-derived, hiPSC-based model of RCM caused by mutations in cardiac
Troponin-T (TNNT2). We found that heightened Ca2+ sensitivity of force generation and increased fibrosis might
underlie disease pathogenesis. Besides TNNT2, mutations in other sarcomeric mutations also cause severe
pediatric RCM, and some are hypothesized to induce disease by distinct pathophysiological mechanisms.
Therefore, AIM 1 of this proposal is to develop hiPSC models of RCM caused by diverse gene variants, and
identify distinct and common mechanisms of contractile dysfunction. Our hypothesis is that RCM is a
heterogeneous disease and distinct gene variant-specific mechanisms converge to elicit hallmark clinical
features of RCM.
Independently, AIM 2 is to evaluate mavacamten mecarbil and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors
(SGLT2i) for efficacy in treating contractile dysfunction in RCM using the hiPSC models. Mavacamten and
SGLT2i are newly approved for other forms of heart disease. Mavacamten, by decreasing actin-myosin cross-
bridging, might be therapeutically effective for RCM independently of genetic etiology. In contrast, SGLT2
inhibitors (SGLT2i), which operate by inhibiting multiple proteins and decrease intracellular [Ca2+] in
cardiomyocytes, might show selectivity for gene mutation depending on pathogenic mechanism. Characterizing
the basic disease mechanisms of RCM and evaluating the efficacy of candidate therapeutics is a critical step
towards improving management of this challenging disease."
10726577,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Herein, a group of collaborative merit review applications (CMA) aim to advance the precision
management of bladder cancer (BCa), especially focused on the early stage initiation of urothelium as
a model of dynamic epithelial changes in response to smoking and deployment-related carcinogens.
Malignancies are the second most common cause of death among Veterans and BCa is the fourth
most common cancer in the VA. Among tumor types, 70% of BCa is confined to the superficial part of
the bladder (Stages T1, Ta, and CIS), with the remainder invasive of the muscle or metastatic. If BCas
are identified at an earlier stage, nearly all of these tumors are treatable with a combination of surgery
and intracavitary therapy. Yet, there are currently no validated or recommended screening procedures
to identify asymptomatic BCas and there are no methods to identify at-risk patients at an earlier and
more curable stage. The proposed CMAs aim to address these limitations and to significantly disrupt
BCa prevention, detection, risk stratification and precision treatment by dissecting the genetic and
molecular foundations of early stage BCa. The projects include the following: CMA1 aims to determine
the genetic and immune-suppressive landscape of CIS to identify new therapeutics and
immunotherapies. CMA2 investigates the plasticity of the urothelium to determine how PPARg can
direct epithelial differentiation as a possible modulator of CIS. CMA3 will examine the epigenetic basis
of urothelial differentiation and the role of LSD1-inhibitor, Methysticin, as a chemopreventative agent to
restore the epigenetic imbalance of the urothelium. Finally, CMA4 will develop artificial intelligence
algorithms for enhanced cystoscopy imaging technologies or BCa detection and risk stratification.
These CMAs are linked both intrinsically among each other and extrinsically with all contributors already
supported by VA R&D with Merit Awards focused on BCa to maximize synergy and ensure success.
Rationale: More than 80% of Veterans report a history of tobacco smoking with 90% of Veterans with
BCa self-reported smokers. Unlike lung, prostate or colorectal cancer, there are no screening protocols
recommended for Veterans at risk for BCa. There is no primary care recommendation for uniform
evaluation of blood in the urine, and no urinary tests have a high negative predictive value that can
replace cystoscopy. Almost all patients with BCa develop blood in the urine at some time, but there is
often delays in pursuing an evaluation by months to years that lead to tumor progression due to lack of
referrals to urologic surgery for evaluation. Once diagnosed, the urothelium is often challenging to follow
and up 20% of invasive tumors will progress to higher stage cancer. Treatment for early stage invasive
bladder cancer is dependent on BCG immunotherapy, but BCG is frequently unavailable and
underutilized for maintenance and 30% of BCas become BCG unresponsive. Therefore, the three major
challenges for improving survival for patients with BCa are 1) early detection of high-risk tumors 2)
identification of progression to higher stage cancer and 3) treatment resistance to BCG immunotherapy.
Our preliminary data suggest that the urothelium has plasticity in early stage BCa that, if understood at
the genetic, epigenetic and molecular level, could be treated and driven to a more indolent cancer.
Based on our preliminary studies and the gaps in diagnosis and treatment we hypothesize that the
urothelium can be influenced by the state of epithelial differentiation and driven towards a more stable
state if detected at early time point."

Surface colonization in the form of biofilms or swarms by otherwise free-swimming bacteria is the first step in
many bacterial infections, but how bacteria sense surfaces remains unknown. The bacterial flagellar motor has
emerged as a key player in surface sensing. Seen traditionally as involved only in motility by rotating helical
filaments, new evidence suggests that the motor acts as a mechanosensor to sense bacterial surface
interactions. However, the components of the motor-mediated mechanosensing pathway largely remain
unidentified. To develop effective strategies for preventing and treating harmful biofilms, there is a critical need
to understand how the motor senses forces and transmits information to downstream processes. The objective
of this proposal is to characterize the function of motor-mediated mechanosensing and its associated circuitry.
The proposed work will utilize novel biophysical methods to precisely control the mechanical load acting on the
motor and to measure the motor’s response. Previous results and preliminary data show that the motor adapts
to load by changing its torque output via the dynamic self-assembly of torque-generating stator units, providing
a possible mechanism for mechanoreception. On the signal transduction side, it is unclear how the
mechanosensing information is transmitted from the motor to the biofilm formation pathways, which are regulated
by the bacterial second messenger cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP). The central hypothesis is that mechanical
stimulation of the motor activates local and global responses that trigger c-di-GMP signaling. The central
hypothesis will be tested by experimentally characterizing motor mechanoreception and using high-throughput
genetics to delineate the mechano-transduction pathways. These goals will utilize a combination of biophysical,
imaging, molecular, and genomic tools. The expected outcome of this work is an improved understanding of how
the flagellar motor of bacteria is involved in surface sensing. The long-term goal is to study how bacteria generate
complex behaviors using simple molecular machinery. The training phase of this career development award
outlines a comprehensive plan for the acquisition of technical and professional skills that will enable the PI’s
transition into an independent research position. The successful completion of this project will provide a platform
for future research aimed at revealing the molecular interactions and the underlying physical biology that enable
complex bacterial behavior such as biofilm formation."

HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) children in sub-Saharan Africa have poorer health outcomes in the first 2 years
of life than HIV-unexposed uninfected (HUU) children, with higher mortality, more illness episodes, poorer
growth and impaired cognitive development. However, it remains uncertain whether these disparities persist as
children enter school, and what the underlying causes are in early life. Impairments in health, growth and
neurodevelopment are likely multifactorial, including both HIV-specific risk factors such as exposure to
maternal viremia and antiretroviral drugs, and universal risk factors such as poverty, low birth weight and
maternal depression. This proposal leverages an existing cohort of HEU and HUU children in rural Zimbabwe,
who were well characterized from early pregnancy to 2 years of age, and are now turning 7 years old. The
goal of this proposal is, first, to understand whether health differences persist at school-age, by
undertaking holistic assessments of the growth, physical and cognitive function of HEU and HUU
children in mid-childhood and, second, to identify the network of underlying causes in early life, by
leveraging the rich dataset of `exposome' measurements between early pregnancy and 2 years of age.
In the first phase of this grant (R61), a cohort of 900 children, previously followed longitudinally in the
Sanitation Hygiene Infant Nutrition Efficacy (SHINE) trial in rural Zimbabwe, will be identified by a network of
Village Health Workers (VHW) and re-enrolled at 7 years of age. All HEU children who participated in SHINE
from an entire rural district will be identified (N=300), and for each enrolled HEU child, 2 HUU children matched
on age, sex and cluster will be selected (N=600). HIV exposure and infection status, social circumstances,
major adversities and medical history of mother-child pairs will be updated, and each child will be linked to
existing meta-data on biological, social and environmental exposures from pregnancy to 2 years of age. A
holistic baseline assessment will compare growth, physical and cognitive function between HEU and HUU
children, and the cohort will begin monthly prospective health surveillance by VHW to identify acute illness,
clinic visits and hospitalization episodes in real-time. At the end of the R61 phase, disparities in school-age
growth, physical and cognitive function between HEU and HUU children will have been characterized, and the
early-life factors associated with these differences identified. In the second phase (R33), monthly prospective
health surveillance by VHW will continue, and an annual assessment of growth, physical and cognitive function
(with storage of biological specimens) will be undertaken, to identify longitudinal disparities between HEU and
HUU children at ages 9, 10 and 11 years, and the early-life exposures associated with these outcomes. A
subgroup of 300 children (150 HEU and 150 HUU) will undergo deep phenotyping of cognitive function, mental
health, body composition, metabolic health, inflammation and chronic comorbidities using a range of cutting-
edge techniques, to provide detailed insights into the functional capacity of HEU children in mid-childhood."
10873932,"Frontline treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD), including psycho- and pharmacotherapy, have
limited effectiveness, with usual care treatment success at just 29% after 1 year. Remission rates for
depression would be enhanced if treatments could be optimized and prescribed to those most likely to benefit.
There is a critical need to develop and test novel, efficacious treatments for MDD and simultaneously work to
optimize their benefits. Resistance exercise training (RET) is a promising but understudied treatment
approach. Our recent meta-analysis found a large antidepressant effect of RET in the few very small trials with
clinically depressed samples (d=0.90), highlighting the potential of RET for treating MDD. These trials, while
underpowered to determine clinically meaningful effects, showed positive results and provide the foundation for
larger mechanistically-informed trials to confirm their promising early effects. Importantly, cerebral blood flow is
lower in adults with MDD, linked with a poor treatment response, and RET can improve cerebral blood flow in
adults. As such, RET may treat MDD via improving cerebral blood flow. However, the mechanistic pathway
linking RET’s antidepressant effects to improved cerebral blood flow in MDD is as-of-yet untested. Further, with
advances in machine learning, the identification of modifiable and stable predictors of clinical and mechanistic
change as well as adherence can inform future precision medicine initiatives for treating MDD. Thus, a trial to
confirm the efficacy of RET for MDD, understand its potential cerebrovascular mechanisms, and uncover the
modifiable predictors of its effects is urgently needed. Toward this end, we propose a confirmatory efficacy 1:1
randomized controlled trial (n=200) of 16 weeks of progressive RET or low dose RET (SHAM) in adults with
DSM-5 diagnosed MDD. Aim 1 will confirm the efficacy of RET vs SHAM on depressive symptoms at 16
weeks, and evaluate both potentially quicker and enduring effects of RET at 8, 26 and 52 weeks. Aim 2 will
determine the effect of RET vs. SHAM on the mechanistic target of cerebral blood velocity and pulsatility and
their potential mediation of antidepressant efficacy. Aim 3 will use supervised machine learning tools to predict
depression changes, cerebrovascular changes, and participant adherence. Upon completion, this study will
build towards our long-term goal of identifying and translating mechanistically-driven behavioral treatments to
reduce the global burden of mental illness by determining the extent to which a promising, accessible,
translatable RET approach can treat MDD by improving cerebrovascular function. Simultaneously, this project
will inform future precision medicine approaches that will target modifiable predictors of treatment response
and adherence to behavioral interventions to optimize MDD treatments and individually prescribe them to
those most likely to benefit. If RET effectively treats MDD, this trial would lay the foundation to apply RET as a
standalone treatment for MDD, and potentially as a standalone or augmentation treatment to reduce the
widespread burden of mood disorders and serious mental illnesses."

Globally, more than half of the world's 37 million people living with HIV are on antiretroviral therapy (ART)
representing immense and encouraging success with access to HIV care. ART prevents disease, death and HIV
transmission and HIV-positive persons can expect to live as long as their HIV-negative peers when their viral
load is undetectable. However, treatment success still lags behind goals. In South Africa alone, 8 million HIV-
positive persons require ART for life and only 4.5 million are currently on ART. Patient barriers to care, such as
missed wages, transport costs, and long wait times for clinic visits and ART refills, are associated with detectable
viral load, the hallmark of struggling to access and take ART. HIV differentiated service delivery (DSD) has
simplified ART delivery: incentives, multi-month scripts, fast-track ART, and community or home ART delivery
motivate clients, reduce the frequency of clinic visits, and decongest clinics. DSD is standard for clients who
achieve viral suppression and engage in care; however, DSD needs adaptation to serve clients who are not
succeeding. Indeed, persons who are not engaged in care arguably need simplified, client-centered
approaches even more than those who can successfully engage.
A suite of adaptive DSD strategies, including community-based ART, have been tested among stable clients
with viral suppression. Lottery incentives effectively change short-term behavior, increasing ART initiation.
Community and home ART delivery increases ART coverage and simplify ART access overcoming clinic
barriers. For stable clients, these DSD activities are as effective as clinic-based care in terms of achieving and
maintaining viral suppression, although among stable clients they have not shown superiority in viral suppression
or cost savings. In contrast, DSD has the potential to improve rates of viral suppression and retention in care
and save costs among more hard-to-reach groups. There is great potential that DSD systems can be client-
responsive and system-efficient for subgroups requiring additional services, matching services with client needs.
A sequential, comprehensive package of DSD approaches, with each step increasing the intensity of service
provision – adaptive DSD – has not been tested to determine the proportion and characteristics of persons who
would achieve viral suppression and retention in care and to estimate the cost-effectiveness and budget impact.
To increase population level viral suppression, persons with detectable viral load need responsive DSD
interventions. A Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design facilitates evaluation of a
stepped, adaptive approach to achieving viral suppression with `right-sized' interventions. We are an experienced
team and propose to build on our strong partnerships to sequentially test adaptive DSD strategies for persons
with detectable viral load: lottery incentives, community-based ART, and home ART delivery. Our aim is to
identify the most effective and efficient HIV care delivery strategies for South Africa."
10843242,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This R21 project is designed to determine structure activity relationships (SARs) of a particular chemotype of
4-(1-methylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-1-ium (aka CPD229 and analogs), new antimycobacterial gyrase inhibitors
discovered in our recent HTS campaign targeting bacterial DNA gyrase funded by an NIAID grant
1R21AI125973. We will also improve their Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) whole cell potency and
pharmacological properties. Additionally, we will determine the mechanism of action (MoA) of these new
gyrase inhibitors both in vitro using purified Mtb gyrase and in vivo within Mtb. DNA gyrase, an essential
enzyme to Mtb, is an excellent and validated target for discovering and developing new antibiotics to treat
MDR-TB. Fluoroquinolones (FQs), one of the most important and prescribed antibiotics, target bacterial DNA
gyrase. FQs are widely used as anti-TB drugs, usually as the second-line antibiotics for MDR-TB patients.
However, FQ-resistant Mtb strains have been discovered threatening the utility of FQ for TB treatment. Certain
FQs also have serious side effects. These newly identified antimycobacterial gyrase inhibitors, structurally
distinct from FQs, provide promising starting points for development and optimization of novel antibiotics that
should yield effective therapeutics capable of overcoming FQ-resistance and effectively treating MDR-TB.
Success in these proposed studies would provide potent non-FQ antimycobacterial gyrase inhibitors for the
development of new antibiotics/therapy for the global public health problem of multi-drug resistant TB."

The Nonhuman Primate (NHP) Core seeks to consolidate supervision and performance of the NHP experimental
protocols of the Program Project entitled “Mechanisms Programming Protective Immunity from RhCMV/SIV
Vaccine and IL-15 Actions” into a structured Core composed of highly experienced research personnel. The
global objective of the Core is to provide leadership and technical expertise to ensure consistency and quality
control in animal selection, execution of study protocols, application of experimental procedures, animal
observations and data collection necessary to meet the objectives of Project and other Core lead investigators.
To accomplish this, the Core will manage and directly supervise all NHP studies for the Project including: 1)
animal selection; 2) animal housing and general husbandry; 3) experimental procedures and clinical
management; 4) specimen collection and processing; 5) necropsy studies; and 6) acquisition and management
of animal demographic, physiologic, clinical, and pathologic data. The overall objective of the Program Project
is to determine the systems response to RhCMV/SIV vaccination and the role of IL-15 signaling in programming
vaccine-induced immune responses responsible for complete arrest and subsequent clearance of SIV infection
in RhCMV/SIV-immunized rhesus macaques. The NHP Core will provide the expertise and technical support
required to ensure successful completion of the six multifaceted and extensive NHP experimental protocols
supporting the 2 projects proposed in this Program. These studies are designed to: a) determine systemic
transcriptomic correlates of the RhCMV/SIV vaccine-induced whole blood Protection-Predictive Transcriptomic
Signature [wbPPTS] in peripheral and mucosal lymphoid tissues and its dependence on IL-15 signaling (Project
1); b) define specific spatial transcriptomic response to RhCMV/SIV-infected cells in tissues and identify the
direct contribution of vector-infected cells to the local and systemic transcriptomic responses linked to wbPPTS
programming (Project 1); c) determine the mechanisms underlying the association between IL-15 signaling
quiescence and generation of the wbPPTS (Project 1) and d) link the tissue and blood transcriptomic
programming identified is a-c to IL-15 signaling pathways, RhCMV/SIV vaccine efficacy and the larger vaccine
response landscape in NHP and people (Project 2)."
10932230,"ABSTRACT
Although aging is understood as a system-wide deterioration of cell and tissue function, it is nevertheless
associated with specific hallmarks, first introduced by López-Otín et al. in 2013. Because these hallmarks have
traditionally been studied in isolation, the relationships between them remain largely unknown, including
whether hallmarks emerge at different times or in a hierarchical manner, or whether certain hallmarks (or genes
therein) are the critical drivers of aging. We previously quantified the system-wide deterioration of cell function
using a statistical physics approach, showing that the information communicated in transcriptional regulatory
networks decreases with age. Here, we propose to investigate how this information loss is determined by the
interplay among hallmarks, using both system-wide analysis and mechanistic interventions. Specifically, we
aim (1) to map the trajectory, hierarchy, and impact of genetic information flow for each of the hallmarks of
aging over time and according to sex; and (2) to mechanistically validate the effect of age on the transfer of
genetic information. We will accomplish these aims using a combination of single cell RNA-seq data from
skeletal muscle cells in young, middle-aged, and old male and female mice; computational analysis built on
tools from statistical physics and information theory; targeted genetic inhibition/overexpression using local
shRNA approaches; and in vivo assessment of muscle functional integrity. This innovative approach will be
carried out by an interdisciplinary team comprising a stem cell biologist (PI), a theoretical physicist (co-PI), a
computational biologist (co-I), and a molecular biologist (co-I), the breadth of which enhances feasibility,
impact, and likelihood for success. The outcome of the proposed work will be a quantitative and mechanistic
understanding of how hallmark-associated genes and processes (de)stabilize regulatory network interactions
over an organism’s lifespan. Ultimately, we anticipate that this framework can be extended to predict an
individual’s biological age and to develop strategies to reprogram gene networks with the goal of preserving a
more youthful phenotype."
10897115,"Project Summary
Altered mitochondrial function, a hallmark of aging, contributes to age-related diseases, in part, due to energetic
failure. Maintenance of mitochondrial energetics requires proper fission and fusion that are in turn regulated by
proteins at endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contacts (a.k.a. mitochondria-associated membranes or MAMs).
Fasting stimulates mitochondrial fatty acid utilization, and it is thought that the benefits of fasting are due to
adaptive changes in mitochondrial dynamics and respiration. How fasting impacts mitochondrial dynamics and
MAMs in intact mammalian systems, and whether these fundamental mechanisms are altered with age and
dietary stress remain unknown. The mechanisms by which upstream signaling cascades regulate mitochondrial
dynamics is becoming an area of great interest, with recent work showing AMPK as a regulator of fission. Our
new data show that the typically nutrient-responsive mTORC2 is paradoxically reactivated by fasting, and that
mTORC2 reactivation supports mitochondrial fission. Indeed, livers silenced for mTORC2 regulator Rictor show
impaired fission and dampened respiration; and mTORC2 activity is suppressed with age. These data raise a
key point: since clinically available mTOR inhibitors (e.g., rapamycin) block both mTORC1 and mTORC2, we
argue that benefits of long-term mTOR inhibition with rapamycin are counterbalanced by mitochondrial
dysfunction due to concomitant mTORC2 inhibition. This forms that basis to explore if blocking mTORC1—in
conjunction with maintaining mTORC2 activity—will lead to healthspan and lifespan extension. Phosphorylation
is a well-established signal in regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. Our phosphoproteomics data suggest that
paradoxical reactivation of mTORC2 kinase during fasting stimulates mitochondrial fission by phosphorylating
novel protein targets at MAMs, including NDRG1, N-Myc downstream regulated 1. Interestingly, the NDRG1S336A
phosphorylation-deficient mutant recapitulates the effects of loss of mTORC2 on mitochondrial
fission/respiration, while phosphomimetic NDRG1S336D stimulates mitochondrial fission. Intriguingly NDRG1, but
not the NDRG1S336A phosphorylation-deficient mutant, interacts with Cdc42, a cytokinetic protein with the intrinsic
GTP hydrolysis activity required for mitochondrial fission. Based on our preliminary data, we propose that
activation of the mTORC2-phosphorylated NDRG1Ser336-Cdc42 axis at MAMs regulates mitochondrial fission
during fasting, and that dysregulation of the mTORC2-NDRG1Ser336-Cdc42 axis leads to age-related loss of
mitochondrial fission and respiration. Three aims are proposed that will characterize (Aim 1) mitochondrial
dynamics and MAMs in aged and stressed livers; (Aim 2) determine if and how dysregulation of the mTORC2-
NDRG1Ser336-Cdc42 axis causes age-related loss of mitochondrial fission; and (Aim 3) explore if synergistic use
of rapamycin and co-expression of phosphomimetic NDRG1S336D will lead to greater lifespan extension when
compared to use of rapamycin alone. Experiments proposed here will rigorously test a new set of hypotheses
that altered mTORC2 signaling is a major contributing factor to age-related loss of mitochondrial function."

Currently 15-20% of adults aged 65+ have Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and a large percentage of these
individuals will develop Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD).
Individuals with MCI demonstrate difficulties performing a wide range of everyday activities and experience
social isolation. Investigators have begun to look at technology-based interventions to improve the functioning
of aging adults with cognitive impairment. Most of these efforts have focused on the provision of cognitive
training or rehabilitation and have not included other aspects of functioning such as everyday activities or
social engagement. The goal of this Stage 1 (NIH Stage Model) Intervention Development cross-site project is
to develop, using a user-centered design approach, and evaluate an innovative intelligent adaptive software
package aimed at providing cognitive and social support and engagement to older adults with MCI. The system
will be designed to adapt to the needs and abilities of the user. Phase 1, akin to Stage 1a, will involve
interviews with aging adults with MCI and care providers to gather information on challenges encountered in
everyday activities and types of technology support features of potential benefit. We will also evaluate different
features of the system (e.g., adaptive interface features), with an iterative design approach with diverse
samples of individuals with MCI. We anticipate conducting two rounds of usability testing per site. Phase 2,
akin to Stage 1b, will involve pilot testing to evaluate the feasibility and usability of the system with a sample of
68 individuals with MCI at each of the three CREATE sites (N=204) and to gather preliminary data on the
efficacy of the proposed system. We will use a waitlist control, pre-post design (waitlist group will receive the
technology after six months and assessed again at 12 months). A battery of measures that includes
demographic information, attitudes towards technology, tablet proficiency, technology experience, performance
of activities targeted in the training components, functional independence and well-being, social
support/isolation, and quality of life will be administered at baseline, 6 months post randomization, and after
another 6 months for the waitlist group. We will also assess potential cognitive ability changes. We will conduct
interviews 6-month post intervention to assess likes, dislikes, and challenges with the system. Our goal is to
develop a unique and highly innovative technology tool that can provide adaptive support to aging individuals
with MCI, even as cognition might deteriorate further. Speech data collected as part of an embedded
reminiscence feature will advance fundamental knowledge of how speech and language production data might
serve as an early indicator of cognitive decline. The project will yield important information on the feasibility of
using technology-based approaches to support everyday activities and cognition for persons with MCI and
insight on barriers to the implementation of technology-based interventions. We will also gain understanding of
the challenges aging adults with MCI encounter in everyday activities."
10888386,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Up to 1 million Americans experience acute respiratory failure (ARF) and require mechanical ventilation in an
intensive care unit annually. Studies repeatedly revealed incomplete penetration of proven-effective,
sometimes life-saving, evidence-based practices (EBP) for these patients, and it is unclear how to select
optimal implementation strategies that can bridge the gap between evidence and practice. Common
approaches to selection have inherent limitations. For example, concept mapping and implementation mapping
rely heavily on stakeholder perspectives, are labor-intensive, and may focus on stakeholder preferences
instead of strategies with the greatest potential impact. Quantitative approaches are also challenging because
important determinants of practice - such as individual motivation and organizational culture - are difficult to
measure at scale.
One important goal of implementation is to reduce variability in the uptake of EBPs attributable to
clinicians and the environmental setting. While clinical practice should vary in response to patient factors and
preferences, implementation programs try to overcome clinician and environmental factors (e.g. insufficient
knowledge or resources) that limit EBP uptake. Applying the Consolidated Framework for Implementation
Research (CFIR) to this conceptual model, the domains of Individuals and Inner Setting should have minimal
influence on adherence to EBPs after a successful critical care implementation program. We hypothesize that
variability attributable to the CFIR domains of Individuals and Inner Setting is lower among patients when a
treatment is supported by high-quality evidence compared to patients for whom the existing evidence for a
treatment is weaker. Our overall objective is to demonstrate 1) how established multilevel modeling techniques
can be used to estimate the proportion of variation in the use of EBPs that is attributable to the CFIR domains
of Inner Setting and Characteristics of Individuals, and 2) how the resulting information can inform selection of
implementation strategies and evaluate their effectiveness. As a proof of concept, we will study two proveneffective
interventions - low tidal volume ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome and bag mask
ventilation during intubation. We will use existing multicenter datasets from the Low Tidal Volume Universal
Support: Feasibility of Recruitment for lnterventional Trial (LOTUS-FRUIT) cohort study and from 3 randomized
trials that collected data on the use of bag-mask ventilation."

Unhealthy diets are associated with numerous deleterious health outcomes. Yet, most children do not
consume a healthy diet, in particular Black/African American and Hispanic children, and children of low
socio-economic status (SES). Previous studies have found that community characteristics influence
diet but the effectiveness of community programs and policies (CPPs) to influence diet is not consistent
across communities by racial/ethnic composition and community SES. The contextual food
environment is an important consideration in understanding the effectiveness of CPPs on diet and may
explain, in part, the differential effect of CPPs across subgroups. However, very few studies have
examined what interventions are most effective for improving diet within community settings and there
are even fewer national studies of how contextual factors influence food environment intervention
outcomes. The proposed study will leverage existing NHLBI datasets with information on CPPs,
contextual food environments, and child, household, neighborhood, school, and community
characteristics that can affect child diet. The study includes over 4,500 children in grades K – 8 from
diverse racial/ethnic and SES backgrounds in 130 communities in the United States. Nearly 10,000
CPPs were documented from over 1,400 key informant interviews within communities. Contextual food
environment measures (e.g., density of supermarkets) in 1, 3, 5, and 8 km buffers around the home,
and in a school-centric buffer, were derived from over 58 million business listings. The specific aims in
this study are to 1) determine the effect of CPPs and the contextual food environment on diet including
intake of energy-dense foods of minimal nutritional value; total added sugar intake; sugar intake from
SSBs; fruit and vegetable intake; whole grain consumption; and fast food consumption, and 2)
determine whether differences persist by race, ethnicity, and SES in the relationship between CPPs
and diet once contextual food environment data are considered. To assess our aims, a generalized
linear mixed model with random intercepts and slopes will be estimated controlling for clustering at the
community level. The proposed study is cost-effective in that it entails secondary data analyses using
linked data from two previous studies. The study is unique in its use of CPPs and contextual food
environment measures at multiple geographic scales in a large, diverse national sample of children
along with control variables at the child, household, neighborhood, school, and community levels. The
findings are expected to help shape how future community investments in programs, interventions, and
policies are tailored and implemented to improve children’s diets and to address diet-related health
disparities early in life."

Of the ~37 million Americans with diabetes, 90–95% have type 2 diabetes (T2D).1 T2D and diabetes
complications disproportionately impact United States (U.S.) racial and ethnic minority communities.
Additionally, populations with low socioeconomic status (SES), those living in rural areas, and low-resourced
communities bear a disproportionate burden of diabetes illness. Advancing equity in T2d disparities necessitates
addressing the social determinants of health; enhancing engagement in the research process; and trans-
disciplinary collaboration that incorporates multi-level interventions and methods of analysis, pragmatic designs
that enhance implementation and dissemination of effective strategies, and mixed-methods approaches. The
overall goal of the National Center for Engagement in Diabetes Equity Research: National CEDER is to
strengthen the engagement of communities and individuals from diverse backgrounds and sectors in T2D
research across the U.S. through a public–private partnership of the NYU Grossman School of Medicine (SoM),
UCLA SoM, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, American Diabetes Association, Health People, and Vision y
Compromiso. Our national reach is amplified through an expansive partnership of 18 academic institutions,
including schools of public health, schools of medicine, and minority-serving institutions; and 10 regional and
national community based organizations reaching diverse African American, Latinx, Asian American, Native
Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native communities. National CEDER, which comprises
three synergistic cores, including an Administrative Core, Stakeholder Engagement Studio Core, and Research
Consultation Services Core, aims to: 1. Strengthen established community-engaged, multi-sectoral regional
partnerships to create a centralized, national network infrastructure designed to foster equitable engagement in
T2D research; 2. Accelerate equitable engagement of diverse communities and sectors through a partnership
hub model and integrated SDOH and health equity frameworks that will inform T2D research priorities and
methods; 3. Use community engagement, implementation science, cultural adaptation, and intersectionality
frameworks to improve uptake of research principles, methods and engagement strategies in T2D research
through a robust studio and consultancy model rooted in bi-directional capacity building and co-leadership
between community, healthcare, municipal, and research partners; and 4. Collaborate with researchers from
diverse disciplines and multi-sector stakeholder groups to synthesize and disseminate best practices and
lessons learned in advancing equitable, sustainable, and replicable community engagement across the T2D
research spectrum. National CEDER efforts will foster community-led and -informed T2D equity research by
integrating community engagement across the research spectrum."
10895589,"Heart disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In healthy myocardium, the
mitochondria utilize oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP and metabolites to support pumping
blood throughout the whole body. Given this critical function of mitochondria in the heart, mutations or
reductions of essential mitochondrial factors cause mitochondrial cardiomyopathy (MC) in humans and
mice. Mitochondrial dysfunction is also a major pathogenic driver in non-genetic ischemic heart disease
such as myocardial infarction (MI). Better understanding of mitochondrial protein functions and
pathogenic molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial dysfunction will promote the development of
therapeutics for MC or MI. Recent RNA-seq coupled with ribosome footprint-seq analyses in mouse
hearts reveal Fam210a (family with sequence similarity 210 member A) as a hub gene in cardiac
remodeling. Our preliminary data suggests reduced FAM210A expression in mouse MI hearts and
human ischemic heart failure. Cardiomyocyte (CM)-specific homozygous (Homo) conditional knockout
(cKO) of Fam210a in adult mice led to MC and mortality. Interactome analyses reveal that FAM210A
binds to mitochondrial Ca2+/H+ exchanger LETM1 (Leucine zipper and EF-hand containing
transmembrane protein 1) and promotes mitochondrial Ca2+ (mCa2+) efflux in vitro and in vivo. Therefore,
Fam210a deletion in CMs resulted in an elevated mCa2+ and reactive oxygen species and compromised
mitochondrial membrane potential. As a result, the mitochondrial respiratory activity was reduced in
Fam210a KO CMs, leading to cardiac dysfunction at a late stage. In addition, persistently activated
integrated stress response (ISR) contributed to the disease progression in Fam210a cKO hearts.
Moreover, CM-specific heterozygous Fam210a cKO mice exhibited lower FAM210A protein expression
and more severe cardiac remodeling than control mice under MI. In contrast, AAV9-mediated
overexpression of FAM210A could protect hearts from MI-induced cardiac damage and dysfunction. Our
central hypothesis is: FAM210A functions as a mitochondrial Ca2+/H+ antiporter regulator and maintains
normal mitochondrial and cardiac function. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing 3 aims. Aim 1.
Decipher the molecular mechanism of FAM210A in regulating mCa2+ homeostasis. Aim 2. Elucidate the
role of FAM210A in regulating cardiac mitochondrial activity and cardiac function. Aim 3. Determine the
effects of FAM210A overexpression on the functional performance of mitochondria, CMs, and the heart
under MI. Collectively, our studies provide novel insights into the function and mechanisms of FAM210A
in regulating cardiac mitochondrial integrity and thus maintaining the normal physiological function of the
heart. This project also suggests that reduced FAM210A level contributes to the MI-induced cardiac
pathological remodeling and overexpression of FAM210A has a cardioprotective role in MI treatment."

Cervical cancer (CC) is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women in Uganda, which has one
of the world’s highest incidence rates. Evidence-based visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) CC screening is
free or low cost, yet ~ 5% of Ugandan women have ever screened for CC, and ~80% have advanced cancer
when initiating care. Drawing on theories of network diffusion and social influence, and known patient-level,
non-structural barriers and facilitators of CC screening, we developed the peer-led, 7-session group
intervention Game Changers for Cervical Cancer Prevention (GC-CCP), a patient-level implementation
strategy to increase CC screening. GC-CCP empowers women who have recently screened for CC to
encourage screening among women in their social networks by disseminating CC knowledge, dispelling myths,
and reducing CC stigma. An R21-funded pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) revealed dramatic effects of
increased CC screening among previously unscreened social network members (i.e., alters). These results,
and our multidisciplinary team’s strong track record of successful collaboration, positions this application to
make a strong impact on CC prevention and control in Uganda, which could be generalizable to other low to
middle income country settings. We propose a hybrid type 1 RCT of GC-CCP to assess its effectiveness for
increasing uptake of evidence-based VIA screening, and implementation and sustainability. The study design
is guided by the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation and Sustainment (EPIS) implementation science
framework. Exploration: This phase consisted of the completed pilot and study site selection (two public, two
private, one each in an urban and rural location). Preparation: In year 1, we will identify and remediate clinic-
and provider-level barriers to ensure good access to and delivery of CC screening services. Implementation: At
each site, 40 women screened for CC will enroll in the RCT as index participants (n=160 index) and be
randomized to the intervention or wait-list control. Each index will recruit up to three (1st degree) alters (n~440
alters) at baseline who have not screened for CC; these index and alter participants will be followed up at
months 6 and 12. At month 6, these alters will each recruit up to two (2nd degree) alters (n ~800 alters) for a
phone interview. Sustainment: After enrolled index participants receive the intervention, each clinic will
continue to implement GC-CCP (with clients not enrolled in the RCT) for an additional 2.5 years, with training
and supervision tasks transferred to clinic staff. Using the RE-AIM framework, we will evaluate engagement in
GC-CCP and CC advocacy (reach), alter CC screening (effectiveness), adoption into usual care,
implementation outcomes (acceptability, fidelity, feasibility, cost), and maintenance. Innovative, sustainable
implementation strategies such as GC-CCP are critical to increase demand for CC screening."

Damage to visual cortex by stroke or trauma often results in contralateral blindness, or hemianopia, a
condition that markedly compromises quality of life. The goal of this project is to develop a primate model of
multisensory rehabilitation from hemianopia. Although several therapeutic strategies have been tried over the
years, they have met with limited success, mostly restricted to the recovery of visuomotor orienting without
visual awareness. Recently, a novel, simple, noninvasive sensory training paradigm has been developed that
produces far more promising and rapid results. This paradigm involves repeatedly presenting spatiotemporally
congruent visual and auditory cues to the blinded hemifield, which engages plasticity within circuits that
process both visual and auditory signals. Results from hemianopic cats have shown that, after several weeks of
such multisensory exposure, animals recover the ability to detect and localize visual stimuli and perform
rudimentary visual pattern discrimination in the contralesional field. Similar findings were recently obtained in
two human patients, who were given a very similar multisensory rehabilitation paradigm, and were able to
verbally report on their awareness of visual stimuli in the previously blind hemifield. However, the extent of
visual capabilities that can be recovered is unknown. To overcome the limitations of using the cat model to
explore these limits and its neurobiological bases, we propose to establish a primate model of multisensory
rehabilitation with which we can detail the effectiveness, operation, and neural correlates of the paradigm. Our
immediate objective is to examine the most pressing questions relating to the psychophysical and
neurophysiological outcomes of the multisensory rehabilitation of hemianopia, including the quantification of
visual stimulus detection and visual feature discrimination capacities. To do so we will assess the behavioral
and perceptual capabilities of trained hemianopic monkeys on a battery of visual psychophysical tasks before
and after multisensory rehabilitation and assess changes in the neurophysiological properties of subcortical
and cortical areas (superior colliculus and area LIP) believed to underlie this recovery. These results will
provide a foundation for understanding the mechanisms underlying this novel rehabilitative approach so that
optimal translational strategies can be developed to ameliorate this condition in human patients."

is excessive, by promoting a healthy, accessible, and culturally appropriate diet. In response, we led PROMED
(Puerto Rico-Optimized Mediterranean-like Diet #NCT03975556), a 4-mo, 2-arm, parallel pilot and feasibility
randomized trial that tested the efficacy of a culturally tailored intervention vs. standard healthy eating
program in improving cardiometabolic risk factors in 44 adults in PR. Participants highly rated PROMED’s
cultural acceptability, practicality, and satisfaction. The short-term benefits on blood pressure and HDL-C need
to be tested long-term. We therefore propose to test these mechanisms and the intervention’s efficacy by
expanding PROMED to a 2-year, 2-arm, parallel randomized clinical trial among 250 free-living adults aged
30-65y in PR with at least one dysregulated risk factor but free of CVD or T2D. The intervention group will
receive culturally tailored portion-control advice through monthly individual counseling reinforced with daily
text messages, and a monthly supply of legumes, vegetable oils, and locally produced fruit and vegetables.
Participants in the control arm will receive standard portion-control non-tailored nutritional counseling in
monthly individual sessions reinforced with daily text messages and monthly supermarket vouchers, but no
foods. Primary outcomes are a cardiometabolic improvement score (CIS) denoting improved cumulative risk
factors at a clinically significant value and 10-year atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk estimated from the
pooled cohort equation. We aim to determine the biological mechanisms mediating the efficacy of PROMED vs.
control by measuring plasma metabolite signatures that predict changes in CIS and 10-year ASCVD risk; assess
change and mediation of psychosocial factors (self-efficacy, self-control, intent) on CIS, and ASCVD; and
ascertain changes in food security, access, and expenditure by group, and effects on diet, CIS, and ASCVD. As
an exploratory aim, we will assess spillover effect of the intervention by inviting one household member of 70
participants at random for clinical and laboratory assessments. We expect PROMED will improve participants’
cardiometabolic health and elucidate posited mechanisms of action of a healthy diet. This new rigorous
evidence will enhance dietary guidelines and shift the paradigm from recommending generalized diets to
adapting guidance according to the biological, psychosocial, and social needs of diverse populations."
10843960,"There is an urgent need to develop novel approaches to target oncogenic transcription factors. Ewing
sarcoma (ES) is emblematic of this need. It has been known for more than 25 years that ES is absolutely
dependent on the EWS-FLI1 transcription factor for cell survival. EWS-FLI1 is the only recurrent mutation of
ES (>20% of tumors) and the dependence of the cells on this protein has been established by multiple
independent studies. Our overarching goal is to identify and clinically translate compounds that inhibit EWS-
FLI1 to improve outcomes for patients with Ewing sarcoma. Consistent with this goal, we have identified the
minor groove DNA binding compound trabectedin as an inhibitor of EWS-FLI1. We have moved this
compound into the clinic in combination with low dose irinotecan and have seen striking clinical responses.
However, some patients progress while on therapy. Other patients have required dose reductions due to
toxicity that limits the efficacy of the therapy. Therefore, in this study, we propose that a deeper understanding
of the mechanisms of activity and drug resistance will improve the therapy. We hypothesize that while these
compounds poison EWS-FLI1 by mechanisms that we have defined, they also alter chromatin structure and
cellular state in such a way that poises the cell for recovery. More precisely, we have shown that trabectedin
redistributes EWS-FLI1 in the nucleus to the nucleolus to trigger an epigenetic switch to alter chromatin
accessibility at the EWS-FLI1 driven GGAA microsatellite enhancer. However, here we propose that additional
epigenetic DNA damage response mechanisms, identified by unbiased approaches, leaves the chromatin
poised for recovery. Additionally, we have shown that redistribution of EWS-FLI1 to the nucleolus stabilizes the
fusion protein thus providing a reserve pool that facilitates transcriptional recovery. Therefore, the goal of this
study is to directly target these poised states to improve the activity of the compound, limit toxicity, and restrict
mechanisms of resistance. Importantly, these approaches should improve the toxicity profile because they
focus on EWS-FLI1 which is only found in Ewing sarcoma cells and its downstream GGAA microsatellite
enhancer which has no known function in normal cells. If successful, the study will yield a novel
mechanistically focused combination therapy for relapsed Ewing sarcoma patients that will build on the
preliminary success of trabectedin/irinotecan. In addition, the study will provide important insight into the use of
DNA binding compounds as inhibitors of oncogenic transcription factors. Finally, it will yield a novel “trapping”
approach to target phase transitioned transcription factors."

 Cognitive decline in Lewy body dementias [Parkinson’s Disease Dementia (PDD) and Dementia with Lewy
Bodies (DLB); a category of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD)], causes significant functional
impairment and does not respond well to existing treatments. Perhaps the greatest challenge for developing
effective treatments is the lack of a mechanistic understanding of the key events driving pathophysiology.
Increasing evidence suggests that a perturbed gut microbiome (dysbiosis) driven by a bloom in sulfate reducing
bacteria and increased intestinal permeability may be key mechanisms driving disease pathogenesis in Lewy
body diseases. There is a need to evaluate whether these factors are present early in the disease course and
associated with known disease processes, such as midbrain degeneration and clinical outcomes. Idiopathic
REM Sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), is one of the earliest and most specific prodromal indicators of Lewy body
diseases as up to 96.6% of iRBD patients will progress to an alpha-synucleinopathy at 14 years follow up. This
population therefore provides an opportunity to conduct a novel evaluation of the presence of a bloom in
SRB/dysbiosis and increased intestinal permeability early in the disease and whether these mechanisms are
associated with known disease processes (increases in α-synuclein, midbrain degeneration and clinical
outcomes). The proposed project will conduct a prospective, cross-sectional study to test the hypothesis that
abnormal lactulose breath tests with elevated H2S concentration (as a marker of dysbiosis and a bloom of SRB
in the gut) are present at prodromal stages of the disease and associated with increases in markers of increased
intestinal permeability and microbial translocation of lipopolysaccharide (total bacterial 16S rRNA gene and
lipopolysaccharide binding protein; LBP), known disease processes (plasma concentration of α-synuclein, MRI
biomarkers of integrity of SNc and LC) and clinical outcomes. We will recruit prodromal (iRBD), symptomatic
Lewy body disease patients (PD and DLB) and HC to evaluate our hypotheses. Consistent with several
objectives outlined in PAR-22-211, the completion of the proposed project will advance our mechanistic
understanding of the effects of a boom in SRB/dysbiosis, potentially identifying targets for disease modifying
treatments. Should our results determine an important role of gut SRB bloom/dysbiosis in the pathophysiology
of Lewy body diseases, these measurements could be incorporated into routine clinical practice to screen for
emerging pathogenic processes. Notably, many potential treatments targeting the microbiome are readily
available and subsequent clinical trials can evaluate whether interventions targeting a bloom in SRB/dysbiosis
could be used to intervene before overt motor and cognitive symptoms develop."
10915606,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Microglia are phagocytic cells that play multiple critical roles in retinal development and ocular diseases. In
parallel, they display remarkable diversity in their functional and molecular states. This suggests that a diverse
portfolio of microglial subtypes is needed in the retina, but the molecules that link microglia state to their function
remain unknown. The objective here is to identify molecular and cellular mechanisms that specify microglia state
changes in the retina. The central hypothesis is that microglia phagocytic states are specified by neurons via a
particular neuron-derived receptor-ligand pair – signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα) and CD47. This receptor-
ligand pair constitutes a key “don’t eat me” anti-phagocytic signal in microglia. Preliminary data surprisingly show,
however, that neuron-derived SIRPα is also crucial for regulating microglial phagocytic function and phagocytic
state. Neuronal SIRPα appears to achieve this by acting as a decoy receptor to prevent microglial CD47-SIRPα
signaling, thereby permitting microglia phagocytosis during retinal development. To understand the mechanisms
by which microglia phagocytic states are specified, and to test the neuronal SIRPα-CD47 signaling hypothesis,
three Specific Aims are proposed. First, we will determine when and how neuronal SIRPα alters microglia
diversity and plasticity. These studies will establish whether neuronal SIRPα alters microglia state by
regulating their maturation or by post-developmental changes. Second, we will define how microglia
reconcile conflicting cues that promote different physiological states. These experiments will causally
establish the relationship between ‘eat me’ and ‘don’t eat me’ cues during microglia state selection. Third, we
will Identify developmental events that depend on SIRPα-driven microglial state changes. This aim will
define functional consequences of microglial state changes driven by neuronal SIRPα. In particular, we will test
whether astrocyte death depends on neuronal SIRPα signaling, a hypothesis supported by our preliminary data.
This work will be significant because identification of a neuron-derived mechanism that dictates microglia state
plasticity is unexpected. Thus, completion of this work will change the way we understand how developmental
signals program microglia outcomes. This study will also lay the groundwork for new therapeutic options to
modify retina microglia state and function."

The ""NexGen"" 7 Tesla MRI scanner at UC Berkeley is a unique resource that we wish to make available for
neuroscience collaborations across the globe. It was specifically designed for extremely high resolution
structural and functional neuroimaging at the scale of cortical laminae and columnar neurocircuit organization
(""meso-scale""). To achieve this, the NexGen scanner builds upon existing standard 7T scanners and
integrates a number of technological advances, creating synergistic improvements and gains in speed,
resolution and signal. Such advances include: currently the highest performance one-of-a-kind head-only
magnetic gradient coil designed to safely create more signal at faster time scales (higher gradient amplitudes
and slew rates without peripheral nerve stimulation; PNS), high-density receiver array coils (e.g. up to 128
channel receive array integrated into a 7T) that enable unprecedented spatial resolution and image-forming
accelerations. As part of this collaborative endeavor, we will be creating novel advances in pulse sequences
for novel neuroscientific applications imaging to take advantage of the scanner hardware’s higher
performance. The scanner has been validated in reproducible mesoscale fMRI studies using GE-EPI and
VASO fMRI at isotropic resolutions between 0.39 mm and 0.6 mm, that is a 4.6 to 23-fold higher volumetric
resolution over typical 1 mm isotropic resolution in fMRI on conventional 7T scanners. The stronger gradients
offer considerable improvements in diffusion imaging reaching higher b-values with shortened TEs. These
hardware advances also enable larger areas of brain coverage, higher temporal resolutions and reduced
distortions at mesoscale resolutions. Thus, with the NexGen 7T, meso-scale neuroscience experiments can
be greatly expanded from traditional zoomed, small volume imaging approaches. Such a one-of-a-kind
instrument has great potential to continue to advance the field and will be optimally used by a diverse group
of neuroscientists and clinician scientists. Funding of the current U24 proposal would facilitate engineering
and scientific personnel to support and maintain the use of the scanner; enables efficient data transfer and
analysis, as well as the subject recruitment, user training and guidance of scientific collaborations nationally
and internationally. While the main goal of this project is to provide an innovative resource for higher
granularity in functional and structural human brain research, the research resource also holds potential for
better understanding neurological diseases, such as Epilepsy, Alzheimer’s and mental disorders."

 Metastatic breast cancer in the brain is a deadly disease and the second most tumor incidence in the
central nervous system. Although improvement of cancer treatments with targeted and immunotherapies have
made some cancer curable, these new advancements and therapeutics have not been able to benefit breast
cancer patients with brain metastasis primarily due to blood brain barrier (BBB). Recently, fatty acid synthase
(FASN), the sole cytosolic enzyme responsible for de-novo synthesis of palmitate, was shown to upregulate in
breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) but not in metastatic breast cancer in other organs and its inhibition
limited breast cancer growth in the brain. Although FASN as a target has been established and inhibitors
targeting FASN have been identified, no therapeutics targeting FASN have been approved for cancer treatments
due to various reasons including toxicity and bioavailability. In attempting to repurpose FDA-approved drugs to
overcome the past hurdles in targeting FASN, we recently showed that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), approved
for treating digestive disorders, effectively bind to and inhibit FASN. They also prohibit breast cancer cell
proliferation in a laboratory study. In a phase II trial of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients,
supplementation of a PPI, omeprazole, at high dose (80 mg/day) inhibited FASN activity in the tumors and nearly
doubled the pathological complete response with the standard of care neoadjuvant AC-T (Adriamycin
cyclophosphamide-taxane) chemotherapy. It is also noteworthy that PPIs have been shown to be BBB
permeable and have neuroprotective effects, providing an opportunity to develop PPIs as BCBM therapeutics
targeting FASN. The long-term goal of this line of research is to eliminate metastatic breast cancer mortality by
repurposing PPIs targeting FASN. The overall hypotheses to be tested in this explorative phase are that FASN
protects BCBM by up-regulating DNA damage repair activity against excessive oxidative stress-induced DNA
damage in the brain and that PPIs could be developed as BCBM therapeutics by targeting FASN to elicit
oxidative stress-induced cancer cell death in the brain. To this end, we will accomplish two specific aims to (1)
determine the molecular mechanism of FASN function in regulating repair of DNA damages induced by oxidative
stress and (2) repurpose PPIs to treat BCBM by targeting FASN. We trust that the successful outcome of this
explorative study will reveal a novel mechanism on how FASN protects breast cancer cells in the brain and
provide preliminary data on targeting FASN by repurposing PPIs that will enable us to conduct a full-scale study.
The positive outcome may also lead to a clinical trial testing PPIs on breast cancer patients with brain metastasis,
which will immediately and profoundly impact the BCBM treatment landscape."

therapeutic vaccination against HIV (OmiT-HIV), will use samples from human clinical trials and
synergistic non-human primate studies to ask how therapeutic HIV vaccines can best elicit effective T-

has a strong multidisciplinary and international character, established by a team of expert PIs who are
longstanding collaborators and have access to unique human cohorts and novel approaches to therapeutic
vaccination of non-human primates. Such diversity, including geographic diversity, requires a strong
administrative structure to promote synergy between the programmatic elements by facilitating regular,
structured communication. This Administrative Core will provide overall organizational structure for the
Program Project, perform administrative functions, interface with NIH/NIAID staff, foster cooperation between
projects and with the Data Management and Analysis Core, encourage criticism and advice from its scientists
and ESAB, promote fiscal responsibility, and assure the continued excellence of the Project and its ability to
address the Specific Aims.
The Administrative Core will be based at UC Davis and led by Dr. Hartigan-O’Connor, one of the project’s two
MPIs. Dr. Hartigan-O’Connor previously led the administrative core for the RETIRE-HIV P01 at UC Davis,
which engaged many of the same personnel and performed similar functions. He is also co-PI of the large
U42 grant funding the Nonhuman Primate Testing Center for the NIH’s Somatic Cell Genome Editing

projects such as this. The Core’s organization is supplemented by administrators, specialists, the External
Scientific Advisory Board, and an Internal Steering Committee.
The specific aims of the Administrative Core are:
1. Provide an organizational and programmatic structure to promote scientific excellence.
2. Provide organizational and financial oversight and future planning, establish decision-making processes, set

Most older adults (~60 years of age) have some signs of osteoarthritis (OA) in their joints. Unfortunately, there
are no disease-modifying therapies for OA due to our lack of insight into the underlying pathophysiology. GH is
an FDA approved drug to treat certain diseases such as growth hormone deficiency (GHD). Additionally, GH
secretion decreases over time, causing some older adults to consider the use of GH replacement as a means to
counteract aging related conditions. However, over-production or prolonged usage of GH has been reported to
have many side effects including joint degeneration and joint pain. Identifying the mechanisms by which GH
causes joint cell dysfunction during aging could inform effective interventions and therapeutic strategies that
reduce the incidence and impact of OA. Our preliminary studies have shown that over-expression of GH gene
in mice predispose mice into progressive joint degeneration, while blocking GH action through systemic GH
receptor disruption protect mice from developing OA. We showed that GH robustly altered the metabolism of
cells (i.e, chondrocytes) in cartilage. Yet, it is still unknown if blocking GH’s action specifically on cartilage tissue
would be protective. Guided by our preliminary data and the literature, we will investigate this question via three
specific aims: Aim 1. Determine how blocking GH action on cartilage through cartilage specific deletion of GHR
affects OA development; Aim 2. Determine the mechanisms by which GH promotes chondrocyte hypertrophic
changes and OA development. Aim 3. Determine if GH receptor antagonism (GHa) protects mice from
developing OA. Well-established mouse models GH over-expression and GH receptor tissue specific deletion
will be used to examine the consequences of enhancing or inhibiting GH action in cartilage on OA pathology. In
vivo and in vitro metabolic profiling methods will be leveraged to determine the effects of manipulating GH
signaling on chondrocyte cellular metabolism. Last but not least, a unique mouse model that was used for
discovery of Pegvisomant, an FDA approved drug for treating acromegaly, will be used to test if blocking GH is
beneficial for joint health. Successful completion of this research is expected to provide more comprehensive
understanding of how GH affects joint cell functions, offering the potential to provide new therapeutic targets for
OA treatment."

 1 Tuberculosis (TB), caused by infection with the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a leading
 2 cause of mortality due to infection, globally. In 2019, 10 million people were newly diagnosed with TB and 1.5
 3 million people died from the disease. As efforts to treat TB expand, the prevalence of infections caused by
 4 drug-resistant Mtb
 5 is increasing, in part due to the long duration (6 months) of combination therapy (4 antibiotics) for drug-sensitve
 6 TB (DS-TB), which results in poor compliance. Treatment for DR-TB is even longer, ranging from 6-24 months
 7 typically, with 3, 4 or more antibiotics taken in combination. Despite the dire need for new treatments against
 8 DR-TB, only one new antibiotic for TB with an entirely novel mechanism of action (MoA) has been approved in
 9 the past 40 years, bedaquiline. Therefore, new classes of drugs with new MoAs that can be combined with
10 existing or new TB drugs in the pipeline are desperately needed. The success of bedaquiline, which disrupts
11 energy metabolism in Mtb and has shown promise in reducing treatment times for DR-TB, has accompanied
12 an explosion of drug discovery targeting respiration in Mtb. Fimbrion is developing a thienopyrimidine small

14 electron transport chain in Mtb, has been validated as a drug target by the early clinical success of the QcrB
15 inhibitor, Q203, which is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials, but has potential liabilities. Our goal in this project is
16 to develop a best-in-class QcrB inhibitor that could become part of a shorter drug regimen that effectively treats
17 both DS- and DR-TB. Initially in our Phase I project, we had examples of some very potent compounds, but
18 metabolic stability was poor. Our Phase I goals, therefore, were to optimize stability, while maintaining or
19 improving potency, so that we could test lead compounds in an animal model of Mtb infection. We achieved
20 this goal, identifying a lead THP series of stable QcrB inhibitors with low nM potency, favorable PK properties,
21 including oral bioavailability, and demonstrated in vivo efficacy in a mouse model of acute TB infection. In our
22 Phase II project, we will optimize our lead series with the goal of identifying and de-risking a clinical candidate
23 molecule that is effective in treating TB. Specifically, we will 1) further optimize our lead series to improve drug-
24 like properties and pharmacokinetics, while maintaining or improving our current in vitro potency and in vivo
25 efficacy; 2) investigate: i) the efficacy of lead compounds against diverse Mtb stains and under clinically
26 relevant conditions, ii) the risk of resistance, iii) potential in vitro synergy with other anti-Mtb drugs, and iv) in
27 vitro toxicity and potential adverse drug-drug interactions; and 3) test advanced lead compounds for efficacy in
28 clinically relevant mouse models of TB disease and assess in vivo PK and toxicity in larger mammals to select
29 and de-risk a clinical candidate. Successful completion of this project will lead to the identification of a clinical

Survival and growth of cancer cells depend on environmental cues delivered by cell contact and soluble factors.
These shape disease biology and aggressiveness, reflected by the effectiveness of therapeutic regimens in
blocking trophic inputs. This principle is exemplified in the relatively common and still incurable chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a disease of clonal CD5+ B cells requiring ongoing signaling from membrane
receptors and cells within the tumor microenvironment. While considerable information has been gleaned about
the bi-directional dialogue between CLL B cells and autologous T cells, little information is available about
individual T-cell subsets, particularly Th17 cells, a unique subset of T helper cells. The scientific premise of
this proposal comes from our findings that in CLL: [1] higher levels of Th17-related cytokines and numbers of
circulating Th17 cells associate with better clinical outcomes; [2] leukemic B cells promote Th17 generation from
autologous CD4 T cells in vitro; [3] expression of miR155, which promotes Th17 cell differentiation, is significantly
higher in Th17 cells from CLL patients than in healthy subjects; [4] Th17 cells modulate CLL B-cell survival and
growth in vitro and in vivo; and [5] treatment of naïve CLL T cells from CLL patients with the PI3K inhibitor
idelalisib, significantly enhances Th17-cell generation. These findings underlie our central hypothesis that CLL
B cells promote the generation of Th17 cells, which exert anti-tumor effects within the leukemic compartment.
We expect that enhancing idelalisib's ability to positively affect Th17 generation and function will significantly
improve its clinical value. Our long-range goal is to define this cellular bi-directional communication more clearly
at the molecular level, so as to manipulate these interactions to therapeutic advantage. To advance our
hypotheses and goal, we propose studies to: elucidate cellular and molecular mechanism(s) whereby leukemic
B cells regulate Th17 cell generation in CLL, focusing on the STAT3/miR155 pathway (Aim 1); determine the
influence of Th17 cells on leukemic B-cell survival, growth and maturation in vitro and in vivo (Aim 2) and
investigate the effects of idelalisib on Th17-cell generation and function in CLL (Aim 3). The proposed work is
innovative as it is the first to explore underlying mechanisms by which leukemic B cells regulate the generation
and function of Th17 cells and the impact this regulation has on clinical outcome; it is also the first study of
genome-wide miR expression in T cells from CLL patients. Also, these innovative studies will have considerable
impact on CLL, since we will identify mechanisms generating Th17s in CLL and the impact this T-cell subset has
on leukemic B cell growth, proliferation and maturation. Finally, we will determine if lower Th17-cell numbers in
CLL patients with poor outcomes results from inherent differences in the CLL T or B cells. This will serve to better
inform future studies on how to enhance Th17 responses in CLL as a therapeutic modality achieved by targeted
drug therapy or adoptive immunotherapy."

We propose a new coil array that will enable next-generation causal brain mapping with unprecedented flexibility,
resolution and precision. The proposed ARES2 hybrid array generates E-fields in the cortex for transcranial mag-
netic stimulation (TMS) as well as B-fields for spatial and diffusion encoding applications including high-resolu-
tion, high b-value diffusion MRI and fMRI. Multi-channel TMS allows different cortical targets to be probed either
sequentially or simultaneously, providing a flexible tool for modulating brain activity that is imaged concurrently
with MRI. By virtue of their close proximity to the head, the coil elements will provide a large boost in diffusion
MRI encoding in the cortex beyond what is possible with current MRI gradient technology, enabling improved
sensitivity to mapping neuronal and dendritic sizes and their distribution following targeted neuromodulation and
providing sub-millimeter spatial resolution for BOLD-fMRI in the cortex following stimulation.
 In Aim1, we will test a 3-channel prototype of the proposed head array, ARES2 (Array for Reception, Encoding,
Shimming, and Stimulation) by leveraging our recent developments in MR-compatible transcranial magnetic
stimulation (TMS) coils. The coils will be driven by large currents to yield 1000 mT/m max. gradients and high
slew rates. The parallel design comprising 48 encoding coils permit B0-shimming capability, while 28 radiofre-
quency coils interlaced with the encoding coils provide parallel imaging. Custom drive amplifiers and switching
electronics will allow alternation between “stimulation” and “imaging” modes. A comprehensive electronic control
system will allow arbitrary waveforms to be played out on all channels in sync with the scanner’s pulse sequence.
 In Aim2, we will scale the system up to the full 48-ch array. We build a new TMS-compatible 28-ch RF receive
array that is mechanically integrated with a TMS probe holder device. The TMS probe holder will allow radial
adjustment of the TMS probe to allow it to be placed against the head surface.
 In Aim3, we will apply the system in vivo to perform next-generation causal brain mapping at submillimeter
resolution. We will demonstrate ARES2’s ability to provide regionally specific measures of cell body (soma) and
neurite size and density in the motor (M1) and somatosensory cortex (S1). These diffusion MRI experiments will
make use of gSlider volumetric diffusion encoding to boost SNR and reach submillimeter resolution. For TMS-
fMRI, we will use the 9ch TMS and 48ch MRI gradient system in an interleaved manner for successive stimulation
and fMRI recording in M1 and S1."

This proposal aims to develop the first potent and specific antagonists of the pro-mutagenic effects of APOBEC
DNA deaminase enzymes in cells. Access to whole genome sequences has helped reveal common mutational
signatures across various cancers. One such prominent mutational signature, termed SBS2, includes
hypermutated clusters containing a high density of C to T/G substitutions on the same strand, a phenomenon
known as kataegis. These features, in addition to the enrichment of the mutations in 5’-TC motifs, point to a
causative role for APOBEC3 (A3) family enzymes. While these enzymes normally mutate and restrict
retroviruses or retroelements, studies have confirmed that two family members, APOBEC3A (A3A) and
APOBEC3B (A3B), have a prominent role in pathological mutagenesis targeting the host genome. The relative
contributions of each enzyme remain a matter of vigorous debate, as genetic approaches specifically targeting
A3A or A3B are limited by their high homology to one another and juxtaposition on the genome. Furthermore,
no molecular tools currently exist that can disrupt A3 function. There is therefore a pressing need for molecular
probes that can either inhibit or deplete A3 enzymes from cells. This proposal builds on the hypothesis that
insights into the mechanism and substrate selectivity of A3 enzymes can be leveraged to design potent and
specific antagonists. Specifically, we have demonstrated that mechanism-based inhibitor moieties can be
presented in preferred secondary structures and engineered into exonuclease-resistant DNA molecules to yield
potent nanomolar inhibitors of A3A. These molecules present the opportunity for facile functionalization, which
can be utilized to convert classical inhibitors into molecules capable of inducing the catalytic degradation of the
target APOBEC enzymes in cells, via an unprecedented combination of nucleic acid inhibitors and proteasome
targeting (PROTAC) technology. Taken together, this proposal aims to fill a critical gap in the field by introducing
tools to perturb APOBEC function in cells in order to reveal their underlying biology and offer a roadmap for
potential therapeutics."
