10837212,"The goal of the Data Management and Biostatistics Core (DMBC) is to create and maintain an autonomous and
self-sufficient data coordinating center to support optimal design, conduct and analysis of the malaria research
carried out within the Malawi ICEMR network. Specifically, the Core will update and upgrade the current network;
maintain and continue to develop a secure Data Management System based on REDCap, ODK and a Health
and Demographics Surveillance System (HDSExplorer); develop a more comphrehensive and reliable sample
tracking system; extend and intensify monitoring of study conduct and data quality; increase the capacity to
provide biostatistics support by conducting statistical analysis for manuscripts and training; enforce and extend
use of secure repositories to file documents and programs; provide mentoring and training to DMBC staff and
The DMBC is housed in the Malaria Alert Centre (MAC) on the campus of the Kamuzu University of Health
Sciences. Staff will regularly visit the health facilities where data will be generated and collected. The Malawi
team will be comprised of a Data Core Leader, two Biostatisticans, two Data Managers, two Data Coordinators,
two Data Entry Clerks, one IT technician, and one Assistant IT Techinician. This team will be supported by an
Advisor with vast experience in epidemiological and biostatistical work.
Data will be collected via passive case detection at health centers, active case detection through a series of
surveys, community and household visits for collection of mosquitoess, and through laboratory assays
(entomological and molecular). All data will be captured directly in computers or on tablets, except clinical data
from health facility registers that will be scanned and subsequently entered into an electronic database. Data
will also be extracted from DHIS2. The integrated system based on REDCap, ODK and HDS Explorer has a
robust search functionality that will facilitate data collectors to identify study subjects promptly and accurately.
An offline GPS system will allow field workers to locate scheduled mosquito capture points. Data will be collected
offline and will be daily transmited to a cloud server. The data capture system has quality assurance
functionalities to prevent data errors during entry and synchronization. The Freezerworks® system will be used
to track samples in the laboratory. In the upcoming years, the DMBC will work on customizing Baobab LIMS as
an alternative open-source solution to replace the Freezerworks® system.
The DMBC will work closely with investigators throughout the whole study cycle to ensure compliance with high
standards of data quality. Design of data capture tools will be supported and quality assurance (QA) reports for
monitoring data quality and study conduct will be automated. Queries will be promptly addressed. A system
developed by the DMBC will conduct QA of qPCR data. Statistical support will be provided for data cleaning and
analysis. In summary, the DMBC will continue to provide comprehensive support to ICEMR projects."
10837213,"Although the global malaria burden declined steadily from 2010 to 2015, progress has since stalled. To combat
this stagnation, novel malaria control interventions have been introduced. New long-lasting insecticidal nets
(LLINs) have been developed to ameliorate the problem of increasing insecticide resistance. The newly approved
RTS,S vaccine is now being given in Malawi during the first two years of life, when disease is most severe and
potentially life threatening. Measuring the combined impact of these two interventions on the full spectrum of
malaria epidemiology (P. falciparum infection, uncomplicated clinical malaria, severe malaria disease), will
provide new information on the real-world effectiveness of both interventions, and enhance understanding of the
interplay of exposure and development of naturally acquired immunity. In this project, we will take advantage of
unique access to sites where programmatic RTS,S vaccination has been on-going for five years, and mass
distribution of dual-AI LLINs will also occur. We will build on the evaluation framework of the WHO-sponsored
RTS,S implementation trial, our prior ICEMR studies, and links to detailed entomologic surveillance in the
Transmission project. Using enhanced surveillance data from health centers and hospitals, we will quantify the
population-level effects of RTS,S vaccination and dual-AI LLINs at scale. Longitudinal and case-control data will
support more detailed investigation of individual-level impacts. All data collection will flank the 2026 dual-AI LLIN
mass distribution campaign to facilitate analysis on the effects. Investigations are proposed in 3 Aims: 1) To
measure changes in uncomplicated clinical malaria incidence, we will determine the overall and age-specific
incidence of clinical malaria using enhanced health center surveillance in health centers where RTS,S vaccine
became available in 2019, in 2022, and where vaccine has not been introduced. 2) To evaluate the impact of
RTS,S vaccination and dual-AI LLINs on P. falciparum infection and transmission, we will conduct repeated
household-based community surveys in the catchment areas of health centers with varied access to RTS,S
vaccination. Thereby, we will assess vaccine timeliness and coverage and measure prevalence of Pf infection
and gametocytemia in children aged 6-months to 10-years. 3) To assess changes in the epidemiology of severe
malaria in response to RTS,S vaccination, we will conduct hospital surveillance to measure population-level and
age-group specific incidence, and use a case-control study to quantify individual-level outcomes based on
verified vaccine status. These population and individual-level results will characterize the epidemiologic
consequences of the new interventions and be used to model their public health value at the national level.
Results will provide new insights into the effectiveness of the RTSS,S vaccine in combination with dual-AI LLINs
to prevent Pf infection, uncomplicated clinical malaria, and severe disease in the target age group, and its
potential impact on older children. Ultimately, our results will help determine the potential contribution of these
two new interventions in reestablishing progress toward malaria control and eventual elimination."
10837214,"SUMMARY – PROJECT 2
Vector control, the mainstay of malaria prevention over the past few decades, has recently become less effective
due in part to expanding insecticide resistance and changing mosquito behaviors involving more outdoor and
early-evening/dawn biting. We have designed studies with the overall goal of understanding and overcoming the
limitations of the current vector control strategies for further reductions of the burden of malaria globally, and
specifically in Malawi. First, we will assess the effects of vector control interventions on population patterns of
two important malaria parasite vectors, Anopheles funestus and An. arabiensis, in environmentally diverse sites
with different transmission intensities, using a robust dataset from historical and prospective household-level
vector sampling (Aim 1). Statistical models will also assess whether National Malaria Control Program sentinel
surveillance sites are adequately representative and informative for evaluating vector control interventions
nationwide. In another set of household-level studies, we will use human-landing catch methods to quantify the
time of day and indoor/outdoor location when Anopheles species-specific biting behavior is occurring in different
socio-ecological settings and seasons. We will then characterize the contribution of differences in the observed
vector biting patterns to Plasmodium falciparum transmission (Aim 2), using concurrent measures of people's
activity patterns, bed net use, infection status, and malaria incidence rate in coordination with the Epidemiology
Project of this ICEMR Program. We expect these analyses will identify policy-relevant risks that could tailor
implementation of existing vector control tools. These first two Aims, combined with the studies proposed in the
Epidemiology Project, will provide a valuable multidisciplinary evaluation of the current malaria prevention tools
used in Malawi. Our third Aim is designed to inform the development of potential future malaria prevention tools.
In these proposes studies, we will assess the transmission-blocking activity of novel antimalarial compounds
targeting mosquitoes under field-like conditions (Aim 3). All experiments will use field-derived, insecticide-
resistant An. funestus and An. arabiensis mosquitoes, and P. falciparum parasites currently circulating in Malawi.
We will initially assess compound uptake and stability under laboratory conditions and quantify P. falciparum
infection in mosquitoes exposed to treated net material, either with the novel compounds alone or in combination
with the insecticide deltamethrin. Additional experiments will be conducted using a screened-in experimental hut
setup, which will provide results under field-like conditions. Results will be incorporated into a mathematical
model of malaria transmission to evaluate the potential public health impact of antimalarial-treated nets. Taken
together, the proposed research program is designed to identify components of current malaria intervention
strategies that may limit their long-term effectiveness, while also assessing opportunities for improved strategies
through enhanced vector surveillance and novel interventions with unique mechanisms of action."
10830363,"The number of people suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) is steadily rising and current treatments only
provide minor symptom amelioration. Results from recent clinical trials targeting amyloid-β (Aβ) production or
clearance were disappointing, prompting a reexamination of approaches to AD treatment. Brains from AD
patients exhibit accumulation of ceramide, a signaling molecule and an integral component of exosomal
membranes. One major source of ceramide is through the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin catalyzed by neutral
sphingomyelinase 2 (nSmase2). Even though transient increases in ceramide through nSMase2 upregulation
are part of normal brain functioning, experimental evidence indicates that chronic nSMase2 upregulation results
in negative effects including neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Recent studies implicate nSMase2 in both
Aβ aggregation and tau protein propagation through exosome secretion from glial cells. Moreover, inhibition of
exosome synthesis by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of nSMase2 was shown to block Aβ aggregation
and tau propagation in both in vitro and in vivo AD models, thus opening a new avenue for AD therapeutics.
Unfortunately, there are no clinically useful nSMase2 inhibitors. Current inhibitors are weak (µM-mM) with poor
physicochemical properties and/or limited brain penetration. In collaboration with NCATS we carried out a human
nSMase2 high throughput screen (HTS) of >350,000 compounds. Filtering and analysis of HTS hits led to
discovery of 2,6-dimethoxy-4-(5-phenyl-4-(thiophen-2-yl)-1H-imidazol -2-yl) phenol (DPTIP) the first nM inhibitor
(IC50 = 30 nM). DPTIP was found to be selective and capable of dose-dependently inhibiting exosome release
in glial cultures. Unfortunately, in vivo DPTIP exhibited rapid clearance resulting in a short half-life (t1/2< 0.5h)
and had poor oral bioavailability (F<5%). Structural modifications (~200 analogs synthesized by our group) have
not led to substantial improvements. Given its significant clinical potential, we propose to address the
pharmacokinetic limitations by utilizing dendrimer nanoparticles to deliver DPTIP selectively to activated glial
cells in the brain. Our team discovered that systemically-administered hydroxyl-terminated poly(amidoamine)
(PAMAM) dendrimers (~4 nm in size) target activated glia in the injured brain, without the need for targeting
ligands, showing minimal uptake in healthy brains. While the dendrimers are endocytosed and retained by
activated glial cells in the brain maintaining exposure for >2 weeks, they are rapidly cleared from the periphery
(plasma t1/2 ~ 6-24 h). We have validated the brain targeting, safety, and efficacy in multiple small and large
animal models, and are in Phase 1 clinical trials with our first dendrimer product (D-NAC in childhood
cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy). Herein, we propose to synthesize and evaluate the in vivo
pharmacokinetics and target engagement of two differently sized dendrimers conjugated to DPTIP (D-DPTIP)
following peroral administration. The optimal conjugate assessed by brain imaging, LC/MS bioanalysis, and
functional inhibition of glial nSMase2 activity will be tested for efficacy and safety in two established mouse
models of AD. We have assembled a highly experienced team with expertise in dendrimer nanoparticles
(Rangaramanujam), pharmacokinetics, biomarkers and target engagement studies (Rais) and
pharmacology, drug discovery and clinical translation (Slusher)."
10839819,"New world hemorrhagic fever arenaviruses (NWAs), such as Junín virus, are rodent-transmitted
viruses that cause ~30% mortality when they zoonose into humans. The mechanism by the NWAs
induce disease is still not certain, although it likely includes induction of high levels of cytokines
by infected sentinel cells of the immune system, leading to endothelia and thrombocyte
dysfunction and neurological disease. Survivors of Junín infection develop strong humoral
immune responses, suggesting that controlling infection at early times post-infection is critical for
virus clearance. Although an effective Junín virus vaccine has decreased disease incidence,
sporadic cases of this as well as the other known and novel NWAs for which there are no vaccines
or effective therapeutics still occur. It is well-established that the clade B pathogenic NWAs bind
to transferrin receptor 1 and other receptors on the cell surface, but the steps leading to their entry
from an acidic cellular compartment are not well-determined. We recently performed a siRNA
screen with pseudotyped viruses bearing a pathogenic Junín glycoprotein with the goal of finding
host genes involved in entry that could serve as therapeutic targets. We found that TRIM2, a
member of the tripartite motif family that includes well-known members of the host's intrinsic
defense against viral infections, limits NWA endocytosis into cells. By probing the TRIM2
interactome for other host proteins that block NWA infection, we discovered that SIRPA, a cell
surface protein that inhibits macrophage phagocytosis of tumor and dead cells and erythrocytes,
also decreases infection. Importantly, SIRPA, unlike TRIM2, inhibits infection by various human
pathogenic viruses that require trafficking to an acidic compartment, including VSV, Zika virus,
LCMV and Ebola and SARS-Cov-2 pseudoviruses. Our data suggest that TRIM2 and SIRPA act
at the viral entry/internalization step. These finding suggests that there are common mechanisms
that regulate virus endocytosis and phagocytosis.
 We propose here to further investigate the overlap between virus-mediated endocytosis
and phagocytosis in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo in three aims that will 1) investigate the overlap in
the NWA entry and phagocytosis pathways; 2) determine where TRIM2/SIRPA inhibition of
infection occurs; and 3) use TRIM2, SIRPA and other relevant knockout mice to probe the roles
of these proteins in cell-type specific and in vivo infection by replication-competent NWAs. In
addition to providing mechanistic insight into the entry of NWAs into cells, these studies have the
potential of increasing our understanding as to how host factors limit infection and could lead to
new approaches to therapeutic intervention."
10845092,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - CANCER RESEARCH TRAINING AND EDUCATION COORDINATION
(CRTEC)
A central mission of the University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCCCC) is to support
the career development of aspiring and experienced cancer researchers, physicians, and professionals. The
Cancer Research Training and Education Coordination (CRTEC) component of the UCCCC plays a critical role
in integrating and centralizing cancer-focused educational and professional development activities across the
institution. The aims of CRTEC are aligned with the stages of the cancer research career continuum, and our
CRTEC initiatives seek specifically to engage trainees at the high school, undergraduate, graduate/medical
school, postgraduate/postdoctoral, and faculty levels. We are particularly committed to supporting the career
ambitions of individuals from populations underrepresented in biomedicine, a focus that is especially important
given the communities we serve throughout our catchment area. To extend our reach and the success of our
efforts, we have engaged in productive partnerships within the UCCCC, across the University, and with local
schools, institutions, and community organizations. To coordinate cancer-based training and mentoring at all
levels across the University, CRTEC leverages existing infrastructure to develop and integrate a wide range of
activities. Specific strengths and unique aspects of CRTEC initiatives include: (1) a multifaceted approach to
supporting researchers across their career trajectories; (2) strong partnerships with key institutions across
Chicago (with particular focus on our neighboring South Side communities), including institutions of higher
learning and diverse high schools; (3) an exceptional leadership and mentoring team of highly dedicated and
experienced individuals to execute our portfolio of programs; and (4) ongoing and expanding integration with the
Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) and the Plan to Enhance Diversity (PED) components of the
UCCCC. During the current funding period, the UCCCC invested significant resources to: (1) integrate
institutional cancer-focused training and mentoring activities across the career continuum; (2) develop new
pathway programs for high school and college students interested in cancer research careers; (3) enhance
multidisciplinary, specialized training opportunities for graduate students and post-doctoral fellows; (4) focus
career enhancement activities toward greater diversity in the cancer research workforce; and (5) broaden
professional development opportunities for senior fellows and faculty. Our long-term goal, consistent with the
UCCCC Strategic Plan, is the development and integration of innovative career enhancement activities to
nurture the cancer-focused career ambitions of trainees at all levels and to grow a skilled and diverse cancer
research workforce."
10845093,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - PLAN TO ENHANCE DIVERSITY
Longstanding national efforts aimed at increasing diversity in the biomedical workforce have had only
incremental impact. Similarly, we recognize that the racial demographics of the University of Chicago Medicine
Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCCCC) are not reflective of either our catchment area or the national
population demographics. We are fundamentally committed to changing this characteristic, and to this end, in
2021, UCCCC established the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) and launched a 5-year DEI
Strategic Plan that aligns to the Plan to Enhance Diversity (PED) Program and focuses on infrastructure,
people, climate, and community. The goal of the UCCCC PED is to achieve the full potential of diversity in our
cancer workforce by actualizing meaningful and sustainable systemic cultural change, instituting a career
advancement cohort model, establishing strong community networks, and training transformative diverse
scholars who will reduce the burden of cancer. Central to the PED Program is synergizing with Community
Outreach and Engagement Component and the Cancer Research Training and Education Coordination
(CRTEC) Component to build bidirectional partnerships with our local communities because engaging diverse
groups in our basic, clinical, translational, and population research activities accelerates our discoveries and
impacts communities in our catchment area. Along with CRTEC, we are establishing training and mentoring
opportunities to encourage students, post-doctoral fellows, and faculty from diverse backgrounds to expand the
pipeline of cancer researchers. Guided by a logic model, the UCCCC will operationalize three aims to achieve
the PED goals: (1) building environmental capacity to enhance diversity by implementing processes and policies
focused on climate and recruitment in the cancer center; (2) developing career advancement capacity to increase
underrepresented minorities and women in UCCCC leadership; and (3) establishing community networks to
enhance diversity of cancer center staff, members, and leaders. To accelerate the impact of the PED, the
UCCCC has already invested in structural and personnel infrastructure, new initiatives, dedicated financial
resources, and fully integrated DEI into all UCCCC programs and the executive leadership. PED will establish
criteria for monitoring and evaluating progress in diversity. Transformative impact in DEI requires bold steps; the
UCCCC has invested in infrastructure to support transformative change in our Cancer Center and the PED
provides a clear path forward for actualizing the full potential of diversity, equity, and inclusion."
10845094,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Clinical and Experimental Therapeutics (CET) Program is a cohesive, integrated group of 74 members
representing 10 different Departments. The overall goal of the Program is to foster interactions between
basic and clinical investigators with a focus on design and execution of innovative immunologic and
molecular targeting driven trials at all phases of drug development, with the ultimate objective of developing
personalized and effective cancer therapies. As the coordinating arm of clinical/translational research within
the University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCCCC), the CET program interfaces with all
other programs to seamlessly integrate fundamental cancer research with clinical research and care
objectives. The program co-leaders include Chin-Tu Chen, PhD, a laboratory-based scientist with
experience in imaging biomarkers and theranostics; Wendy Stock, MD, MA, a medical oncologist with
expertise in clinical trials and clinical drug development for hematologic malignancies; and Russell
Szmulewitz, MD, a medical oncologist with expertise in therapeutic development and biomarkers for
genitourinary malignancies. Mark Applebaum, MD, a pediatric oncologist with expertise in therapeutics and
biomarkers for pediatric solid tumors contributes as an Assistant Leader. The CET prioritizes and has led
investigator-initiated studies across the different tumor types, especially those with a high mortality,
prevalence, and population disparity in the UCCCC catchment area. CET investigators led 86 investigator-
initiated interventional trials (IITs) and sponsored 45 Investigational New Drugs/Devices during this reporting
period. CET investigators have contributed to important advances in anticancer target validation, predictive
and prognostic biomarkers, and insights into overcoming resistance mechanisms through IITs and
correlative science. CET members have led practice-changing, multi-institutional clinical trials through the
NCTN leadership and multi-center IITs. CET led/co-led UCCCC inter-programmatic working groups,
seminars and CET-sponsored meetings form the intellectual framework for translation of mechanistic
insights that lead to these innovative trials. The specific scientific aims of the CET Program are to: (1)
develop and advance innovative therapeutic drug development and practice-changing clinical trials; (2) test
strategies to optimize drug utilization and develop innovative biomarkers that enhance therapeutic safety,
efficacy, and personalization; (3) elucidate and target mechanisms of drug resistance to enhance precision
therapeutics; and (4) train the next generation of leaders in clinical and translational research through formal
mentoring and career development efforts. Program members are supported by $21.3M in total funding
(DC), with $4.9M in peer-reviewed funding ($3.2M from NCI), and $16.4M in non-peer-reviewed support.
During 2018–2022, Program members authored 1,623 peer-reviewed publications, with 20% inter-
programmatic, 20% intra-programmatic, and 36% in high-impact journals."
10845095,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - CANCER PREVENTION AND CONTROL (CPC)
The mission of the Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC) Program at the University of Chicago Medicine
Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCCCC) is to: (1) promote novel cancer population science discoveries
through interdisciplinary research; (2) develop efficacious and disseminable interventions that prevent
cancer, detect it early, or improve survivorship; and (3) translate this knowledge into clinical and public
health practices that benefits our catchment area and beyond. The CPC program promotes research and
translational efforts with a strong emphasis on fostering collaboration across UCCCC research programs;
training the next generation of scientists; engaging local communities; and supporting diversity, equity, and
inclusion efforts. Reducing or eliminating cancer disparities in our catchment area, nationally, and globally
is an overarching premise across all CPC activities. The CPC Program consists of 38 scientists from 10
Departments across the University, who are supported by strong NIH ($7.6M) funding, including $4.7M from
NCI and have been highly productive during this funding cycle (752 publications, 22% in high-impact
journals). Guided by UCCCC strategic priorities, CPC leaders promote research and collaboration by
organizing working groups and retreats, supporting pilot projects, shaping UCCCC Shared Resources,
contributing to faculty recruitment, and providing mentorship opportunities. Investments support novel CPC-
relevant research infrastructure at the local, national, and international levels, including creation of
demographically and socio-economically diverse cohorts, case-control studies of diverse ancestries, and
biomedical data commons. To continue to build upon and extend the program’s accomplishments, resources,
and expertise, we propose the following complementary aims that span the cancer control continuum. Aim
1: to investigate environmental, lifestyle, genetic, and socio-structural factors to mechanistically understand
how they cause and increase risk of cancer. Aim 2: to develop, test, and implement novel interventions for
primary prevention and early detection of cancer in healthy populations. Aim 3: to assess determinants of
survivorship and develop interventions that (a) optimize delivery of precision oncology, (b) enhance health-
related quality of life, and (c) improve outcomes among cancer survivors. Our aims align with 4 UCCCC’s
Strategic Pillars: (#1) reduce the catchment area’s cancer burden and disparities, (#4) develop novel imaging
modalities to optimize screening, (#6) leverage epigenetics to understand cancer mechanisms, and (#8)
foster inter-programmatic interactions. Guided by these aims and priorities, the collective impact of CPC
members is on a strong, upward trajectory with future plans focused on (1) working with the COE Office to
embed intervention and implementation scientists in healthcare and community settings to ensure strategies
are sensitive to local contexts, and (2) testing novel health communication interventions to enhance
dissemination of CPC discoveries and impact health policies and clinical practice."
10845096,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - IMMUNOLOGY AND CANCER (IC)
Members of the Immunology and Cancer (IC) Program of the University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive
Cancer Center (UCCCC) aim to understand the interface between the host immune system and a malignant
tumor, and to use this knowledge to develop effective immunotherapies for the treatment of a broad array
of cancer types. In addressing our 3 specific aims, program members are making fundamental advances in
the understanding of anti-tumor immunity and immune regulation, bringing new concepts into preclinical
models of anti-tumor immunity, translating fundamental discoveries into clinical applications, and testing
new hypotheses generated from human studies back in murine models. Aim 1 is to elucidate fundamental
immunology concepts that have relevance for the cancer context. In this regard, we have made key
advances regarding the nature of the endogenous T cell response to cancer, the role of the microbiota in
impacting myeloproliferative disease, and novel mechanisms of antigen presentation that direct the priming
of tumor-specific T cells. Aim 2 is to define mechanisms impacting anti-tumor immunity and evaluate novel
treatment strategies in preclinical settings. Here, program members have engineered novel approaches to
reduce the toxicity of checkpoint blockade antibodies, enhance the efficacy of CAR-T-based cellular
therapies, implement potent adjuvant combinations for cancer vaccines, and augment the efficacy of
immunotherapy via manipulation of the microbiota. Aim 3 is to translate fundamental research discoveries
into clinical applications and take new clinical observations back into the laboratory. The program has
developed key collaborations with clinical researchers from the Clinical and Experimental Therapeutics
Program and industry partners to implement numerous interventional immunotherapy clinical trials. Program
current efforts are aided by extensive biobanking, recent expansion of our cGMP facility to include a vector
production lab, and expansion of infrastructure for executing cell therapy studies using T cell products
generated in-house. The IC Program adds considerable value to the UCCCC by fostering an environment
that promotes collaboration, focuses basic research on important cancer-relevant questions, and promotes
the bidirectional transfer of ideas between the laboratory and the clinic. Program leaders have been pivotal
in: (1) the enhancement of tumor immunology research across the UCCCC; (2) the recruitment of senior
and junior immunology investigators to the program; (3) the promotion of collaboration among
immunologists, clinicians, and basic scientists at UCCCC through intra- and inter-programmatic activities;
and (4) the development of the solid tumor cellular therapy program in collaboration with CET leaders in the
Jonas Center for Cellular Therapy. In addition, IC faculty play critical roles in advancing local diversity
initiatives, participating in community educational forums, developing the long-term UCCCC Strategic Plan,
organizing special symposia, and mentoring junior faculty."

10851002,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Schizophrenia is a severe and debilitating psychotic disorder, characterized by disturbances of the basic sense
of self and social disconnection throughout the course of illness. The proposed project aims to elucidate the
impact of self-disturbances in social impairments by focusing on one core aspect of the bodily self, the self-other
boundary. An implicit awareness of clearly defined self-boundary is a prerequisite for adaptive interactions with
the external world. In individuals with schizophrenia, however, a disrupted self-other boundary complicates the
process of distinguishing one’s own behaviors from those of others, thereby undermining social interactions.
Loss of social opportunities often leads to social isolation, which further erodes interpersonal relationships and
exacerbates self-disturbances, setting up a destructive cycle.
Despite the chronicity and prevalence of self-disturbances and social impairments in schizophrenia, common
mechanisms underlying disrupted self-other distinction and social impairments have not been extensively
investigated. One major hurdle has been a lack of methodological tools to quantify the subjective phenomenology
of self-disturbances. We will utilize novel behavioral methods and leverage the technological advances in
immersive virtual reality (VR) to investigate two core aspects of self-other interactions in space: (1) the implicit
multisensory action space around the self that determines one’s self-other boundary (peripersonal space); (2)
the social construct of the interpersonal comfort space (interpersonal distance). To estimate the implicit self-
boundary in our participants, we will implement a basic visuo-tactile integration paradigm in VR adapted from
neurophysiological studies of multisensory neurons in nonhuman primates. To assess the social comfort space
that determines interpersonal distance, we will use the stop-distance paradigm in VR. This approach will allow
us to quantify the self-other boundary in the context of social interactions and link to their neural correlates. We
will specify mechanisms that connect these constructs to identify more precise targets for treatment.
Systematic examination of the peripersonal space and its relation to interpersonal distance regulation may be a
first step towards identifying the role of self-disturbances in components of disrupted social behavior. This project
will utilize mechanisms underlying multisensory integration processes to understand complex social behavior.
Self‐disturbances are common features of a wide range of neuropsychiatric conditions. Indeed, all forms of
psychiatric disorders may be conceptualized as maladies of disrupted social homeostasis between the self and
the social world. Thus, this approach may be broadly applicable across multiple neuropsychiatric conditions that
intersect with self-disorders and social impairments and will contribute towards the goals of the NIMH Research
Domain Criteria (RDoC) strategy."
10850865,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
More than 8 million people are living with HIV in South Africa (SA), including >250,000 women who become
pregnant annually, and >50% of SA women are overweight/obese.1 In SA and globally, Dolutegravir (DTG)-
based antiretroviral therapy (ART) is being scaled up as part of the preferred 1st-line ART regimen. However,
DTG has recently been implicated as an obesogen that is associated with increased weight and adipose tissue
gain compared to other antiretroviral agents.2,3 Obesity in pregnancy is associated with poor health outcomes
for both mother and child4-9 as pregnancy is a critical period during which exposures leading to alterations in
metabolic health may influence not only long-term maternal health but also fetal, neonatal, and ultimately child
health. For women living with HIV (WLHIV) and their children, these exposures are myriad, including HIV/ART,
weight gain, & obesity. The overall goal of our study is to investigate the impact of DTG in pregnancy
and its obesogenic effects on the metabolic health of women living with HIV (WLHIV) and their
children, compared to women without HIV and their children. To address this goal, we will leverage:
(i) existing NIH-funded research infrastructure in SA and (ii) the NIH large R01 mechanism to enroll 1900
pregnant women in the 1st trimester (633 WLHIV initiating DTG in pregnancy, 633 WLHIV continuing DTG use
from pre-pregnancy, and 633 women without HIV) and their children, following them to two years. Within this
cohort, we will first examine how HIV and/or DTG use (HIV/DTG) impacts longitudinal changes in weight and
adipose tissue mass in pregnancy using air displacement plethysmography. We will further investigate
pathways of excess gestational weight gain and adipose accrual by evaluating: a) the balance between caloric
intake and resting energy expenditure, b) markers of systemic and adipose inflammation, gut integrity, and
satiety/hunger, and c) subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) function and homeostasis. Following this, we will go
on to examine how HIV/DTG use in pregnancy and postpartum affects maternal metabolic health postpartum
(postpartum weight retention, adiposity, dysglycemia, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia) as well as neonatal
and child metabolic health (weight, adiposity, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia). To understand whether
signature clusters of metabolites and lipid subspecies are associated with maternal and child metabolic health,
we will apply widely targeted metabolomics techniques to measure maternal (in pregnancy) and cord blood
metabolites, lipid subspecies, and eicosanoids. To address the different specific aims we will use a series of
nested substudies, including smaller nested cohorts and efficient case-cohort designs, within the main cohort.
This study will play a pivotal role in defining the obesogenic mechanisms and clinical consequences of DTG
use in pregnancy in WLHIV and their children. The results of our study will provide insights into metabolic
disease risk reduction in the context of HIV/ART, identify potential targets for interventions, and inform public
health approaches to diminish chronic co-morbidities over the life course for WLHIV and their children."

investigators in women’s reproductive health research. First funded in 2005, our WRHR Program has made
major strides. We have met all of our WRHR benchmarks having successfully trained 10 female Scholars (1
Hispanic and 1 African American) who have published 566 peer-reviewed manuscripts and have received 117
grant awards as PI, including 26 from NIH across 8 Institutes (NICHD, NHLBI, NIMH, NIMHD, NCI, NLM, NIDDK
and NIA). The Department of OBGYN will continue to coordinate and administer the WRHR Program and
leverage the scientific wealth and robust reproductive research infrastructure at Northwestern. The key
leadership at Northwestern continues to make strong institutional commitments to this WRHR Program. Serdar
Bulun, MD, the original Program Director is now the Chair of the Department of OBGYN and PI of this WRHR
renewal. Melissa Simon, MD MPH, the Vice Chair of Clinical Research in the Department is one of our highly
successful original WRHR Scholars and remains as the Research Director. The Blue Ridge Institute ranks our
Department as the fourth highest for OBGYN NIH funding in the U.S. Amongst all U.S. OBGYN Department
faculty members, 6 of our 29 named primary mentors on this application are in the top 50 in NIH OBGYN funding
(Drs. Bulun, Simon, Woodruff, Matei, Chakravarti, and Grobman). Operating large, comprehensive and high-
quality OBGYN residency and fellowship programs, we have an active pool of candidates for WRHR Scholar
selection as we attract some of the best and the brightest residents and fellows. Our WRHR Scholars have an
opportunity to choose among highly competitive clinical research teams or basic and translational science
laboratories conducting research in the areas of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, Oncofertility,
Maternal Fetal Medicine, Gynecologic Oncology, Reproductive Genetics, Family Planning and Contraception,
and Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery. Research methodologies and approaches span a
world class group of mentors and collaborators with areas of expertise ranging from cutting edge basic and
translational techniques to clinical trial and behavioral intervention specialists, psychometricians, biostatisticians,
and experts in a wide range of biomarkers, bio-behavioral, and social science research approaches. The WRHR
Scholars will interact with several Department, Medical School and University-wide Institutes and Centers,
including the Center for Reproductive Science, Institute for Women’s Health Research, Clinical and Translational
Sciences Institute, the Lurie Cancer Center, the Center for Health Equity Transformation, and the Institute for
Public Health and Medicine, which are all home to large scale center/multi-site grants in focused OBGYN areas."

 Despite strong consensus that early, specialized intervention for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder
(ASD) can have a dramatic impact on outcomes, the U.S. health system’s capacity to provide such services is
severely challenged by the rapid rise in ASD prevalence. The long-term goal is to improve outcomes for
children with early signs of ASD by increasing the capacity to provide appropriately specialized treatment
within an existing infrastructure: the Part C Early Intervention (EI) service delivery system. Part C is publicly
funded, available in all areas, and serves children under age 3 who have developmental delays or disabilities.
Currently, the effectiveness of EI services is limited by high practice variation and infrequent use of evidence-
based interventions. The study objective is to improve services and outcomes for children with early signs of
ASD by conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing the effectiveness of training EI providers to
deliver Reciprocal Imitation Training (RIT). RIT is a naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention (NDBI)
that is ideally suited for EI settings because it is low intensity, play-based, easy to learn and implement, and
can be taught to families for their independent use, thus increasing intervention dosage.
 This RCT will employ a hybrid type 1 effectiveness/implementation design, and will use a unique mixed
methods approach to gather evidence that will be essential for implementing RIT at scale, pending positive trial
results. The sample includes 20 EI agencies across 4 U.S. States and comprises a total of 160 EI providers
and 440 families of children with early symptoms of ASD, which not only provides a robust sample size, but
also affords the opportunity to assess generalizability of this approach across regions that vary in their
implementation of Part C services. EI providers will be randomly assigned to the RIT training group (n=80) or
treatment as usual (TAU; n=80). Providers in both groups will identify 2-5 children in their caseload who are
16-30 months old with early symptoms of ASD (n=220 children per group). Intensive, state-of-the art, multi-
method assessment technology will be used to measure the impact of the intervention on children’s language
and social communication, as well as parents’ self-efficacy and well-being. Importantly, this study will examine
putative mechanisms (i.e., child gains in imitation and joint attention; parent contingent responsiveness)
through which the intervention improves clinically-relevant outcomes. Data regarding provider-initiated
modifications to the intervention and delivery will be analyzed to identify fidelity-consistent vs. fidelity-
inconsistent changes, which will inform refinement of future RIT training and quality assurance procedures. In
sum, this study will generate the evidence necessary to implement RIT at scale, thereby increasing the
capacity of the existing EI system to deliver effective, evidence-based intervention to the rapidly growing
population of children who show early signs of ASD."

Misregulation of hematopoietic genes can result in disruption of the production of functionally specialized blood cells. Abnormal DNA methylation, a key epigenetic signature essential in hematopoiesis, is regarded as the hallmark of most hematological malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Unfortunately, the currently approved demethylating agents act indiscriminately on the entire genome and come with a toll of high toxicity and low specificity. Strategies to achieve selective demethylation are therefore needed. The long-term goal of our research is to understand how to develop a highly specific and low toxic approach to correct aberrant DNA methylation in disease states. The central hypothesis is that the establishment of DNA methylation in hematopoiesis is controlled by specialized RNAs, able to bind to the DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) – DNMT1- interacting RNAs (DiRs). DiRs are widespread and prevent DNA methylation and silencing in a locus-specific manner. Specifically, we have shown that the expression of a master regulator of hematopoietic differentiation, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA), is regulated by a DiR originated upstream of the CEBPA gene during the S phase, termed extra-coding (ec)CEBPA. The overall objectives of this proposal are to investigate how ecCEBPA and lineage specific DiRs guide hematopoietic differentiation. The rationale for this project is to demonstrate DiR-mediated regulation of DNA methylation in hematopoiesis. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Define the biological role of ecCEBPA in hematopoietic differentiation; and 2) Define the biological role of DNMT1-interacting RNAs in hematopoietic differentiation. The proposed research is innovative because we will dissect the regulation of DNA methylation in hematopoietic differentiation and uncover the mechanisms underlying the control of cell type-specific methylation patterns. It is significant because we will identify key epigenetic regulators governing the establishment of DNA methylation in hematopoiesis; and lay the foundation for a transformative approach to achieve gene-specific control of this critical epigenetic mark."

Bone fracture is a very common injury, and there has been a dramatic increase in trauma-induced fractures with
the increase in active lifestyle. Despite the regenerative ability of bone, bone injuries often suffer from delayed
healing or non-unions. The prevalence of bone fracture and the cost of repair is on the rise primarily due to aging
of the population. The profound negative impact on the patient’s quality of life and the economic burden of
fracture treatment following trauma or age-related fragility fractures warrants the development of efficient and
cost-effective fracture-healing adjuvants to accelerate the healing rate and improve the quality of healing. The
proposed research focuses on biomaterial-assisted local delivery of adenosine to promote bone healing of aged
bone tissues by rejuvenating the endogenous tissue environment and reparative cells. We hypothesize that local
delivery of adenosine at the injury site will induce a pro-regenerative immune environment and promote
regeneration of aging bone tissues through enhanced osteoblastogenesis and angiogenesis. These hypotheses
will be tested through the following aims. Aim 1 will determine the effect of local delivery of adenosine to promote
bone regeneration in aged mice by using two injury models: transverse tibial fracture and critical-sized segmental
femoral defect. Aim 2 will determine the role of adenosine delivery on immunomodulation leading to enhanced
bone regeneration. Successful completion of the proposed studies will have a significant impact in public health
by establishing a new therapeutic intervention for promoting bone regeneration."

Project Summary/Abstract
This project aims to advance efforts for a nationally integrated food safety system through the
state manufactured food program in Arizona focusing on achieving and maintaining
conformance with the current Manufactured Food Regulatory Program Standards (MFRPS).
Standard conformance will enhance food safety and help reduce potential foodborne illness in
manufactured food plants.
Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) will continue to build the manufactured food
program and work to complete elements listed in the strategic improvement plan to come into
full standard conformance. ADHS has entered into a contract for manufactured food inspections
with the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and will be increasing the inspection load throughout
the overall project timeframe. ADHS is in the process of implementing state manufactured food
rules and regulations that are equivalent to the current code of federal regulations.
The project emphasizes training goals to ensure ADHS and county program staff are well-
trained to perform manufactured food inspections and to ensure the state has adequate staff to
meet contract requirements for manufactured food inspections, particularly as the program
grows. The project also provides opportunities to meet with the local county environmental
health departments to discuss the state manufactured food program, the counties' roles within
the program, the availability of staff training, and the progress in adopting state manufactured
food rules.
ADHS also proposes to enhance its manufactured food program by strengthening its existing
Food Protection Task Force (FPTF). The state currently organizes quarterly FPTF meetings
during which task force members give presentations on effective outbreak investigations or
examples of effective coordination among a variety of stakeholders to protect food, discuss
current local food protection issues, and other topics. In-person meetings with a hybrid option
will be offered moving forward to allow for direct collaboration, but to also include those who are
unable to travel due to distance. The hybrid meeting option will allow greater participation
among stakeholders. The key goals of the FBTF include improving food safety and foodborne
illness education, training, identifying and prioritizing food safety issues, implementing a reliable
network among stakeholders, and to create a platform for information sharing."

The Society for Research on Nicotine & Tobacco (SRNT) is the only scientific association dedicated
exclusively to the support of researchers, academics, treatment professionals, government employees, and
other partners in the field of nicotine and tobacco research. With members in more than 40 countries, SRNT is
truly global in its reach. The SRNT Annual Meeting is the main venue for presentation of novel findings from
global tobacco control research and for networking among scientists in the field. To promote its international
mission, SRNT has a longstanding policy of waiving registration fees and providing travel awards for low- and
middle-income country (LMIC) researchers to ensure representation of global tobacco control science in the
meeting program. The SRNT Global Research Network (GRN) supports SRNT members in LMICs; provides
guidance to the SRNT Board and committees, as necessary, to inform discussions around issues related to
research and researchers in LMICs; and enhances SRNT’s mission by promoting and encouraging sustained
involvement in global tobacco control science. For over a decade, LMIC researchers from across geographic
regions and with extensive research experience and professional networks across LMICs have been GRN
Chairs and have led GRN committees. Despite SRNT’s support, global tobacco control and LMIC-based
science are underrepresented at its annual meeting especially given that 80% of the world’s tobacco users live
in LMICs. Further, the promotion of implementation science is desperately needed to close the critical
implementation gap in global tobacco control. SRNT seeks a conference grant to elevate the visibility of global
tobacco control research and implementation science at the SRNT 2024 Annual Meeting to be held in
Edinburgh, Scotland. This location will allow participation of researchers from regions that typically have less
presence at the annual conference. We will form a GRN Steering Committee to pursue the following specific
aims: 1) Organize a pre-conference workshop and presidential symposium to promote bidirectional learning in
global tobacco control and implementation science; 2) Increase abstract submissions in global tobacco control
science to highlight advances in the area, foster scientific discussion and debate, and stimulate collaboration
among global tobacco control researchers; 3) Offer travel scholarships for LMIC-based researchers presenting
on topics related to the NCI Center for Global Health research priorities; and 4) Support post-conference article
submissions led by LMIC investigators to Nicotine & Tobacco Research (SRNT’s journal) that focus on
implementation science in global tobacco control. Meeting the proposed aims will bolster how the SRNT
annual meeting facilitates bidirectional learning opportunities among LMIC and high-income country (HIC)
investigators working in global tobacco control, building capacity to conduct implementation research that is
relevant and impactful in low resource contexts."

10829439,"Today there are more than 85,000 EPA-registered synthetic chemicals, but only 10% have been tested for
carcinogenicity in animal studies. Of those tested, ~200 have shown evidence of causing cancer and/or an
increase in mammary tumors. However, few of the chemicals have been evaluated in human studies, and results
in humans have been inconclusive. Our study will focus on chemical body burden of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl
substances (PFAS), and concomitant risk of developing invasive breast cancer during the menopausal transition.
These “forever chemicals” are pervasive, enduring, and of high public interest, yet studies of their possible
relationship to breast cancer have been limited. We hypothesize that elevated body-burden levels of these
endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) will increase the risk of developing invasive breast cancer, and that
alterations in DNA methylation (DNAm) and the breast microenvironment are mechanisms that link these
chemical exposures and breast cancer. We will test this hypothesis using a three-pronged approach. In Specific
Aim 1, we will conduct a prospective study of women in the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study-3
(CPS-3) to assess the association between body burden of PFAS during the menopausal transition and
subsequent development of invasive breast cancer. We will measure PFAS levels in plasma samples collected
1 to 7 years before invasive breast cancer diagnosis in 1000 CPS-3 participants and 1000 matched, cancer-free
CPS-3 participants, all between 40 and 57 years of age at blood draw. In Specific Aim 2, studying the same
participants, we will measure DNAm using Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChips and conduct an epigenome-
wide association study (EWAS) to identify DNAm changes associated with levels of PFAS in the cancer-free
participants. We then will determine the association between the PFAS-associated DNAm changes and risk of
developing breast cancer. This valuable DNAm data also can be used later for other outcomes, including
exposure to other EDCs. In Specific Aim 3, we will determine the direct effects of PFAS on tissue- and molecular-
level states associated with susceptibility to cancer initiation in genomically-well-characterized primary human
breast mammary epithelial cells (HMECs). Identifying these mechanisms in primary breast cells is critically
important, as PFAS mechanisms of action generally differ by tissue. We will use 2-D cultures to determine the
effects of short-term exposures and 3-D cultures to define the effects of protracted chemical exposures on
changes in epithelial lineage consistent with accelerated aging and age-related molecular changes in genome
methylation, lineage-specific transcription, and cytokeratin proteins. Results from this multi-disciplinary approach
will advance our understanding of the effects of PFAS exposures on risk of developing breast cancer during an
important window of susceptibility. Ultimately, we hope results from our proposed project will identify an
integrated biological signature of environmental exposure, deliver mechanistic insights into breast cancer
development from EDCs, and inform future studies for prevention strategies to reduce or mitigate exposures."

Cardiovascular disease is a main cause of death and disability in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD)
but little is known on the genetic factors accounting for the increased cardiovascular disease burden in CKD.
Genome-wide association studies have identified several loci for cardiovascular disease and subclinical
atherosclerosis traits. Studies have also shown that genetic variants that regulate gene expression have
important roles in complex traits. We propose to test regulatory regions of the genome associated with
cardiovascular outcomes using approaches that integrate gene expression data to genome-wide genotypes.
We will use the comprehensive clinical and biomarker data from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort
(CRIC), a multi-ethnic and longitudinal study of individuals with CKD. CRIC has adjudicated cardiovascular
events in all participants and the study has already documented a high burden of atherosclerosis and
cardiovascular disease in CKD. We will perform genome-wide association studies of cardiovascular outcomes
using dense imputed genotypes from multi-ethnic reference panels obtained from the Trans-Omics for
Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program to identify new loci in individuals with CKD (Aim 1). To identify putative
causal genes associated with cardiovascular disease in CKD, we will use predicted gene expression
approaches and expression quantitative trait loci from ancestry-matched datasets (Aim 2) and multi-tissues
(Aim 3). This project uses innovative concepts and approaches by integrating transcripts and genotypes for
gene discovery in a high-risk population for cardiovascular disease. This project aligns with NHLBI mission to
reduce the burden of CVD."

the Pediatric and Adult divisions involved in lung research at this Institute, and is thus interdepartmental at its
core. Thirty-three experienced investigators and research mentors representing 13 different clinical and basic
science departments and centers form a solid, diverse training force. This funding cycle we have reorganized
our mentor groupings from a unidimensional track system into a tridimensional matrix that varies along disease
focus, translational level, and scientific competency. Trainees may access their primary and secondary mentors
through entry into an appropriate point in the matrix and be encouraged to develop along different axes. This
structure encourages cross-disciplinary and trans-departmental training, and creates a framework for
professional and scientific development. Trainees will receive a comprehensive field- and project-specific
didactic curriculum. Both clinical and basic science trainees will be guided by an individualized advisory
committee that has both basic and clinical science mentors, to broaden the trainee’s perspective and facilitate
bench to bedside thinking. Emphasis will be placed on maintenance of project focus, creative experimental
design, state of the art technology, and early career guidance. The strength of this program lies in the highly

10829413,"Modulation of VEGF receptors to prevent Limbal Stem Cell Transplant rejection
Abstract:
The ranking of ocular trauma as the fourth most common injury among combat personnel
indicates the vital importance of evaluating and promoting ocular health among veterans.
Corneal neovascularization, or the growth of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) and new
lymphatic vessels (lymphangiogenesis) in the cornea, often results from infection or severe
corneal injury caused by explosion pressure, penetration by debris, or long-term exposure to dry
environments. Almost eight million people worldwide are afflicted with blindness secondary to
such corneal disease. Even larger numbers of people are suffering from ocular discomfort
caused by ocular surface disease from mechanical, chemical, immune or thermal trauma.
Military persons are at high risk since they are exposed to such environment frequently. And
also insufficiency of adequate and timely treatment is major problem on the field which is the
main cause for condition getting worse. Trauma to the ocular surface, damage to the limbal area
results in the loss of Limbal stem cells, and cause Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency (LSCD). At
present Limbal Stem Cell Transplantation (LSCT) is prominent way to treat LSCD. Although,
LSCT induces faster epithelialization, without the use of systemic immunosuppression, the
rejection rate of LSC transplants is as high as 70%.
Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) and membrane-bound (mb) VEGF receptors
(mbVEGFR1, R2, and R3) have been identified as modulators of corneal angiogenesis and
lymphangiogenesis and therefore regulates Limbal Stem Cell Transplantation rejection.
VEGFR1, R2 and R3 specifically are the primary mediators of angiogenesis and
lymphangiogenesis in the corneal stroma and epithelium. Here we propose to use high-risk
mouse Limbal Stem Cell Transplantation models with conditional (CDh5-CreERT2 and Prox1-
CreERT2) knockout of mbVEGFR1, 2, or 3 in vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells to
determine the most effective strategies for inhibiting corneal blood and lymphatic vessel growth.
In doing so, we hope to identify components that effectively modulate corneal
neovascularization in order to facilitate the future development of drugs that will block injury
induced corneal angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis and further improve Limbal Stem Cell
Transplantation success rates. Our research will bear implications not only pertinent to the
Veteran Affairs healthcare mission by promoting ocular health and preventing blindness among
veterans, but also indicate methods for successful transplantation of other tissues in addition to
the Limbal Stem Cell."

The Research Society on Alcoholism (RSA) Annual Meeting is the premier annual scientific meeting
involving all areas of alcohol research. In addition to biological/preclinical aspects, it also covers
medical/clinical, and psychosocial research. The RSA meeting is held annually, and previous
meetings (42) have been held mostly in the continental US, although some meetings have also been
held in Hawaii and Canada (Vancouver, Montreal). RSA had been planning to hold the 43rd meeting
in 2020 in New Orleans, LA (June 20-24, 2020). However, this meeting had to be cancelled due to
the Covid-19 pandemic. The 44th meeting in 2021 will be in San Antonio, TX. Also, please note that
this meeting is being planned as a joint meeting between RSA and the International Society for
Biomedical Research on Alcoholism. The location of these meetings will provide an attractive
opportunity for scientists from around the U.S.A. along with others around the world to present and
discuss their research. The meetings will have a large impact on alcohol research in the U.S., and the
outcome of the research presentations and discussion will advance the field. The program for each
meeting will feature topics that are highly relevant to the alcohol research community and provide
opportunities for discussion of existing and new collaborative research. The research presentations
will be in the form of symposia, roundtables, and workshops that will be proposed by the membership
of RSA. The RSA Program Committee will select the proposals with the highest scientific merit and
innovation. In addition, numerous poster sessions will be held. The RSA has made an effort to recruit
and retain new investigators in the field by highlighting their work as well as providing professional
development activities, and this will continue for the 2021 and 2022-2025 meetings. Since RSA is a
stable, established organization with annual meetings, this application is for 5 years of funding
(support for the 2021-2025 meetings). Planning for the next three meetings is well underway, but we
expect similar planning for years 4-5 of this application to begin soon. This application specifically
requests funds to offset expenses for young scientists (predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees within 4
years of their terminal degree) to attend these important meetings. Funds are requested for travel and
registration fees. An effort will be made to specifically target underrepresented groups. Some
administrative costs are also requested. The specific aim of this grant is to provide travel and
registration assistance for students and young investigators to attend the annual RSA meeting. The
overall goal is to provide information to those individuals who are interested in learning more about
current research in the alcohol field with the possibility of pursuing alcohol research as a career."
10829809,"Abstract
Viruses have historically revealed novel cellular processes, including mRNA nuclear export pathways. Here we
study a recently identified pathway usurped by influenza virus mRNAs to mediate their nuclear export. This
process is driven by the viral NS1 protein interaction with cellular and other viral proteins. NS1 is a major
virulence factor that inhibits cellular antiviral response and promotes viral gene expression. In this proposal,
molecular mechanisms of NS1 functions that mediate viral mRNA nuclear export and the mechanism of action
of a novel small molecule inhibitor of viral mRNA nuclear export will be examined. In particular, our published
and preliminary structure-function data show that NS1 inhibits the export of cellular (host) mRNA from the
nucleus to the cytoplasm by interacting directly with the heterodimeric host mRNA export receptor NXF1-NXT1.
Moreover, NS1 prevents NXF1-NXT1 docking to the nuclear pore complex. However, NS1 is also critical for
nuclear export of at least some of the essential influenza mRNAs, even though these also require NXF1. In Aim
1 of the current proposal, this paradoxical observation will be investigated by determination of the molecular
mechanisms that mediate influenza mRNA nuclear export. A combination of genetics, single-molecule RNA-
FISH (smFISH), in vitro and cell-based binding assays, and a viral mini-genome system will be used to explore
how NS1 promotes the export of viral mRNAs. Aim 2 will address target identification/validation of a novel
inhibitor of viral mRNA nuclear export. It is based on the identification of a cellular NS1-binding protein that
mediates nuclear export of viral mRNAs and of a subset of cellular mRNAs, but not bulk cellular mRNA. This
provided an avenue to target influenza virus without compromising bulk cellular gene expression. We designed
and performed a high-content, image-based chemical screen and identified a novel inhibitor of viral mRNA export
that exhibited no significant activity towards bulk cellular mRNA. This small molecule inhibits virus replication at
non-toxic concentrations. Preliminary data indicate that this small molecule targets the cellular TAOK2 kinase.
The focus of Aim 2 will be on target validation and identification of potential additional targets of this novel inhibitor
of mRNA export using photo-crosslinking based chemical approaches, and functional genetic, biochemical, and
imaging approaches. By determining how NS1 influences mRNA export and how this process can be regulated
by a small molecule, we will uncover fundamental new mechanisms and regulation of a noncanonical mRNA
export pathway. Additionally, this compound may serve as a lead for developing antivirals."

cancer therapeutics includes i) a potent cytotoxic capacity to trigger virus-mediated killing of as many tumor cells
as possible in the shortest period of time, and ii) the capacity for stimulating adaptive anti-tumor immune
response. While early efforts to develop potent oncolytic therapeutics were primarily focused on harnessing or
even increasing virus-mediated tumor cell cytotoxicity, new data suggest that in vivo, therapeutic efficacy of
viruses with low cytotoxic capacity is comparable or even better than that of viruses which are highly effective at
killing cancer cells in vitro. The mechanistic factors underlying this mismatch between efficacy and potency in
vivo remain poorly understood. While evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of systemically administered
adenovirus-based vectors in a mouse model of disseminated lung cancer, we found that virus dose escalation
leads to a reduction in median survival of tumor-bearing mice. In mice that developed a ‘non-responder’
phenotype, myeloid cells become highly activated in response to adenovirus administration. Based on these
findings we propose the novel concept of a “reparative call”, whereby efficient tumor cell killing by the virus
triggers activation of tumor-associated myeloid cells, which in turn secrete pro-tumorigenic growth factors,
triggering accelerated tumor growth. This project is designed to comprehensively address mechanistic aspects
of this concept by analyzing how cytotoxic potency may affect the efficacy of systemic virotherapy with Ad-based
vectors. We will determine the mechanistic role of tumor-derived IL-33 in driving myeloid cell activation and will
develop novel Ad vectors expressing soluble IL-33R to block IL-33-dependent tumor-cell activation. We will
further analyze the therapeutic efficacy of soluble IL-33R-expressing Ad vectors in combination with clinically
relevant drugs that target myeloid cells and the PD-1 pathway. The successful completion of this project will
significantly advance our understanding of fundamental factors that are critical for effective clinical translation of
Ad-based vector systems for therapy of neoplastic disease."

Coordination across multiple laboratories is a key challenge that U19 groups face. The Administrative Core will
provide the organizational structure and administrative support needed for the team to function efficiently and
will assist team members in communication and dissemination of research outcomes. This effort will be led by
the Program Director, Dr. Greg DeAngelis, assisted by a group of experienced administrators. The primary
objectives of the Administrative Core will be to provide governance of the research program, to facilitate
communication and development of ideas, and to establish avenues for sharing information and resources.
Aim 1 will establish a governance structure for the research program, along with a set of policies and
procedures for managing the team's activities. This structure will include establishing an Internal Advisory
Committee consisting of the project and core leaders and an External Advisory Board, as well as a set of
routines for communicating among team leaders, monitoring progress toward achieving goals, and dealing with
any conflicts that may arise through negotiation and, if needed, mediation. Aim 2 will facilitate team
collaboration and communication, by establishing regular activities such as monthly meetings of the Internal
Advisory Committee, joint laboratory meetings, and an annual workshop with all members of the research team
as well as the External Advisory Board. The Administrative Core will also support laboratory visits as needed
for intense collaborative work, along with training in common procedures and techniques that will be used
across laboratories. Aim 3 will share information among the team and disseminate tools and data to the
community. The Administrative Core will oversee development of a program website that will serve three main
goals. First, it will communicate the goals and importance of the research program to the public, as well as the
important advances that will be made. Second, the website will provide links to public repositories where data,
code, and tutorials will be shared with the broader neuroscience community, so that other researchers can
benefit maximally from our group's work. Third, the website will provide an intranet for the research team to
share preliminary results, analysis approaches, experimental techniques, and standard operating procedures.
This website will be linked with the data infrastructure to be developed by the Data Science Core. The
proposed U19 project team has highly relevant and complementary expertise, along with extensive experience
of collaboration among its various members, which will facilitate cooperation across the group. Thus the project
leaders are confident that the team will work well together to achieve the goals of this ambitious project to
define the neural basis of causal inference, from perception to action."
10834915,"Project Summary
This application proposes to use theory-driven experimental design, with advanced techniques for neural
recording, data analysis, and computational modeling, to investigate the neural mechanisms, circuits, and
representations underlying the perceptual process of causal inference in space and time. The multidisciplinary
nature of the proposed work requires close collaboration among consortium members. The Data Science Core
will facilitate this collaboration and provide the tools necessary to handle and analyze the large-scale neural
data collected in the proposed experiments. To achieve these goals, the Data Science Core will rely on
existing infrastructure, open standards, and open-source software as much as possible. Aim 1 will establish a
unified data standard, and data exchange and storage infrastructure, using the architecture established by the
International Brain Laboratory, which stores metadata in a relational, searchable database, and experimental
and processed data on a separate file server. Github will enable joint development, exchange, and
documentation of the code underlying data preprocessing, processing, and analysis. To relate data to models,
voltages recorded experimentally must be transformed into standardized spike times and counts, without
artifacts or confounds. Aim 2 will develop a principled, transparent, and reproducible pipeline for this
preprocessing and apply it to all neurophysiological data generated in Projects B and C. The first stage will
eliminate electrical and behavioral artifacts and convert voltages into spike times and local field potentials. The
second stage will use a statistical model of neural activity to identify and label potential outliers. This pipeline
will produce annotated and cleaned data in a standardized format that can be used to perform reliable
analyses, model fitting, and hypothesis tests. Aim 3 will combine cutting-edge methods and convert them to
software tools that can be reliably applied to new data. Most of this effort will be applied to variants of latent-
state discovery techniques that jointly fit the influence of stimuli, model-driven hypothesized latent states, and
unobserved latent states such as slow fluctuations. The central work of this aim is to implement those tools,
help the team apply them to the data generated by the collaboration, and refine them for public use. Aim 4 is to
share the experimental data with the wider research community by uploading the relevant portions of the data
to public and freely accessible repositories. Code, documentation, and use cases will be made public on
Github. The use of standard data structures, open standards, and open-source software will ensure barrier-free
access, ease of use, and reproducibility for neuroscience researchers. With the help of a full-time data scientist
hired to manage these efforts, the Data Science Core will build on established data storage and analysis
standards and methods to produce cleaned and standardized data that our consortium can use to close the
loop between theory and experiments. By sharing code, use cases, and data with other researchers, this
project will also improve and extend these resources for future use by others."
10834919,"Project Summary
The same pattern of neural activity can correspond to multiple events in the world. The brain resolves this
ambiguity by inferring which causal model best explains a sensory input pattern, and generating beliefs about
the sensory variables in this model. The neural basis of causal inference is difficult to study, however, because
this internal model is only partly accessible through behavior. Normative modeling provides a powerful way to
circumvent this problem: if these computations are close enough to optimal, beliefs inferred by normative
models can be used to identify potential neural correlates. This project's goal is to develop normative models of
the motion tasks investigated experimentally in Projects B and C, to generate trial-by-trial as well as dynamic
moment-by-moment predictions of key latent variables in the computation, and to investigate their neural
implementation using data collected in those projects. These models will be fit to behavioral data to determine
how the brain uses causal inference applied to retinal image motion to infer the animal's self-motion, to decide
whether or not the object is moving in the world, and to infer the object's velocity and depth. For the trial-based
tasks in Project B, Aim 1 will start with the generative model of sensory inputs and invert it to produce causal
inferences. Preliminary work has extended and unified previous efforts into a novel Bayesian model that uses
retinal motion and depth to segment visual scenes during self-motion. Psychophysical tests show that this
static model agrees with perceptual experience. This model will be used to predict neural responses in cortical
motion-processing areas MT and MSTd by assuming that these responses represent Bayesian posterior
beliefs. In Aim 2, because the real world is not static, the team will develop a dynamic model that describes
normative causal inference and inverse rational control in real-time. This model will predict which latent
variables the brain needs to track in the continuous, naturalistic tasks of Project C. Preliminary work shows that
a simplified model using dynamic causal inference can keep a running estimate of self-motion velocity and of
whether an object is stationary or moving. Aim 2 will extend this model to more complex sensory inputs and to
support object motion dynamics on timescales similar to those of inference. It will also develop a real-time
rational control model to generate quantitative hypotheses about the neural correlates of goal-directed control
for animals acting upon the percepts from causal inference. We will fit this model to observed behavior to
reverse-engineer animals' beliefs during goal-directed control. When the proposed work is complete, the static
model will link three physically interconnected variables—object motion, self motion, and depth—which may be
computed and represented in different neural populations, to predict how beliefs about these variables
influence each other and propagate across the brain. The dynamic model will extend the study of causal
inference to more realistic conditions, in which sensory data and beliefs evolve over time, to close the
understudied loop between perception and action."
10834921,"Project Summary
The world's complexity makes sensory information ambiguous. A set of signals sweeping across the retina, for
instance, might be generated by a moving object or by the animal's own motion. The brain resolves this
ambiguity by constructing an internal model of reality that associates patterns in sensory data with events in
the world, in a process called causal inference. To support adaptive action, the brain's estimates of all relevant
variables must be updated to remain consistent with physics under the current interpretation of the scene, as
well as with each other. This proposal focuses on perceptual interactions among object motion, self-motion,
and depth. This project will test the predictions of models from Project A for how causal inference should
update these related sensory variables. Based on previous work and preliminary data, the overall hypothesis is
that parietal (7a) and prefrontal (8av) areas signal whether or not an object moves in the world, and that these
signals flow through feedback projections to update sensory representations of object depth in area MT and
self-motion velocity in area MSTd. The goal of this project is to use traditional, trial-based tasks to determine
whether, and if so how, causal inferences are propagated back to sensory cortex to update representations of
task-relevant variables in monkeys. The goal of Aim 1 is to test whether causal inference modulates low-level
sensory representations of motion by examining neural correlates of optic flow parsing, a phenomenon in
which the perceived direction of an object's motion is strongly and predictably influenced by background optic
flow. Aim 2 will test directly if sensory representations of task variables are updated to maintain consistency
with beliefs about the world. Monkeys will judge whether an object moves in the world and also report its depth,
while neural populations in parietal area 7a, prefrontal area 8av, and sensory areas MT and MSTd are
recorded. The theoretical framework, supported by preliminary behavioral data, predicts that this causal
inference about object motion will induce specific patterns of bias in estimates of depth and self-motion
velocity, and that neural estimates of motion and depth in MT and MSTd will update to remain consistent with
behavior. To identify the neural circuitry necessary for causal inference and sensory updating, Aim 3 will
inactivate feedback pathways with muscimol or optogenetics while neural activity is recorded in sensory
representations, as animals perform the same task as in Aim 2. Aim 1 is expected to establish that causal
inference modulates early visual processing, and to identify the areas where these effects are implemented.
Aim 2 will provide the first cellular and neural population evidence of causal inference and sensory updating by
belief propagation. Aim 3 will establish a neural circuit that is necessary for mediating causal inference and for
updating sensory representations. Together, successful completion of the proposed experiments will uncover
circuit mechanisms of causal inference and sensory variable updating and establish a new functional role for
top-down feedback connections, which are a general feature of cortical organization."
10834923,"Project Summary
When sensory inputs are ambiguous, the brain builds an internal model to infer which events in the world
caused this pattern of sensory activity. This process, called causal inference, provides a unifying framework for
understanding how neural signals that represent beliefs about the structure of the world interact with incoming
sensory signals to drive perception-action loops. This proposal focuses on perceptual interactions among
object motion, object depth, and an animal's self-motion through the world, as a particular moving pattern of
neural activity on the retina can be generated by many combinations of object motion in the world and self-
motion. The overall hypothesis is that parietal and prefrontal neurons infer whether an object moves in the
world, and that these signals flow through feedback projections to update task-relevant representations in
extrastriate visual cortex. The goal of this project is to study causal inference in dynamic tasks, in which an
animal's internal model of the world changes continuously. In a virtual reality navigation task in monkeys and
mice, these experiments will explore brain computation and multi-area interactions in the naturalistic setting of
continuous action and active sensing, as well as dynamic on-line inference about latent, task-relevant variables
related to the internal model. This project will develop a causal inference version of a dynamic navigation task
already in use in the Angelaki laboratory and then use population recordings and causal neural manipulations
to test and refine the dynamic model developed by the theory team in Project A. The continuous-time latent
variables of this model will be fitted to monkey and mouse behavioral data to reveal each animal's beliefs about
the state of the world and interacting task-relevant variables, and to generate novel hypotheses about the
neural dynamics. Using multi-electrode recordings and chemical and optogenetic manipulations, this project
will test these hypotheses in four mutually interconnected monkey brain areas involved in visual perception,
navigation, memory, and decision-making: parietal area 7a, prefrontal area 8aV, and extrastriate visual cortical
areas MSTd (dorsal medial superior temporal) and MT (middle temporal). Finally, neural activity will be
mapped throughout the mouse brain, with an emphasis on subcortical structures, using parallel recordings with
Neuropixels probes for hypothesis-free identification of other areas that are modulated by this dynamic task,
which will also serve to generalize the findings across species. Based on these findings, additional macaque
brain regions will be targeted for recording and manipulation experiments as needed. Collectively, these
experiments will rigorously test the computational framework of dynamic causal inference across species and
brain areas. When compared with the complementary findings from trial-based tasks in Project B, successful
completion of these experiments is expected to uncover general principles of the function of causal inference
processes and top-down feedback connections during naturalistic and dynamically fluid behavior."
10836483,"ABSTRACT
Unbalanced chromosome content, so-called aneuploidy, is a hallmark of many human genetic diseases and
cancers. Aneuploidy not only results in the altered expression of the genes encoded on the aneuploid
chromosome, but also affects gene expression genome-wide. For many aneuploidy related diseases, it is still
not clear which gene or gene sets are the key drivers of disease pathology. Research on molecular
consequences of aneuploidy could shed invaluable light on “genotype-phenotype” association, thus leading to
a better understanding of disease development mechanisms. Due to the known substantial post-transcriptional
processes in aneuploidy condition and the functional importance of proteins, proteomic measurement is
indispensable to identify genes that are dosage-imbalanced at the protein level. However, biological and
technical challenges such as the variability of the individual genome, the limited quantitative reproducibility and
accuracy of the measurement, and the lack of strategies for identifying indirect mechanisms have hindered
efficient proteomic scrutiny on aneuploidy. We hypothesize that the aneuploid cells would employ characteristic
proteostasis and cell signaling pathways to deal with the large-scale protein dosage imbalance, and that the
newly acquired or altered protein-protein interactions under aneuploidy stress play an important role in
regulating molecular network and cellular fitness. In this proposal, we will use isogenic cell models from human
and mouse aneuploidy cases. We will further develop and apply the techniques based on quantitative mass
spectrometry and new analytical strategies based on protein- context profiling to discover the direct and
indirect proteomic effects in the aneuploidy models. Results from this proposal are extremely important. First,
the proteomic- centric, multilayered dataset will describe how protein homeostasis is maintained when several
hundreds of genes that are gained or lost, decipher commonly activated signaling processes across
aneuploidy models, and provide opportunities to predict the cellular impact of specific gene copy number
alteration (CNA). Second, the protein-context profiling technique will be an invaluable tool for identifying de
novo protein functions and associations in aneuploidy and other disease conditions. Third, those significant
proteins escaping the homeostasis control or tightly interacting to signaling hubs will provide a list of important
protein targets for further functional studies in aneuploidy cases, such as lung squamous cell carcinomas and
trisomy disorders that are relevant to the studied cell models."
10836493,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The human gut microbiota is increasingly recognized as having essential functions in human health. However,
the microbiota is constantly subjected to challenges such as intestinal inflammation, which drives the microbiota
into a perturbed state that can exacerbate diseases. Therefore, microbial resilience, which maintains the
structural and functional stabilities of the gut microbiome in the face of perturbations, is critical to host health.
The overarching goal of our research program is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that govern commensal
resilience in the inflamed intestine. During intestinal inflammation, host processes known as nutritional immunity
starve gut microbes from essential micronutrients such as iron. In contrast to the well-studied strategies that
pathogens employ to overcome host nutritional immunity, little is known about how gut commensals survive iron
starvation in the inflamed gut. The primary goal of our research program for the next five years is to define
the resilience mechanisms that maintain commensal iron homeostasis during gut inflammation. Enteric
pathogens overcome nutritional immunity by producing iron-chelating molecules termed siderophores. Here, we
show that the model gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (B. theta) acquires iron in the inflamed gut by
pirating siderophores from an enteric pathogen that causes intestinal iron limitation. Notably, B. theta captures
siderophores using a unique system absent in other Gram-negative bacteria. However, such a capture
mechanism can be exploited by enteric pathogens to “re-pirate” siderophores from gut commensals to evade
nutritional immunity. In addition to increasing iron uptake, we show that B. theta employs small, non-coding RNAs
to orchestrate iron conservation and maintain intracellular iron homeostasis in the inflamed intestine. With this
MIRA award, we will define commensal resilience mechanisms by addressing two related but independent
questions in fundamental bacterial physiology: 1) How does xenosiderophore acquisition mediate B. theta
resilience during gut inflammation? 2) How does B. theta manage intracellular iron homeostasis in the inflamed
intestine? We will approach these questions using an interdisciplinary pipeline consisting of cutting-edge omics
experiments, bacterial & host genetics, and a mechanistic understanding of bacterial physiology in vivo. The
completion of these research projects will reveal the mechanisms by which gut commensals adapt to iron
limitation in the inflamed gut and how such adaptation shapes the structural and functional stability of the gut
microbiome. The proposed work is innovative because it adds commensal iron metabolism as a previously
unappreciated dimension to the intricate interactions between pathogen and nutritional immunity. This work is
impactful because it will provide much-needed insights into how interphylum iron metabolism contributes to gut
microbiota resilience in the inflamed gut."
10836495,"Anxiety disorders comprise a spectrum of conditions, including panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder,
obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, social anxiety disorder, and phobias. Their
lifetime prevalence among women has been reported to be as high as 30%, so these disorders frequently
complicate pregnancy. Insomnia is also very common during pregnancy, with a prevalence of nearly 40%.
Pharmacological treatment with benzodiazepines or non-benzodiazepine sedative hypnotics is frequently
indicated for severe anxiety and insomnia; approximately 4% of pregnant women uses one of these classes of
medication during their pregnancy. Polytherapy among women using these medications is common, with 30-
40% being co-prescribed at least two additional psychotropic medications. Benzodiazepines and non-
benzodiazepine sedative hypnotics cross the human placenta and may therefore have the potential to alter
normal intrauterine development of fetal growth, anatomic structures, physical functioning, and postnatal
development.
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that decisions regarding mental health
treatment during pregnancy be made jointly between a woman and her mental and obstetrical health providers
prior to pregnancy. Unfortunately, rigorous and comprehensive safety data to inform the risk-benefit trade-off
are sparse, evidence is conflicting, and numerous safety concerns have been raised. The objective of the
proposed studies is to address this critical information gap by generating high-quality evidence on the safety of
benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine sedative hypnotics during pregnancy considering a broad range of
clinically relevant adverse pregnancy outcomes, including major congenital malformations, spontaneous
abortion, preterm birth, low birth weight, small for gestational age, hypoglycemia, respiratory problems, NICU
admission, and neurodevelopmental disorders.
The use of large, population-based cohorts of publicly and privately insured pregnant women (N ≈ 4.5 million)
will enable quantification of effects with great precision, as well as exploration of the effects for specific drugs,
doses, gestational timing of exposure, and polytherapy. As is the case for all studies evaluating drug safety in
pregnancy given that they are observational in nature by necessity, the most important challenges relate to the
potential for confounding, as well as misclassification of exposures and outcomes as documented in existing
healthcare data. The project will benefit from the multidisciplinary team’s deep experience and established
track record overcoming these challenges in perinatal psychiatry research using highly innovative design and
advanced computational approaches. The findings will have a direct and large public health impact by enabling
treatment to be tailored for the large number of women that struggle with perinatal anxiety and sleep disorders."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Vector Biology of Invasive Anopheles stephensi
 in Rural to Urban Landscapes in Ethiopia
Anopheles stephensi is a major malaria vector species in urban and peri-urban environments of
South Asia. Since its first detection in Djibouti in 2012, the distribution of this vector species has
expanded to Ethiopia, Sudan, Somalia, Kenya and Nigeria. The emergence and spread of An.
stephensi in Africa pose serious challenges for malaria control and elimination in fast-growing urban
areas of Africa. The World Health Organization recently launched an initiative to make a concerted
effort to stop An. stephensi spread by improving An. stephensi surveillance and control in Africa. The
biology of An. stephensi has been well characterized in its native range in South Asia. However, the
ecology, behavior and population genetics of newly invasive An. stephensi and its role in malaria
transmission in Africa are not well understood. Knowledge gaps related to An. stephensi ecology and
behavior and the effectiveness of intervention methods have impeded the development of a data-
driven and evidence-based An. stephensi control program. Lack of sensitive surveillance methods for
An. stephensi has hindered efforts to effectively track An. stephensi population spread over time. The
overarching objectives of this project are to address these knowledge gaps in invasive An.
stephensi vector biology and spread in Ethiopia, identify surveillance tools and methods
needed to track vector spread and develop control tools that can be adapted to settings of
varying malaria endemicity. The central hypothesis is that An. stephensi invasion into new
African environments has dynamically shifted the malaria vectorial system and altered local
transmission dynamics. We will test this hypothesis by filling in knowledge gaps related to An.
stephensi ecology, behavior and genetics; examining transmission dynamics along the rural to urban
continuum; and evaluating new control tools. The four specific aims are to: 1) Examine the
entomological drivers of malaria transmission in rural-urban landscapes; 2) Determine An. stephensi
spread and influential anthropogenic, biological and environmental factors contributing to its spread;
3) Optimize larviciding methods for An. stephensi and native malaria vector control, and 4) Identify
serological biomarkers that can distinguish exposure to invasive An. stephensi from other native
malaria vector mosquitoes. Because many African urban settings are predicted to be conducive to
An. stephensi invasion and An. stephensi is highly susceptible to local malaria parasites in Africa,
better understanding of An. stephensi biology and distribution and optimizing vector control tools will
be of paramount importance to malaria control in Africa."

 PROJECT SUMMARY
Malaria Epidemiology Across Rural and Urban Landscapes in Ethiopia
Although many rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa have achieved major reductions in malaria over the
past two decades, the malaria burden is increasing in rapidly growing urban regions of the continent.
Emergence of invasive Anopheles stephensi may further alter malaria transmission dynamics and
increase malaria risk in urban settings. This application responds to the World Health Organization’s
“Global framework for the response to malaria in urban areas,” a program launched in 2022 to address
the challenges of urban malaria control in the context of An. stephensi invasion in Africa. The central
objectives of this project are to advance knowledge of malaria epidemiology across the rural to
urban continuum in Ethiopia, where invasive An. stephensi presents a major threat, and to
examine the epidemiological impact of malaria vector control programs targeting areas at high
risk for malaria and An. stephensi distribution. The central hypothesis is that An. stephensi
invasion and rapid urbanization will modify malaria transmission dynamics and increase the
risk of malaria infection and clinical disease. Deeper understanding of these processes will
allow for the development of cost-effective malaria control strategies tailored to local urban
vector ecology and risk patterns. Three specific aims are proposed: 1) Determine the temporal
dynamics and spatial heterogeneity of malaria risk and underlying risk factors across the rural to urban
continuum in Ethiopia; 2) Assess the impact of urbanization and An. stephensi invasion on malaria
parasite within-host infection complexity and population-level genetic diversity; and 3) Evaluate the
epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness of a larviciding program targeting areas of high malaria
risk in the rural to urban landscape. This project will reveal how An. stephensi invasion changes malaria
risk and influences susceptibility to clinical malaria and will provide critical information on the cost-
effectiveness of different microbial larviciding methods. Although this study will solely be conducted in
Ethiopia, we anticipate that our findings will have broad and timely implications for the assessment of
malaria risk and for malaria control in other African countries in the face of An. stephensi invasion."
10840962,"Gut symbiotic microbiota–derived CD1d ligands and their immunomodulatory mechanisms
PROJECT SUMMARY
The symbiotic microbiota has co-evolved with the mammalian host for millennia, and the host has developed a
sophisticated system for distinguishing pathogens from commensal microbes. Unlike pathogens, many of whose
molecules trigger robust inflammatory and immune reactions, symbiont-derived molecular factors have been
believed to be “silent,” even though they reside within the host at a very high density. However, recent studies
strongly suggest that molecular factors of symbiotic origin actively contribute to host immune regulation and
protection from excessive inflammation. We have previously identified and characterized a unique class of lipids
(alpha-galactosylceramides) from the human gut symbiont Bacteroides fragilis that can modulate host immune
development early in life. Our preliminary results show that these molecules (BfaGCs) are presented by the
nonclassical MHC class I–like molecule CD1d in a structurally conserved manner similar to that documented
for prototypic CD1d ligands. Of considerable interest, unlike CD1d agonists such as KRN7000, BfaGCs function
as a regulator of natural killer T (NKT) cells, a specific T cell subtype restricted by the CD1d–lipid antigen
complex. Synthetic BfaGC molecules can induce distinct immunomodulatory signals from NKT cells and can
function as a regulator of NKT cell proliferation in the colon. Furthermore, targeted lipidomic profiling of gut
symbionts has identified lipid species structurally related to BfaGCs in multiple gut symbionts, implying that
gut symbionts can collectively synthesize potential NKT cell regulators. We propose an investigation of
molecular immunomodulatory mechanisms that underlie the activity of gut symbiont–derived lipid ligands. We
aim to determine (1) the distinct NKT population recognized by the CD1d-BfaGC complex and their
immunomodulatory responses to BfaGCs, (2) the specific molecular-level interactions between CD1d and
BfaGCs, (3) the structure and immunomodulatory activity of previously uncharacterized lipid species of
symbiont origin and (4) the modulation of inflammatory responses by symbiont-derived CD1d ligands in vivo.
The proposed studies will provide valuable knowledge of the molecular mechanisms by which symbiotic
microbiota-derived molecules modulate the host immune system and help the development of potential
immunotherapeutics."
10841389,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In recent years, the field of cancer immunotherapy has seen a renaissance – with the use of monoclonal
antibodies that target immune checkpoints to activate anticancer immune responses demonstrating unparalleled
clinical success. Several of these therapies have now gained FDA approval and are part of routine treatment
regimens for several malignancies. Despite the overall success of immunotherapeutic regimens, existing
modalities present complications that current research efforts seek to overcome: (1) systemic delivery of
checkpoint blockade monoclonal antibodies lead to diverse and unpredictable immune-related adverse events
(irAE), (2) boosting responses from the endogenous antitumor repertoire often relies on the existence of pre-
primed antitumor T cells, which in the case of highly immunosuppressive tumors or those with low mutational
burden may be extremely rare, and (3) attempts to combine immunotherapies to additively boost T cell responses
demonstrate increased on-target, off-tumor toxicity. Thus, to circumvent toxicity and immunosuppression,
contemporary strategies focus on developing methods to deliver potent immunostimulants directly into a tumor,
locally priming antitumor T cells to attack disseminated metastases exhibiting a similar antigenic profile. Bridging
these observations, the goals of this proposal are to engineer probiotic strains of bacteria that selectively colonize
colorectal cancer (CRC) and locally release immune checkpoint blockade. We hypothesize that this approach
will result in more robust and diversified antitumor T cell immunity and promote the clearance of colonized
primary and metastatic colorectal cancer lesions and systemically growing CRC-derived foci. The primary
innovations of this proposal are in engineering probiotics as an immunotherapeutic delivery vector to locally
release high-dose immune checkpoint blockade. Specifically, the proposed system has several advantages over
current therapeutic strategies, including: (1) tumor-specific production of immunotherapies and LPS adjuvant,
(2) bacteria lysis, leading to effective release of novel immunotherapeutics and LPS, (3) local delivery of novel
immunotherapeutics that are toxic to deliver systemically, and (4) oral delivery of probiotics that selectively
colonize CRC metastases. This work seeks to shift current research and clinical practice paradigms to overcome
current limitations of immunotherapies, by providing a unique vehicle to locally deliver immunotherapies that
stimulate antitumor immunity while preventing systemic toxicity and mitigating irAE."

While it is well established that estradiol (E2) -the main premenopausal ovarian hormone-, plays mitogenic
roles in estrogen-receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, emerging evidence shows that E2 promotes
tumorigenesis and metastases of ER negative (ER-) tumors through effects on the microenvironment. E2 plays
well known neurotrophic and neuroprotective functions in the adult brain by regulating the expression of
neurotrophins, growth factors and chemokines, however, how E2 promotes brain metastatic progression
remains ill-defined. The scientific premise of this proposal is that E2 promotes brain metastasis by
modulating ER+ cells in the brain microenvironment. Our long-term goal is to define the mechanisms
underlying the pro-metastatic effects of E2 in the brain to identify novel strategies to prevent or treat brain
metastases. Our studies have shown that E2 promotes experimental brain metastases by modulating ER+
reactive astrocytes, which are induced early during brain metastatic colonization and are essential for brain
metastatic progression. Reactive astrocytes surrounding brain metastases express both ER genes (ERα and
ERβ), and in response to E2, upregulate neurotrophins (BDNF) and growth factors (EGF) that activate pro-
metastatic pathways (TRKB, EGFR, HER2) in cancer cells. E2 also represses chemokines (Ccl2, Ccl3, Ccl4,
Ccl5), which promote recruitment and polarization of microglia into an M1 tumor-suppressive phenotype. Our
central hypothesis is that E2 promotes brain metastases by at least two independent mechanisms: 1)
upregulation of BDNF leading to activation of TRKB/EGFR signaling in metastatic cancer cells, and 2)
repression of tumor-suppressive M1 microglia in the early brain metastatic niche. Therefore, targeting
aromatase, E2/ER signaling or downstream BDNF/TRKB/EGFR activation can be used to prevent or treat
brain metastases. In Aim 1 we will determine how E2 upregulates BDNF in the metastatic niche, and whether
BDNF activation of TRKB/EGFR/HER2 is a mechanism of increased brain metastases in response to E2. In
Aim 2 we will determine how E2 regulates microglia activation and polarization at early stages of brain
metastases, and whether this is a mechanism of increased brain metastases in response to E2. In Aim 3 we
will determine whether targeting E2/ER signaling or downstream BDNF/TRKB/EGFR activation reduces brain
metastatic colonization and progression in vivo. This contribution will be significant because defining the
mechanisms by which E2 modulates the brain niche could provide alternatives for prevention and treatment of
brain metastases in women at high risk. This proposal is innovative because it represents a new paradigm in
thinking about E2 and the brain niche in cancer; it will fill a critical gap by defining how E2 modulates microglia
during brain metastasis and, it will define if aromatase inhibitors and/or ANA-12 have preclinical efficacy in
prevention and treatment of TrkB+ brain metastases."

studies over the ten previous years of this award have demonstrated that the deoxyuridine triphosphate
nucleotidohydrolases (dUTPase) encoded by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and more recently by the human
herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) have novel immunoregulatory and neuroregulatory functions that contribute to the
pathophysiology observed in a subgroup of patients with ME/CFS. In this renewal application, we will continue
our mechanistic studies to define the role that the EBV and HHV-6 dUTPases have in ME/CFS. Our overall
hypothesis is that the increased abortive replication of EBV in plasmablasts/plasma cells in a subgroup of
patients genetically susceptible to developing ME/CFS induces the increased synthesis and release of EBV
dUTPase in exosomes. Ligation of EBV dUTPase-containing exosomes with TLR2 present on antigen-
presenting cells (APCs) in the local microenvironment triggers the production of pro-inflammatory TH1
cytokines as well as activin A, which in turn stimulates the differentiation and proliferation of follicular helper T
(TFH) cells, resulting in IL-21 production, which contributes to the immune dysfunction observed in these
patients. Activin A is also a negative regulator of muscle growth and we are proposing that it alters the function
of key enzymes in skeletal muscle leading to oxidative stress and low energy levels thus, contributing to the
post-exertional fatigue characteristic of patients with ME/CFS. Trafficking of EBV dUTPase containing
exosomes to the brain and TLR2 ligation on target cells results in microglia activation, disruption of the BBB,
neuroinflammation and altered synaptic plasticity ultimately leading to cognitive impairment in these patients.
Finally, these physiological effects of the EBV dUTPase are enhanced by chronic stress. The results of this
study, will demonstrate that the EBV/HHV-6 dUTPases may act as drivers of the immune activation that occurs
in ME/CFS. It may also identify EBV/HHV-6 dUTPase proteins as diagnostic biomarkers for identifying a
subset of patients with ME/CFS. Finally, these studies will demonstrate that engagement of EBV/HHV-6
dUTPase proteins with TLR2 is essential for inducing neuroimmune dysfunction and thus, this interaction can
be used as a novel target for the development of alternative therapeutic approaches."

The untreated burden of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the United States is a massive contributor to
healthcare budgets in both the military and civilian sectors, and better treatment and prevention methods are
needed. Fortunately, awareness of PTSD among military service members has grown in recent years, and
yet, there is a hidden epidemic of PTSD among civilians and women. Women experience PTSD at about twice
the rate of men (11% vs. 5%), but the causes for this sex difference are largely unknown. It has long been
suspected that sex hormones play a major role in development of – and also potentially protection from –
PTSD and other mental health disorders. This project will provide the largest ever study of sex hormone
effects on PTSD and the related mental health outcomes of depression and anxiety disorders. Whereas
studies in the past were limited by small sample sizes and results were inconclusive, this investigation will use
a massive sample size of approximately 500,000 participants to answer questions about two well-known sex
hormones (testosterone and estradiol) and three psychiatric outcomes (PTSD, depression, and anxiety
disorders). These variables were measured in the UK Biobank, and we have been granted access to the data
to study sex hormone effects on mental health outcomes and to study genetic effects underlying both sex
hormone levels and mental health disorders. The completion of this work will reveal whether rates of mental
health disorders vary with testosterone and estradiol levels. It may be the case that levels of hormones that
are both too high and too low are problematic. Given this reality, we will use sophisticated regression and
machine learning techniques, and therefore we will be able to detect linear and non-linear relationships
between sex hormones and PTSD, depression, and anxiety disorders. The sample size and study design
make this the most powerful study conducted to date, and the results will be generalizable to diverse
populations. In addition to the outcomes mentioned above, we will further explore genetic effects underlying
relationships between sex hormones and mental health disorders. To do this, we will conduct genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) of both testosterone and estradiol. We will then make polygenic scores for
testosterone and estradiol, yielding genetic proxies of sex hormone levels which can be used in studies in
which sex hormones have not been measured. Finally, we will test for shared genetic effects between genetic
effects on sex hormones and genetic effects on psychiatric disorders in order to better understand the etiology
of these common, debilitating, and inadequately treated mental health disorders. Taken together, these
findings will provide critical foundational knowledge relevant to clinical trials which are currently testing
testosterone and estradiol as treatments for PTSD, depression, and anxiety disorders. These results will also
provide actionable findings for the development of novel treatment and prevention strategies."
10842409,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 Chronic stress promotes a systemic inflammatory response that contributes to cardiovascular and
metabolic disease (CVD), and even acutely augmented stress can exacerbate disease severity. In humans,
consumption of high fat/high cholesterol diet (HFD) is a common co-factor driving chronic stress responses.
Understanding mechanisms controlling the stress-response and its association with CVD diseases, which are
nearly ubiquitous and a leading cause of mortality, will allow for development of impactful translational
approaches to fight against this understudied disease. The AG is the primary source for steroid hormones,
corticosterone and aldosterone that are produced in the cortex. Elevated corticosterone modifies glucose
homeostasis, immunity, and tissue remodeling. Our prior work using a cold-temperature stress model showed
that cold-stress drives the promotion of monocyte egress from bone marrow and exacerbated atherosclerosis.
Therefore, we sought to determine whether the local immune cells in the AG were also responding to stress
responses, either through cold-exposure or HFD feeding. Interestingly, we observed accumulation of lipid within
AG resident macrophages sitting adjacent to hormone-producing endocrine cells in models of atherosclerosis,
hypertension, or acute cold challenge. Tissue resident macrophages are typically tissue repair cells and lipid
accumulation is associated with anti-inflammatory phenotypes in macrophages. AG macrophages have not been
thoroughly described in literature, and their function in response to hormone signals is unknown. Through our
preliminary studies of WT mice (chow-diet fed with no overt stressors), we identified two primary populations of
macrophages present in the AG. These populations showed a sexual dimorphism in the representation of
macrophage subsets when comparing adult male versus female mice. Furthermore, through single cell RNA-
seq profiling between male and female AG immune populations, we identified gene programs associated with
AG resident macrophages and found constitutive expression of the lipid-sensor Trem2, which was found to
increased on AG macrophages following chronic challenge, supporting a role in responding to lipid-hormones.
Loss of Trem2 was associated with lipid accumulation in the AG and elevated circulating corticosterone levels
in the absence of challenge. Together, these observations led to the overarching hypothesis AG resident
macrophage maintenance is controlled by sex hormone production, and that AG macrophages sense
steroid hormones during stress responses to dampen inflammation and promote tissue health. Our
extensive experience in studying tissue macrophage development and function, along with the utilization of new
animal models make our group ideal to test these novel concepts. If true, the implications of this study will identify
new approaches to regulate systemic inflammation responses through the modulation of AG associated
macrophages, which might complement current lipid-control approaches used for high-risk CVD patients."
10841307,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mutation and meiotic recombination are the sources of all genetic variation, the fuel of evolution,
and the ultimate cause of heritable diseases and of many cancers. Consequently, their rates and
properties are of fundamental interest, as well as key parameters in almost any population or
human genetic study. Yet many aspects of these processes remain poorly understood. Notably,
despite strong constraints on both mechanisms–how deleterious errors in recombination or
abnormal numbers of mutations can be–they evolve rapidly over time and differ markedly across
species. My group takes advantage of this variation within humans and between species, using it
as a tool to learn about the underlying processes of mutagenesis and meiotic recombination. To
this end, we combine mathematical modeling, statistical data analysis, and genomic approaches
in humans and a broad range of non-model organisms. Ongoing work is concentrated along two
main axes: (1) Elucidating sources of point mutations and causes of differences in germline
mutagenesis between human sexes and across amniotes; and (2) Characterizing the strategies
used by different vertebrate species to direct meiotic double strand breaks to the genome and
understanding their evolution. Ultimately, our goal is to elucidate not only how but also why these
fundamental genetic processes differ across individuals and species. Answers to these questions
have important implications for human and evolutionary genetics, as well as for cancer biology."

 The mission of the Stanford CTSA is to transform clinical, translational, and science of translation
research and education (CTSRE) at Stanford and across the CTSA consortium. The Stanford CTSA’s
programs in CTSRE have been designed to extend from the earliest stages of the translational pipeline to the
“final mile” of implementation science at the patient and population level and to take full advantage of the rich
research and educational resources available at Stanford University. The overall goal is to make CTSRE more
effective and efficient to serve the health needs of more individuals and more diverse populations. During the
next seven years, the Stanford CTSA will achieve this goal by capitalizing on our greatest strengths, namely a)
training the next generation of clinical, translational, and science of translation researchers; b) developing and
implementing across all elements of our CTSA the principles of science of translation, including Rigor and
Reproducibility (SPORR); Team Science; Health Policy; and Research Equity, Accessibility, Diversity, and
Inclusiveness (READI); and c) innovating data driven and clinical operational approaches to accelerate, scale,
and diversify our translational research and science of translation research and educational efforts. We aim to
do this locally, regionally, and nationally in collaboration with our networks, including the CTSA consortium.
 To that end, our first overarching aim is to educate and train the next generation of investigators who
make up the clinical and translational research “workforce” with the knowledge and skills in CTSRE to achieve
the vision of translational medicine in the 21st century and to meet the opportunities and challenges of
providing optimal, equitable healthcare delivery and access for all. Our second overarching aim is to a)
develop, optimize, and implement innovative data science and health informatics infrastructure, methods, and
tools to promote analysis of large-scale real world data to serve as the platform for the conduct of CTSRE,
accelerating the translation of discoveries into improved health outcomes; b) sustain, develop, enhance, and
implement infrastructure, methods, services, and tools to support our entire CTSRE workforce locally and
across the CTSA Hub; c) imbue all Elements of our Stanford CTSA with science of translation principles,
including rigor and reproducibility (SPORR), team science, health policy, and Research Equity, Accessibility,
Diversity and Inclusiveness (READI) in support of our CTSRE mission. Our third overarching aim is to
maximize community engagement, team science, and diverse and inclusive approaches so our CTSRE
products benefit all segments of the population. Finally, we aim to develop and employ innovative state-of-the-
field evaluative approaches to determine the effectiveness of all our CTSRE efforts. With Stanford CTSA’s
record of accomplishments to date, supportive institutional environment, well-developed infrastructure,
integrated leadership, and expanding network of collaborators and community partners, we are well-positioned
to execute on our vision for the next seven years."

Natural products are important small molecules for studying, treating, and even causing human diseases, and
they typically have unique functional groups that are critical for their biological activities. By exploiting the
biosynthetic machinery by which these functionalities are synthesized, it is possible to enhance, vary or diminish
the biological activities of parent compounds and apply the biosynthetic machinery to new systems for functional
group installation. Toward this goal, the chemical logic and enzymatic machinery underlying natural product
biosynthesis need to be fully characterized and understood. Our lab has been focused on the biosynthesis of
unusual pharmacophores of natural products, including but not limited to terminal alkene, alkyne, isonitrile, and
N-hydroxytriazene. These moieties often serve as the warhead of bioactive NPs and have distinct physical
properties that enable molecular tracking such as Raman- or IR-imaging based cellular uptake and dynamic
studies. More importantly, they are often called “clickable” and utilized in bio-orthogonal chemical transformations
for various chemical biology applications. Specifically, our program has and will continue to make contributions
in the following four areas: 1) Novel enzyme discovery. “Bio-orthogonal” suggests that these functionalities are
rare in nature, but structures of a few rare NPs have already indicated the prospect of novel enzyme discovery
for these functionalities. 2) Enzyme mechanism interrogation. New and fundamental insights into the catalytic
mechanisms of these new enzymes will be obtained. 3) Biocatalysis and biosynthetic pathway engineering. We
plan to examine the substrate scope of new enzymes in detail and explore the utilization of these biosynthetic
machinery to install “clickable” functionalities on various biomolecules on demand. 4) Leveraging the unique
properties of these functionalities to promote natural product research, such as visualization, identification,
enrichment, quantification, diversification, and biological target identification. Our program employs
multidisciplinary approaches including bioinformatics, genetics, heterologous reconstitution, organic synthesis,
biochemical and structural analysis, spectroscopic analysis, bio-orthogonal chemistry, protein engineering, and
pathway engineering, with support from world-renowned collaborators providing complementary expertise in
structural biology, bioinorganic chemistry, computational chemistry, enzymology, chemical biology, biophysics,
and microbiology."

 This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is designed to prepare the candidate to
become an independent investigator in the emerging field of the gut microbiome in alcohol use disorder (AUD).
AUD is a chronic relapsing disease with a major public health impact. While substantial research has been
done to understand the neural circuitry underlying AUD, the role of the periphery and the connections between
the periphery and the central nervous system have been understudied. One promising avenue of study is the
gut microbiome and the microbiota-gut-brain axis, which have only recently been recognized as contributing to
the pathogenesis of AUD. Despite the promise of the microbiota-gut-brain axis as an important contributor to
AUD, there have been no comprehensive investigations of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in a single sample of
individuals with AUD. Therefore, this proposal seeks to evaluate the relationship between gut dysbiosis, clinical
phenomenology of AUD, and a brain-based biomarker in individuals with AUD and matched controls. The
research objective of this K01 application is to characterize the microbiome-gut-brain axis across different
levels of analysis. Specifically, 64 individuals with AUD and 64 matched healthy controls will provide a fecal
sample to localize the effects of chronic alcohol use on the gut microbiome. Participants will also provide a
blood sample to evaluate gut permeability through serum biomarkers. Participants will also complete an in-
depth neuroscience-informed clinical assessment battery, which will allow for phenotyping individuals into the
three domains of the Addiction Neuroclinical Assessment (ANA): incentive salience, negative emotionality, and
executive dysfunction. Finally, participants with AUD will complete an alcohol cue-reactivity neuroimaging task
to obtain a brain-based biomarker of AUD. The specific aims of the proposed project are: (1) to identify the gut
microbiota discriminating individuals with AUD from controls; (2) to evaluate the relationship between the gut
microbiome and AUD phenomenology; and (3) to test the relationship between gut microbiota and a brain-
based biomarker for AUD. The successful completion of the above aims will provide the first data linking the
microbiome-gut-brain axis to AUD in a clinical sample. This K01 award will position the candidate to be at the
forefront of the AUD microbiome-gut-brain axis field. The training goals for Dr. Grodin are to gain expertise in
(1) the gut-microbiome applied to AUD phenomenology, (2) quantitative methods in machine learning and big
data, and (3) professional development as an independent scientist."

We propose to establish a new national training program in response to the NIGMS initiative, “Innovative Program
to Enhance Research Training” (IPERT), that is designed to increase the size of a highly skilled, successful, and
diverse behavioral and biomedical workforce. Our intension is to accomplish this by instructing researchers at
academic institutions, research institutes, scientific societies, and private industry in the best professional skills,
including research ethics, and in the ways by those skills can be effectively transmit to trainees at their home
institutions or professional societies. It is our believe that such instruction is necessary to maximize the success
and scientific integrity of individuals engaged in behavioral and biomedical research. This is because, whereas most
post-baccalaureate research training programs provide their trainees with a strong background in a scientific
discipline and relevant laboratory skills, much more is needed to maximize the likelihood these individuals will
advance in their careers and do so with a high level of integrity. As successful research scientists they will require a
wide variety of additional skills, including the ability to develop a rigorous research program that generates
reproducible data; fund that research through successful grant proposals; obtain and succeed in employment;
communicate effectively through oral presentations, posters, research manuscripts, and informal networking;
manage time, stress, and conflict; become effective lab managers, educators, and mentors; and exhibit social
responsibility, including taking the time to effectively communicate with lay communities. In a great many cases the
development of such skills will require explicit instruction. We believe that such instruction should be provided by
individuals actively involved in research and should occur both within core academic courses and as part of
workshops on these skills that include a discussion of their ethical dimensions, rather than via separate courses in
research ethics. Our team is made up of a diverse group of individuals who – separately and collectively – have
been involved for many years in instructing others in these skills both directly and through “train-the-trainer”
workshops. We now propose to expand those previous efforts substantially by developing improved materials,
including cases for discussion and other handouts, slide decks, and videos; addressing a much broader range of
topics than in the past; increasing the relevance of our training programs for a diverse workforce that includes ethnic
minorities and individuals with disabilities; delivering those materials via larger and more diverse workshops and
websites; and producing a training manual. We will also help workshop participants develop ways to establish a
climate of inclusion at their home institutions. The impact of our workshops, designed for a minimum of 50 trainers
each year, will be carefully assessed by a professional evaluator who will collect and report data on the participants’
evaluation of our workshops; the impact the workshops have on participants’ subsequent instructional activities; and
the effectiveness of the participants in imparting what they have learned to their trainees, who may include college
students, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, laboratory staff, faculty, and/or staff scientists."
10843753,"Summary:
Stroke remains a leading cause of disability in the United States. Stroke is a heterogeneous multifactorial
disorder. Prior attempts at developing new therapies have failed in clinics due to imperfect target validation,
unrealistic therapeutic windows and lack of age appropriate models. Thus, there is an opportunity and a need
to identify new medical treatment for stroke. The immune cells move to stroke area in the brain and contribute
to damage. We have recently shown that the purinergic P2X4 receptor is excessively stimulated by adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) released by dying brain cells during stroke. This receptor protein then causes activation of
the immune cells and results in greater stroke injury. We have assembled the necessary tools such as animals
lacking P2X4 receptors as well as blockers that selectively inhibit the receptor. The proposal, using these new
tools, aims to investigate whether this receptor protein is a novel target to develop treatment for subjects with
stroke. Our initial data suggest that blocking or deleting this receptor protein during the acute phase of stroke is
beneficial. However, it is unknown how this protein works and what its potential adverse effects might be.
Answering these questions is the overall goal here and should define the correct approach in pursuing a new
stroke treatment"

Over 37 million individuals in the U.S. have chronic kidney disease (CKD) and are at high risk to die from
cardiovascular complications. While great strides have been made to improve CKD care and dialysis access,
minimal advances have been made in drug development to stall or reverse kidney damage and associated
pathologies. Currently, therapeutic options to prevent cardiovascular damage in CKD do not exist, and the only
cure for CKD is kidney transplantation. Elevations in serum levels of phosphate and fibroblast growth factor
(FGF) 23 are a hallmark of CKD and associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death. Expression levels
of klotho, a regulator of phosphate metabolism in the kidney, are reduced in CKD. Klotho can be released from
the kidney as soluble klotho (sKL) that circulates in the blood and acts as a binding partner for FGF receptors
(FGFR) on various tissues. Reductions in serum sKL levels have been shown to contribute to CKD-associated
pathologies. sKL seems to protect tissues by substituting for renal klotho thereby promoting FGF23/FGFR1-
induced renal phosphate excretion and lowering systemic phosphate levels, as well blocking the direct pathologic
actions of FGF23 and of paracrine FGFs. While elevating klotho expression has shown therapeutic potential in
animal models of CKD, further advances have been stymied by sKL’s short half-life and technical difficulties to
produce the recombinant sKL protein in sufficient amounts, along with a lack of tools to measure sKL activity.
Alpha Young LLC has developed a novel method to produce the recombinant sKL protein as well as a novel
assays to determine the bioactivity of sKL based on its ability to bind FGF23 and FGFR1. We have generated
an early-stage mimetic protein, and here we will introduce additional point mutations to increase sKL’s stability
and bioactivity. In Phase 1, we will modify sKL’s glycosylation sites and heparin binding domain, and we will
screen for mutant variants with increased binding affinities for FGF23 and FGFR1 to improve bioactivity, and
decreased heparin binding affinity to increase half-life. In Phase 2, we will optimize our identified sKL variants
by utilizing a phage display-based approach to introduce mutations into sKL’s FGFR binding domain with the
goal to increase FGFR1 binding affinity. Candidates with the desired changes in binding properties will be tested
for their biological activity using cell culture models that can determine the effect of sKL on FGF23-regulated
signaling, renal phosphate uptake, cardiac hypertrophy and on fibroblast activation induced by paracrine FGFs.
The half-life of the most promising candidates will be tested by injection studies in in rats. Finally, the most active
and stable sKL variant will be injected into mouse models of CKD, followed by the analysis of renal phosphate
excretion and cardiovascular damage. We propose that the administration of our sKL mimetic can serve as a
novel therapeutic approach in CKD to lower serum phosphate levels and to protect from the damaging actions
of FGFs. A successful completion of our project would provide us with a potent drug candidate and the
opportunity to pursue early-stage partners for advancing and validating its potential for future clinical trials."
10843953,"The past 5 years have witnessed a stunning convergence between basic and clinical visual science. Basic
advances in optogenetics, transcriptomics, stem cell biology, viral transduction, angiogenesis, and imaging
have all seen application in the clinical setting. The rationale for this program is that the ideal visual scientist of
the future, today’s trainee, needs to have a multidisciplinary background so as to be well-versed in both basic
science and clinical applications. The major aim of the Northwestern University Multidisciplinary Vision
Training Program is to prepare pre- and postdoctoral trainees for independent careers in vision research
broadly defined to include: diseases and functions of the anterior eye including the cornea and Schlemm’s
canal; diseases and mechanisms of the retinal neurons and vasculature; and, processing by central retinal
target areas including those mediating pupillary responses, accommodation, and circadian entrainment. This
proposal leverages the existing multidisciplinary research base at Northwestern University by integrating labs
into a cohesive unit for the purposes of training. The 16 preceptors offer research training in cell and molecular
biology, neurobiology of the visual system, genetics, advanced microscopy, stem cell biology and organoid
culture, diseases of the anterior and posterior eye, and evidenced based analysis of treatment outcomes and
healthcare delivery. Funding to support 3 predoctoral candidates, after they have begun full time thesis
research, and 1 postdoctoral trainee, in the early or middle stages of training, is requested. The predoctoral
trainees are recruited on the basis of course performance, rotation evaluations, and relevance of the proposed
dissertation research from the Northwestern University Integrated Neuroscience (NUIN) program, the
Interdepartmental Biological Sciences (IBiS) program, the Driskill Graduate Program in Life Sciences (DGP),
and the Biomedical Engineering (BME) Graduate Program. Pre- and post-docs are supported for up to two
years contingent on research progress. The Director and Steering Committee evaluates and selects trainees
from among the eligible pre- and post-docs. The training program also educates trainees in the ethics of
science and responsible conduct of research. Major emphasis is placed on recruiting trainees from under-
represented minority groups to vision research. The program for each trainee is determined by the trainee,
preceptor, and Steering Committee who formulate an individual development plan. The Program Director is
Steven H. DeVries, MD, PhD, Professor and David E. Shoch Chair of Ophthalmology and Physiology. In
addition to research training, the program offers a curriculum that includes two formal courses on vascular
biology and retinal circuits (pre-doc trainees must choose at least one), a 2 quarter presentation series entitled
Advanced Topics in Vision, invited lectures by nationally known researchers, and a Research Day. The long-
term objective is to educate trainees who will continue as independent, productive, and ethical investigators
and who will address national priorities in vision research."
10830253,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hypersensitivity of the urogenital organs and pelvic region is associated with urologic chronic pelvic pain
syndrome (UCPPS; inclusive of interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome and chronic prostatitis). Evidence
from animal models demonstrates that central nervous system processing of urogenital/pelvic sensory
information may be modified individually by (i) neonatal events that occur during sensory development and that
permanently alter neuroanatomical substrates, or (ii) adverse events, such as stress or trauma, experienced
during development or adulthood. Both of these phenomena have a high degree of clinical relevance, and there
is good reason to believe that consequential alterations in the phenotype and function of primary afferent neurons
innervating the urogenital and pelvic region are critical for the development of hypersensitivity and, thus, would
serve as targets for therapeutic intervention. The long-term goal of this project is to systematically study changes
in primary afferent-to-spinal cord sensory processing of somatic and visceral urogenital structures in clinically
relevant animal models of UCPPS. The objective of the current proposal is to systematically examine the effects
of neonatal bladder inflammation (NBI) or maternal separation (NMS), alone and in combination with an adult
insult of the same class (bladder re-inflammation, acute or chronic stress), on urogenital hypersensitivity and/or
widespread pain. The guiding hypothesis that serves as the basis of this proposal is that experiencing early life
inflammation or stress alters distinct subclasses of urogenital primary afferent and spinal dorsal horn neurons
that, in turn, inhibit or augment urogenital sensitivity in the context of a secondary adult exposure to inflammation
or stress. This hypothesis will be addressed in three specific aims using: 1) in vivo reflex behaviors coupled with
optogenetic targeting of stratified neuronal populations to determine how NBI or NMS alter primary afferent-
driven reflex behaviors, 2) patch-clamp and extracellular in vivo electrophysiology to characterize functional
activity within urogenital afferent and spinal dorsal horn neuronal pathways following NBI or NMS, and 3)
neurochemistry and optogenetics to identify neurochemical mediators and receptors/transducers in urogenital
tissues, primary afferent neurons, and spinal dorsal horn involved in the development of pelvic hypersensitivity."
10830257,"Racial/ethnic disparities in preterm birth (PTB) are persistent in the U.S., with a higher prevalence of PTB in
non-Hispanic (N-H) Black women than their N-H White counterparts. However, the underlying mechanism of
such Black-White differences is not well understood. Even extensive biomedical, behavioral, and socio-
demographic risk factors can explain only about half of PTB incidence. Chronic stress has received significant
attention as a robust predictor of PTB, particularly among racial/ethnic minority groups. Nevertheless, literature
shows inconsistent evidence on the relationships among race/ethnicity, chronic stress, and PTB, mainly
because of the complexities involved in assessing women’s chronic stress exposures. Accurate chronic stress
measures should capture the nature of stressors: cumulative, interactive, and population-specific. In this
regard, conventional statistical models (e.g., linear regression) have limited ability to model chronic stress
exposures with high precision. Thus, this study will adopt machine learning (ML), a state-of-the-art modeling
technique, to compute non-linear and synergistic relationships among chronic stressors, detect unknown
patterns, and reflect subtle differences in chronic stressors between N-H White and N-H Black women for more
accurate prediction of their PTB risk. I will develop simple, accurate, and explainable ML algorithms of chronic
stress exposures by building a hybrid algorithm specific to N-H White and N-H Black women and computing
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values. Specifically, the hybrid algorithm will combine Multivariate
Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithms where MARS will select
only “important” chronic stressor variables for each race/ethnicity to serve as DNN’s input features for PTB risk
prediction. Additionally, a SHAP value for each chronic stressor in the final algorithm will quantify its degree of
contribution to the predicted PTB risk. The ML algorithms will be trained and tested on a large national
database—Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (2012-2017)—collected by 37 U.S. states. The
study’s specific aims are to 1) compare the accuracy among logistic regression (LR) and two ML algorithms
(DNN and hybrid) of chronic stress exposures to predict PTB risk using area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUC); 2) compare the accuracy between race/ethnicity-combined and race/ethnicity-
specific models within LR, DNN, and hybrid algorithms; and 3) determine the extent of the importance of
chronic stressors to the predicted PTB risk in the best-performing algorithm using regression coefficients (for
LR) or SHAP values (for ML algorithm). Career development goals are to 1) develop expertise in stress
measurement in the context of maternal and child health, 2) acquire knowledge and skills in ML and the
analysis of large-scale data, and 3) cultivate health informatics-focused manuscript and grant preparation skills
for independence. Results from this study will contribute to preventing PTB among vulnerable pregnant women
via early screening with more accurate, data-informed tools to assess these patients’ chronic stress."
10830308,"SUMMARY
Gap junctions or “electrical synapses” mediate the flow of ions between neurons and are thus
essential to normal brain function. Circuit activity is defined by the selective placement of
electrical synapses between specific neurons and in particular cellular compartments.
Although much has been learned about the mechanisms that direct assembly of chemical
synapses between specific neurons, little is known of the pathways that drive the creation of
neuron-specific electrical synapses. With its stereotypical placement of gap junctions and
powerful tools for genetic analysis and imaging, the C. elegans motor circuit offers a unique
opportunity to investigate gap junction specificity. VA and VB motor neurons are connected via
gap junctions to command interneurons (AVA or AVB) that drive backward (VAàAVA) or
forward (VBàAVB) locomotion. Notably, VAàAVA gap junctions are placed on the VA axon
whereas VBàAVB gap junctions are positioned on VB cell soma. The UNC-4 transcription
factor functions in VAs to preserve VAàAVA electrical synapses; unc-4 mutants adopt
VAàAVB gap junctions on VA cell bodies and are thus unable to move backward. Thus, UNC-
4 regulates a transcriptional program that defines both the cellular compartment and neuron-
specificity of gap junction placement. We used VA-specific RNA-Seq data to reveal that UNC-
4 blocks expression of a phosphodiesterase, PDE-1, that degrades cAMP, and a neuropeptide
receptor, FRPR-17, that functions in a GaO pathway that antagonizes cAMP synthesis. Aim 1
tests the hypothesis that UNC-4 represses specific downstream targets to maintain cAMP
which in turn sustains VAàAVA gap junctions. Our RNA-Seq data revealed that another UNC-
4 target, the atypical kinesin VAB-8, is ectopically expressed in unc-4 mutant VAs where it
antagonizes normal trafficking of gap junction components into the VA axon. Aim 2 tests the
hypothesis that VAB-8 binds to microtubules to block the anterograde function of kinesins that
drive gap junction transport, thus, facilitating the formation of VAàAVB gap junctions on VA
cell soma. Aim 3 uses single molecule imaging techniques to test a “blockade” model in which
VAB-8 lacks ATPase/motor activity but binds to microtubules to impair gap junction export from
the cell soma. Although studies in cultured mammalian cells have implicated cAMP signaling
and trafficking in gap junction assembly, these pathways have not been tested for functional
roles in neuron-specific placement of electrical synapses in an intact nervous system. Thus,
our work with a model organism could provide important clues to fundamental processes
governing the formation electrical synapses in the human brain."

 About one in four myocardial infarction (MI) patients progress to develop congestive heart failure,
which has a 5-year mortality rate of 50%. The goal of this project is to understand post-MI roles of
neutrophils by establishing how this cell type transitions in phenotype during wound healing spanning
from inflammation to repair. We hypothesize that neutrophils undergo a temporal phenotype
evolution that includes influencing post-MI inflammation resolution and ECM organization.
Specific aim 1 will map neutrophil polarization phenotypes over the post-MI time course. Aim 2 will
test the hypothesis that neutrophils actively contribute to inflammation resolution. Aim 3 will test the
hypothesis that neutrophils actively contribute to extracellular matrix organization during scar
formation. Innovation lies in the evaluation of neutrophil subtypes post-MI, which will allow us to
connect early neutrophil cell physiology to late remodeling outcomes. Multi-discipline approaches will
be integrated to explore the mechanisms whereby neutrophils regulate remodeling. This study will
drive forward the understanding of the cellular basis of LV remodeling and identify novel intervention
targets directed at neutrophils."

10835937,"Antibody Secreting Cells (ASC), are the source of pathogenic autoantibodies in Systemic Lupus
Erythematosus (SLE). Despite ample evidence documenting profound abnormalities in the
generation of ASC in SLE and their correlation with active disease, little is still known regarding
their diversity, mechanisms of generation and regulatory programs. Our previous studies
document great phenotypic, functional, and molecular heterogeneity in human ASC and have
provided original insight into the contribution of different B cell precursors to the generation of
pathogenic ASC. Specifically, we described a large contribution of activated naïve B cells to
pathogenic ASC in severe SLE and COVID19 infection through extra-follicular differentiation.
Initial single cell (SC), studies provide an initial atlas of blood and bone marrow SLE B cell and
ASC and a roadmap to decipher the pathogenic and therapeutic implications of ASC diversity in
human disease. In this Project we will test the over-arching hypothesis that in order to fulfill
protective functions in primary and memory responses a healthy immune system has evolved
specialized differentiation pathways that determine the intensity, kinetics and longevity of diverse
ASC populations. Such precise regulation is subverted in SLE owing to intrinsic programs
(epigenetic) and extrinsic cues (microenvironment), determined by tissue-specific factors for local
and systemic responses (nephritis and BM , respectively). A central corollary is that the different
ASC populations will be differentially sensitive to therapies targeting separate B cell precursor
and their ASC progeny. These postulates will be addressed in a synergistic fashion with the other
PPG projects and Core B through 3 Aims: 1) Heterogeneity, origin, and fate of SLE ASC; 2)
Molecular Regulation of tissue-specific and systemic pathogenic ASC in SLE; and 3) Using B cell
targeting therapies to probe the origin, longevity and function of human ASC. Our studies will
greatly enhance our knowledge of human ASC biology and their dysregulation in SLE. The
information gained will also improve our ability to design safer and more effective therapies for
SLE and multiple antibody-mediated diseases and modulatory strategies to optimize protective
vaccine responses."

THIRD COAST CFAR CORE A : ADMINISTRATIVE CORE (AC)
The Administrative Core (AC) of the Third Coast Center for AIDS Research (TC CFAR) provides coordinating
leadership, management, communication, and networking for all HIV research across Northwestern University
and the University of Chicago, as well as collaborating effectively with Howard Brown Health (HBH),
AllianceChicago, AIDS Foundation of Chicago, the Chicago and Illinois Departments of Public Health and other
community partners. The AC is responsible for all strategic planning, assessment of progress of all Cores and
the Scientific Working Group (SWG), and input/feedback from internal and external stakeholders. Strategic
planning led to prioritization of the current Overall aims on improving care-prevention continuums, non-AIDS
comorbidities, and scientific innovation to improve HIV prevention and treatment of all conditions impacting
persons living with HIV (PLWH). The AC ensures that TC CFAR scientific Cores (Clinical Sciences Core, CSC;
Behavioral, Social and Implementation Sciences Core, BSISC; and Viral Pathogenesis Core, VPC) support
Overall aims with complementarity and synergy, avoiding overlap. The AC ensures they, and the Developmental
Core (DC), are well-resourced. The AC also works closely with the DC on mentoring and review processes that
enabled robust return on DC investment and competitive national funding of 16 administrative supplements (AS)
in the first term. The AC successfully built ongoing trans-disciplinary and cross-institutional research synergies.
Fiscal and administrative management responsibilities ensure that each Core meets its own specific aims and
strategic plans. The AC also stewards the generous institutional support, dedicating strongly to DC awards from
it. In the first 5 years, the AC led major growth. The OAR-determined allowable funded research base (FRB)
grew by almost 50%, with 33% of the PIs appearing on the allowable FRB for the first time in FY2018 having
previously received DC Awards. The allowable FRB grew by a similar percentage at NU and UC, an indicator
that the AC contributes fairly to HIV research growth across the multi-institution TC CFAR. The number of faculty
and their transdisciplinary interactions are increasing. The AC catalyzes collaborations that rapidly built strength
across the TC CFAR, locally with HBH and the health departments, and nationally as an implementation science
(IS) resource. This expertise, and AC vision, are contributing to DHHS’ Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) Initiative
in Chicago (through both BSISC and the Innovation and Implementation for Impact on EHE SWG) and nationally
(through 2 AS-funded projects: the Implementation Sciences Consultation, Collaboration, and Coordination
Initiative and the Inter-CFAR IS Working Group). A continuing focus for the AC is to strengthen and leverage
links already accelerating research productivity on comorbidities in HIV and scientific innovations. In the first
term, the AC made robust progress toward its goal (stated in the 2014 application) to “become a national model
for trans-institutional and trans-disciplinary collaborations that will add value to the research of all our
investigators.”"

THIRD COAST CFAR CORE B: DEVELOPMENTAL CORE (DC)
The Third Coast Center for AIDS Research (TC CFAR) Developmental Core (DC) serves as the foundation from
which members build new NIH-funded research that advances the Administrative Core (AC)-prioritized scientific
agenda. DC services enable and fuel each of the TC CFAR Overall aims. The DC provides a range of seed
funding mechanisms for all faculty (Core Subsidy Awards), faculty new to HIV research (Pilot Awards), our
scientific Cores (Core Resource Awards), and community partners (Community Collaborative and Community
Mini-Awards). DC has enabled success in competitions for administrative supplements (AS) and assists AC with
other mechanisms. In the first 5 years, more than $5.6 million was awarded via multiple DC mechanisms and
AS, with >$860,000 of that total contributed by NU and UC from institutional support. In less than 5 years, returns
on these investments have been strong. Projects on each of the 3 Overall aims have been funded by DC Awards
and Administrative Supplements; Overall aims 2 and 3 emerged from AC-led strategic planning more recently
than Overall aim 1. DC work proposed here adds to anticipated growth in DC-funded projects addressing Overall
aims 2 and 3. New entrants to HIV research, and trans-disciplinary submissions to the DC, have increased.
Community Collaborative Awards built relationships with HRSA-funded community partner organizations that,
along with learning from processes for Administrative Supplement proposal development, enabled a strong
response to the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) Initiative and the successful launch of new EHE Scientific
Working Group that is starting to seed more research-practice partnerships. Strong mentorship is another DC
service that contributes to junior faculty career development, is growing HIV research at University of Chicago,
and starting to improve representation of URM faculty across the CFAR. A new cross-institutional and cross-
disciplinary NHLBI-funded career development program (Third Coast HIV-related Cardiovascular and Sleep
Disorders K12 Career Development Program) is synergizing future growth of non-AIDS co-morbidities research
as well as our faculty’s careers. Junior faculty gain DC review panel experience, and the Core will now also
mentor a new co-director and give junior faculty achieving independent NIH funding leadership experience as a
rotating co-director. The DC also navigates CFAR members to resources that enhance proposal and project
development, including mentoring before and after DC submissions and mock study section reviews prior to NIH
submissions. The aims of this renewal are: (1) to provide seed funding to TC CFAR members, emphasizing early
stage investigators (ESI) and established faculty new to HIV research, to further enhance high priority HIV
research; (2) to inform and fund current and new community partners providing public health, prevention, and
care services, including those countering structural inequities driving the HIV epidemic; (3) to enhance career
development, and improve navigation to proposal-enhancing expertise for new entrants to HIV research and our
scientific priorities."

THIRD COAST CFAR CORE C: CLINICAL SCIENCES CORE (CSC)
In 2017, new HIV infections in Chicago decreased somewhat, and 92% of persons diagnosed with HIV were
linked to care within 12 months of diagnosis. However, major problems remain. Only 36% of persons living with
HIV (PLWH) in 2017 were retained in care, and only 48% achieved viral suppression. In addition, successes of
antiretroviral therapy (ART) have led to a rising population of older PLWH, which has made aging-related
comorbidities a proximate threat to well-suppressed PLWH and ultimately an increasing public health challenge.
Thus, the needs to improve real-world effectiveness of treatments, as well as HIV prevention, continue. The
Clinical Sciences Core (CSC) will intensify its support of research that addresses these problems, building on
infrastructure and linkages that we have created within and between Northwestern University (NU) and the
University of Chicago (UC). An expanding group of community organization partners also increases reach to
service providers, now notably including Howard Brown Health (HBH) that has expanded sites to areas of most
need and has a long commitment to the health of the LGBTQ community in Chicago. Offering CSC expertise
and services across disciplines and institutions is central to our mission and supports the development of new
scientific partnerships. This expertise includes human subjects research on streamlining ART and studying
aging-associated comorbidities and inflammation. Our accomplished and dynamic Clinical Informatics Group
(CIG) will continue advancing researcher access to sophisticated techniques for computation, analyses of
Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived data, and emerging digital tools for research participants. The CSC also
emphasizes disseminating research findings and best practices, as well as engaging with community-based
clinics and HIV screening programs. The long-term goal of the CSC is to significantly increase the number of
outstanding clinical investigators, and the trans-disciplinary resources available to them, in order to fuel
discoveries that will propel us towards the end of the HIV epidemic. The CSC’s specific aims to reach this goal
are to: 1) support clinical research that interacts with HIV-infected and at-risk participants, and/or obtains and
studies clinical data and specimens from them; 2) catalyze and support new research on non-AIDS
comorbidities, including clinical phenotyping and pathophysiology of inflammation and accelerated aging in HIV;
3) expand research collaborations and linkages among study participants, clinical HIV researchers, HIV care
providers, other implementation partners and trainees. In the next project period, the CSC commits to expanding
the scope and impact of research on non-AIDS comorbidities among PLWH on ART as a major contributor to
TC CFAR’s Overall aim 2. Each of the CSC specific aims contributes to Overall aim 2 on non-AIDS comorbidities,
and the intent is to increase the CSC users’ trans-disciplinary research on aging and comorbidities in HIV."

THIRD COAST CFAR CORE D: BEHAVIORAL, SOCIAL, AND IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE CORE
The Third Coast Center for AIDS Research (TC CFAR) Behavioral, Social, and Implementation Science Core
(BSISC) provides a robust infrastructure to enhance development, uptake, and sustainability of effective
interventions that improve the continuums of HIV prevention and care (TC CFAR Overall aim 1). BSISC
resources also support researchers who are addressing non-AIDS comorbidities (Overall aim 2) and innovations
to improve HIV prevention and treatment of persons living with HIV (Overall aim 3). BSISC users and its services
addressing Overall aims 2 and 3 are less numerous than those addressing Overall aim 1, and not less important.
BSISC emphasizes helping all TC CFAR members, and working across all Overall aims, to reach communities
most impacted by the HIV epidemic. This includes young men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender
women of color. The Core’s aims build on the successes of the prior funding period, including a strong, continuing
focus on implementation science (IS) to move research proven effective into practice at the scale needed.
Resources continuing with enhancement include a BSISC data analyst “embedded” on-site in the Chicago
Department of Public Health (CDPH) and the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) to facilitate rapid access
and analysis of epidemiological data from: 1) partner services; 2) case surveillance; 3) the Medical Monitoring
Project (MMP), a probability sample of HIV-positive persons representative of all receiving care in Chicago; and
4) National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (samples of MSM, high risk heterosexuals, and people who inject drugs).
BSISC also is now adapting or developing person (or patient)-reported outcomes (PROs) for HIV research,
leveraging a strength in research fields other than HIV at our institutions. PROs can enhance scaling up of PrEP
and ART interventions to improve continuums of prevention and care, as well as add new information to research
on non-AIDS comorbidities during ART. Quantitative/qualitative data analyses, IS consultations/trainings,
community engagement assistance, and the BSISC research participant registry (CHAMP) also are applicable
to research on all Overall aims. The BSISC specific aims are: (1) to expand data sources and analytic support
that drive innovative, multidisciplinary collaborations; (2) to provide consultation and training in implementation
science to HIV researchers and their implementation partners that will facilitate movement of evidence-based
HIV interventions into real-world practice; (3) To strengthen community participation in research, as well as
community-engaged research, dialog with the public, and information exchange among researchers."

Natural products (NPs) continue to inspire novel chemistry, enzymology, biology, and medicine. New omics
technologies and accompanying computational developments have fundamentally transformed the current
paradigm of NP research, revealing a tremendous diversity of NP biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that far
exceeds the number of known NPs. Most NP BGCs, however, are silent when the microorganisms are
cultured under standard laboratory conditions. In this MIRA renewal application, we propose to continue our
interdisciplinary program on NP research by leveraging the Actinobacterial Strain Collection and the Genome
Database at the Natural Products Discovery Center (NPDC), UF Scripps. Our hypotheses are: (i) genome
mining of the Actinobacterial Strain Collection and Genome Database will allow us to identify potential
producers of the targeted NP scaffolds and predict the structural novelty of the new NPs, (ii) genetic
manipulation of the most promising BGCs in their native producers or expression of them in designer
heterologous hosts will allow us to produce and isolate the new NPs in sufficient quantities for structural and
functional characterizations, and (iii) investigation of the biosynthetic machinery of these new NPs will allow us
to discover new chemistry and enzymology. The Actinobacterial Strain Collection at NPDC, consisting of
122,522 strains that were isolated over the last eight decades and from 69 different countries, encodes NP
diversities that are impossible to reproduce in laboratory settings today. We have completed sequencing
13,719 selected strains (as of May 2023), of which 10,495 genomes have been assembled and annotated.
These results, together with findings from the MIRA program, have cumulated into: (i) the establishment of C-
1027 and tiancimycin as model systems for enediyne NP biosynthesis, (ii) the establishment of leinamycin and
guangnanmycin as model systems for biosynthesis of the leinamycin family of NPs, (iii) the identification of
1,050 and 276 distinct BGCs, encoding new enediynes and new members of the leinamycin family of NPs,
respectively, and (iv) the development of a suite of enabling technologies to discover the target NPs and study
their biosynthetic machinery in native producers or designer heterologous hosts, setting the stage for the
proposed studies in this renewal application. The outcomes of this application include: (i) fundamental
contributions to genome mining and activation of large BGCs, in native producers and heterologous hosts, for
NP production and biosynthesis, (ii) discovery of new NPs, with privileged scaffolds, to inspire new chemistry,
biology, and medicine, and (iii) new insights into biosynthetic machineries and novel chemistry and
enzymology for the biosynthesis of enediynes and the leinamycin family of NPs. The long-term goal of our
research is to understand at a molecular level how microorganisms synthesize complex NPs and to exploit this
knowledge to discover novel NPs to impact chemistry, biology, and medicine."

In sexually reproducing organisms, meiosis reduces the chromosome complement by half to generate haploid
gametes. During meiosis, homologous chromosomes undergo pairing, synapsis, recombination, and faithful
segregation. As such, defects in meiosis are a leading cause of both infertility and birth defects in humans. While
a large number of meiosis-specific factors are involved, ubiquitously expressed factors also play critical roles.
The meiotic process is generally conserved from single-cell eukaryotes to multicellular metazoans; however,
species-specific meiosis factors and functions have evolved. Our genomic and proteomic screens have identified
a large number of novel mammalian meiosis factors and we plan to determine the molecular function of a number
of key factors in the regulation of meiosis in both sexes. Meiotic recombination is essential for genome integrity
in gametes and critical for genome evolution by increasing genetic diversity at the population level. Meiotic
recombination begins with formation of meiotic DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). There are major knowledge
gaps in our understanding of this meiotic process. One main challenge is to understand the mechanism that
prevents meiotic DSB formation from getting out of control. Only a subset of the meiotic DSBs are processed
into crossovers by a large protein network. What is the molecular mechanism underlining the crosstalk in this
protein network? What additional proteins are involved in the processing of DSBs into crossovers? In many
species, chromosomal synapsis is tightly coupled with meiotic recombination. However, the process of synapsis
initiation and maintenance remains poorly understood. These challenges will be tackled in this application
through deciphering novel molecular networks underlying regulation of mammalian meiosis. Our innovative
combination of genetic, genomic, proteomic, cell/molecular biological, and biochemical approaches will focus on
the following critical but challenging aspects of meiosis: initiation of meiotic DNA double strand breaks, regulation
of meiotic recombination, initiation and maintenance of chromosomal synapsis, and origin of sex chromosome
aneuploidy. Completion of the proposed studies will provide novel mechanistic insights into key meiotic
processes, identify new candidate fertility factors, and elucidate the molecular etiology of sex chromosome
aneuploidy."

 Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), are severe, life-threatening
immunologically mediated adverse drug reactions representing the same disease across a spectrum of severity.1
There is currently no evidence-based standard of care treatment for SJS/TEN. Preventive efforts have been
fueled by strong associations between the HLA Class I allele HLA-B*15:02 which has led to implementation of
cost-effective pre-treatment genetic screening programs in many Southeast Asian countries.2,3 However, the
lower prevalence (<1%) and negative predictive value of this HLA allele in European American, Hispanic
American, and African American populations, and the lack of currently defined HLA associations with drugs
commonly used and associated with SJS/TEN in the United States has left many evidence gaps and
implementation hurdles.4 The scientific premise of this study is that the most efficacious treatment will
impact cellular immune responses mediating, related biomarkers and clinical outcomes of SJS/TEN. We
have assembled the North American Therapeutics in Epidermal Necrolysis Syndrome (NATIENS) study,
a group of 22 sites across the United States to conduct the first multicenter double-blind double dummy
randomized controlled assessment of cyclosporine or etanercept or supportive care. The controlled
design will afford the opportunity to collect and assay multiple samples in each treatment arm, in both
the acute and convalescent phase, with the aim to discover new strategies for prevention, early
diagnosis and targeted treatment. We will use integrated multi-omic, single-cell and high-throughput
in-vitro screening approaches to determine the genetic basis, immunopathology and antigen specificity
of drug-induced SJS/TEN. In Specific Aim 1 we will establish the most clinically effective therapy for SJS/TEN
through the NATIENS multi-centered, double-blind double-dummy randomized controlled trial with a planned
accrual of 267 patients over 5 enrollment years to determine whether etanercept and/or cyclosporine have
benefit over supportive care for the measured primary outcome of complete re-epithelialization. In Specific Aim
2 we will use genome-wide sequencing, high-resolution HLA sequencing, transcriptomic, and cytokine profiling
to identify genetic and biological markers that predict risk and outcome for SJS/TEN. In Specific Aim 3 We will
study the immune phenotype of cells in the skin, blister fluid and peripheral blood in acute SJS/TEN based on
single-cell RNA and protein expression. Using the dominantly represented T-cell receptor (TCR) in the blister
fluid we will use a high throughput in-vitro screening approach to identify specific epitopes recognized by CD8+
T cells at the site of SJS/TEN tissue damage.5 Our study will be the first to examine in a double-blind
randomized controlled design both management and mechanisms of SJS/TEN. This will lead to new ways
to prevent, diagnosis and treat SJS/TEN, and will create a roadmap and evidence-base for studies of serious
immunologically-mediated adverse drug reactions and other immunologically-mediated diseases."
10836470,"Protein S (PS), a plasma anticoagulant, is vital for the maintenance of hemostasis.
Deficiencies or abnormalities in PS can lead to thrombotic conditions such as pulmonary
embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and acute small blood vessel coagulation. PS is a non-
enzymatic cofactor for Activated Protein C and for Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor. Recently,
we discovered that PS inhibits procoagulant FIXa. This significant finding likely explains the
thrombotic pathology associated with PS deficiency. Thus, we seek to derive a complete
understanding of the interaction between FIXa and PS and to establish the explicit importance
of the PS-FIXa interaction, exclusive of PS interactions with APC and TFPI. Identification of the
biochemical details of PS-FIXa interaction will enable development a small derivative of PS that
could treat individuals who have excess FIXa activity (and excess blood clotting) and PS
deficiencies or abnormalities.
 We have pinpointed the PS binding site to FIXa’s heparin-binding site and identified HBE
residues necessary for PS-FIXa binding. We have established that the Gla and EGF domains of
FIXa contribute to the stability of the interaction with PS, and we discovered that the isolated
Laminin G1+2 domains of PS are effective inhibitors of FIXa.
 For this project, we will use the following in vivo and in vitro approaches to achieve a
thorough understanding of the interaction of PS with FIXa: (1) Confirm PS domains required for
FIXa inhibition, (2) Identify PS residues required for FIXa inhibition, and (3) Define the in vivo
interaction of FIXa with PS LG domains and single-site LG domain mutants. The molecular and
biochemical knowledge obtained from this study will provide the basis for creation of a PS-
derived FIXa-inhibiting molecule for the treatment of thrombotic conditions caused by PS
deficiency or upregulation of FIXa."

10837058,"Project Summary/Abstract
A large and rapidly growing majority of American Indian/Alaska Native (AI) families now reside in urban areas.
Although they experience severe health disparities associated with substance abuse, risky sexual behavior,
depression and suicide, few evidence-based prevention interventions address their distinctive needs. Family
disruption, stresses due to migration and poverty, and cultural and social losses are often implicated in adverse
health outcomes for urban AI families. By improving effective parenting skills and overall family functioning,
culturally grounded parenting interventions enable parents to model and promote their children's well-being
and reduce their children’s vulnerability to risk behaviors. The proposed study extends the project team's prior
research on a culturally grounded parenting intervention for urban AIs, Parenting in 2 Worlds (P2W), which
was co-developed with a coalition of urban Indian non-profit organizations, tested in three Arizona cities, and
demonstrated efficacious. The research team joins two AI and two non-AI investigators, who together have
extensive experience conducting collaborative research with AI populations in urban and tribal settings. This
proposed multi-regional study will create new knowledge in four areas. First, the study will test P2W’s
effectiveness beyond Arizona in improving parenting and family functioning, among a wider and more diverse
group of urban AI communities located in cities spread across four regions: Northeast (Buffalo/Niagara),
Midwest (St. Paul/Minneapolis), Mountain (Denver), and Southwest (Phoenix). Through the auspices of
collaborating urban Indian center partners, the trial will recruit 720 families of AI youth age 12-17 (180 per city)
and individually randomize them to receive P2W or an informational family health curriculum. Second, the
study will test for moderators of the effectiveness of P2W, whether desired outcomes vary by the level of
socioeconomic vulnerability, experiences of historical loss, or AI cultural identity of the parent participants.
Third, the study will expand on the original Arizona trial to examine the adolescent’s reports on family
functioning and an enlarged range of youth health behaviors potentially impacted by the P2W intervention,
including mental health (depressive symptoms, suicidality) as well as substance use and risky sexual
behaviors. Fourth, the study will test for mediation—whether positive changes in parenting and family
functioning that result from P2W lead to changes in the youth health behaviors. This would be the first cross-
site multiregional trial of a culturally grounded parenting intervention designed specifically for urban AIs. It will
advance critical knowledge on community prevention interventions for an under-served group severely affected
by health disparities, and establish whether urban Indian centers and their communities can readily employ
P2W to strengthen urban AI families and promote the behavioral health of their youth. It will also provide a
foundation for advancing knowledge on effective prevention interventions in urban AI communities that have
different migration histories and tribal compositions."
10837059,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that results in the destruction of the insulin-producing β cells
of the pancreas. The timeline of T1D development and progression is heterogenous with diagnosis occuring at
a few years of age in some patients versus other patients having autoantibodies for years before diagnosis. In
T1D, immune dysregulation occurs leading to autoantibody production, immune cell infiltration into the islets
(insulitis), and eventual loss of β cells. The events that occur within the β cell during this time and the resulting
impacts on β cell function remain unknown. The goal of this proposal is to determine how β cells function
during the course of T1D development, particularly during the critical early, asymptomatic stages.
Understanding these functional changes within β cells or islets is critical for a complete understanding of
disease progression and for the identification of possible therapeutic targets. The overall objective of my
proposal is to use live pancreas tissue slices to explore how β cells function during T1D development,
specifically I will identify the role immune cell infiltration plays in β cell dysfunction and loss. Live pancreas
tissue slices are ideal for these studies because these samples keep the islet in its native microenvironment
and preserve the extant tissue pathologies, allowing for studies of both β cell function and immune cell
populations. I hypothesize that immune dysregulation early in T1D progression results in dysfunction of the β
cell glucose metabolism pathway primarily mediated by mitochondrial stress, resulting in MHC class I
hyperexpression and increased β cell visibility to the immune system. To test this hypothesis, live pancreas
tissue slices generated from human organ donor tissue will be used and complemented by slices made from
pancreata of mouse models of T1D. Confocal microscopy techniques will be used to determine the degree of
insulitis within the tissue while islet function is simultaneously assessed. Additional functional assessments
such as perifusion experiments followed by insulin ELISAs and gene expression will be employed to look at
function in greater detail. The first part of this proposal focuses on assessments conducted to determine the
impacts of in situ immune cells on β cell function. To gain more control over the disease timeline, particularly to
investigate the earliest stages of disease, HLA-matched T cell avatars will be introduced to control human
pancreas tissue slices, creating an insulitic environment. Disease initiation and progression will be studied
further through adoptive transfer experiments with splenocytes from NOD mouse models. Progression to T1D
will be monitored with live pancreas tissue slices being made as disease develops. Functionality assessments
and immune cell studies will be conducted as discussed above. I expect the contribution of the proposed
research will be the identification of the role that immune dysregulation plays in β cell dysfunction as well as
the mechanistic origination of β cell dysfunction. This will provide critical information about how T1D develops
and will indicate possible therapeutic targets to halt disease progression."
10837072,"Defects in motor neuron (MN) function or survival result in severe human pathologies, such as amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy, with distinct MN subtypes differing in susceptibility to disease.
There is currently no effective treatment for MN disorders in part due to a lack of understanding of the
molecular mechanisms that allow distinct MN subtypes to acquire and maintain their function-defining
properties. Thus, basic research in model organisms such as nematodes, flies, and mice is needed to reveal
such mechanisms. MN subtype function is endowed by the differential expression of terminal identity genes.
Such genes encode proteins (e.g., ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, neuropeptides, trans-membrane
receptors, adhesion molecules) that are expressed continuously, from the last steps of development through
adulthood, and thereby define the unique functional features of a given MN subtype. Hence, revealing the
molecular mechanisms that induce (during development) and maintain (throughout life) expression of terminal
identity genes will help us understand how MNs become and remain functional, a key goal in the fields of MN
development and disease. A remarkable wealth of terminal identity markers is available for all cholinergic MN
subtypes of the C. elegans nerve cord that control locomotion, providing a unique model system to elucidate
how MNs acquire and maintain their functional features. Leveraging these tools, we discovered that the
conserved Collier/Olf/Ebf-type transcription factor (TF) UNC-3 is required for the continuous function of all
these cholinergic MN subtypes, and that this outcome arises from UNC-3-dependent induction and
maintenance of MN subtype-specific terminal identity genes. Through unbiased genetic screens, we recently
identified several conserved regulatory factors (6 TFs, 2 chromatin factors) that control the terminal identity of
individual MN subtypes. Intriguingly, our preliminary results suggest that while UNC-3 activates expression of
all MN subtype-specific terminal identity genes, these regulatory factors counteract the activator function of
UNC-3 by repressing UNC-3 targets in specific MN subtypes. These observations suggest a general principle

are repressed in a MN subtype-specific fashion by distinct TFs and chromatin factors. To test this hypothesis
within the 5-year R01 timeframe, this proposal will focus on one TF (BNC-1/mammalian BNC1-2) and one
chromatin factor (PBRM-1/mammalian BAF180) that counteract UNC-3 in different MN subtypes. Specifically,
we seek to: (a) determine whether these two factors are required throughout life to secure subtype identity
(Aim 1), (b) define the mechanism underlying the repressor activity of BNC-1 (Aim 2), and (c) decipher the
function of PBRM-1 by identifying its downstream targets (Aim 3). The proposed experiments will establish a

as a valuable entry point to understand how mammalian MNs become and remain functional."

lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy, with distinct MN subtypes differing in susceptibility to disease.
There is currently no effective treatment for MN disorders in part due to a lack of understanding of the
molecular mechanisms that allow distinct MN subtypes to acquire and maintain their function-defining
properties. Thus, basic research in model organisms such as nematodes, flies, and mice is needed to reveal
such mechanisms. MN subtype function is endowed by the differential expression of terminal identity genes.
Such genes encode proteins (e.g., ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, neuropeptides, trans-membrane
receptors, adhesion molecules) that are expressed continuously, from the last steps of development through
adulthood, and thereby define the unique functional features of a given MN subtype. Hence, revealing the
molecular mechanisms that induce (during development) and maintain (throughout life) expression of terminal
identity genes will help us understand how MNs become and remain functional, a key goal in the fields of MN
development and disease. A remarkable wealth of terminal identity markers is available for all cholinergic MN
subtypes of the C. elegans nerve cord that control locomotion, providing a unique model system to elucidate
how MNs acquire and maintain their functional features. Leveraging these tools, we discovered that the
conserved Collier/Olf/Ebf-type transcription factor (TF) UNC-3 is required for the continuous function of all
these cholinergic MN subtypes, and that this outcome arises from UNC-3-dependent induction and
maintenance of MN subtype-specific terminal identity genes. Through unbiased genetic screens, we recently
identified several conserved regulatory factors (6 TFs, 2 chromatin factors) that control the terminal identity of
individual MN subtypes. Intriguingly, our preliminary results suggest that while UNC-3 activates expression of
all MN subtype-specific terminal identity genes, these regulatory factors counteract the activator function of
UNC-3 by repressing UNC-3 targets in specific MN subtypes. These observations suggest a general principle

10837073,"Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective antidepressant non-invasive brain stimulation
therapies for adults with major depression. However, a number of patients fail to respond despite adequate trials,
and while clinically beneficial, ECT can produce adverse cognitive effects including amnesia, executive
dysfunction, and verbal dysfluency. Previous single- and multi-site ECT-imaging investigations have been limited
by insufficient sample size and/or non-standardization of methodology. Therefore, in answer to NIMH Strategic
Objective 3.2 “Develop strategies for tailoring existing interventions to optimize outcomes,” our investigative
teams have conducted clinical studies to develop standardized methods for acute ECT course administration,
antidepressant and cognitive measures for phenotyping, optimal neuroimaging protocols and E-field modeling,
and sophisticated analytic models to integrate and interpret the antidepressant-response and cognitive-
impairment biomarkers. In this prospective study we propose the first investigation integrating multiple units of
analysis including clinical and cognitive phenotyping, whole-brain neuroimaging, EEG, and E-field modeling to
establish the mechanisms underlying ECT-induced antidepressant response (response biomarkers) and
cognitive adverse effects (safety biomarkers), as well as to find the “sweet spot” of ECT dosing for optimal
antidepressant benefit and cognitive safety. Adult patients with major depressive disorder (n = 230) will receive
a standardized acute ECT course, complete clinical and cognitive measures and undergo structural and
functional MRI at three time points (baseline, after ECT #6, and following treatment completion) and one-month
naturalistic follow-up. All MRI data will be processed and harmonized identically at a central imaging core to
ensure uniformity. We have three primary aims: 1) Determine the relationships between E-field strength, ictal
power, and biomarkers; 2) Determine the relationships between E-field strength, biomarkers, and antidepressant
outcomes; and 3) Determine the relationships between E-field strength, biomarkers, and cognitive outcomes. An
exploratory aim will contrast antidepressant-response and cognitive-impairment biomarkers identified in the
current proposal with magnetic seizure therapy and healthy comparison subjects. The overarching hypothesis
of this investigation is that the E-field variability will explain antidepressant and cognitive outcomes.
Public Health Significance: Successful completion of this project will verify the optimal ECT dose (the “sweet
spot”) of 112 V/m within the right hippocampus which can then inform precision and individualization of ECT
amplitude with “E-field informed ECT”. The standardized algorithms for E-field modeling can be generalized and
widely disseminated. This proposal will result in a paradigm shift from “trial and error” approaches of ECT
parameter selection to individualized, precision dosing to improve patient outcomes."
10837074,"We propose to continue years 21-25 of a brain imaging and drug abuse postdoctoral T32 training program. We
support this training via a variety of brain imaging tools that have yielded valuable insights into addictive disorders
and related cognition. The need for such a dedicated program is driven by the emergence of innovative imaging
techniques to evaluate both the anatomical and functional aspects of the brain under a variety of conditions
related to substance use including acute intoxicating effects, cue-induced craving, cognitive effects, persistent
neurological and cognitive defects, withdrawal, sleep disturbances, medication compliance, treatment progress
and medications development. Because the nature and spectrum of the disciplines involved in imaging are broad
and complex, a new breed of scientists with experience in imaging technology, multimodal analyses,
neuroscience, pharmacology, addiction medicine and treatment is needed to more fully explore the
neurobiological bases of drug abuse and fill the anticipated needs in the United States—our Training Program
has been filling this void. Over the past 19 years we have successfully directed an integrated, multidisciplinary
Drug Abuse and Brain Imaging Training Program that is supported by the outstanding environments offered by
McLean Hospital/Harvard Medical School and by the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at the MGH. We
have trained 26 scientists over this period and all but one remains in the field. Our program emphasizes both
clinical and translational research career development paths that have solid foundations in magnetic resonance
[imaging, functional and spectroscopy], EEG, PET and Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). The training program
infrastructure is built around two Siemens 3T clinical scanners (Prisma and new Trio upgrade to Prisma), a
Varian 4T clinical scanner, a 9.4T small bore animal scanner, low- and high-density EEG/ERP and an Imagent
NIRS system. Animal and clinical PET as well as 7T MRI are available at the Martinos Center. Our program also
supports the hardware and offers training in how to analyze big data including working with datasets from the
Human Connectome Project (HCP) and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) program. Our
mentors are well funded by NIDA, NIAAA, and NIMH and so offer a unique breadth of research opportunities for
our trainees. The program is designed to provide 2-3 years of training on the basics of imaging techniques as
well as fundamental elements of drug abuse and psychiatry, followed by placement in one of four research tracks
tailored to each trainee’s specific career goals: 1) Technology and Instrumentation; 2) Basic-Clinical; 3)
Clinical/Treatment; and 4) Translational. The combination of didactic training in brain imaging and
psychopharmacology with practical applications in a variety of highly successful research laboratories provide s
our trainees with the skills to utilize a broad range of brain imaging techniques as they embark on the next decade
of research into how drugs and alcohol affect the brain."

 Administrative Core
We established CHERISH (Center for Health Economics of Treatment Interventions for Substance Use
Disorder, HCV, and HIV) as a National Center of Excellence for health economic research related to substance
use disorder policy and HCV and HIV care of people who use substances. Our unique multi-institutional center
leverages outstanding researchers with synergistic areas of expertise including health economics, health
services research, addiction medicine, clinical research, simulation modeling, and dissemination science. In
this renewal period, we propose to build on these successes and initiate new activities to expand our scope.
While continuing to support economic analyses of individual-level interventions, we will expand our focus to
add economic components, develop economic methodologies, and improve knowledge translation strategies
for outcome and implementation research that is conducted at the individual, system, and community levels.
The specific aims of the Administrative Core are 1) to provide leadership, management structure, and
resources to ensure successful cross-institutional and cross-Core coordination and evaluation of Center
activities, and 2) to support CHERISH researchers and Research Affiliates in promoting Center activities,
research, and funding opportunities, and to serve as a national resource to researchers interested in heath
economics of substance use disorder treatment and HCV and HIV care of people who use substances. The
Administrative Core will be innovative in the way that it uses web-based technologies to support formal and
informal research interactions that cross locations and disciplines. We use an administrative tracking system to
monitor and evaluate the Center’s progress toward meeting its objectives. We will continue to highlight
CHERISH activities through regular blog and news posts, a newsletter, and frequent social media
engagement. We will promote and support activities of the other Cores including the Research Affiliates
program, CHERISH/LDI Issue Briefs, research and mentoring networks, pilot grant awards, and trainings and
workshops. These activities will continue to support a highly productive and interactive environment that will
enhance existing research projects and develop a new cohort of investigators with the skills needed to conduct
substance use disorder economic research that will have an impact on substance use disorder, HCV, and HIV
treatment policy."
10839858,"The Molecular Biology Core is a critical component of the NIDA P30 Center at Temple
University. The Molecular Core offers services to investigators that involve either short- or long-
term use of molecular techniques. This Core provides three types of services. First, the Core
supports the design and construction of molecular constructs for the expression of genes of
interest. This will include, for example, the expression either in vitro or in vivo of opioid or
cannabinoid receptors. These molecular constructs will permit a variety of studies of interest to
collaborating investigators including the analysis of receptor-mediated signaling processes and
the analysis of the cellular trafficking of receptors (or other genes of interest). Second, the
Molecular Biology Core will provide gene expression analysis both in vitro and in vivo. The Core
provides highly quantitative analysis of mRNA and miRNA expression using RT-PCR, northern
blot analysis, RNase protection analysis, and new to this renewal application, the novel FISH
flow (PrimeFlow) analysis. The Core also offers comprehensive transcription factor function
analyses. Third, the Core provides genotyping services for the Animal Core and to other
investigators breeding mutant animals. Services are provided for investigators who span a
variety of disciplines and work is carried out in direct collaboration with the investigator. The
Molecular Biology Core is particularly interested in continuing efforts to promote the use of
molecular techniques to study the role of drugs of abuse in the host-parasite interaction with
HIV. The Core has been highly successful in engaging NIH-funded investigators from many
disciplines in collaborative research projects that have advanced the understanding of the
actions of drugs of abuse and their interplay with the immune system and with HIV. By
combining the expertise of investigators with diverse interests, new perspectives and potentially
novel investigations can be developed."
10839861,"The Pilot Project Core will provide critical support for new initiatives and feasibility studies to test
new hypotheses and generate novel data in the field of substance abuse, pain and addiction
research, and the intersection of drugs of abuse with HIV. Research that is supported ranges
over a variety of disciplines and techniques including molecular, pharmacological, physiological,
immunological, and behavioral. Projects involve a variety of drug classes including opioids,
cannabinoids, psychostimulants, alcohol and nicotine. The amount of support is sufficient to
allow the testing of new ideas and accumulating data that can be used to form the basis for an
application for external funding. In addition to the actual dollars supporting the project, the
investigators are encouraged to make use of the expertise and the facilities of the Research
Support Cores of the NIDA P30 Center. Use of the Research Support Cores allows those
carrying out a Pilot Project to expand their areas of expertise by receiving assistance with new
techniques and approaches with which they may be unfamiliar, and to receive mentoring from
the Core faculty. In the previous funding period, three projects/year were supported by the Pilot
Projects Core, resulting in a recently awarded NIDA R01 as well as other submitted grant
applications, several publications, and presentations at national and regional meetings.
Potential applicants are solicited by general and targeted announcements to faculty at Temple
University and to faculty of other institutions through professional list-serves. Applications for
pilot project support are evaluated by a sub-committee of P30 Center faculty and are judged on
their innovation and significance of the research question and approach, the probability that
sufficient outcomes will be obtained to serve as preliminary data for an independent grant
application, and the strength of the integration with the aims of the NIDA P30 Center. Special
consideration is given to early career investigators and to investigators new to the field of
substance abuse research. Progress is evaluated via informal and frequent discussions of
progress and formal reports from awardees. It is anticipated that three pilot projects will be
supported directly by the Pilot Project Core each year, including at least two new projects per
year."
10839866,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The Administrative Core will oversee operations of the Mayo Clinic P20 Center “Renal macrophages in the
pathogenesis of human urinary stones and Randall’s plaque formation in mice” and serve as the
interface between diverse Center activities and CAIRIBU, the Urology Centers Program, NIDDK, the Mayo
Clinic administrative structure, and the Urology Research Community. The Administrative Core will also
interact with an External Advisory Committee, whose members’ expertise will complement the Center
administrative and programmatic leadership. The Administrative Core will be responsible for executing the
Center’s communication plan, thereby disseminating our ongoing research findings and resources for urinary
stone research to the urology research community. The Core will also coordinate interactions with CAIRIBU
and the Urology Centers Program via the bimonthly Center Leaders meetings, CAIRIBU annual meeting, and
CIRIBU Interactions Core. To further catalyze USD research, the Administrative Core will oversee the Center’s
Education Enrichment Programs. The Core will identify potential collaborators. Key components of the
Educational Enrichment Program include ongoing seminar series with Urology, Nephrology and
Physiology/Biomedical Engineering at Mayo, as well as an annual kidney stone retreat hosted at Mayo Clinic.
Over the last 12 years, the Mayo Clinic has also actively engaged 47 bright young students in our Kidney
Stone research programs via our nephrology/urology summer undergraduate research fellowship (nuSURF)
program. Moreover, Mayo Clinic offers opportunities to encourage research through an endourology fellowship
program designed to promote academic urologists and future leaders in the field.

10839868,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Urinary stone disease (USD) is the 3rd most common urological disease in men and women. Prevention of
USD and its associated costs and morbidity requires an understanding of early and late USD pathogenesis.
Emerging evidence suggests pathophysiological interactions between intrarenal crystal nucleation, growth, and
phagocytic cellular responses may play a key but unrecognized role in USD. Studies in vitro demonstrate that
calcium phosphate (CaP) and calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals induce renal tubular and phagocytic cellular
secretion of cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular vesicles (EVs; exosomes and microvesicles). These
biomarkers can attract blood or residential monocytes and convert monocytes into pro (M1) or anti (M2)-
inflammatory macrophages (Mφ ’s ). Observations in experimental animal models and human tissues suggest
that renal tissue monocytes and Mφ ’s can phagocytose and metabolize intrarenal crystals, and urinary stone
formers appear to have increased medullary M1 and decreased M2 Mφ populations. In a hyperoxaluric mouse
model, suppression of monocyte to M2 Mφ conversion significantly increased intrarenal CaOx deposition. Our
studies also demonstrated that urinary excretion of EVs bearing inflammatory markers derived from specific
segments of renal tubules were significantly lower in idiopathic calcium stone formers (ICSFs) compared to
controls. Thus, multiple lines of evidence suggest that tubular and monocyte derived Mφ populations can
phagocytose and degrade crystals as a crystal clearance mechanism, and defects in these clearance
mechanisms could promote interstitial Randall’s plaque (RP) and/or collecting duct plug (CDP) formation. The
proposed research project is designed to evaluate the role of Mφ ’s in RP and CDP formation using a novel
hypercalciuric claudin-2 global knockout mouse model (over 3-24 months age) that resembles the phenotype of
patients with idiopathic hypercalciuria and USD (Aim 1), and to define the frequency and spatial distribution of
monocyte/ Mφ populations in carefully phenotyped ICSFs (20-70 years) with hydroxyapatite, brushite, and
calcium oxalate stones plus varying amounts of RP (Aim 2). The proposed innovative study will elucidate the
role of renal medullary pro-and anti-inflammatory phagocytic cells in the development of RP, CDP, and USD
and whether urinary cytokines, chemokines or EVs carrying biomarkers of pro-/anti-inflammatory phagocytic
cells can be used to non-invasively monitor intrarenal crystal deposition. Completion of this study will also
facilitate the formation of a skilled multidisciplinary team including a promising early-stage surgeon-scientist (Dr
Kevin Koo) under the mentorship of an experienced and skilled USD clinical and researcher (Dr. Lieske). The
resulting preliminary data will provide evidence of the effectiveness of our team. This work will also enable
submission of future detailed grant or center proposals that will extend these mechanistic studies, and has
great potential to elucidate underlying pathogenic steps in USD genesisto identify novel therapeutic targets."
10839892,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Methodology Core
This Core focuses on economic evaluation approaches, tools, and measures to support new and existing
interdisciplinary research collaborations. Despite decades of research supporting a chronic disease approach
to substance use disorder treatment and recovery, uptake and sustainment remain low. Some of the most
important factors inhibiting adoption of evidence-based practices are concerns about the potential burden on
staff and other resources, as well as overall budget impact. Changing current practices requires not only
clinical evidence, but also consideration of additional costs and the reallocation of existing resources that will
result from the changes. Economic analysis can directly address these issues by providing a detailed
accounting of the costs to the provider of updating services, and more broadly inform “real-world” resource
allocation decisions by providing policymakers and payers with evidence on the net economic and health
impact of new approaches and their fiscal viability over time. This requires considering both costs and
consequences of a new intervention, often using a cost-effectiveness or cost-benefit analysis framework. The
overall aim of CHERISH (Center for Health Economics of Treatment Interventions for Substance Use Disorder,
HCV, and HIV) is to develop and disseminate economic evidence that informs substance use disorder policy
and HCV and HIV care of people who use substances. In this renewal period we will expand our focus to
outcome and implementation research that is conducted at the individual, system, and community levels with
the following specific aims: 1) to guide researchers in the design, implementation, and interpretation of
economic analyses of treatment for substance use disorder, and HCV and HIV among people who use
substances, and 2) to develop and apply methods that support economic evaluations for substance use
disorder, and HCV and HIV among people who use substances with a focus on intervention implementation
and adaptive interventions. Through the CHERISH Consultation Service and Research Affiliates Program, we
will contribute to the development of new grant proposals with explicit economic aims, and will continue to
connect with and advise qualifying researchers nationally to ensure that planned economic analyses are
methodologically sound and feasible. We will expand the CHERISH Research Affiliates program so it can
serve as a nationally-representative virtual community for researchers engaged in substance use disorder
treatment health economic research. Working with existing studies and integrating data from third-party
datasets and administrative records, we will develop analytic frameworks and tools for evaluating individual
and systems-level substance use disorder and related implementation interventions. We will also develop
economic evaluation methods for adaptive interventions. In collaboration with the Population Data & Modeling
Core, we will assist researchers in using external data to enhance interpretation of economic evaluation
results."
10839894,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Population Data & Modeling Core (PDMC)
At this time, overdose deaths reduce US life expectancy and we are spending more than $500 billion per year
on treating substance use disorders and their medical consequences. Considering the wide spectrum of
clinical and economic consequences of substance use, the U. faces a “syndemic” of substance use disorder,
HIV, HCV, and bacterial infections. In response, we propose to replace the former HCV & HIV Core with a
Population Data & Modeling Core (PDMC) that has a broader mission to use secondary data and modeling to
address population outcomes of this syndemic. One powerful approach to measuring economic value is using
“big data” from the real world. Linked administrative records and data repositories from electronic health
records compliment traditional prospective study designs and are an essential tool for health economics
research. Administrative and clinical records are still more powerful when coupled to simulation models.
Simulation models can integrate the most up-to-date knowledge about the epidemiology and natural history of
substance use disorders, treatment outcomes, and resource utilization to make policy-relevant insights about
treatment and care. The overall aim of CHERISH (Center for Health Economics of Treatment Interventions for
Substance Use Disorder, HCV, and HIV) is to develop and disseminate economic evidence that informs
substance use disorder policy and HCV and HIV care of people who use substances. In this renewal period we
will expand our focus to outcome and implementation research that is conducted at the individual, system, and
community levels with the following specific aims: 1) to promote the use of population data from linked
administrative and clinical records in conducting community-level economic evaluations of treatment and care
for substance use disorder, and HCV and HIV among people who use substances, and 2) to advance the
application of simulation modeling methods to evaluations of the economic and population outcomes of
substance use disorder, HCV, and HIV treatment for people who use substances. We will also leverage our
unique expertise working with linked state-level administrative data across multiple state agencies in
Massachusetts to help establish best practices for building and using similar databases in other states. We will
collaborate with colleagues to create and sustain a network of researchers who employ simulation models to
inform the response to the opioid crisis. We will sponsor an annual working group meeting, publish
manuscripts identifying best practices for simulating substance use disorder and the transmission of HCV and
HIV among people who inject drugs, and work closely with the Dissemination & Policy Core to develop best
practices for translating simulation model outcomes into actionable policy messages."
10839896,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Dissemination & Policy Core
Since CHERISH was established in 2015, economic research to inform policymakers and the public regarding
treatments for substance use disorder, HCV, and HIV has only increased in importance. Substance use
disorder has claimed the attention of mass media and policy makers, but large gaps remain in the translation
and use of evidence. Although economic evidence can help bridge this gap by addressing costs, tradeoffs, and
sustainability of best practices, research must address stakeholders’ priorities to have policy and public health
impact. Findings must be communicated effectively to the right audience, in the right format, at the right time.
To meet these needs, the CHERISH Dissemination & Policy Core uses the tools of dissemination science to
assess, facilitate, and build researchers’ and stakeholders’ capacities to exchange knowledge. In this renewal,
the Core will expand its role as a knowledge broker and translation capacity builder connecting researchers
and stakeholders, and we will directly assist research teams. Our affiliation with the Leonard Davis Institute of
Health Economics at the University of Pennsylvania brings deep expertise in translation and dissemination of
health policy research – including engaging stakeholders and researchers in settings that build expertise in
dissemination science theory and practice, promote information exchange, and leverage clinical experience in
treatment of SUD, HCV, and HIV. The overall aim of CHERISH (Center for Health Economics of Treatment
Interventions for Substance Use Disorder, HCV, and HIV) is to develop and disseminate economic evidence
that informs substance use disorder policy and HCV and HIV care of people who use substances. In this
renewal period we will expand our focus to outcome and implementation research conducted at the individual,
system, and community-levels with the following specific aims: 1) to engage stakeholders and health
economics researchers in information exchange and translate health economic research results addressing
substance use disorder treatment policy and HCV and HIV care for people who use substances, and 2) to build
the dissemination science knowledge base in substance use disorder policy and HCV and HIV care by
developing and implementing training on best practices for stakeholder engagement and communication of
relevant economic methodologies, and by conducting relevant dissemination science research. We will
translate research results for target policy audiences, with a focus on state and local policymakers and
influencers. Our dissemination science activities will assist research teams, incorporating findings from our
stakeholder needs assessment and face-to-face engagement with decision makers and their advisors including
members of our Policy Advisory Board. We will develop, pilot, and implement a curriculum for substance use
health economics and health services researchers to improve knowledge translation capacity. After the
curriculum is established, we will host workshops at national meetings to introduce and refine the curriculum."
10839897,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Pilot Grant & Training Core
The need for investigators who can conduct health economic studies related to substance use disorder and
HCV and HIV treatment of people who use substances is growing, but a limited number have the appropriate
training and skills to conduct this research. In this context, pilot research studies are particularly valuable. Pilot
studies can ensure that research is responsive to the rapidly changing health policy landscape and can initiate
economic data collection in a timely fashion, including alongside randomized trials or other interventional
studies. These benefits are particularly critical for early stage investigators. In 2015, we established CHERISH
(Center for Health Economics of Treatment Interventions for Substance Use Disorder, HCV, and HIV), a
National Center of Excellence for health economic research related to substance use disorder policy and HCV
and HIV care of people who use substances. The CHERISH Pilot Grant & Training Core draws on the Center’s
scientific strengths, including an extensive network of expertise and experience conducting economic
evaluations of substance use disorder treatment and HCV and HIV treatment of people who use substances
through our investigators and growing network of Research Affiliates nationally. The Pilot Grant & Training
Core’s specific aims are 1) to administer competitive pilot research awards that support the development and
application of methods and dissemination tools in substance use disorder, HCV, and HIV health economic
research, and 2) to conduct training activities and mentor trainees and early-stage researchers in economic
evaluation methods related to substance use disorder, HCV, and HIV. We will provide pilot grant opportunities
that will enable researchers to investigate innovative methodologies or applications, collect preliminary data to
inform external grant proposals, and collaborate with researchers who have complementary expertise. We will
continue to provide in-person introductory training sessions that are recorded and archived on our website as a
virtual library of trainings. We will expand our trainings to include advanced economic evaluation trainings for
more experienced researchers, to be held in conjunction with major conferences and meetings. We will initiate
a new mentorship program for early-stage researchers and develop and execute a plan to engage diverse
trainees and mentees. We will continue to work closely with the other Cores to achieve these aims by drawing
on their expertise to review pilot grant applications, mentor pilot grantees, develop and implement training
programs, and identify career mentors. These activities will result in new investigator-initiated research awards
and career development awards, and a new cohort of investigators with the skills needed to conduct economic
research that will have an impact on substance use disorder, HCV, and HIV health outcomes and treatment
policy."
10830448,"Project Summary
This project aims to advance our understanding of major depressive disorder (MDD) through the analysis of
electronic medical records, biobanks and associated genetic data. MDD is the commonest psychiatric disorder
and recognized as the world’s leading cause of disability, yet current treatments are relatively ineffective: only
about half of patients will show signs of improvement after three months of therapy. Genetic approaches are a
proven path to identifying causal factors and hence finding novel treatments, but they are hard to apply to MDD
without obtaining large samples of cases. We propose using the very large numbers of cases available through
electronic medical records by applying statistical methods that accurately identify MDD. Our methods provide a
“best-guess” diagnosis by a process known as imputation. We then identify features that are specific to MDD.
Our insight is that since non-genetic and non-specific factors explain large components of variability in traditional
MDD phenotypes, algorithmically removing them increases the signal from the core biological drivers. We
assume that non-specificity can be attributed to latent factors capturing the relationship between MDD, comorbid
disease, and pleiotropic factors. By identifying and removing these signals, we increase specificity, and thus
identify features that reflect the episodic severe shifts of mood, associated with neurovegetative and cognitive
changes, that are central to MDD. Our project has three aims: first, to impute phenotypes of a large sample of
MDD cases and controls in biobank data and determine the best approximation to MDD; second, to identify and
characterise specific and non-specific genetic effects on MDD, and finally to identify genes involved in MDD by
associating the cases defined via our first two aims with rare coding variants."
10839820,"ABSTRACT
DNA replication is a fundamental process for all organisms to precisely duplicate genetic material prior to
cell division. Central to the process is a helicase enzyme that uses ATP-hydrolysis to separate base-paired
DNA to allow polymerases to gain access to synthesize complementary strands and also to drive the
replication machinery along the DNA. In human and other eukaryotic cells, the helicase engine is the 6-
protein MCM complex. The proposed research will fill a knowledge gap by providing atomic level
mechanism pictures of MCM proteins as they interact with ATP compounds and with DNA. These will be
studied at the molecular level by a coordinated approach involving structural studies by X-ray
crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy and also in vitro methods to study their functions and
interactions. The DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX3X has been implicated in many aspects of RNA
processing and is associated with several human diseases, including HIV, HCV, and medulloblastoma. The
proposed research will fill a knowledge gap by providing detailed pictures of DDX3X proteins interacting
with RNA and ATP compounds in the functional state. A considerable body of preliminary data has been
obtained for this project that includes the identification of a minimal fragment of DDX3X that has RNA-
stimulated ATPase activity and its crystal structure bound to relevant substrates."
10850772,"Mucus provides a critical protective barrier against infectious agents; its role in the clearance of microorganisms
from the lung [1] is long-appreciated. Recent studies by our team [2,3] on the modulation of microbial
phenotypes by mucins, glycoproteins that are a primary component of mucus, are creating a whole new
appreciation for the complexity of interactions in the mucosal layer. However, to date, our understanding is limited
to cataloging the components in this complex milieu with little understanding of the mechanisms underlying the
phenotypes that emerge from the interactions of microbes and mucins. Understanding the mechanistic mucin-
driven modulation of microbial phenotypes is of paramount importance in multiple diseases including cystic
fibrosis, a disease characterized by defective clearance of mucus [4]. There is emerging evidence that mucin
alters the transport of secreted factors and elicits changes in gene regulation in microbes [1,5]. Recently
developed metabolic models by our team of P. aeruginosa (a key pathogen in cystic fibrosis) can explicitly
account for the connection between these changes in gene regulation and the metabolic functionality of the
bacterium in these complex environments [6]. The underlying central hypothesis to the proposed work is that
microbial phenotypes are a function of mucin-modulated transport- and metabolism-related properties. An
integrative, multi-scale computational model will be constructed to guide experimental design and facilitate
understanding of emergent microbe-mucin phenomena. We will develop a framework for integrating metabolic
network models with continuum models of transport phenomena using agent-based models that can serve as a
template for similar multi-scale modeling challenges. Specifically, we will address the following questions: (1)
How do mucins modulate the metabolism of microbes? (2) How do mucins alter transport of microbes
and metabolites? (3) What are the key metabolic- and transport-related modulators of clinically-relevant
phenotypes of a microbe in mucus? The importance of a mechanistic understanding of the underlying complex
interactions of microbes, mucins, metabolites, and transport phenomena cannot be overstated; for example,
acute lower respiratory tract infections, driven by the interaction between mucus and microbes, are a critical
global health problem with a greater burden of disease than cancer, heart disease, malaria, and HIV [7]. Our
team of experts in computational modeling, microbial physiology, and mucus biology is well poised to tackle this
complex problem. We will establish a framework for computational modeling of metabolism and transport in
mucosal environments and identify key modulators of Pseudomonas phenotypes. We will be able to predict and
control biofilm dispersion through modulation of the mucosal environment, resulting in the potential for more
effective antibiotic targeting and ultimately strategies to treat P. aeruginosa infections and other diseases in
which a disrupted mucosal interface is important. This framework will serve as a template for the predictive value
of such models to interrogate complex microbe-human host interactions for many other applications."
10850773,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) affects 16 million US adults, many of whom experience high
rates of emergency department and hospital COPD revisits after initial hospitalizations due to care transition
failures. These frequent COPD exacerbations lead to more rapid lung function decline and earlier mortality.
Further, hospitalizations for exacerbations highly contribute to the ~$50 billion spent annually for COPD care in
the US. Therefore, COPD revisits are now a public health crisis. It is feasible to improve COPD care and
decrease acute care revisits, as shown by published evidence of successful care transition interventions. Our
team has led efforts to identify effective care transition interventions and has successfully piloted a multi-level
COPD care transition program. Effective care transition interventions include medication reconciliation, self-
management education, and post-discharge communication. However, for wide-spread adoption to occur, we
must identify optimal intervention delivery methods based on hospitals' resources and patient care needs. For
instance, virtually-supported interventions are often more resource-friendly, and while effectiveness data on
individual virtual interventions exists, multi-level virtual programs have not yet been studied compared to in-
person programs. In addition, feasible implementation approaches to support the delivery of evidence-based
care transition programs are needed for wide-scaled dissemination and sustainability. Our team has found that
a mentored implementation model is effective for implementing multi-level, hospital-based programs across US
health systems. This approach traditionally relies on in-person site visits. The use of virtual site visits could
dramatically increase this model's reach, but has not yet been studied. In summary, for successful, wide-scale
adoption, diverse US hospitals need to have access to feasible, multi-level care transition programs and
effective implementation approaches that are aligned with site-specific care needs and resources, but currently
the optimal approach is unknown. Thus, in this proposal, we will compare the effectiveness of virtual vs. in-
person multi-level COPD care transition programs in real-world settings by concurrently studying whether
virtual or in-person mentored implementation increases programs' reach. We will collaborate with the Hospital
Medicine Reengineering Network convened for rapid discovery and dissemination to identify and enroll sites.
After conducting pre-implementation contextual assessments at all sites using the Consolidated Framework for
Implementation Research, we will conduct a Hybrid Type II Effectiveness-Implementation study to determine
effectiveness of the programs to reduce 30-day COPD revisits and of the mentored implementation to increase
program penetration. Finally, we will study programs' sustained outcomes for two years post-implementation.
Data from this study will inform the optimal implementation of COPD care transition programs at scale. Further,
lessons gleaned from this study can inform implementation approaches for other hospital-based programs."
10850557,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: CORE C
G4C2 repeat expansions in C9orf72 are the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), two devastating diseases with no effective treatment. Success in
developing a treatment for “c9ALS/FTD” will require a better understanding of disease pathomechanisms, the
identification of molecular pathways amenable to therapeutic targeting, and the development of biomarkers to
track disease progression and to confirm target engagement of potential therapies. The studies outlined in
Projects 1, 2 and 3 aim to fill these needs, and the Human Validation Core (Core C) will work closely with
Project investigators to facilitate these important studies. In addition to providing post-mortem tissues to
Projects 1, 2 and 3, Core C will conduct a thorough neuropathological and biochemical analysis of these
patient samples, including the quantification of TDP-43, P62 and dipeptide repeat (DPR) protein pathology,
microgliosis and astrogliosis, and repeat length. Core C will similarly characterize brain tissues from (G4C2)149
mice used in Projects 1 and 3, and measure DPR protein levels in neurons differentiated from patient-derived
induced pluripotent stem cells used in Project 2. These data will serve as valuable traits for the proteomic and
transcriptomic studies conducted in all three projects to discover pathological mechanisms relevant to disease,
and biomarkers for use in clinical trials. Furthermore, Core C will play a significant role in validating, at the
protein level, expression changes of genes or proteins that associate with ALS genotypes or phenotypes, and
that may define pathophysiological pathways linked to c9ALS. This will be done with independent methods of
protein detection and using tissues from discovery series and validation series. Indeed, to ensure that the
collection of post-mortem tissues from C9orf72 repeat expansion carriers continues to grow, Core C will work
closely with Core B to obtain rapid autopsies of patients enrolled in clinical studies and provide diagnostic
evaluations. In this fashion, we will further increase the number of patients from whom both antemortem
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and postmortem brain tissue are available – important resources for comparing brain
and CSF proteomes. With regards to the latter, Core C will help Project 3 home in on promising candidate
biomarkers that warrant investigation in CSF, and assist in determining whether their top candidates could
serve as CSF biomarkers for c9ALS/FTD."

Individuals with cancer who live in rural settings experience worse outcomes as compared to those in urban
settings. Individuals in rural regions have difficulty accessing supportive care services due to travel
challenges, cost of services, and overall lack of available supportive care resources. The latter issue likely
contributes greatly to the urban/rural survival differences, given that multiple studies document that regularly
addressing patient symptoms has a survival benefit in the setting of advanced cancer. Technology may provide
solutions to overcome issues of rurality, however, little work has been done to specifically leverage technology-
based solutions to deliver high quality supportive care in rural settings. Our team has developed and pilot
tested a tablet-based symptom assessment and supportive care intervention called Nurse AMIE (Addressing
Metastatic Individuals Everyday) that was well received by patients with metastatic cancer, including a subset
of rural patients living in non-metropolitan counties (Rural Urban Continuum Code (RUCC) counties of 4 or
higher). Patients were provided a tablet and cellular data plan to allow them to answer symptom questions
daily, and an embedded personalized decision tree then offered evidence based self-care interventions to
address the self-reported symptom with a goal of improving overall health and well-being. A pedometer and
resistance band were also provided, given evidence that physical activity can assist with all four of the
symptoms addressed in Nurse AMIE (fatigue, sleep, distress, and pain). These four symptoms form the basis
of the psychoneurological symptom cluster that has been noted to be associated with quality of life and survival
in oncology patients. Nurse AMIE can conduct symptom assessment, track data, and provide interventions
offline if internet access is unavailable. Our preliminary evidence demonstrates acceptability and feasibility of
the tablet-based approach as our patients logged on 57% of intervention days. Furthermore, patients using
Nurse AMIE reported high patient satisfaction with the self-care system. Based on findings from the pilot, we
propose to add a weekly survey similar to that from prior research by Basch et al. and Denis et al. to expand
the symptom assessment aspect of the platform. We propose that this distance based supportive care
intervention (Nurse AMIE) will have significant effects on rural patients overall survival (primary outcome),
cancer treatment-related symptoms, function, and health related quality of life. We will focus our efforts on
N=344 underserved or low-income adult men and women living in non-metropolitan counties (RUCC codes 4-
9) that have low access to supportive care. This work will be carried out with the help of a strong community
advisory board, and guided by the PA and WV State Offices of Rural Health. We will enroll and randomize
patients to receive the Nurse AMIE supportive care intervention or usual care. Enrollment will occur at
regularly scheduled medical visits and the intervention will extend for the length of follow-up (2 years). We will
also examine the cost effectiveness of Nurse AMIE."

Adipocytes are distributed throughout the body in discrete depots and the intrinsic cellular and metabolic
properties of different populations are shaped by the specific niches in which they reside. Whereas visceral
adipocytes exist within the body’s core, other subpopulations, including subcutaneous, marrow and dermal
adipocytes primarily exist in temperatures well below 37oC. Despite this, the role of environmental temperature
has largely been neglected in our consideration of adipocyte molecular and functional characteristics. Hints
within historical literature suggest that cooler adipose tissue temperatures are also associated with greater lipid
unsaturation. We have found similar correlations in rodents and humans, with cooler distal marrow adipocytes
having increased unsaturated lipid composition. Housing rats at thermoneutrality decreases formation of
unsaturated lipids in triacylglycerols of marrow adipocytes within the distal tibia and caudal vertebra. Warmer
temperature also decreases expression of Stearoyl CoA Desaturase I. Adaptation of cultured adipocytes to
31oC is associated with elevated oxygen consumption, altered nutrient selection, elevated anabolic and
catabolic lipid metabolism, and a genetic program for cold-adaptation. We hypothesize that cold adaptation
results in profound changes to gene expression and metabolism that allow adipocytes to function at
temperatures well below 37oC. To test these hypotheses, we propose a series of specific aims that when
successfully completed will provide fundamental insights into how cold-adapted adipocytes are functionally
different from their warmer counterparts. These studies will help uncover novel mechanisms of adaptive
thermogenesis and identify targets for pharmacologic interventions to increase energy expenditure and combat
incidence of obesity and diabetes."

Diversion of ADHD stimulants, by sharing, selling, or trading, is the primary conduit by which these
Schedule II controlled drugs reach their peak prevalence of misuse in early adulthood (use without a
prescription, overuse of prescribed medication). Yet, understanding of stimulant diversion and contributing
factors is limited to speculation from small cross-sectional studies. Dramatically increased rates of stimulant
prescribing in recent years (from ~49.2 to 62.8M people), mainly in adults, has heightened concern. The state-
of-science on this important topic precludes development of prevention efforts based on variables with inferred
causal influence. Additionally, although primary care is the most common treatment setting for ADHD, this
population and its risk for diversion in adulthood, including when diagnosis and treatment occurs after childhood,
is poorly understood. Due to concern about these trends and reports of associated physical dangers and legal
consequences, the FDA recently established a public docket requesting comments on the potential role of abuse-
deterrent stimulant formulations. The accompanying review stated a need for information on factors that would
inform their decision-making, including characterization of longitudinal pathways to misuse. The proposed
study prospectively examines stimulant diversion and hypothesized risk factors among young adults at
peak age for stimulant diversion: those initially diagnosed and stimulant-treated in early adulthood, and
those stimulant-treated as adolescents by pediatricians and aging now into early adulthood. The
combined sample will provide a unique opportunity to examine associations between timing of ADHD
treatment, stimulant diversion, and hypothesized risk factors. N=357 adolescents stimulant-treated for
ADHD in primary care (U01 DA040213), and 150 newly recruited young adults first diagnosed and treated
in adulthood, will be studied (total n = 507). Three annual assessments will span ages 18-24 to allow
prospective study of stimulant diversion during the age period of its greatest prevalence. Self- and parent-report
and behavioral economics tasks will be used to assess intrapersonal, attitudinal-behavioral, and social-normative
risk factors and environmental moderators (parenting and provider factors). The results of this study will aide
Priority Focus Area #3 of NIDA’s 2016-2020 Strategic Plan, “Addressing Real World Complexities” by generating
findings that will apply to two of the largest, least understood segments of the treated ADHD population—those
treated in primary care, and those young adult-diagnosed. Findings will provide crucially needed prospectively
gathered data to inform the development of stimulant diversion prevention efforts."
10850667,"Project Abstract
Pancreatic β-cells is essential for the regulation of blood glucose. One major hope for diabetes therapy
is to generate a large number of functional, transplantable beta-cells from patient-derived pluripotent cells.
In the past decade, a few in vitro protocols have been developed to differentiate human pluripotent stem
cells (hPSCs) into functional β-like cells, which also serve as fantastic tools for the study of human
pancreatic development to reveal the etiology of relevant diseases. However, the major limitations to use
β-cell differentiation system in research and therapeutics is that the protocol is still not robust. (i) The
differentiation generates heterogenous cell populations; (ii) Differentiation efficiency is variable between
different hPSC lines, and also between batches. (iii) The resulting β-like cells are still not quite equivalent
to primary β-cells from human islets at molecular and physiological levels. To address this problem, we
propose to use the latest single cell and low-input genomic technology to generate a reliable map of
lineage determination in this system. Importantly, we will for the first time map the individual variation
between the differentiation of 24 hPSC lines. To ensure robust comparison, we have devised a pooling-
demultiplexing single cell genomic approach that allows simultaneous mapping of many hPSC lines in
one scRNA-seq or scATAC-seq experiment. This strategy minimizes the batch variation and significantly
reduces the experimental cost. In Aim 1, we will use this approach and scRNA-seq to map the dynamics
and variation of single cell transcriptome while differentiating 24 hPSC lines towards pancreatic β-cells.
In Aim 2, we will map the dynamics and variation of open chromatin using scATAC-seq, and we will also
use a low-input Hi-C technology to reveal the dynamic 3D genome during β-cell differentiation. In aim 3,
we will perform high-throughput CRISPR screen and locus-specific genome editing to discover and
validate key differentiation regulators at both gene and enhancer levels. This project is built upon a rich
set of published and preliminary data, which already led to improved differentiation protocol and better
understanding of disease genetics. Completion of this project will deliver a comprehensive data resource
of transcriptome, epigenome, and 3D genome during the β-cell differentiation, which will shed light on
the disease etiology, and reveal novel therapeutic opportunities."
10850668,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A central goal of modern neuroscience is to link genetically defined neural circuits with specific behaviors. Deep
sequencing studies have revealed an incredible transcriptional heterogeneity of neuronal subtypes within populations
previously thought to be homogeneous. Despite the discovery of such molecular heterogeneity, the functional and
behavioral relevance of these recently genetically defined neuronal cell types is largely unknown. Our application
addresses this gap in knowledge by focusing on the neuronal control of social behaviors. Social interactions, ranging from
non-vocal communication to complex language to core behaviors such as courtship or aggression, are important for
mental well-being and reproductive success. The neural circuits underpinning these diverse behaviors have been difficult
to disentangle, with non-genetically targeted approaches yielding phenotypes in multiple behavioral domains. Here we
propose to characterize how progesterone and estrogen receptor alpha expressing neurons (Pvl neurons) in the
ventromedial hypothalamus ventrolateralis (VMHvl) regulate social behaviors. Our deep sequencing studies reveal
distinct neuronal cell types within the population of Pvl neurons, with one of them restricted exclusively to females. Using
newly developed Cre and Flpo mouse strains that mark this female-restricted neuronal cell type within Pvl neurons, we
will determine its activity (Specific Aim 1), behavioral function (Specific Aim 2), and functional connectivity (Specific Aim
3) as these relate to female social behaviors. Together, our studies will uncover the activity dynamics, function, and
connectivity of a genetically defined neuronal cell type of Pvl neurons; in parallel, we will also characterize the
complementary set of remaining Pvl neurons and test their participation ins social behaviors. Thus, our research aims to
understand how genetically defined cellular heterogeneity within a neuronal population relates to functional specificity
in the control of social behaviors, a critical issue in neuroscience.
Health Relatedness: Diverse neurodegenerative conditions and mental illnesses manifest with devastating clinical
symptoms as well as a range of deficits in social and emotional behaviors. Pvl neurons within the VMHvl represent a
critical hub that regulates diverse core, developmentally programmed social behaviors that differ between the sexes. Rare
case reports of lesions in proximity to this region show dramatic alterations in social behaviors. Our studies therefore will
provide new insights into fundamental questions in neuroscience, and they also have the potential to shed light on how
dysfunction in pathways emanating from the VMHvl alters social behavior in disease states."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a costly epidemic, both in the U.S. and worldwide. Typically, it is managed with a
progressively escalating and complicated medication regimen, which presents challenges with respect to
adherence, cost, and side-effects. Lifestyle interventions are a potentially sustainable, less expensive solution
with positive side effects. The parent R01 grant reported that, compared to conventional weight loss therapy,
an intervention that focuses on reducing post-nutrient blood glucose (BG) excursions is effective at improving
metabolic control, risk for cardiovascular disease, depression, empowerment and diabetes distress. Efficacy was
unrelated to baseline demographic, psychological or disease severity variables, suggesting this approach is
broadly applicable. The current proposal differs from our previous research in that it will be a multi-center study
for greater external validity, individualized to more accurately reflect routine care, applied to adults newly
diagnosed with T2D, who may benefit the most, and it will be self-administered at home to eliminate the need
for face-to-face contact and consequently will be more broadly applicable.
200 adults who are newly diagnosed with T2D and have not begun taking diabetes medication will be randomized
to individualized medication management or to individualized post-nutrient glucose excursion minimization
(GEM). Medication management participants will receive from their primary care provider the medication types,
doses and timing that will optimize treatment and minimize side effects. The 4-session, self-administered GEM
will be individualized by allowing participants to choose between a text or video format, between continuous
glucose or capillary BG monitoring, and the timing and content of text-message prompts based on their
preference and resources. Participants will be assessed before, and at both 3 and 12 months post-treatment.
Assessments will include clinical (A1c, lipids, blood pressure, weight, risk of cardiovascular disease), behavioral
(physical activity, carbohydrate intake) and psychosocial (depression, empowerment, diabetes distress)
outcomes. Throughout the 12-month study period, each participant’s diabetes-related expenditures will be
tracked. We hypothesize that GEM will be superior to medication management in terms of reducing A1c, with
less diabetes medication, lower diabetes-related cost, and will lead to greater secondary benefits.
The results of this study have the potential to immediately provide patients newly diagnosed with T2D and their
primary care providers a new, cost-effective lifestyle intervention option. It could also direct researchers toward
investigating the maintenance of GEM’s impact and its underlying mechanisms (e.g. reducing insulin resistance,
glucose toxicity, improving insulin production)."
10850671,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, a parallel `infodemic,' an abundance of reliable information and
inaccurate misinformation, persists. There has also been a significant increase in misinformation exchange and
consumption, largely on social media platforms, which threatens individual and public health. An important
challenge remains to develop strategies to detect trusted and accurate `signals' amidst dynamic misinformation
`noise.' This misinformation contributes to confusion, distrust, and distress around health behaviors such as
vaccination, mask wearing, and social distancing. The racial disparities in morbidity, mortality, social, and
economic consequences of COVID-19 are well documented; less studied are variations in the information-
seeking and COVID-19 health decision-making specific to Black and rural communities. Public health
information and campaigns have traditionally relied on theory-based surveys or interview methods to measure
knowledge and attitudes to design health messaging. Rapid expansion of social media use and parallel advances
in machine learning analytics provide a unique opportunity to track public views, knowledge, and
attitudes simultaneously to translate novel analytic insights into precision public health
communication with an intentional lens on Black and rural communities. This proposal aims to build
a computational framework to uncover heterogeneity in attitudes and misinformation exposure towards COVID-
19 vaccination, model predictors of highly engaging and persuasive messages (including sources, linguistic
choices, and content); and to use pragmatic qualitative methods to understand individual response to social
media misinformation with a specific lens on race (Black and white individuals) and location (rural and urban).
While we focus our message development process on COVID-19 vaccination as a timely and critical
behavior, and compare targeting across four specific audiences (Black rural residents, white rural residents,
Black urban residents, and white rural residents), our approach is highly adaptable across health topics
and scalable to a number of precision-targeted audiences. We see a need for flexible and nimble
methods for rapid, human-centered content generation that supports accurate, equitable, and effective precision
public health messaging. Computational tools powered by machine learning, predictive analytics, and natural
language processing married with patient-centered qualitative methods offer a powerful synergy to conventional
approaches to public health campaigns to identify and combat misinformation. The findings from this study will
directly inform broader public health action and future strategies so that they can be deployed in the current
pandemic and in ongoing efforts to address racial disparities in chronic diseases, HIV, cancer, maternal
mortality, and mental health."

This proposal describes a 5-year training program for the development of an academic career in cardiovascular
research. Dr. Lino Cardenas will gain from the expertise of multiple investigators in an environment of over 100
faculty and will have access to a wide range of biomedical core facilities at MGH/HMS to aid in the successful
completion of the research program outlined in his application. Dr. Lino Cardenas's research program focuses
on the molecular mechanisms of vascular calcification, highly relevant to the pathogenesis of acute coronary
syndromes, atherosclerosis, and peripheral arterial disease. Growing evidence points towards autophagy, an
evolutionarily conserved process, as being protective during early atherosclerosis. However, autophagy can
become dysregulated with advanced atherosclerosis. In preliminary studies, Dr. Lino Cardenas has observed
that pharmacologic activation of the autophagy pathway reduces vascular calcification in Mgp-/- mice (mouse
model of spontaneous vascular calcification) and improves survival. The candidate proposes to define the
precise molecular mechanisms by which disruption of autophagy exacerbates vascular calcification with the
following two aims: In Aim 1, the candidate's first objective is to determine the role of vascular smooth muscle
cell (VSMC)-specific autophagy dysregulation on the development of vascular calcification and whether
modulation of autophagy may inhibit vascular calcification. Dr. Lino Cardenas will extend his preliminary findings
by combining RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq technologies to define the effects of chromatin plasticity on the
autophagy pathway during vascular calcification. Dr. Lino Cardenas will study the therapeutic effect of a range
of autophagy modulators on VSMC phenotype and calcification in vitro and ex vivo. In Aim 2, the candidate will
determine whether pharmacologic or genetic activation of the autophagy pathway inhibits vascular calcification
in vivo using two different murine models of vascular calcification. Enhancing knowledge of novel molecular
mechanisms responsible for vascular calcification may hold important clinical implications and provide new
targets for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. The candidate aims to accomplish the following immediate
and long-term career goals: (1) To develop a broader understanding of the molecular mechanisms resulting in
vascular calcification. (2) To learn genomice-phenotype analyses using existing human genetic databases to
identify polymorphisms in autophagy initiation genes associated with vascular phenotypes. Additionally, Dr. Lino
Cardenas will learn advanced techniques in molecular biology and conditional gene deletion in multiple murine
models. (3) To develop under the guidance of his mentors and advisory committee the necessary skills of
directing a laboratory, fostering productive research collaborations and grant writing (4) To successfully apply
for R01 funding within 3 years of his award initiation."

Multiple debilitating disorders, such as myopathies, hearing and vision loss, are the result of defects in
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication and transcription. The driving forces behind these essential processes
in human mitochondria are two Pol A family polymerases – RNA polymerase mtRNAP and DNA polymerase
Gamma, Polg. Structures of the macromolecular machines formed by these enzymes are the main focus of this
proposal. We will investigate how mtRNAP recruits transcription factors, recognizes, binds, and melts promoter
DNA, and initiates RNA synthesis using single-particle CryoEM. Because transcription generates DNA
supercoiling, interactions of the transcription elongation complex with mitochondrial topoisomerase will be
probed using function assays, cross-linking, and CryoEM. We will also determine the structure of replicative
helicase, TWINKLE, in a complex with a fork template to elucidate the mechanism of DNA strand separation.
The structure of a replisome – the complex of Polg with TWINKLE formed on a fork template – will be determined
by CryoEM to elucidate the mechanism of mtDNA replication. Replication initiation at replication origin OriL
requires an interplay between mtRNAP, which generates ~30 nt replication primer, and Polg. Two polymerases
form a primosome complex on the OriL hairpin, the structure of which will be probed by CryoEM. Studies of the
structure and function of the transcription and replication machinery are critical for understanding the regulation
of mitochondrial genome expression. This, in turn, will determine our ability to influence various mitochondrial
functions and, consequently, treat mitochondria-associated diseases.
Human mtDNA is highly prone to somatic mutations, including point mutations and deletions, which are
detrimental to mitochondrial function and cell viability. It has been found that aging mammals have increased
levels of somatic mtDNA mutations, however, the biochemical mechanisms underlying the formation of mtDNA
mutations and mtDNA maintenance are poorly understood. Biochemical and structural approaches will be used
to fill in the large gap of knowledge associated with DNA repair in human mitochondria. This work will examine
the process of proofreading by Polg using CryoEM to determine the structural basis of this mechanism. DNA
repair complexes will be reconstituted using Polg and known DNA repair proteins, and their structures determined
using CryoEM. Additional interaction partners of Polg that are involved in DNA repair will be identified using
pulldown assays and mass spectrometry, and their activity will be probed using functional assays. We will also
investigate transcription-coupled repair mechanisms by reconstituting transcription complexes on DNA scaffolds
containing UV damage and determine their structure. Factors involved in DNA repair will be identified using
pulldown assays from UV-treated cells and their complexes with mtRNAP subjected to CryoEM. The research
described in this proposal will provide valuable knowledge pertaining to the onset of degenerative mitochondrial
diseases."

Patients with colon cancer who require chemotherapy dose reductions and treatment delays are twice as likely
to experience disease recurrence and death than patients who complete their full chemotherapy dose on time.
Up to 60% of patients develop toxicities of sufficient severity to require chemotherapy dose reductions or
treatment delays. We hypothesize that aerobic exercise improves chemotherapy relative dose intensity and
reduces patient-reported chemotherapy toxicities by improving the calibration of chemotherapy through
changes in body composition and altering immune function. In response to RFA-CA-21-031, we will conduct a
Bayesian, multi-stage, response-adaptive, dose-ranging trial of aerobic exercise. Participants will be 219 stage
II-III colon cancer survivors recruited from three diverse socioeconomic, racial, and geographic regions (Baton
Rouge, LA; Boston, MA; Oakland, CA). The first 80 participants are randomized to 1 of 5 groups equally:
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at 75 min/wk, 150 min/wk, 225 min/wk, 300 min/wk, or attention control
(stretching). This is followed by adaptive randomization in which subsequent participants are assigned to an
exercise group in a ratio proportional to the probability that the specific exercise group improves chemotherapy
dose intensity and is feasible. Exercise is chemotherapy-periodized with more and less demanding weeks to
accommodate cyclical variations in patient-reported symptoms. Aim 1 will evaluate the dose-response effects
of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise compared with attention control on chemotherapy relative dose intensity
(primary endpoint). Aim 2 will determine the effect of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise compared with
control on gastrointestinal and peripheral neuropathy symptoms assessed using the Patient-Reported
Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [PRO-CTCAE (key secondary
endpoint)]. Aim 3 will determine the effect of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise compared with control on
whole-body tissue distribution (total body fat mass and lean mass) measured using dual-energy x-ray
absorptiometry. Aim 4 will determine the effect of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise compared with control
on changes in neutrophil counts, phenotypes, and functions (biomarkers of neutrophil effector functions
including elastase, citrullinated Histone H3, and myeloperoxidase and direct measures of chemotaxis and
oxidative burst). This study will leverage a transdisciplinary team's synergies to identify an exercise
prescription that is patient-centered and proven to have a high probability of clinical benefit. This study will
directly inform clinical practice guidelines that recognize exercise as an essential supportive care intervention
for chemotherapy and establish exercise training as obligatory for delivering high-quality, evidence-based care
to colon cancer survivors."

Research for Dr. Nathan A. Smith, a new Assistant Professor of Pediatrics, and Pharmacology and Physiology
at Children’s National Health System (CNHS) and George Washington University School of Medicine and Health
Sciences (GWSMHS). Dr. Smith is establishing himself as a young investigator in mechanisms of synaptic
plasticity with a particular focus on the role of norepinephrine (NE) in astrocytic modulation of synaptic plasticity.
This K01 Award will provide Dr. Smith the support necessary to complete the following goals: (1) to acquire patch
clamping techniques for slice preparation; (2) to acquire and apply LTD protocols to slice preparation to
determine the role of astrocytes in learning and memory; (3) to acquire and learn advance pharmacology
techniques in order to specifically block a adrenergic receptors in astrocytes; (4) to develop the skills needed to
be an independent investigator through a variety of career development activities and mentorship. To achieve
these goals Dr. Smith has assembled a mentoring team comprised of a primary mentor, Dr. Vittorio Gallo, Chief
Research Officer at CNHS and a leading authority on glial signaling in health and disease, and two co-mentors:
Dr. Stefano Vicini, who has expertise in slice physiology and synaptic plasticity; and Dr. Jason Triplett, who has
expertise in sensory circuit development and function and one consultant/collaborator: Dr. Baljit Khakh (UCLA),
who is an established investigator and a leader in the field of glial biology and physiology.
NE is a major neurotransmitter that modulates a number of brain functions including synaptic plasticity. Recent
studies suggest that astrocytes could be involved in NE-induced network modulation. For example, NE has been
demonstrated to evoke global Ca2+ transients in cortical astrocytes. Additionally, NE has been shown to enhance
astrocytes ability to respond to local synaptic activity in the visual cortex. However, further investigation is needed
to elucidate the mechanisms of NE-mediated astrocytic effects on cortical networks and synaptic plasticity. To
that end, I will first explore if astrocytes are essential for NE-mediated LTD in the somatosensory cortex using
acute cortical slices in our novel GCaMP5G-tdTm/Aldh1l1 mice in Aim 1. In Aim 2, I will examine NE-induced
priming of astrocytes to respond to local synaptic activity. Specifically, I will explore NE-mediated enhancement
of astrocytic mGluR3-induced Ca2+ signaling to local synaptic activity in the somatosensory cortex, using both
acute cortical slices and in vivo preparations in GCaMP5G-tdTm/Aldh1l1 mice. Finally, in Aim 3, I will test the
hypothesis that astrocytes modulate NE-mediated cortical LTD via the release of ATP. Combined, the proposed
studies will provide novel insights into the role of astrocytes in synaptic regulation, and thereby in higher
information processing through NE-mediated neuromodulation. This research will also form the basis for an R01
application before the end of the K award cycle."

Aging is the single biggest risk factor for disease. For the first time in US history, by 2030, people aged 65 and
older will outnumber individuals under the age of 18. Over the next 20-30 years, the number of people over the
age of 65 will double to ~80 million in the US with associated healthcare costs projected to be 2 trillion dollars.
Aging induced inflammation is the major risk factor for multiple diseases including Alzheimer's disease.
Therefore, the endogenous pathways and metabolites that deactivate inflammation of aging have high clinical
impact. Caloric restriction (CR) in animals has been shown to extend lifespan and healthspan. However, the
impact of CR on immune system, and immunometabolic control of inflammation in humans is unknown. This
proposal is in response to the PA-18-823 “Analyses of CALERIE Data and Biospecimens to Elucidate
Mechanisms of Caloric Restriction (CR)-Induced Effects in Humans”. The central hypothesis. Therefore, the
Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy (CALERIE-II) clinical trial was
designed to test the long-term effects of 2 years of moderate CR on human physiology and predictors of
healthspan and longevity. Our preliminary data establishes that further profiling of CALERIE-II immune cell
samples, plasma and adipose tissue biopsies collected in our study is a fruitful approach to discover
mechanism of CR and identify targets that can be developed against age-associated chronic diseases. This
project will test the central hypothesis that – negative energy balance in humans integrates metabolic and
immune cells that enhances anti-inflammatory reprogramming and reveals clinically relevant CR-mimetic
targets. The long-term goal of this project is to discover CR-mimetic targets that reduced inflammation,
enhance immune response, and promote healthspan."

Myoblast fusion, the process in which mononucleate myoblasts fuse to form multinucleate, contractile muscle
fibers, is essential for skeletal muscle development, maintenance and regeneration. Insights into the molecular
and cellular mechanisms of myoblast fusion to date have mainly come from studies of a genetic system, the fruit
fly Drosophila. Studies in Drosophila have uncovered a handful of evolutionarily conserved regulators of
myoblast fusion, ranging from cell adhesion molecules to actin polymerization regulators to mechanical sensors.
More importantly, Drosophila studies have identified a novel cellular mechanism underlying myoblast fusion at
the site of fusion – an attacking cell aggressively invades its fusion partner using actin-propelled membrane
protrusions, whereas the receiving cell increases mechanical tension to resist the invasion, leading to cell
membrane juxtaposition, fusogen engagement and plasma membrane fusion. Besides evolutionarily conserved
fusion-promoting proteins, recent studies in zebrafish and mouse have identified a pair of vertebrate-specific
fusogenic proteins, Myomaker and Myomixer (also known as Myomerger and Minion). However, how and where
these proteins facilitate myoblast fusion is largely unknown. Compared to Drosophila studies, a major issue that
hinders the study of the mechanisms underlying vertebrate myoblast fusion is the lack of knowledge of the
precise sites of fusion. While myoblast fusion appears to occur at undefined location(s) along a broad cell-cell
contact zone in cultured mammalian myoblasts, the sites of myoblast fusion in an intact animal remain completely
unknown. Thus, it is imperative to identify the sites of fusion in vivo and provide a cellular framework upon which
future studies can be built. Zebrafish is an excellent vertebrate model to study myoblast fusion in vivo, due to the
large number of small and transparent zebrafish embryos and their rapid ex-utero development. In this proposal,
we will use zebrafish as an in vivo model to define the sites of myoblast fusion in an intact vertebrate animal with
molecular markers. In addition, we will study the localization and potential interaction between the fusogens,
Myomaker and Myomixer. Furthermore, we will explore the interaction between the fusogens and the cell
adhesion molecules and the actin cytoskeleton. Insights from the proposed studies will have a broad impact on
understanding the fundamental principles of muscle development and regeneration, and ultimately may be
exploited for the development of therapeutic strategies to optimize satellite cell-mediated muscle regeneration
in patients with muscle degenerative diseases."

There are few in vitro models that examine Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology outside the central nervous
system. Several studies have indicated the lack of appropriate preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease and Related
Dementias (ADRD) models as one of the barriers for successful development of AD/ADRD therapeutics. Motor
impairment is a common feature of early AD pathology and the link between motor function and the risk of
developing AD has been increasingly recognized. Gait abnormalities have been found to precede the onset of
dementia by many years. It is now becoming apparent that treatment windows and thus clinical trials must shift
to the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or better yet the pre-MCI stage to be effective, however, there are few if
any diagnostics to predict who will develop AD at this stage of the disease. Studies have demonstrated that
motor dysfunction early in AD seems to predict cognitive and functional decline, institutionalization, and mortality.
Thus, a preclinical screening model based on a functional assay composed of human cells to evaluate the effects
of amyloidopathy and tauopathy in the motor and sensory segments of the peripheral nervous system (PNS)
enables a platform for understanding multiplicative effects in AD and potentially identify biomarkers that could
identify high risk AD patients at the preclincial stage, thus improving their clinical outcomes. We seek to use
UCF’s functional systems to investigate AD in terms of deficits in sensory and motor function in collaboration
with Dr. Morgan at MSU to complement our CNS AD functional models in response to the NOSI: Sensory and
Motor System Changes as Predictors of Preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease (NOT-AG-20-053). Recently, Hickman
published a model of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) composed of human motoneurons (MNs) and human
primary skeletal muscle (SkM) myotubes cultured in a serum-free medium for applications to ALS using iPSC
derived mutant MNs. The system, with two chambers linked by microtunnels, supports axonal outgrowth to the
muscle chamber and facilitated MN-stimulated SkM contraction as well as direct stimulation-induced SkM
contraction. We also have established a functional sensory neuronal system where intrafusal fibers can be
innervated by sensory neurons, stretched and the AP generation monitored at the neuronal cell body that can
be integrated with piezoelectric sensors and actuators. We propose establishing a PNS model for AD using Aβ42
and tau oligomer dosed healthy systems in addition to motor and sensory systems composed of AD mutant
iPSC-derived NMJ systems as an extension of our recently published CNS AD model. We hypothesize our AD
PNS systems will exhibit characteristic disease pathology as well as uncover distinct functional deficits useful in
a preclinical diagnostic capacity. We will determine functional deficits induced by the oligomers as well as monitor
biomarkers in the medium to identify which biomarkers could be used in a companion blood test. We have
preliminary data that Aβ oligomers have a deleterious effect on MN and NMJ function. Development of in vitro
models of the PNS without cortical neuron components could establish definitively the effects of AD in the PNS."

Single-cell multi-omic datasets, in which multiple molecular modalities are profiled within the same cell, provide
a unique opportunity to discover the temporal relationship between epigenome and transcriptome. To realize
this potential, we propose to develop a system consisting of differential equations that extends the RNA
velocity framework for gene expression to incorporate epigenomic data. By fitting pairs of jointly sequenced
RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data, this probabilistic latent variable model is able to estimate the switch time and
rate parameters of chromatin accessibility and gene expression from single-cell data, providing a quantitative
summary of the temporal relationship between epigenomic and transcriptomic changes. The parameters
inferred by the method quantify the length of time for which genes occupy each of the four distinct and
biological meaningful states, ranking genes by the degree of coupling between transcriptome and epigenome.
Similar to how transcriptomic data has been split into unspliced and spliced modalities to compute RNA
velocity, the chromatin accessibility data measured with ATAC-seq can be further split into enhancers and
promoters to model dynamics inside cis-regulatory networks during transcription. We will use this
comprehensive multi-layer velocity method to study human blood cell differentiation and mechanistic changes
during transcription due to HIV infection. We seek to uncover previously unknown markers of infection status
through the means of mathematical modeling on single-cell multi-omic sequencing techniques."

Immunoengineering is a vibrant, emerging field that improves human health by enabling the analysis,
manipulation, and engineering of the immune system. Grounded in fundamental immunology discoveries, the
integration of principles from engineering and the physical sciences into immunological research has accelerated
in the last decade. However, the immunoengineering community until recently did not have a flagship conference
that brings together all of its constituencies. Workshops held at individual universities and symposia within larger
conferences have been well attended, but an internationally accessible conference that supports networking
between generations of researchers and across fields has been missing. Such a conference is needed to bring
together leaders, new investigators, and trainees from different disciplines for the first time, to advance both
translational and fundamental science and to provide a focal point for collaborative relationships, career guidance,
and mentoring of trainees in this field. Therefore, this proposal requests partial support for the second
international meeting on Immunoengineering as part of the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon
Research Seminar (GRS) series, to be held in Lucca, Italy February 10-11 (GRS) & 11 – 16 (GRC), 2024. The
specific aims of the conference are (i) to increase knowledge in immunoengineering at two levels – basic as
well as translational immunotherapy and immunology – by promoting engagement between investigators from
different disciplines, (ii) to advance the careers of new investigators and trainees in field of Immunoengineering
by showcasing their work and facilitating networking with senior investigators and peer mentors, and (iii) to
enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion among new investigators and trainees in Immunoengineering via strong
representation at the meeting. The GRC program will have a keynote address and nine sessions that broadly
address pressing health challenges where immunoengineering is making substantial headway in or already has
had translational impact, including cancer, pathogens, aging, neuroimmunology and autoimmunity, and
regenerative medicine. It will also highlight engineered immune cell therapies, molecularly engineered
immunotherapies, biomaterials for vaccines and immunomodulation, systems and computational immunology,
in vitro models of immunity, and micro-technologies to assess immune cell function. Each session will feature 1-
2 Short Talks selected from abstracts to highlight work by early stage investigators, as well as poster sessions
and an innovative lunch-based networking strategy. The Chairs of the GRC will implement strategies to increase
participation of woman and historically underrepresented minorities by setting aside specific funding for such
individuals, targeted advertising, and ensuring that they are well represented in the Short Talks. Thus, the 2024
Immunoengineering GRC and GRS will set the stage for the advancement of knowledge and translation in
Immunoengineering by promoting engagement and long-term relationships across fields, while supporting a
diverse base of young investigators to ensure its future strength."

The formation of functional tissue architectures during embryonic development depends on the ability
of cells to orchestrate collective tissue-level movements. The goal of my research program is to
understand how cells work together to collectively generate the shape and structure of multicellular
tissues in the process of morphogenesis. Our current understanding of morphogenesis has been limited
by conceptual and technological barriers to dissecting the mechanical and molecular inputs that
together coordinate cell behaviors. During this award, we will address these challenges and focus on
resolving several key gaps in our understanding by: (1) elucidating how contractile and adhesive protein
machineries in cells help coordinate activities between neighboring cells to give rise to collective cell
and tissue movements and (2) dissecting how mechanical inputs integrate with molecular inputs to
coordinate cell behaviors within tissues. Using the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, we are
taking innovative approaches to address these questions in the context of epithelial tissue
morphogenesis. To enable us to dissect mechanisms that coordinate cell behaviors, we are developing
and using new technologies for controlling and quantifying the cell machineries and forces that drive
these cell behaviors. These techniques, in combination with quantitative modeling, will allow us to
dissect the molecular and mechanical mechanisms that coordinate cell behaviors within multicellular
tissues. This work will provide a foundation for integrating mechanics into our understanding of how
genetic and biochemical factors control development and may motivate new strategies for controlling
tissue shape and structure in vivo and in vitro. More broadly, the tools and framework we develop will
enable us to investigate the mechanisms that coordinate cell behaviors in a broad range of multicellular
processes. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying collective cell behaviors can elucidate
general principles of self-organization in biological systems, provide insight into how improper
regulation of these processes leads to human disease, and develop new approaches to manipulate
these processes for therapeutic benefit."

Over the last 50 years, access to contraception in the US has been supported by dedicated public funding
streams. Benefits to women's lives are often cited as rationale for these programs. But there is surprisingly little
rigorous contemporary evidence to support the claim that access to highly effective contraception – as
opposed to use of it – impacts women's economic outcomes and human capital accumulation at the population
level. This absence of evidence leaves a dominant rationale for the public subsidy of contraception untested.
This project seeks to overcome challenges in data and research design that resulted in this lack of evidence.
In partnership with the U.S. Census Bureau, the project will (Aim 1) construct an individual-level longitudinal
dataset, Reproduction in People's Lives (RIPL), recording women's fertility and women's and men's human
capital formation for nearly all reproductive-age U.S. residents 2007-2021. It will link restricted individual-level
microdata for the entire United States from the 2010 Census, IRS tax filings, the Census Household
Composition Key File, Medicaid Eligibility Records, and the 2007-2021 American Community Surveys (ACS).
The project will estimate the causal impact of access to contraception using a massive policy experiment: the
Colorado Family Planning Initiative (CFPI), begun in 2009, which dramatically expanded access to highly
effective contraception in all federally funded Title X clinics in Colorado, making previously expensive methods
free. Vital statistics analyses showed CFPI decreased young women's fertility and abortion rates in Colorado
compared to prevailing trends in other states. A pilot for this project used linked Census and ACS data (to be
included in RIPL) to study effects of CFPI on education, finding that CFPI improved high school completion.
Changes in life course outcomes as Coloradans gained access to highly effective contraception will be
compared to changes in comparison states using a difference-in-differences approach. In this way the project
will (Aim 2) assess the impact of access to highly effective contraception on women's fertility over their life
course. Similarly, the project will (Aim 3) assess the impact of access to highly effective contraception on
women's (and for the first time, men's) economic outcomes and human capital accumulation. For each
outcome, whether impacts vary by age at exposure, family of origin socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity,
as well as whether fertility mediates the impact of CFPI on women's socioeconomic lives will be assessed.
Project findings will inform longstanding debates in demography, economics, and public policy regarding the
consequences of family planning programs, the degree to which individuals may improve their economic
opportunity by controlling their fertility, whether observed associations between fertility timing and women's
later life outcomes are causal, and whether empowering women to control their fertility reduces the negative
socioeconomic consequences of childbearing for women. The data and methods developed by the project may
also be used to investigate effects of other family planning and social policy changes."

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a potentially fatal disease characterized by progressive pulmonary vascular
remodeling and elevated pulmonary artery pressure, leading to right heart failure. The molecular etiology is
poorly understood, even in familial PH where mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling
pathway are well characterized. Our approach focuses on understanding the germline genetic variation that
predisposes to PH, and somatic changes within the lung that may contribute to the onset and/or progression of
the disease. We were the first to identify chromosome abnormalities in pulmonary artery endothelial cells from
explant PH lung tissue. Levels of DNA damage were higher in lung and blood cells from patients than controls,
and correlated with the amount of reactive oxygen species. Similar changes were found in the blood of
patients' relatives, suggesting this may be genetically determined. Our current studies utilize state of the art
next generation sequencing approaches in lung tissues and cells to test the hypothesis that increased levels of
DNA damage predispose to genetic alterations in the lung, and may contribute to vascular remodeling in PH.
We are also testing novel therapeutic approaches to correct BMP signaling in familial PH and hereditary
hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a related vascular disorder also caused by mutations in the BMP pathway.
HHT carries high morbidity associated with risk of hemorrhage from arteriovenous malformations in the lungs,
liver and brain. Our current studies focus on ataluren, a small molecule with orphan drug status that promotes
ribosomal readthrough of nonsense mutations. In preliminary studies, BMP signaling was restored in cells from
5 of 6 patients with different nonsense mutations. In vitro studies in blood or lung-derived endothelial cells
from affected patients are complimented with treatment and prevention studies in a genetic mouse model.
This Outstanding Investigator Award proposal combines these two major themes into a unified research
program in the genomics of pulmonary vascular disease. We will harness the emerging power of single cell
sequencing technologies to develop novel analyses of endothelial cells that adhere to the Swan-Ganz catheter
after routine cardiac catheterization. This will extend our current studies in several new directions: (1) enabling
direct analysis of DNA damage markers in disease-relevant cells; (2) providing immediate ex vivo readouts of
drug responses; (3) developing novel diagnostic and prognostic signatures; and (4) perhaps ultimately
providing single cell resolution of the timing and evolution of somatic mutations in the PH lung. Through
leadership in the genomics components of two NHLBI-funded national consortia, we will leverage the results of
these innovative studies and integrate them with a broad range of other omics data to realize the goals of
improving the diagnosis, precision treatment and ultimate prevention of pulmonary vascular disease."

10829415,"Throughout the developing nervous system excess neurons are generated which are nonessential, or
inappropriately connected, and are eliminated by programmed cell death (PCD). In the PNS, the extent
of apoptosis is governed by both a limited supply of survival-promoting neurotrophic factors provided by
targets of innervation, and by apoptosis-inducing competition factors secreted by “winning neurons” that
have successfully competed for these neurotrophic factors. The glial cell line-derived neurotrophic
factor (GDNF) family ligands (GFLs) are a family of potent growth factors that support the survival of
autonomic, somatosensory and spinal motor neurons. The GFLs promote survival and growth through
a common signal-transducing receptor tyrosine kinase, Ret. During this grant period we discovered that
Ret interacts with p75, a member of the TNF family of death receptors, and p75 enhances GDNF-mediated Ret activation and survival. When p75 is deleted specifically in sensory neurons,
approximately 20% are lost between P14 and adulthood, and these losses selectively occur in Ret+ nonpeptidergic nociceptors. These results indicate that p75 is required for the development of the
nonpeptidergic nociceptor lineage by fine-tuning Ret-mediated trophic support. We also found that
during PCD in sympathetic neurons of the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) Ret is restricted to a subset
of degenerating neurons that rapidly undergo apoptosis. Pro-apoptotic conditions induce the
association of Ret with p75, thereby enhancing the regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) cleavage
of p75 and activation of downstream apoptotic effectors. Deletion of p75 in Ret+ neurons, and deletion
of Ret, specifically during PCD, inhibits apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. These results indicate that
Ret acts non-canonically to augment p75-mediated apoptosis. The molecular mechanisms that underlie
the ability of p75 to enhance Ret signaling, and for Ret to enhance p75 mediated death, are not well
understood, and are the subject of Aim 1. We also discovered recently that semaphorin 3A (Sema3A),
a secreted repulsive axon guidance molecule, induces apoptosis of primary SCG neurons, and that
deletion of its receptor components, Neuropilin-1 (Npn-1) and PlexinA3 (PA3), significantly reduce PCD
in the SCG. Sema3A induces apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway, requiring caspase-8, as opposed to
the intrinsic pathway triggered by NGF withdrawal in sympathetic neurons that requires caspase-9. The
combination of apoptosis induced by neurotrophic factor deprivation and death receptor activation in
the developing SCG raises the question of the extent to which caspase-8 and caspase-9 contribute to
apoptosis during PCD, and which death receptors are driving this process. These questions will be the
subject of Aim 2. Collectively the experiments proposed here will define the molecular mechanisms and
magnitude of the role played by death receptor pathways, such as Npn-1/PA3 and p75, in PCD."

generate a systematic map of proviral and antiviral HIV-interacting host factors, (2) functionally validate novel
HIV-host interactions, (3) undertake endogenous deep mutational scanning of specific protein domains to identify
critical host-pathogen interaction interfaces, and (4) introduce/replace small stretches of DNA at targeted
genomic sites to study the function of specific genetic variants. Collectively, these genetic studies will strengthen
the central HARC mission to understand interactions between HIV accessory proteins and host factors and open
new experimental and therapeutic avenues for a broader HIV research community. In summary, the Genetics
Core will develop a toolbox for genetic perturbations to complement innovative structural biology and proteomic
efforts."
10829813,"Novel mechanisms of glomerular injury in primary membranous nephropathy
Primary membranous nephropathy (MN) is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. Injury is
initiated by the deposition of circulating auto-antibodies against podocyte antigens in the subepithelial space of
the basement membrane, leading to complement activation and formation of the C5b-9 membrane attack
complex (MAC). MAC-mediated sublytic injury is thought to cause podocyte damage and glomerular disruption.
However, a randomized controlled trial showed no benefit of anti-C5 antibody in disease remission in patients
with MN, suggesting that other MAC-independent mechanisms apply. Studies on MN pathophysiology have
been limited by the lack of reliable in vitro systems. We generated a new glomerulus-on-a-chip platform that we
will use as a tool to assess alternative mechanisms of injury in MN. Preliminary data suggest that complement
activation leads to C3a/C3aR signaling in podocytes, which induces loss of glomerular permselectivity due
to SNAIL-mediated signaling. Moreover, challenging current assumption in MN, we have found that
MN-serum leads to C3a/C3aR signaling also in glomerular endothelial cells and induces overexpression of
MMP9, thus suggesting a role of this signaling in regulating glomerular basement membrane-cell interaction.
These effects are prevented by a C3aR antagonist, suggesting the direct involvement of C3a in podocyte and
GEC damage and in glomerular basement membrane (GBM) degradation. Therefore, based on our
preliminary data we hypothesize that C3a/C3aR signaling not only plays a critical role in podocyte damage
but exert its effects also on GEC, leading to disruption of glomerular filtration barrier and loss of
permselectivity. To test our hypothesis, we will investigate the effects of C3a signaling, its mechanism(s) of
action and its role in GBM degradation both in vitro and in vivo. If confirmed, our findings will not only provide
novel evidence that multiple injury mechanisms are in play in PMN but will also inform us about potential
therapeutic targets that could prove useful for the development of new treatments for MN and other
proteinuric diseases."
10829904,"Abstract
Alternative splicing of messenger RNA (mRNA) is a regulatory mechanism that controls transcript localization,
translation, and stability, and enables the expression of multiple protein isoforms from a single gene. In neurons,
splicing is finely controlled and is critical for regulation of neurogenesis, neuronal migration and structure,
synaptogenesis, and synaptic function. Growing evidence highlights a role for splicing alterations in neurological
diseases, emphasizing the need to better understand the mechanisms of RNA processing in order to develop
splicing-targeted therapies. Recent studies have shown that neurons can control gene expression during critical
developmental stages by coupling alternative splicing with nonsense mediated decay (NMD). This mechanism
relies on inclusion of cassette exons, known as poison exons, to create in-frame premature termination codons
that trigger transcript NMD and reduce protein expression. Importantly, genetic variants promoting constitutive
inclusion of poison exons have been associated with neurodevelopmental and, more recently,
neurodegenerative diseases. However, the field lacks rigorous methods to identify and annotate poison exons
and variants affecting their splicing. A well-established example in which increased exon inclusion can lead to
neurological diseases is the aberrant splicing of the microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT). Pathogenic
splicing mutations that promote MAPT exon 10 inclusion lead to increased 4R-tau isoform expression and
aberrant tau accumulation, whereas missense and deletion gain-of-function mutations in exon 10 are associated
with mutant 4R-tau pathology. In both contexts, an approach that promotes MAPT exon 10 exclusion would be
therapeutically beneficial. Given the increase relevance of misplicing in disease, the goal of the proposed work
is to advance the understanding of the role of splicing alterations in neurological diseases with the objective of
developing splicing-targeted therapeutics. In Aim 1, we will develop a transcriptomic approach to map poison
exons relevant for neuronal development and survival, and by intersecting the identified poison exons with
ClinVar pathogenic variants, we will catalog mutations that are likely to affect their splicing and contribute to
disease. Then, generation of CRISPR/Cas9-engineered human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived
neuronal models for a selective number of these mutations will allow us to evaluate the impact of aberrant poison
exon inclusion on neuronal phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will use a mRNA-targeted strategy that promotes MAPT
exon 10 skipping as proof-of-principle for the therapeutic potential of splicing modulator compounds, by showing
rescue of neuronal disease phenotypes in patient-derived neuronal models of frontotemporal dementia (FTD).
The development of novel mRNA-targeted therapies that specifically correct the molecular defects leading to
disease will be a major advance for the treatment of incurable neurological diseases caused by splicing
alterations."
10828571,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Many specifics of the pathological process of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remain unknown, such as the precise,
functional relationship between tau accumulation and cognitive decline as a function of age, as well as other
biomarkers that may modify these relationships. Conventional statistical approaches cannot easily answer
questions about the relationship between tau and cognition, due to their dynamic relationship, unknown time
lags, and complex measurement error structures. Mathematical modeling techniques—commonly used in
infectious disease epidemiology and computational biology—are specialized for the study of complex
relationships between biological variables, while incorporating prior knowledge about the relevant physiologic
system. The proposed project leverages my quantitative expertise from dissertation research on infectious
disease, using data from across the age span of AD onset to elucidate the relationship between tau-PET
measures and cognition.
As more tau-targeting drugs move through the pipeline, it is important to determine the optimal timing and
duration of treatment for trial design and for post-approval clinical guidelines. The ideal timing for tau-targeting
therapies may depend on factors such as age, amyloid, or vascular burden. Existing and emerging blood-
based biomarkers may offer important information about how tau spreads in the brain and the timing of
subsequent atrophy and cognitive decline longitudinally. A growing number of studies now perform tau-PET,
and including repeated neuroimaging, making it possible for an improved understanding of the dynamics of tau
and cognition in relation to other biomarkers.
We propose a biologically motivated, mathematical modeling approach to understand how neuroimaging and
other biomarkers can be used to better understand Alzheimer’s disease biology. We plan to fit mechanistic
models to data from three cohorts across the age span of AD diagnosis: Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI), Longitudinal Early-onset Alzheimer's Disease Study (LEADS), and The 90+ Study. The long-
term objective of this research is to improve our understanding of the age-specific pathophysiology of AD,
determining the precise relationship between tau and cognition, with the ultimate goal of guiding therapeutic
development and trials for AD treatment.

coursework, and directed readings and mentorship with the primary mentor Professor M. Maria Glymour and
co-mentor Professor Gil Rabinovici, MD. Scientific advisors Professors María Corrada (MPI: The 90+ Study;

10832792,"Project Summary
 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of mortality in women, with approximately
one woman dying per minute in the US. Women living with HIV (WLHIV) are a particularly high-risk group
of women with high CVD prevalence who have long been understudied in clinical research. As compared
with uninfected women, WLHIV have a 2 to 4-fold increased CVD risk that persists later life and which is on
par with men living with HIV. Additional research on sex-specific mechanisms of HIV-associated CVD will
better inform the development of CVD prevention and treatment approaches clinically relevant to over 16
million women with HIV globally. Current CVD treatment approaches for PWH are lacking and have
focused on applying cardiology guidelines from the general non-HIV population to PWH, however
traditional risk assessments tend to underestimate CVD risk, possibly due to higher levels of chronic
inflammation recognized in PWH, and pronounced in WLHIV. Initial work performed in the Hays lab
demonstrated that nitric-oxide mediated coronary endothelial dysfunction, which contributes to
atherosclerosis and predicts adverse cardiovascular events, is present at early ages in women and men
with HIV compared to age-matched control participants without HIV. During the course of our initial work,
we identified emerging risk markers in women and men with HIV such as abnormal fat distribution and
associated inflammation, lipoprotein metabolism, and early menopause (in women) which may contribute
to early impaired CEF. However, these early studies were cross-sectional in nature, and it is unclear how
these important risk markers influence vascular health over time in women compared to men with HIV.
 The goal of the Hays lab over the next few years will be to: 1) better understand contributors and sex-
specific pathways that underlie progression of heart disease in PWH with a focus on the role of ectopic fat
deposition on long term vascular endothelial health 2) to evaluate and test novel risk markers (both
targeted and untargeted markers using proteomics) for sex-specific CVD risk in PWH and 3) identify
potential treatment targets that may be rapidly translated and tested in clinical trials in PWH. For the first
two goals, we propose a longitudinal study with equal numbers of men and women with HIV across the
lifespan to test the hypothesis that a hyperinflammatory milieu characterized by abnormal fat distribution,
increased systemic inflammation and abnormal lipoprotein levels result in worsening CEF over time in
PWH. The identification of important biologic drivers of increased CV risk in PWH is critical to define new
therapeutic approaches. We will also study glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) that may
reduce ectopic fat and slow the progression of CVD in PWH. My research program will address significant
knowledge gaps regarding sex-specific factors that affect vascular health in PWH and provide data to
design future interventional studies to improve health outcomes in PWH and cardiometabolic disorders."

10836857,"Data Management and Biostatistics Core
SUMMARY
The primary objectives of the Data Management and Biostatistics Core (DMBC) are to establish a
centralized data management system for both laboratory and field data from research projects within
the ICEMR, provide statistical assistance and training to ICEMR consortium members, and improve
biostatistical capacity for malaria research and control in Ethiopia. To achieve these objectives, the
DMBC will aid investigators with tasks such as creating data dictionaries, designing data entry forms,
and ensuring data quality using standard operating procedures and quality control checks. Our previous
ICEMR has provided the DMBC with profound experiences in managing multi-layered data, including
remote sensing data, ecological and geospatial features, population genomics data, and clinical
information generated through the proposed projects. The DMBC will utilize a cloud-based data
management system developed from the previous ICEMR, which will be upgraded and customized to
suit the new project's requirements. Emphasis will be placed on the use of standardized terminology
and electronic data capture, monitoring of data quality, establishing a comprehensive sample tracking
system, enhancing data security, and facilitating data sharing in accordance with NIH guidelines. The
DMBC will play a critical role in managing the different types of datasets collected by the ICEMR
projects and in implementing the data management and sharing plan. The specific aims of the DMBC
are: 1) establish a standardized data acquisition and management system for all ICEMR activities; 2)
provide statistical support and training to ICEMR members; and 3) develop and implement scientific
data sharing plan. The DMBC will be under the direction of Dr. Ming-Chieh Lee at UCI and supported
by biostatisticians and data managers in both the United States and Ethiopia."
10932367,"MoTrPAC Project Summary
The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) will discover and characterize the
range of potential molecular transducers that underlie the health benefits of exercise in humans. MoTrPAC
was launched in 2016 with six adult Clinical Centers and a pediatric Clinical Center that have collaborated
to generate extensive Manuals of Operations to guide research protocols involving all aspects of clinical
operations (Phase I). Phase II began in the fall of 2019 with all Clinical Centers demonstrating excellent
progress toward initial recruitment goals and implementation of the protocol. The initial goal set forth by
the Consortium was to recruit 270 children (10-17 years of age) and 1,980 sedentary adults (aged 18+
years of age) who are randomized to endurance exercise training (170 youth, 840 adults), resistance
exercise training (840 adults), or no-exercise control (50 youth, 300 adults) interventions. Additional groups
of highly active endurance trained (50 youth, 150 adults) or resistance trained (150 adults) individuals
serve as comparator groups and do not undergo the MoTrPAC exercise interventions. The recruitment
and enrollment approaches are sex balanced, with participants across a wide age range (10-17, 18-39,
40-59, and 60+ age groups) and of different races and ethnicity. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some
MoTrPAC activities were suspended for more than a year, beginning in March 2020, with continued
constraints through 2022. Despite the numerous challenges encountered as a result of the pandemic,
recruitment activities at the adult and pediatric Clinical Centers have accelerated to a rate that is projected
to successfully achieve the target enrollment numbers by the end of the new award period. This led the
NIH Common Fund to release the current NOFO (RFA-RM-23-010) to provide MoTrPAC with funding to
complete recruitment and follow-up for the clinical studies, including finishing mechanistic randomized
controlled trials of sedentary adults and children and observational studies of highly active adults and
children. This will enrich the participant cohorts that are critical to understand the heterogeneity of exercise
adaptations across age, gender, and minority groups. This extension will enable MoTrPAC to complete
the intended goals as originally envisioned and will provide a more complete public database of the health
benefits of exercise and provide insight into how physical activity mitigates disease."
10841722,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Liver transplantation is the only cure for liver failure, but many patients die waiting for a transplant due to a vast
shortage of donor livers. Insufficient donor supply is further diminished by ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) during
procurement and preservation of liver grafts. IRI-damaged grafts must be discarded because they are
dysfunctional following implantation into recipients, causing patient death. Mitigating IRI is critically needed to
increase the number of viable donor livers and improve patient survival. The IRI mechanism involves several
pathways. After ischemic insult facilitates cellular injury, reperfusion triggers oxidative stress and innate immune
pathways that converge to activate apoptosis, the major cell death mechanism in liver IRI. Hepatocyte apoptosis
in IRI is mediated by Fas receptor (Fas), and leads to necrosis and inflammation, which cause liver dysfunction.
In rats, Fas reduction prior to ischemia reduces liver damage. It may be possible to mitigate IRI-induced liver
dysfunction by silencing hepatocyte-specific Fas during the transplantation process.
The goal of this proposal is to use small interfering RNA (siRNA) to inhibit IRI and improve quality of liver grafts
for transplantation. Chemically-modified siRNAs enable potent, sequence-specific silencing of any target gene
in vivo. Modified siRNAs are delivered to hepatocytes when conjugated with N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc).
GalNAc-siRNA technology is the basis of numerous FDA-approved liver disease drugs. With guidance from Drs.
Anastasia Khvorova (siRNA), Paulo Martins (liver transplant), Athma Pai (RNA seq), Gyongyi Szabo (liver IRI),
Jacob Bledsoe (liver pathology), and Matthew Gounis (in vivo imaging), this project will develop in vivo and ex
vivo approaches using previously-validated GalNAc-siRNA targeting Fas to inhibit IRI and protect liver function.
Aim 1 will determine how silencing Fas prior to ischemia perturbs IRI pathways (Aim 1.1), and explore if silencing
Fas in combination with other mediators confers greater protection against liver damage (Aim 1.2). GalNAc-
siRNAs targeting Fas, alone, or in combination with validated oxidative stress (Hmgb1) and inflammation (Tnfr1)
mediators, will be injected into rats, and IRI will be induced using a liver clamp model. Post-reperfusion, target
gene expression, liver damage, and IRI transcriptome changes will be assessed. Aim 2 will determine how
silencing Fas in liver grafts (ex vivo) affects transplant outcomes in rats. Delivering siRNA during ex vivo
preservation, by either static cold storage (SCS) or machine perfusion (MP), leads to uptake into liver grafts. Rat
livers will be procured and GalNAc-siRNA targeting Fas will be delivered during SCS or MP. GalNAc-siRNA
uptake, Fas expression, and IRI transcriptome changes will be assessed over 24 hours. This experiment will
then be repeated, preserving grafts for maximal GalNAc-siRNA uptake/efficacy, transplanting grafts into rats,
and measuring liver damage/function and recipient survival. Study findings will characterize how Fas silencing
pre- and post-ischemia affects liver IRI pathways, identify in vivo and ex vivo approaches for maximal IRI
inhibition, and help develop therapies that increase the donor pool and improve patient survival."

Adhesions are rigid, fibrous bridges that adjoin tissue surfaces as a result of ischemic conditions following
postoperative mesothelial injury. Studies have shown a 93% occurrence rate following abdominal surgery and
complications of small bowel obstruction, chronic pelvic pain, and female infertility, where treatment accounts for
over $1 billion in healthcare costs. Clinically adopted prevention strategies include a hyaluronic acid-
carboxymethylcellulose sheet-like film often described as “brittle” and “sticky” in practice, thereby rendering it
difficult to apply and inconsistent in treatment efficacy. Additional strategies include gel-based materials designed
to sustain shear forces imparted by the perpetual shifting of organs in vivo, as well as delivery of anti-
inflammatory and hemostatic therapeutics targeting non-physical pathways. Clinical translatability of solid and
gel barriers is largely impeded by either their mechanical properties or means of application, while delivery of
anti-inflammatory drugs presents issues of controlled release when topically administered. Inclusion of a targeted
therapeutic into a solid barrier host matrix with improved mechanical properties and translatable applicability,
would provide for a holistic approach to both adhesions prevention {and complications associated with intestinal
anastomosis such as intestinal fluid leakage.
Adherence and ability to conform to an injured tissue site is imperative in combinatorial design of a solid barrier
and sealant capable of effective anti-inflammatory release. Use of an elastic, surface eroding polymer as a drug
host offers a physical solution to both concerns, as we hypothesize molecules implicated in abnormal
fibrogenesis would detach from the barrier’s external surface prior to their functional time scale (Specific Aim 1).
However, ischemic conditions and a disrupted inflammatory response highlight the biological foundation of
adhesions and a pathway to an augmented treatment approach. Localized anti-inflammatory release from an
adherent polymer solid barrier could inhibit the rapid fibroblast proliferation within a fibrin matrix presented in
adhesions pathology. With evidence of enhanced receptor binding affinity, we hypothesize mimetic peptides of
apolipoprotein E (ApoE) will inhibit the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines noted in adhesions development
(Specific Aim 2). Evaluation of prevention efficacy is qualified through complication rate and an objective grading
scheme assessing the appearance and relative degree of difficulty required to separate the fibrous scar tissue,
while sealant efficacy will be measured via ex vivo and in vivo burst pressure models. {Due to the broadness
and large surface area of the abdominal cavity, we will qualify adhesions prevention and sealant efficacy of
surface eroding and drug releasing polymer solid barriers within the intraperitoneal (IP) space of cecal wound
mouse and porcine models (Specific Aim 3).}"

Long-acting (LA) pre-exposure prophylactic (PrEP) strategies offer the promise of improving adherence to therapeutic regimen for maximal HIV preventive efficacy. To this end, we have developed an ultra-long acting antiretroviral (ARV) delivery implant with an unprecedented release duration of at least 2 years uninterrupted for durable and safe HIV prevention independent of user adherence. The NanoDDI is a refillable subcutaneous nanofluidic implant for constant drug release, which comprises a newly patented nanofluidic membrane, and ports for rapid, minimally invasive transcutaneous drug refilling. Refilling is performed manually via a syringe without any complex pumps or equipment to extend implant use duration beyond 2 years. The nanofluidic membrane use nanochannels to control drug release through passive diffusion without pumping mechanisms, permitting discrete, long-term user-independent dosing. Unlike injectables or other LA polymeric strategies, NanoDDI avoids burst and decay release. Zero-order release kinetics is achieved independent of physiological conditions, regardless of interindividual heterogeneity. Importantly, the NanoDDI addresses user preferences for discretion and longer dose duration. The NanoDDI development was originally planned for use with islatravir (ISL), an ARV developed by Merck. However, ISL clinical development for long-acting HIV PrEP was recently terminated by Merck based on lymphocyte depletion concerns, rendering ISL of limited clinical relevance for PrEP. Thus, we have shifted our NanoDDI focus to the potent ARVs, MK8527 (MK) and lenacapavir (LEN). Here we will test the hypothesis that constant and sustained MK8527 (MK) or lenacapavir (LEN) delivery from NanoDDI will achieve preventative drug levels for a 2-year duration and effectively prevent SHIV infection in non-human primates (NHP). This proposal outlines a comprehensive preclinical framework fundamental for developing NanoDDI as a HIV PrEP platform. We aim 1) to develop and optimize NanoDDI and MK and LEN formulations for sustained and constant release in vitro and in rats; 2) to assess pharmacokinetics (PK), tolerability, and safety of NanoDDI-MK85 and NanoDDI-LEN for 2 years in NHP and evaluate effectiveness of transcutaneous drug refilling; and
3) to comprehensively evaluate PrEP efficacy of NanoDDI-MK in NHPs using the vaginal and rectal routes of simian HIV transmission, in dose de-escalation studies. Our multidisciplinary team has a solid history of collaborative HIV PrEP studies with long-acting drug delivery implants. We will use a milestone-driven research approach to advance the NanoDDI technology towards the ultimate goal of clinical translation."
10843158,"Project Summary/Abstract
Immune responses are the result of a combined effort of multiple cell types. In innate immune responses the
activity of both macrophages and neutrophils is important in targeting pathogens, resolving tissue damage, and
maintaining homeostasis. My laboratory uses the larval zebrafish model to determine the differential role and
functions of these two innate cell types in inflammatory responses. The overarching goal of my research
program is to identify specific signaling pathways, including signals, receptors, and effector
mechanisms, that are required for the function of macrophages versus neutrophils. During human
disease, the function of just a subset of these cells may go awry, yet common treatments target broad
pathways that inhibit multiple cell types and therefore cause harmful side effects. Identification of discrete
mechanisms used by single cell types in inflammatory disease will provide targets for future precision
therapies. We have developed an experimental system in larval zebrafish using the fungal pathogen A.
fumigatus that separates the function of macrophages and neutrophils. Over the next five years, we propose to
combine this system with genetic targeting tools and chemical inhibitors to interrogate the requirement of
intracellular killing mechanisms, cell death pathways, Toll-like receptors, and C-type lectin receptors in
macrophage versus neutrophil functions against A. fumigatus and in response to PAMPs and DAMPs. In future
research, we will expand our experimental model to interrogate the role of these genes and pathways in other
inflammatory scenarios, such as sterile inflammation during auto-inflammatory disease. Altogether, this
research will delineate complete pathways differentially required for innate immune cell function."
10843163,"Project Summary/Abstract:
More than 40% of adult Americans are obese and obesity is common among patients with severe asthma. The
mechanisms underlying the association between obesity and severe asthma are poorly understood, but a clue
comes from the metabolic consequences of obesity, which include insulin resistance and systemic interleukin-6
inflammation. We recently showed that a subset of obese asthma patients have metabolic dysfunction (MD) and
that obese patients with MD have more severe asthma than obese patients without MD. In addition, we found
that lower lung function in obesity is more strongly related to measures of MD than measures of body mass
index. Furthermore, we found that obese patients with MD respond poorly to inhaled and systemic
corticosteroids. All of these findings lead us to hypothesize that obesity-related MD and insulin resistance causes
airway pathology that leads to corticosteroid resistant airway dysfunction. Here, we propose to test this
hypothesis by comprehensively characterizing airway physiology and pathology in obese asthma patients with
MD and exploring mechanisms by which insulin mediates airway dysfunction. We have 3 aims: Aim 1 will
characterize the radiographic and physiologic abnormalities in obese asthma patients with and without metabolic
dysfunction (MD). Here we will analyze computed tomography lung scans and perform cardiopulmonary exercise
testing in asthma patients with and without MD. We hypothesize that patients with MD have radiographic
measures of bronchial wall thickness and air trapping and suffer dynamic hyperinflation during exercise leading
to exercise intolerance. Aim 2 will characterize airway inflammation and airway remodeling in asthma patients
with metabolic dysfunction; Here, we will map the cellular profile of asthma patients with MD using transcriptomic
profiles from induced sputum samples and measure basement membrane zone thickness from endobronchial
biopsy samples to test our hypothesis that airway inflammation in obese patients with MD is type-2 low and that
these patients have airway remodeling characterized by subepithelial fibrosis. Aim 3 will develop gene
signatures of insulin-related airway disease and determine if these signatures are upregulated in asthma patients
with insulin resistance. Here we will utilize in vitro cell cultures and spatial transcriptomics to identify gene
expression signatures of insulin-mediated airway disease in airway fibroblasts and epithelial cells. We will then
determine if these gene signatures are upregulated in airway epithelial brushings or sputum cells from asthma
patients with IR. Together these aims will help address an important gap in knowledge about disease
mechanisms operating in obese patients with severe asthma and promises to provide data to inform novel
treatment approaches for these patients."
10841272,"Title: Defining microtubule cytoskeleton regulatory pathways in development and disease
P.I. Kassandra Ori-McKenney
Project Summary:
Cellular architecture is governed by the organization of cytoskeletal networks and determines the functional
output of a cell. It is therefore essential to understand the regulatory mechanisms of cytoskeleton organization
as a cell develops, changes, or maintains its internal structure, because altering these processes can hinder
cell function and ultimately lead to pathological conditions. In particular, disrupting the activities of microtubule-
associated proteins (MAPs) is correlated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, neurodegenerative
diseases, and cancers. In published and preliminary data, we have found that a subset of MAPs exhibit diverse
binding behaviors on the microtubule lattice and differentially affect microtubule motors and tubulin
posttranslational modifications, highlighting an essential role for MAPs in gating access to the lattice.
Furthermore, we have observed that cells utilize specific MAPs to remodel their microtubule landscapes in
order to efficiently adapt to changes in their environment. We are only beginning to understand how MAPs in
their unaltered states control tubulin posttranslational modifications and microtubule-based transport under
different cellular contexts, but MAPs themselves are heavily modified by a handful of kinases whose regulatory
effects remain unclear. We have identified DYRK1a kinase as a key regulator of the microtubule cytoskeleton
due to its role in phosphorylating multiple MAPs. DYRK1a is involved in a range of cellular processes and is
implicated in many neuropathologies and cancers; however, the downstream molecular mechanisms of this
kinase are largely unexplored. The goal of this project is to dissect the multiple layers of regulation of
microtubule-based processes by studying the biochemical and genetic relationships between kinases, MAPs,
tubulin posttranslational modifications, and motors both in vivo and in vitro. We aspire to construct a
comprehensive network to elucidate the multiple ways in which disease-relevant kinases and MAPs modulate
the microtubule cytoskeleton during different cellular processes. To accomplish these goals, we will use an
interdisciplinary approach combining in vivo and ex vivo imaging techniques with in vitro biochemical assays.
We will utilize epithelial cell lines to study how cells tailor their microtubule cytoskeletons for specific functions,
the dendritic arborization neurons of the Drosophila peripheral nervous system to study neuronal
morphogenesis, dendritic pruning, and polarized transport, and mammalian neuronal cell culture to analyze
patterns of MAPs, tubulin posttranslational modifications and cargo transport under various conditions. To
complement these in vivo experiments, we plan to perform in vitro reconstitution experiments using TIRF
microscopy with purified MAPs, microtubule motors, tubulin modifying enzymes, and kinases in order to
elucidate their individual and collective effects on MAP binding, microtubule dynamics and microtubule-based
transport. We endeavor to comprehensively dissect MAP networks at the protein level and at the cellular level,
in order to understand how these pathways contribute to a diversity of human pathologies."

Substance use disorders (SUDs) are among society's most pressing challenges. Despite their high prevalence,
effective interventions for SUDs are lacking. Considering the chronically relapsing nature of SUDs,
understanding factors that contribute to relapse risk is a particularly important research goal. One such factor is
biological sex. Once a SUD is established, women experience greater difficulty abstaining and relapse incidence,
and resume use for longer periods of time after relapse has occurred when compared with men. Sex differences
in relapse vulnerability are mediated in part by sex hormones, including estrogens. We have identified a novel
mechanism through which estrogen acutely promotes drug seeking via actions in the prelimbic prefrontal cortex
(PrL-PFC). Estradiol (E2), at a dose that produces proestrus levels in female rats, potentiates cocaine-primed
reinstatement in females via estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) activation in the PrL-PFC. Our preliminary findings
suggest that this effect of E2 is associated with an ERβ-dependent attenuation of inhibitory synaptic transmission
in the PrL-PFC that is likely attributable to reduced GABA release. This proposal will build on these findings by
further investigating the PrL-PFC mechanisms through which E2 regulates synaptic transmission and drug-
seeking behavior (Aim 1) and by characterizing the PrL-PFC output pathways that are regulated by E2 and
contribute to drug seeking (Aim 2) with a focus on projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core and
paraventricular thalamus (PVT). Women are particularly susceptible to relapse during periods of stress.
Consistent with this observation, we have established a preclinical approach for examining the ability of stress
to potentiate cocaine seeking and have demonstrated that, in female rats, stress further increases cocaine-
primed reinstatement, thus producing an increased cumulative risk for drug seeking in females relative to males.
We have found that stress-potentiated cocaine seeking is mediated by the stress hormone corticosterone
(CORT) and that, like E2, involves CORT actions in the PrL-PFC that likely include attenuated synaptic GABA
release and reduced constraint of PrL-PFC output pathways (i.e., to the NAc core) that are critical for drug
seeking. However, while CORT-potentiated drug seeking involves endocannabinoid/CB1 receptor-dependent
reductions in GABA release from cholecystokinin+ interneurons in the PrL-PFC, the actions of E2 are CB1R-
independent and likely involve ERβ regulation of fast-spiking parvalbumin+ interneurons. We will test this
hypothesis and further explore the interactive relationship between CORT and E2 in Aim 3. This innovative multi-
PI proposal pulls together expertise in synaptic physiology, systems neuroscience, and behavior analysis. The
aims have broader implications for understanding how hormonally mediated reproductive and stress “brain
states” converge in the prefrontal cortex to guide behavior."

Age-related stem cell dysfunction is thought to contribute to diminished heath, tissue
degeneration, and cancer. The stem cell niche is required to maintain stem cells, and
both the niche and stem cells age. To potentially reverse deleterious effects of stem cell
aging and to predict how regenerative medicine strategies such as stem cell
replacement will be influenced by an aged niche environment, we need to understand
how aging affects the entire unit, including the niche. Local stem cell niches physically
interact with and signal to stem cells, and aging can alter these niche-stem interactions.
Yet it is not well understood how these aspects of the aging niche combine to contribute
to age-related stem cell decline nor how they can be reversed to potentially rejuvenate
aged stem cells. This project uses a combination of imaging, molecular-genetic, and cell
biological approaches in C. elegans, an established model organism for aging biology
that has an anatomically well-defined and accessible niche that supports germline stem
cells. Thus the project has implications for reproductive aging as well. The project will
elucidate how aging impacts the niche and its responding stem cells, discover the
molecular mechanisms driving niche aging, and determine the potential of niche
manipulation to rejuvenate stem cells. In addition, it will address how this niche-stem
system integrates with a novel branch of the systemic insulin aging pathway that was
previously implicated in stem cell aging in this system.

10830340,"Paranoid ideation—the mistaken belief that intentional harm is likely to occur—spans a continuum, from mild
suspicion to persecutory delusions. Among patients with schizophrenia and other psychosis disorders, elevated
levels of paranoia are common, debilitating, and challenging to treat. The cues (public environments, strangers)
and processes (anxiety) that promote paranoia have grown increasingly clear, but the brain bases of these
pathways are unknown, thwarting the development of mechanistic models and, ultimately, the development of
more effective or tolerable biological interventions. Leveraging our team’s unique multidisciplinary expertise and
productive track record of NIH-sponsored research, this project will use an innovative combination of paranoia
assessments, advanced neuroimaging techniques, and smartphone-based experience sampling to clarify the
factors governing paranoia. We will enroll the full spectrum of paranoia without gaps or discontinuities—including
psychosis patients with frank persecutory delusions and matched community controls. These data will allow us
to rigorously examine the hypothesized contribution of brain circuits responsible for triggering anxiety and
evaluating the threat potential of everyday social cues, such as faces. Integrating neuroimaging measures with
experience-sampling data will enable us to extend these insights to the real world—a key step to establishing
therapeutic relevance—for the first time. It has become increasingly clear that categorical psychiatric diagnoses
(e.g. schizophrenia) present significant barriers to understanding pathophysiology. Our focus on dimensional
measures of paranoia overcomes many of these barriers and dovetails with the National Institute of Mental
Health’s Strategic Objectives and Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative. This work would provide a
potentially transformative opportunity to test and refine theory, deepen our understanding of etiology, guide the
development of new translational models, discover new treatment targets, and provide an integrative
biopsychosocial framework for unifying research across investigators, approaches, and scholarly guilds."
10830417,"Project Summary
Crucial to the success of epilepsy surgery is the availability of a robust presurgical biomarker to identify the
epileptogenic zone (EZ). Complete resection of the EZ may lead to medication and seizure freedom. Since the
EZ cannot be measured directly, its location is estimated indirectly based on concordant data from a multitude
of noninvasive tests. Yet, the results of these tests are often insufficiently concordant or inconclusive.
Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) serves as the gold standard for the delineation of the seizure onset
zone (SOZ). However, the SOZ does not always predict the surgical outcome, and its delineation requires
many days of recordings to capture clinical seizures. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs), recorded with iEEG
are promising interictal biomarkers of the EZ. Yet, their clinical value for epilepsy surgery is still debated since
the HFO-generating area is often relatively large and its complete resection may overlap with eloquent areas.
This is often attributed to the presence of physiological HFOs in non-epileptogenic areas. In our recent iEEG
study, we showed that interictal HFOs are initiated by an onset generator and spread to other brain areas over
time. This generator constitutes a promising interictal biomarker of the EZ since its resection is associated with
good surgical outcome. Despite the copious literature on HFOs, the clinical value of HFOs for surgery has
been only investigated using iEEG, which presents serious limitations due to its invasiveness and its limited
spatial sampling. This application aims to noninvasively localize interictal HFOs with high-density
electroencephalography (HD-EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) in children with medically refractory
epilepsy (MRE), distinguish pathological from physiological HFOs, and assess the noninvasive localization of
the HFO-onset generator with respect to the surgical resection and patients’ outcome. Our hypothesis is that
HD-EEG and MEG can distinguish pathological from physiological HFOs non-invasively and can localize the
HFO-onset generator whose removal leads to better surgical outcome than the removal of the area of
secondary spread. To test our hypothesis, we specifically aim to: (i) assess the ability of HD-EEG and MEG to
localize HFOs; (ii) differentiate physiological (nHFOs) from pathological (pHFOs) HFOs using unsupervised
machine learning; (iii) localize noninvasively the HFO-onset generator and compare it with the clinical gold
standard for resection tailoring, i.e. the iEEG-defined SOZ; and (iv) assess the predictive value of the HFO-
onset generator in terms of surgical outcome. To pursue these aims, we will record HD-EEG and MEG data
from 50 children (0-18 years old) with MRE and 50 typically developing (TD) children. This application
combines the use of cutting-edge pediatric neuroimaging instruments, 3D printing technology, and innovative
signal processing tools together with extensive neuroimaging experience with children. Our research will have
a direct impact on the life of children with MRE since it will provide a new noninvasive biomarker of the EZ that
would limit invasive long-term monitoring, augment presurgical planning, and improve the surgical outcome."

Bacteria typically live in complex sociomicrobiological communities, often as biofilms, on surfaces
as diverse as water pipes, ship hulls, plant roots, insects, shellfish, indwelling medical devices, and
mucosal surfaces. Biofilm growth in humans can cause or exacerbate disease, and biofilm growth
in environmental niches can facilitate transmission of pathogenic bacteria to humans and other
animals. Understanding how bacteria recognize, cooperate and compete with their neighbors in
diverse environments is critical for developing strategies to control microbiological community
composition, to prevent biofilm development, and to eliminate pre-existing biofilms and their
consequent diseases. Contact-Dependent Growth Inhibition (CDI) is a phenomenon in which
bacteria use the toxic C-terminus of a large exoprotein to kill or inhibit the growth of neighboring
bacteria upon cell-cell contact. Production of a small immunity protein protects bacteria against
CDI. Using the Gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia thailandensis as a model, we have
discovered that in addition to using CDI system proteins to kill their neighbors, bacteria can use
these proteins for signal transduction, causing a change in gene expression that leads to the
production of cooperative behaviors, such as biofilm formation, when neighboring bacteria are
recognized as ‘self’, a phenomenon we call CDS (for contact-dependent signaling). We recently
discovered that the genes encoding the CDI system proteins in B. thailandensis (bcpAIOB) are
located on a large mobile element that defines a new class of transposon. We showed that this
transposon moves using a copy-out-paste-in mechanism, that the copy-out step, which results in
the formation of a large (210 kb), circular, extrachromosomal ‘megacircle’, requires the activity of
the BcpA exoprotein, and that megacircle formation is required for CDS phenotypes. We now plan
to determine the molecular mechanisms by which the bcpAIOB genes and the proteins they
encode contribute to megacircle formation, the molecular mechanisms by which megacircle
formation leads to gene expression changes resulting in cooperative behaviors, and the role this
system plays in the development of sociomicrobiological community development. Understanding
the function of these systems at the molecular level may lead to the development of new
antibiotics, new approaches to blocking biofilm development and biofilm-mediates diseases, and
new approaches to blocking transposon-mediated spread of antibiotic resistance."
10828735,"The introduction of Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) has transformed the standard of care and
elevated treatment outcome goals for young individuals experiencing the initial stages of a
psychotic illness (EP). The response to treatment for EP individuals receiving CSC, however,
remains highly variable. A substantial proportion show minimal symptom reduction despite
receiving the full range of evidence-based practices comprising this treatment model. Currently,
clinicians have no way to predict which EP individuals entering CSC will respond to treatment
and published data show that expert clinicians perform no better than chance. Early
identification of treatment non-responders has very high clinical significance and would inform
and enhance clinical decision making during the first few months of care. Surprisingly, little
research has been conducted on baseline predictors of treatment outcomes in EP individuals
entering CSC. During the past two decades, considerable progress has been made using
neuroimaging to investigate pathophysiological processes during the early phases of illness.
Furthermore, limited data suggest that fMRI measures of brain activity and PET measures of
increased dopamine synthesis are related to treatment outcomes in EP. We have recently
demonstrated in a moderately large sample of EP patients entering CSC that the ability to
activate the frontal parietal (FP) cognitive control network (measured using fMRI during the AX-
CPT task) is a significant predictor of who will meet responder criterion after one year of CSC.
We propose to replicate and extend this result by examining the predictive ability of this and two
other promising MRI based measures linked to pathophysiological processes related to
psychosis: 1) free water diffusion tensor imaging (FW) - a putative biomarker of
neuroinflammation that is increased in EP individuals, and 2) midbrain neuromelanin (NM)
scans, which index midbrain dopamine, shown to be decreased in Parkinson's disease and
increased in schizophrenia. Each of these measures will be used individually to predict
responder status for EP participants entering CSC. In addition to these analyses we will use
novel deep learning methods to optimize the prediction of treatment response in EP individuals
entering CSC and to obtain new insights into the mechanisms underlying these effects. Our goal
is to leverage recent progress in the development of MRI based imaging biomarkers to develop
a precision medicine tool that can identify early psychosis patients entering CSC who are at
high risk for non-response and thereby inform treatment decision making for all patients in order
to optimize the recovery of young individuals following the onset of psychotic illness."

continue to be public health concerns. The intrauterine and early postnatal environment
provides support that is critical to the proper development and health of offspring. Maternal high
fat (HF) diet consumption during pregnancy can have persistent detrimental effects on the fetus
that predispose to obesity and its comorbidities. Our preliminary data in a rat model suggest that
maternal HF diet has negative consequences on offspring controls of food intake via the gut-

maternal HF diet alters development of the gut-brain axis and vagally-mediated controls of
feeding in offspring leading to increased susceptibility to obesity and other metabolic disorders.
Aim 1 will determine how vagally-mediated controls of feeding are altered in rat offspring from

dysbiosis in altered gut-brain axis function and determine whether use of prebiotics to normalize
microbiota composition of HF fed dams, and consequently their offspring, will improve offspring
gut-brain axis development and function. Together the proposed experiments will identify

 Pediatric healthcare inequities in the United States (US) remain persistent and pervasive. Suboptimal
patient-provider communication plays an important role in creating and maintaining disparate outcomes; this is
compounded by mismatches between a family’s skills and resources and demands imposed by the complexity
of the health system (such as health literacy and system navigation). Few interventions exist to address
inequities related to communication and system navigation in the inpatient setting; given t he established links
between these inequities and disparate clinical outcomes, such interventions are needed. To address this gap,
the study team collaborated with parents/caregivers, staff, and providers to develop and pilot-test a novel
program to improve navigation ability, communication, and hospital-to-home transition for a diverse population
of children and their families, The Family Bridge Program (FBP).
 The FBP combines principles of effective patient navigation and communication coaching interventions
into a brief and targeted inpatient program. It is designed for a broad population of low-income children of
color, is not disease-specific, is not limited to English-proficient families, and is less time-intensive than
traditional navigation, to enable provision of support to more families. The FBP, delivered in-person by a
trained lay navigator, includes: (1) hospital orientation; (2) unmet social needs screening (e.g., food insecurity);
(3) parent communication and cultural preference assessment, relayed to the medical team; (4) communication
coaching for parents; (5) emotional support; (6) assistance with care coordination and logistics; and (7) a
phone call 2 days post-discharge. Program elements are flexibly delivered based on parent need and interest.
 In pilot testing, the program was feasible to deliver, acceptable to parents and providers, and significantly
improved parent-reported system navigation ability. The current R01 proposes a two-site randomized
controlled trial (RCT) of the effectiveness of FBP among 728 families of low-income children of color. Enrolled
families will be randomized 1:1 (stratified by site) to FBP or usual care plus written resources. The specific
aims of the study are to (1) Adapt the FBP to a new site using a rigorous and replicable process, Socio-
Technical Analysis, which will also result in an implementation guide for future adaptations; (2) Test the effect
of the FBP on parent-reported system navigation ability, quality of hospital-to-home transition, diagnosis
comprehension, observed communication quality, perceived stress and revisits for families of low-income
children of color; (3) Examine whether changes in parent-reported barriers and needs mediate program effects;
and (4) Identify subgroups of parents among whom the FBP is more effective. The proposed RCT will use a
rigorous design to test a feasible, innovative program to address a critical national problem. If effective, the
Family Bridge Program would provide a scalable model for improving health care experiences and outcomes
for families of low-income children of color, including those with LEP."

The Data Sharing for Demographic Research (DSDR) project of the Inter-university Consortium
for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) supports population science and related fields by
making it possible for researchers, policy makers and others to discover, access, and analyze
relevant secondary data. Access to high-quality, generalizable data about populations facilitates
scientific advancements at a pace that is not possible when researchers are limited to the data
resources they produce themselves. Specifically, data that are findable, accessible,
interoperable, and reusable are critical to transparency and research reproducibility as well as
making it feasible for scientists to combine data of different types and from different sources for
a more nuanced understanding of the context of health outcomes and behaviors. DSDR
provides the infrastructure for researchers to see the scope of available data; access both
public- and restricted-use data while protecting human subjects; integrate emerging data types
such as biomarkers, genomics, and administrative record data; and learn from others in the
demographic community about the data and relevant analytic techniques.
DSDR leverages the capabilities and capacities of ICPSR, the Institute for Social Research, and
the University of Michigan to support research on maternal and child health, the lifecourse,
health disparities, migration, relationship formation and dissolution, and more in the U.S. and
internationally. To meet the aims set forth by NICHD, DSDR proposes five main objectives: 1)
Sustain and build the collection of data, documentation, and other support files, 2) Improve
discoverability and exploration of data, 3) Amplify access to restricted-use data, 4) Enable the
combining of new types of data (e.g., biomarkers, neuroimages, and administrative records)
with survey data, and 5) Offer training and perform outreach to engage the demographic
community. ICPSR’s high-quality curation, creation of standardized information describing the
data, dissemination of complete documentation including codebooks and user guides, and
training opportunities ensures researchers can more easily find, evaluate, and use data
collected by others to answer new and innovative research questions while upholding
respondent privacy expectations."

Psychologist with the VISN 1 New England Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center (MIRECC)
and recent graduate of the VA Interprofessional Advanced Addiction Fellowship, in her goal of becoming an
expert in recovery-oriented behavioral interventions for Veterans with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). Medications
for OUD save lives by preventing relapse and overdose, but they do not actively directly address the significant
functional challenges for Veterans in early recovery. Adjunctive behavioral interventions hold promise for this
area, but existing approaches rarely outperform standard buprenorphine medication management. This may
be due to a tendency for early sessions to focus on symptoms (i.e., cravings and urges) that are already
addressed by medication treatment. The proposed research seeks to develop a brief, values-based
intervention which instead focuses on helping to improve Veterans’ interpersonal functioning and community
integration during early treatment. These two recovery-oriented concepts are closely linked to the known
functional consequences of OUD and are key predictors of recovery outcomes. The three phases and
respective aims for the current proposal cover the activities outlined in Stages 1a and 1b of Rounsaville’s
Behavioral Therapy Development Model. Specifically, manual development (Stage 1a) will include stakeholder
interviews with Veterans and VA Providers (Aim 1) and an open pilot with a small sample of Veterans to field
test the intervention (Aim 2). The final phase of the proposed research will be a pilot randomized controlled trial
(RCT) of the intervention compared to standard medication management, the standard of care and most
common comparison condition for research with this population (Aim 3), which will provide feasibility and
acceptability data for the intervention. These aims will directly support a subsequent RR&D MERIT proposal to
conduct a full-scale RCT of the resulting intervention and will also provide invaluable experience for the
candidate’s intended long-term career path. The current proposal’s training aims are designed to build on Dr.
Ameral’s clinical background in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (the theoretical foundation for the
proposed intervention), experience in translational experimental research, and demonstrated commitment to a
VA research career in recovery-oriented addiction. These training aims will be met through a series of formal
training experiences together with support and guidance from a mentorship team of highly productive VA
researchers with complementary expertise and skills sets. Specifically, the current proposal will address critical
knowledge and skills gaps for the candidate in relevant content areas (recovery-oriented research, behavioral
intervention development, medications for OUD) and methodological approaches (conducting clinical trials,
qualitative methods, statistical analysis for clinical trials), and leadership and professional development to
support the proposed research and career plan. In sum, the research and training outlined in the current
proposal will position Dr. Ameral to become a leading researcher in the area of recovery-oriented interventions

10834916,"Current rehabilitation methods fail to restore normal arm function for many stroke survivors,
particularly those with severe deficits. The main objective of this study is to test efficacy and
evaluate underlying neurophysiological mechanisms of a novel approach to treat persistent
severe arm deficits after stroke with a combination of MyoPro™ and motor learning-based
therapy. We will also estimate cost effectiveness of this therapeutic approach. Rationale: Motor
learning-based therapy is one of the most effective stroke rehabilitation methods available,
however its application is challenging for individuals with severe arm impairment because of
their limited ability to practice volitional arm movement effectively. The MyoPro is an exoskeletal
myoelectrically controlled orthotic device that is custom fitted to an individual’s paretic arm and
assists the user to move the paretic arm. MyoPro can help with motor learning-based therapy
for individuals with severe motor deficits as it motivates practice because even weak muscle
activity is translated into patient-initiated arm movement. Preliminary results of motor-learning
therapy using MyoPro in our laboratory showed an increase in Fugl-Meyer for Upper extremity
score (FM) of 7.44 points following 18 weeks of training (18 in-clinic therapy sessions over 9
weeks followed by 9 weeks of home practice) for chronic stroke survivors with baseline FM≤30.
However, comparison of the same dose of combination therapy with motor-learning alone
remains to be determined. Study Design: Using a randomized, controlled design, individuals
with chronic severe stroke (≥6 months post; Fugl Meyer UE score ≤30;n=60) will participate in
either MyoPro+motor learning (M+ML) or motor learning alone (ML-alone). The study
intervention will include 9 weeks of in-clinic training (18 sessions;1.5 hours each) followed by 9
weeks of home practice and a 6-week follow-up. Aim 1 is to determine whether M+ML results
in greater treatment gains compared to ML-alone. The primary outcome will be change in FM.
Secondary outcome measures will assess overall paretic arm performance and will include:
kinematics, muscle tone (Modified Ashworth Scale; MAS), grip/pinch/arm dynamometry,
sensory function (Semmes Weinstein mono-filament test, joint proprioception), arm function
(Arm Motor Ability Test (AMAT);actigraphy) and quality of life (Stroke Impact Scale (SIS)).
Aim 2 is to characterize structural and functional brain changes after treatment. Outcomes
include corticospinal excitability (motor evoked potential recruitment curve (MEP-rc)), and
functional connectivity (resting state function Magnetic Resonance Imaging(rs-fMRI). Aim 3 is to
identify baseline factors associated with greater functional improvement with treatment.
Outcomes are as follows: baseline integrity of the stroke-affected corticospinal tract (lesion load,
MEP-rc; Diffusion Tensor Imaging); baseline motor ability of the affected arm (FM); baseline
functional connectivity (rs-fMRI); device usage and actigraphy. Aim 4 is to evaluate cost
effectiveness of M+ML versus ML-alone. Outcomes include: direct/indirect costs and health
related quality of life surveys (Short Form 12v.2 and SIS). Significance: This study will address
an important problem for the VA patient population by testing for the first time whether MyoPro
combined with motor learning-based therapy is superior to motor learning alone in the treatment
of chronic, severe arm impairment in stroke. If found to be effective, the study intervention is
readily deployable to the clinical setting."
10835026,"Specific aims
Transposons are major genome constituents with the potential to trigger genome instability and
disease, or generate beneficial genetic diversity that can drive evolution. The interplay between
mobile elements and the “immobile” genome is controlled by the piRNA pathway, which has a
conserved role in transposon silencing during germline development. This pathway must
respond to new genome invaders, distinguish piRNA source loci from genes, and modulate
transposition in response to stress. The three aims address these critical, but poorly
understood, processes.
Aim 1. How does the germline respond to genome invasion? piRNA control of established
transposon families has been extensively studies, but the response to new genome invaders is
poorly understood. The KoRV-A gammaretrovirus is currently invading the koala germline, and
progressing in a north to south sweep through the wild population. Gammaretroviruses produce
spliced Env mRNAs and unspliced transcript which encode Gag, Pol, and the viral genome. Our
initial analysis this process indicates that these unspliced transcripts, which are essential to
retroviral replication, are directed to the piRNA biogenesis machinery and processed into sense
strand piRNAs. Significantly, we find that selective processing of unspliced proviral transcripts
is conserved from flies to placental mammals. These findings suggerst that inefficient proviral
transcript splicing generates molecular “pattern” that triggers an innate genome defense
response, which is followed by adaptive genome immunity, mediated by anti-sense piRNAs.
These model will be tested through extended analysis of theKoRV-A/koala system, and
mechanistic studies in the tractable fly model.
Aim 2. How are piRNA source loci defined? piRNAs are sequence specific guides in the
germline transposon silencing system, and the specificity of this genome immune system is
defined by the genomic loci that produce piRNA precursors. From flies to mice, transposon
mapping piRNAs are produced from both long non-coding “clusters” containing transposon
fragments, and a subset of euchromatic transposon insertions. In flies, these loci are marked by
the Rhino-Deadlock-Cuff (RDC) complex, but how the RDC is specifically localized to these
sites is not understood. Studies under this aim will define the genetic and epigenetic
mechanisms that localize the RDC, and specify where piRNA precursors are made.
Aim 3. How does the piRNA pathway respond to stress? McClintock discovered
transposition as a response to chromosome breaks, and transposon mobilization is a driving
force in evolution, suggesting a critical role in adaption to stress. To generate heritable benefits,
stress induced transposon activation must occur in the germline, but how the piRNA pathway
responds to stress is not understood. Our preliminary studies, and work from several other
labs, point to a critical role for Checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) in DNA damage control of the piRNA
biogenesis machinery, and we find that heat shock induces rapid, reversible disassembly of
chromatin organization at piRNA source loci. This aim focuses on characterization of these
stress responses, and uses reversible disruption of the biogenesis machinery by heat shock to
probe the mechanisms controlling piRNA cluster chromatin assembly and de novo initiation of
piRNA production."
10840272,"Kinases are a central hub for signaling in multiple disease settings, including cancer, autoimmune disease, heart
disease, and beyond. There is significant need for technologies that could streamline multiplexed measurement
of kinase activities in live cells using high throughput screening and clinical lab-compatible read-outs for future
translation. We develop these kinds of cell-based assay approaches, designing novel substrates tuned to
particular read-out technologies and characterize them in vitro and in cell-based assays. Through prior work, we
prototyped an in silico pipeline called KINATEST-ID, in which kinase substrate preferences are identified, cross-
checked against other “off-target” kinases, then novel peptides are designed based on predicted compatibility
with a read-out technique and tested empirically. Our initial iterations of this pipeline have focused on tyrosine
kinases and in vitro lanthanide fluorescence assay read-outs, which have limited multiplexability. Mass
spectrometry detection of cell-deliverable kinase substrates that report kinase activity in live cells would provide
far higher multiplexability, but in prior work we ran up against a fundamental physiochemical limitation of our
design pipeline: selecting sequences for Tb3+ chelation produces substrates biased towards acidic amino acids
(e.g. D, E) that ionize very poorly in standard MS analyses. We also found that while we could predict biochemical
efficiency for kinases that had high-quality preference data available, prediction of selectivity is still inadequate
because most kinases lack such data for cross-referencing against each other. These barriers have limited further
progress on developing substrates for cell-based kinase profiling assays, particularly with multiplexed MS
detection. Further, in order to be more robust for higher throughput analyses, the workflows for the assay,
sample processing, and MS detection need to be simplified. In Aim 1, we will expand the KINATEST-ID platform
functionality with a focus on MS detection. In Aim 2, we will develop multiplexed cell-based deliverable substrate
kinase assays using targeted parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) MS methods in collaboration with colleagues at
Cedars Sinai who are developing cutting edge, high throughput proteomics methods that are clinical lab-
compatible. This work will produce an optimized platform for developing and implementing MS-compatible,
cell-based assays enabling kinase activity profiling in live cells, as well as a path to new tools for understudied
kinases. Overall, these tools will have high potential to impact both basic research for rapid profiling of signaling
activities, and kinase inhibitor drug discovery with eventual translation to the clinic."

Our goal is to broadly understand the biological roles of arginine methylation, a very common post-translational
modification (PTM). This PTM is deposited by at least nine protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) in
mammals. Like lysine methylation, arginine methylation of a substrate often recruits an effector molecule to the
newly created methyl-motifs. Unlike lysine methylation, relatively few effects have been identified for
methylarginine marks. This paucity of identified methylarginine (Rme) mark effectors and the signaling roles of
the known effectors define a knowledge gap that will be addressed here. By performing proteomic screens, we
have identified a novel reader for Rme marks, called SART3. This effector does not harbor a Tudor domain
which is usually found in “traditional” readers of Rme marks, but rather it carries a series of HAT (Half-a-TPR)
repeats that are rich in aromatic amino acids. Here, we plan to characterize this interaction and investigate the
possibility that other TPR repeat-containing proteins may be involved in sensing arginine methylation. Also, we
are investigating the functions of two known effects of Rme marks, called SND1 and TDRD3. Through a
combination of mouse work and protein array studies, we have determined that SND1 can likely directly activate
the kinase activity of S6K2, and that TDRD3 can play a role in the DNA damage response."
10835874,"Because of its highly metastatic potential and limited treatment options, triple-negative breast
cancer (TNBC) remains a leading cause of cancer associated deaths in women. Recent studies
have shown that distinct chromatin landscapes correspond to metastatic relapse. Our lab has
shown that the Abelson (ABL) family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases promote metastasis of
breast cancer cells through activation of downstream transcriptional changes. However, how
these changes exist in the greater context of global chromatin dynamics has yet to be explored.
My preliminary data suggest that simultaneously targeting the epigenome and the ABL kinase-
regulated transcriptome might be a promising new therapeutic strategy for treating metastatic
triple negative breast cancer. The overall hypothesis of the proposal is that inhibition of ABL
kinases leads to distinct changes in the chromatin landscape that sensitizes TNBC cells to
treatment with drugs targeting epigenetic regulatory proteins leading to TNBC cell death. The
aims of the proposal are to elucidate the epigenetic landscape associated with ABL kinase
signaling to promote metastatic progression, and to understand how these dynamic changes
might be exploited to elicit therapeutic benefit in metastatic TNBC models. Approaches used to
address these objectives will include CRISPR/Cas9 screens, ATAC-seq, and in vitro and in vivo
drug treatment experiments using cell lines and mice respectively."
10835875,"Cervical cancer remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in women, in particular in HIV-infected
women in low and middle-income countries (LMIC), such as South Africa. Testing for human papilloma virus
(HPV), the etiological agent of cervical cancer has significantly improved screen-and-treat approaches at the
point of care in LMIC. However, although persistence of high-risk HPV types is the primary cause of
precancerous cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 and 3 (CIN2+) and invasive cervical carcinoma (ICC),
its detection has a low positive predictive value, as only a small proportion of HPV+ women will progress to
CIN or ICC. Therefore, there is a compelling need for “triaging” HPV-positive women, to reduce unnecessary
treatment. Once precursor lesions are identified, they are treated by either ablative or excisional methods,
depending on grade. Both of these methods have significant recurrence risk. Better predictors of high-risk
recurrences at the time of treatment as well as potential markers for recurrence post-treatment are needed to
drive down the incidence of cervical cancer. The key factors that promote cancer progression likely reside in
the cervical environment, notably its local microbiome. Preliminary evidence suggests that increased bacterial
diversity and the presence of Lactobacillus iners are associated with CIN2+. L. iners harbors a highly variable
mobile genetic repertoire, containing methylases and toxins that may play a role in progression of cervical
lesions. Elucidating which taxa or genes are predictive of disease state could enable the development of
adjunct rapid diagnostics in HPV+ women. Here we propose to comprehensively study virus-microbiota-host
interactions, specifically the interaction between HPV and lower genital tract commensal bacteria and fungi
relevant to cervical cancer screening in HIV+ and HIV- women. Our group at Columbia University has a long-
standing and highly-productive collaboration with the University of Cape Town, South Africa, with whom we
have undertaken large clinical studies of cervical cancer prevention. We will leverage samples and clinical data
already collected from two of these recent studies. In Aim 1, we will define whether the cervicovaginal bacterial
and fungal communities distinguish between HPV-infected women who have or do not have CIN2+, stratified
by HIV status. In Aim 2, we will test whether cervical microbial taxa at baseline, or changes in taxa over time,
predict recurrence after ablative therapy at 6 or 12 months in women with HPV+/CIN2+. This will inform which
patients require more monitoring, and guide the identification of potential “adjuvant” therapies to improve
efficacy of screening programs by reducing recurrent disease after treatment. In Aim 3 we will apply
metagenomics to identify microbial gene markers and structural genetic variants that predict cervical cancer
treatment failure. Combined, our work will inform potential triage tests to reduce the number of women without
cervical disease beginning treatment, increase the sensitivity for detecting women who are at high risk of
treatment failure, and yield mechanistic insights to help guide the future development of adjunct therapeutics."
10835876,"Abstract
The prevalence of adolescent severe obesity is at an all-time high in the U.S. (~8%), and the refractory nature
of this disease has led to uncertainty regarding how to provide effective, safe, scalable, and durable treatments
without placing undue strain on the healthcare system. In 2017, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
(USPSTF) released updated screening recommendations concluding that comprehensive, intensive behavioral
interventions with a total of ≥26 contact hours over a period of 2-12 months resulted in weight loss in youth with
obesity, with ≥52 contact hours leading to even greater weight loss and improvements in some cardiometabolic
risk factors. However, the practicality of delivering these types of intensive behavioral services to the millions
of youth with severe obesity in the U.S. is debatable not only because of the treatment-resistant nature of
severe obesity, but also the time-commitment, acceptability, and sustainability of this approach for patients and
their families and the extensive resources required to offer these interventions. While behavior change is an
indispensable component of any effective weight loss approach, adjunctive strategies such as
pharmacotherapy may enhance health outcomes. Pharmacotherapy combined with relatively low-intensity
behavioral counseling (<26 contact hours) represents a potentially effective, durable, and safe treatment
strategy for this population. This approach may be more practical and feasible to implement on a broad scale,
preferred by patients and families, utilize fewer healthcare resources, and cost less to deliver compared to
comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions. We propose a two-arm, randomized clinical trial in
adolescents with severe obesity evaluating two years of comprehensive, intensive behavioral counseling,
aligned with the USPSTF report (52 contact hours during year one; 26 contact hours during year two), vs. two
years of medical management with liraglutide plus relatively low-intensity behavioral counseling (12 contact
hours during year one; six contact hours during year two). Outcomes will include weight loss effectiveness and
durability, cardiometabolic risk factor improvements, quality of life, safety, and implementation feasibility."

10836012,"Project Summary
The American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI) has been the primary patient-reported outcome
(PRO) used in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for decades; however, it is not a comprehensive
assessment of lower urinary tract symptoms that may present with BPH because it lacks items on urinary
incontinence and bladder pain. The Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN)
developed general-use multidimensional symptom questionnaires in order to address the complex needs of the
urology clinic, but these tools have yet to be validated in specific clinical populations. The overarching goal of
this project is to use these questionnaires and other PROs to enhance clinical decision-making in men with BPH.
This will be achieved by (1) integration of PRO assessments into the evaluation and management of patients
with BPH; (2) determination of clinically meaningful differences in LURN Symptom Indices in men with BPH
receiving known effective treatment; and (3) creation of care-coordination recommendations to facilitate using
PROs in order to match evidence-based treatments to patients with persistent symptoms. PROs are a cost-
effective strategy that, combined with advances in electronic medical health record technology, can improve
patient care by allowing for more real-time surveillance and intervention, including the monitoring of both the
core urologic symptoms of BPH and common comorbid symptoms such as sleep disturbance and depression. In
order to effectively determine meaningful symptom changes in response to treatment, minimally important
differences specific to men with BPH must be established. Moreover, previously demonstrated convergent
validity of the questionnaires must be confirmed in this population. In addition to using PROs to assess
treatment response, they can also be used to monitor short-term side effects and comorbid conditions over the
course of treatment, a practice that can facilitate care coordination that will increase quality of care and quality
of life for men with BPH. In Aim 1, we will use statistical methods to predict changes in urologic symptoms and
assess associations between lower urinary tract symptoms and measures of sleep disturbance, depression, and
pain, among others. In Aim 2, we will assess test-retest reliability and other psychometric properties of the LURN
Symptom Indices, using a triangulation of methods to determine minimally important differences. In Aim 3, we
will engage stakeholders, including patients and clinicians, and use qualitative methods to create care
coordination checklists intended for physician extenders to follow up with patients undergoing treatment,
including via telehealth. Aim 3 will also enhance the recovery and routine monitoring of men with BPH after
surgery, who can experience distressing side effects and complications such as urinary leakage and pain. The
ultimate result of this work will be better understanding of the associations between comorbid sleep disturbance,
depression, anxiety, etc., with urinary symptoms in men with BPH, and improved care and reduced symptom
burden through the integration of robust and validated PROs into multiple phases of urologic care."
10836013,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The 500,000 patients in the United States with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) suffer
extraordinarily high rates of mortality at ~18% per year, with 50% of these deaths attributed to cardiovascular
disease (CVD): namely, atherosclerotic CVD, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. Effective approaches for
prevention, treatment and risk stratification in the HD population are lacking. Medical therapies that are
effective in patients without ESRD, such as statins, are not beneficial for patients with ESRD when tested in
randomized clinical trials. Ironically, traditional CVD risk factors, such as hypercholesterolemia, obesity, and
hypertension, have `reverse' associations with CVD outcomes among these patients as compared to the
general population. Major obstacles to progress in these areas that are addressed in our proposal include: 1)
poor understanding of the disturbed biology in patients on HD that leads to poor CVD outcomes; and 2) failure
to consider CVD in the HD population as a complex, potentially heterogeneous entity that calls for a
personalized approach to CVD risk stratification using CVD models that are individualized and whose risk
factors are modifiable. Circulating protein levels can serve as modifiable biomarkers for CVD risk, guide
therapy and elucidate causal biological pathways and mechanisms. We plan to take advantage of an advanced
modified aptamer assay (SOMAscan) that measures ~ 5000 proteins in just 175µl of plasma with high
sensitivity and specificity. To date, no studies have utilized large-scale proteomics to understand outcomes and
biological mechanisms in patients with ESRD on HD. In Aim 1, we propose to study proteins associated with
clinical CVD outcomes in 649 participants of the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) who have had one
or more study visits after initiation of HD, and validate our findings in 408 participants in the Predictors of
Arrhythmic and Cardiovascular Risk in ESRD study. In Aim 2, we will investigate changes in proteins that
associate with progression or regression of left ventricular mass in the Frequent Hemodialysis Network, and
validate our findings in CRIC. Proteomics will be measured at two time-points 1-2 years apart in 2/3 of the
1324 participants so that we may study single time-point proteins as well as protein trajectories. We will employ
innovative methods, including stratified Cox analyses that support differing baseline hazards for participants
with and without CVD, and time-dependent covariates for risk models, to accommodate intervening events in
our analysis of protein changes. Agnostic and targeted pathway analyses will elucidate biological networks
among protein predictors. In carrying out these Aims we will create accurate, personalized and mutable risk
models for CVD events in HD patients. We will identify heretofore-unknown proteins and biological pathways
associated with CVD; some of these may eventually become targets for interventional strategies for ESRD
patients on HD, who are in great need of new therapies to improve their poor outcomes."
10833930,"ABSTRACT
 Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic, oftentimes disabling gastrointestinal disorder
characterized by recurrent abdominal pain associated with alterations in bowel habits (diarrhea
and/or constipation). Three subtypes of IBS have been defined based on stool patterns: IBS
with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D), IBS with predominant constipation (IBS-C), and alternating
or mixed IBS (IBS-M). Approximately 10% to 15% of adults in the United States are affected by
IBS, with IBS-D estimated to account for roughly a third of the cases. Due to the disruptiveness
of the abdominal and bowel movement-related symptoms in their daily lives, IBS is among the
top 10 reasons people consult a primary care physician.
 Although several global and symptom-specific PRO measures have been used to support
approval of treatments for IBS, FDA encouraged the development of comprehensive subtype-
specific symptom severity measures that meet its regulatory expectations. The PRO
Consortium formed the IBS Working Group to meet this unmet measurement need. To begin
the development of the Diary for Irritable Bowel Syndrome Symptoms–Diarrhea (DIBSS-D) and
measures for the 2 other subtypes, the IBS Working Group reviewed the literature and
conducted concept elicitation interviews to identify a comprehensive set of symptoms
experienced by people with IBS. Based on these results and input from a patient representative
and advisory panelists, a set of IBS symptoms was identified, and draft items were generated to
assess the core symptoms of each subtype. Then, 3 rounds of cognitive interviews were
conducted with 16 participants with IBS-D to ensure that the DIBSS-D addressed the IBS
symptoms of greatest importance to participants and to optimize the item wording and response
scales. The developmental DIBSS-D was subsequently tested in a cross-sectional observational
study conducted at 10 clinical sites across the US that included 133 participants with IBS-D.
 Aim 1 of this proposed project is to analyze the data collected from participants with IBS-D in
our cross-sectional observational study in accordance with the QP and its accompanying
statistical analysis plan currently under QRT review. Aim 2 is to prepare a Full Qualification
Package (FQP) in accordance with the most current version of FDA’s COA FQP content outline,
and Aim 3 is to submit the DIBSS-D FQP to FDA. The intended result of this project will be a
qualified, publicly available PRO measure for the assessment of abdominal and bowel-
movement-related symptom severity in persons with IBS-D. Qualifying the DIBSS-D will fill a
critical gap in the measurement of patient-reported clinical benefit in IBS-D treatment trials."
10836456,"High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) subtypes have been identified across multiple studies; however,
the biologic basis of these subtypes remains poorly understood. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that
differences in the cellular composition of HGSOC tumors drives the expression patterns that characterize at
least some of the previously described HGSOC subtypes. New technologies that barcode antibodies and
transcripts from individual cells before sequencing can characterize gene expression at single cell resolution
and detect cell types, which allows the central hypothesis to be directly tested. These combined advances lay
the groundwork to identify the basis, in terms of cell composition and pathway expression, of HGSOC subtypes
through two aims.
Aim 1: Characterize transcriptomes and selected proteins at single cell resolution, and deconvolve
existing tumor gene expression data. Single cell RNA and surface protein abundances will be measured at
the single cell level for high-grade serous ovarian cancers, unsupervised analysis will be used to identify cell
populations, cell surface proteins will be analyzed to characterize the immune compartment, cell-type marker
genes will be defined, and marker genes will be used deconvolve matched bulk RNA-seq samples. This will
allow existing data from larger cohorts to be deconvolved allowing survival analyses to be performed on tumors
stratified by cell composition.
Aim 2: Characterize the transcriptomic profile of cancer cells within HGSOC tumors to identify
pathways that are variably expressed within cancer cells. Gene expression within cancer cells will be
measured using two complementary approaches: (i) orthotopic patient derived xenografts (PDXs) and (ii)
single cell RNAseq. For each pathway, an enrichment score will be generated and pathways with expression
levels that vary substantially across the cohort will be identified. Combining the expression levels of genes
within variable pathways with cancer cell fraction estimates from existing datasets will enable inference of the
extent to which these variable pathways differ between reported subtypes after controlling for cancer cell
abundances.
The proposal is expected to result in two primary outcomes: 1) an understanding of the extent to which cell
composition and pathway expression contribute to HGSOC gene expression subtypes; and 2) estimates of the
proportions of cell types in existing studies with public gene expression data. A short-term impact is expected
through improved survival predictors of HGSOC subtypes based on variation identified from cell composition
and pathway expression and the work is expected to be impactful in the longer-term because determining the
biologic basis of subtypes is a key step towards developing treatments that target their specific vulnerabilities."
10836457,"Symptoms and hospitalizations for heart failure (HF) are primarily driven by congestion, making loop
diuretics a cornerstone therapy in HF. This is problematic since loop diuretic resistance (DR) is common and a
driver of persistent congestion and the poor outcomes that follow. We have recently confirmed that: 1) The
dominant driver of DR in human HF is at the renal tubular level, rather than poor diuretic delivery. 2) Proximal
tubular sodium reabsorption is not a substantial contributor, rather 3) reduced response at the site of action in
the loop of Henle and compensatory distal tubular sodium reabsorption drive DR. 4) Resistance at the loop of
Henle appears to be addressable with diuretic doses traditionally considered above the ceiling dose. Despite
progress in defining the general locations for DR, the culprit transporters and thus specific druggable
targets remain undefined. There is consensus on the existence of three stoichiometrically relevant distal
sodium (Na) transport pathways. The central components to these three pathways are the sodium chloride
cotransporter (NCC), the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), and the chloride bicarbonate exchanger, pendrin.
Importantly, these targets can be manipulated in humans with FDA approved drugs; NCC can be selectively
inhibited by bendroflumethiazide (a thiazide with minimal carbonic anhydrase inhibition), ENaC by amiloride,
and pendrin downregulated by NH4Cl loading. We have also learned that sodium reabsorption in the loop of
Henle is dynamic with substantial regulation and plasticity of NKCC2. Importantly, NKCC2 splice variants have
been identified that have dramatically different ion affinities, transport capacity, and diuretic sensitivities.
 The primary goal of this proposal is to translate the above knowledge into therapeutically
actionable approaches to human DR. To accomplish this, we will conduct 3 mechanistically focused clinical
trials using pharmacologic manipulation of different transport pathways, endogenous lithium clearance to
understand regional nephron sodium handling, and urinary extracellular vesicles to investigate differences in
tubular solute transporter levels and splice variants. Specifically, Aim 1 will investigate the mechanism
underlying the substantial shift in the loop diuretic dose response curve to the right in human HF. Here we will
serially titrate the highly selective NKCC2 antagonist bumetanide to 10mg (400mg furosemide equivalents) in
stable DR and diuretic responsive HF patients. In Aim 2 we seek to understand the effect of acute antagonism
of amiloride sensitive, thiazide sensitive, or combined amiloride & thiazide sensitive transport pathways on loop
diuretic response in stable DR HF patients. We will accomplish this by administration of the combinations of
placebo, amiloride, and/or bendroflumethiazide, in conjunction with bumetanide, to stable DR HF patients. In
Aim 3 we will determine if NH4CL loading, known to downregulate pendrin, can reduce non-amiloride/non-
thiazide sensitive distal sodium reabsorption. Through the completion of these aims we will gain substantial
understanding of the specific mechanisms underlying DR in HF allowing targeted therapeutic strategies."
10839913,"TOOL OPTIMIZATION CORE: ABSTRACT (PROJECT DESCRIPTION)
Beyond datasets, Bridge2AI’s Data Generation Projects (DGPs) will create a rich set of software methods and
tools. The Tool Optimization Core (TOC) will be a national and multi-national hub for algorithmic and methodo-
logic innovation, benchmarking, standardization, optimization, and dissemination. We aspire to be a Commons
that services a broad and diverse range of stakeholders: algorithm developers and users, citizen scientists, reg-
ulatory bodies, and members of the public.
With this overarching mission, our TOC aims to incorporate each stakeholders’ specific needs as well as merge
expertise, innovation, and dissemination to enable tool optimization across the broader Bridge2AI initiative. Our
Tool Optimization Core comprises five Specific Aims. First, we will support tool generalization. The TOC will
serve as a Center of Excellence in benchmarking, software development, and user interface (UI) development
as well as provide resources to support critical existing tools and tools generated by data generating projects
(DGPs). Second, we will coordinate tool development within and beyond Bridge2AI. The TOC will coordinate
benchmarking, standards-setting, and interface development for DGPs working with other NIH-funded consortia
and initiatives. Third, we will benchmark and optimize tools. The TOC will identify, plan, and execute quarterly
pan-Bridge2AI crowdsourced benchmarking exercises to identify and quantify best-practices while working with
DGPs on a wide range of algorithms. Fourth, we will identify and fill gaps in tool development, optimization, and
generalization. The TOC will create working groups across the DGPs Tool Development & Optimization Modules
to identify gaps and subsequently coordinate creation of gold standard datasets and tool optimization in these
spaces. Fifth, we will disseminate best practices in tool development and optimization. The TOC will create a
standardized registry for sharing of tools, datasets, and benchmarking results with these resources available
through programmatic and visual interfaces.
These efforts will be achieved through coordination of the TOC with other BRIDGE Coordination Center Cores,
particularly including the Standards Core and Skills & Workforce Development Core. Successful execution will
allow the TOC to comprehensively advise DGPs, create open and coordinated tool development within and
beyond Bridge2AI, develop Bridge2AI-wide benchmarking, harmonize tool development across Bridge2AI, and
develop and host workshops and systematic training materials on Bridge2AI. The efforts of the TOC will support
continual tool refinement and development with lasting impact for the scientific community."

Bridge2AI’s Data Generation Projects (DGPs) will be establishing flagship AI-ready datasets. These will provide
a foundation to establish new opportunities to train individuals in about the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and
data-driven methods. Yet there is increasing recognition that there is not a “one-size-fits-all” approach to training
researchers in this space, given its highly interdisciplinary nature. Some individuals are interested in algorithmic
improvements; others are focused on the sociotechnical implications of AI; still others actively engage with inter-
disciplinary research. The heterogeneity of backgrounds and interests of individuals wanting to gain skills and
knowledge in biomedical/behavioral AI requires a dynamic, thoughtful approach that maximizes the utility of the
DGPs and embraces the diversity of individuals needed to ensure biomedical/behavioral AI benefits everyone.
This Skills & Workforce Development Core (SWDC) is designed to work with the DGP Training Modules and to
facilitate the use of DGP products and providing myriad opportunities and venues for their understanding and
use. To do so, it will be closely integrated with the other BRIDGE Coordination Center (CC) Cores. It will garner
feedback from a broad variety of end users and stakeholders as to how DGP products are perceived and can
be improved. The SWDC’s mission is threefold: 1) developing educational modules and activities around DGP
datasets and tools, illustrating key concepts in contemporary AI, covering both technical concepts and issues
around ethical and trustworthy AI (ETAI, with the Ethics Core); 2) implementing strategies across the DGPs to
provide a dynamic way for different learners to receive a customized curricula that provides the skillset, (practical)
knowledge, and experience that is desired; and 3) tackling the urgent need for more diversity in biomedical data
science through novel engagement programs that leverage the Bridge2AI products, creating opportunities for
mentorship and long-term impact. This mission is realized across two specific aims: 1) to develop curricula,
educational materials, and interactive sessions with the DGPs, thereby addressing skills development; and 2) to
develop training opportunities for a new, diverse, and AI-ready workforce, building infrastructure and relation-
ships to enable workforce development. A series of meetings are planned to understand the DGPs datasets and
tools, from which we can identify common opportunities and set priorities to develop educational modules and
plan activities, including data jamborees and hackathons (in conjunction with the Standards and Tool Optimiza-
tion Cores). Building atop this library of modules and other resources, we plan to create novel methods to tailor
a set of recommended courses for a learner, given their stated educational background, familiarity with AI, and
targeted use of skills. Importantly, all these developments will be informed by our commitment to equity, diversity,
and inclusion (EDI) as we look to meaningfully engage underrepresented minorities and disadvantage individuals
in biomedical data science, ensuring their presences and voices in its future."

CREATE involves a collaboration between three sites: Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM), Florida State University
(FSU), and U. of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Dr. J. Sharit. will remain as a research Co-leader and
member of the Executive Working Group (EWG), but data collection will not take place at the University of
Miami (UM). To increase our scientific and technical capacity, we also involve faculty from other campuses
within our institutions (e.g., Cornell Tech) and other institutions (e.g., Carle, Northwestern). CREATE has a
highly efficient and effective organizational structure, which consists of four integrated units: The Administrative
Core (AC), newly restructured Data and Technical Development Core (DTDC), the Dissemination Core (DC),
and the Research Program, which includes three thematic cross-site projects and a Pilot Research Program.
An External Scientific Advisory Board (ESAB), central Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB), Community
Advisory Boards (CABs), and Industry Advisory Council (IAC; new for CREATE V) augment the Center. If
funded, the AC will continue to provide leadership for the Center and oversight and direction for its activities.
The AC will assume primary responsibility for ensuring that the Center’s science is of high quality and fostering
collaborations across the sites, the community and clinical settings, industry, government representatives, and
older adults. The AC will work to expand the Center’s research, development of junior investigators, and help
ensure that the Center’s outcomes are broadly disseminated. The aims of the AC are to: 1) provide leadership
and direction for the Center’s activities and oversight of progress; 2) facilitate cross-site collaborations and
integration across the research projects and the DTDC & DC; 3) facilitate linkages between the ESAB, CABs,
DSMB, IAC, and the NIH; 4) facilitate linkages with the community, government agencies, and industry; 5)
ensure adequate resource and technical support for the research and the DTDC & DC; 6) assist with
identification of participant recruitment/retention strategies and administration of the CREATE Core Battery of
Measures; 7) administer the Pilot Research Program; 8) promote and facilitate expansion of the Center’s
research and foster international collaborations; and 9) help ensure the Center is visible within the public policy
arena. The AC will build on our existing structures and protocols and long standing and newly formed
collaborative relationships. The Center’s evaluation plan has internal and external feedback loops and
includes: 1) monthly and annual reporting mechanisms; 2) tracking of research and core activities and
progress; and 3) reporting to the ESAB, CABs, DSMB, IAC, and the NIH. Our metrics will include traditional
markers of academic success (e.g., peer reviewed manuscripts, presentations) and metrics beyond
contributions to the academic knowledge base (e.g., training of junior scientists, inclusion of diverse samples;
relationships with community organizations and industry; development of guidelines and tools for technology
design; resource sharing, impact on technology design and older adults)."

participant training solutions. Cybersecurity protection protocols will be applied to all data, projects, and study
participants and users will be queried about annoyance. The DTDC will also ensure that research activities are
conducted in compliance with regulatory agencies with regard to privacy and confidentiality. The DTDC will
collaborate with the Administrative Core (AC) in the development of data collection, entry, and training protocols
for all research personnel. The Core will also be responsible for providing the investigators with technology
support for the research projects. This will include the development of technology interfaces (e.g., VR), the
development of novel intelligent adaptive systems using machine learning, digital assistants, and other types of
technology tools. The Core will continue to use a variety of methods for data collection, including computer-
assisted instruments and computer-aided telephone interviewing software (CATI). During CREATE V, these
protocols will be expanded and adaptive data collection tools on mobile devices for study participants will be
included. Server-side applications for data collection (e.g., REDCap) will be implemented for survey data
collection. The DTDC will also develop data documentation manuals and data libraries for the projects and
assume responsibility for data scoring and integration. The Core will be responsible for: processing all data to
ensure its accuracy, consistency, and integrity; continuing to serve as a central repository for all Center related
data and documents; providing a framework to facilitate collaboration between Center personnel; and
implementing our detailed resource sharing plan (see Resource Sharing Plan). It will also continue to maintain
the SharePoint Server for the Center to share libraries of data, documents, presentations, etc. The DTDC will
continue to work with the AC in the preparation of project reports such as the progress reports for the NIH and

media, publications, and presentations). The major aims of the core are to coordinate and direct dissemination
activities to maximize the impact of CREATE work. Specifically, for CREATE V, activities will include
capitalizing on existing connections to networks, agencies, and communities to promote CREATE activities
and research; formalizing dissemination efforts to inform stakeholders; enhancing translational efforts targeted
to industry and international groups; and systematically advancing social media and internet presence. The DC
will continue to deploy successful dissemination strategies and techniques developed over the past two
decades that have resulted in the Center and PIs receiving awards for innovative and interdisciplinary
research, publishing hundreds of peer-reviewed journal articles, presenting at most major aging, psychology,
and design conferences and hosting well-attended and well-received webinars and workshops nationally and
internationally. CREATE V dissemination activities will specifically target stakeholders who work with and have
the ability to improve the health and wellbeing of older adults, including healthcare networks; the industry and
design community; community and government agencies; the scientific community; and older adults and the
general public. The DC has developed and will monitor metrics of success associated with reaching each of
these stakeholders. In addition to previously deployed methods and strategies, CREATE V will develop new
materials and strategies to reach a broad array of stakeholders, including podcasts and “Research in a Minute”
web videos targeting different stakeholders; policy briefs targeted at local and national governments; news
materials, action plans, and public-facing articles in conjunction with existing professional connections of
CREATE PIs; and formalized efforts to inform stakeholders. Another new structure of the DC for CREATE V is
the development and implementation of a social media internship program. The DC will also take advantage of
CREATE’s new Industry Advisory Council (IAC) to disseminate CREATE findings and products to small and
large businesses; designers and programmers; workplace managers; and human resources departments. Our
efforts to inform older adults, healthcare providers, family members, and the community at large will reduce
age-stereotypes, especially myths about older adults’ interest in innovative technology use. Traditional and
novel dissemination routes will help ensure the goals of minimizing technology disparities and bridging the
digital divide are met, allowing individuals of all ages to benefit from existing and emerging technologies."

Poor sleep is common in neurodevelopment disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with up to
93% of ASD individuals reporting sleep problems. These problems worsen quality of life and core symptoms of
ASD and likely precede an ASD diagnosis, suggesting they start early in life. The potential adverse impact of
early life sleep disruption is supported by animal model studies showing long term functional consequences on
behavior. However, little is known about the underlying molecular consequences of sleep deprivation (SD)
early in life. Our recent work in wildtype mice demonstrates that the cortical transcriptional response to SD is
more prominent at postnatal day 24 (P24) with a preferential downregulation on the Wnt-singling pathway
compared to adulthood. Nevertheless, the transcriptional response and molecular mechanisms underlying the
adverse effects of SD early in life are poorly understood in the context of ASD. My overall goal is to understand
the detrimental consequences of sleep loss in neurodevelopmental disorders. Previous work in the lab showed
that mice carrying a mutation in the ASD gene Shank3 (Shank3∆C mice) are the only ASD mouse model that
replicates the clinical features of insomnia in ASD and show an abnormal transcriptional response to SD in
adults. In my graduate work, I used polysomnography in young Shank3∆C mice to show that sleep problems
are present and detectable at P24. In the F99 phase, I will investigate how this ASD mutation alters the impact
of SD on transcription at P24 using both bulk and single nuclear RNA sequencing. In addition, I will use
targeted quantitative proteomic for SHANK3 and -catenin to investigate the effects of Shank3∆C and SD on
canonical Wnt-signaling. Nuclear -catenin levels are a well-established marker of canonical Wnt-signaling
activation and SHANK3 has been shown to bind -catenin in the nucleus and inhibit its transcriptional activity.
My sponsor, Dr. Peixoto has an established track record analyzing transcriptomic response to SD in mouse
models and has establishes the Shank3∆C model for the study of sleep in ASD. My co-sponsor, Dr. Frank has
extensive experience in developmental neuroscience and has pioneered many of the studies characterizing
the role of sleep-in developmental synaptic plasticity. Additional members of my advisory committee, Dr Hicks
and Dr. Prasad are world experts on single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics. In the pre-doctoral F99 phase,
I will learn to use proteomic and transcriptomics approaches and advanced transcriptomic data analysis. In the
postdoctoral K00 phase, I will build upon these skills and use genetic mouse models to integrate circuit level
manipulation and multi-omics to better understand the consequences of sleep loss on behavior in
neurodevelopmental disorders. Overall, the proposed training will optimally position me to start an independent
research career at a leading neuroscience research institute and advance our understanding on the molecular
consequences of sleep loss across development."

A clear need to train and retain veterinary physician scientists is outlined by several National Research Council
reports in 2004, 2005 and 2013 and by the National Institutes of Health Physician-Scientist Workforce Report
in 2014. Recruitment and retention of highly qualified biomedical scientists, especially clinician-scientists with
the DVM degree continues to be one of the most challenging issues facing not only the broader research
community, but specifically academic veterinary programs around the country. In response, UC Davis School
of Veterinary Medicine initiated the Veterinary Scientist Training Program (VSTP) in 2000 with the first class of
VSTP students matriculated in August 2001, which has become the second continuing program in the nation.
To date, 30 graduates have completed the VSTP program with dual DVM/PhD. Currently, the VSTP program
has 17 students and admitted 3 students to the class entering in 2019. Fourteen of our graduates have gone
on to leadership careers in academia, government agencies, and industry. 12 recent graduates are still at the
early stage of their post-DVM residency and/or postdoctoral training. Only four graduates (13.3%) have chosen
to become small animal practitioners, but one of them has indicated to return to academia. Thus, the
percentage of our VSTP graduates who are using their research training is more than 80%. Our mission is to
prepare our students with dual DVM-PhD degrees to become compassionate and exceptional veterinarian-
scientists engaged in basic and translational research to advance the health of people, animals, and
environment. The goal of our VSTP program is to provide an outstanding environment for both clinical and
biomedical research training at the nation's top-ranked School of Veterinary Medicine and College of
Agriculture and Environmental Sciences along with the University's internationally-recognized strong programs
in Biological Sciences, Biomedical Engineering, and Human Medicine. Most of our training faculty participate
in established Centers and Institutes that promote collaborations and employ diverse evidence-based
approaches to solving scientific problems through state-of-the-art equipment in individual labs and campus
shared facilities. Our VSTP program hosts a number of student-centered activities, some of which are jointly
organized with our medical school MD/PhD program, to create a unique learning environment in comparative
medicine. Our students are an integral part of this dynamic environment and promote the excellence of the
program through their research, outreach and student mentoring. Our objectives and intended outcomes for
this T32 training grant are to: 1) prepare all of our trainees to become future leaders in academia, government
service and public health, 2) provide greater exposure to career paths outside academia, 3) maintain the
average time (8 years) to degree, 4) attract and train a diverse group of dual degree students, and 5) increase
the number of dual degree trainees in training at UC Davis from 17 to 24."

Palliative care focuses on improving quality of life for people with serious illness and their family caregivers at
any stage of illness and aligning medical treatments with a persons' values and goals. Older adults with
serious illnesses such as heart failure (HF) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have numerous
palliative care needs. However, palliative care is often provided late in illness by palliative care specialists, near
the end of life. In addition, palliative care is a limited resource that is not available to many of the patients with
HF or COPD and their family caregivers, especially in urban poor and rural settings. Furthermore, many older
adults with HF or COPD have comorbid cognitive impairment and dementia which are associated with worse
outcomes. In prior work, I tested the effect of early palliative care interventions for adults with HF or COPD. In
this application, I propose new research to determine how to adapt and implement early palliative care into the
primary care setting for patients with HF or COPD who have cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease and
related dementias. The overall goals of this proposal are to (1) train mentees (through increased mentoring
time) to increase the cadre of successful patient-oriented researchers who will improve care and outcomes for
older adults with serious illness and cognitive impairment, and (2) expand my research skills and experience in
cognitive impairment and implementation science research for seriously ill older adults in primary care. I will
accomplish these goals through additional training, research experience, and mentorship from experts in
cognitive impairment, implementation science, and mentoring. During the K24, I will work closely with mentees
to develop individual career plans and conduct research to further their development as independent
investigators in palliative care, aging, and cognitive impairment. The research proposed in this application will:
(1) determine how cognitive impairment influences participation in early palliative care and palliative care
outcomes; we will analyze cognitive function and quality of life data from two of my multisite clinical trials (one
completed, one active) of older adults with HF or COPD, and (2) engage primary care stakeholders (clinicians,
leaders, staff, patients, and caregivers) to identify which palliative care interventions to implement in primary
care and how to implement them. The proposed research, conducted with implementation science
collaborators and mentees, will provide new knowledge on how to adapt and implement early palliative care
into primary care for older adults with HF or COPD and cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer's disease
and related dementias. I am thrilled to train the next generation of patient-oriented researchers in palliative
care, aging, and cognitive impairment. With my record of research and mentoring success and the resources
from the K24 and the University of Colorado, I can provide an outstanding training environment."

Despite substantial progress in preventing infant HIV infections, an estimated 160,000 new pediatric infections
still occur each year worldwide, primarily due to gaps in testing and care for pregnant and lactating people with
HIV. The World Health Organization (WHO) and UNAIDS have issued an ambitious call to end pediatric HIV by
2030. With NICHD support, R01HD079214 has launched development and growth of the CEPAC-Pediatric
model, a detailed microsimulation model of HIV in children in Côte d'Ivoire, South Africa, and Zimbabwe.
CEPAC-P analyses focused on diagnosis and treatment of HIV have been cited in every published WHO HIV
Guideline since 2013. In the next award cycle, we propose to address the crucial question: what will it take to
drive infant HIV infections as close to zero as possible? Meeting this ambitious goal will require not only
pediatric interventions, such as improved postnatal prophylaxis for infants born to people with HIV, but also
bold and creative interventions for pregnant and lactating people with or at risk for HIV to prevent, diagnose,
and treat maternal HIV before infant infection occurs. Both pediatric and maternal interventions are needed,
but neither can be considered in isolation; the choice of maternal interventions will determine what infant
interventions are clinically most useful and provide good economic value. We will conduct CEPAC model-
based policy analyses of individual maternal and infant interventions. We will then develop, test, and apply
simulation optimization methods to identify the package of these interventions that minimizes infant infection
risk, improves infant and maternal health, and provides the best value for limited healthcare resources in each
of the three focus countries described above. Our Specific Aims include:
 Aim 1: To estimate the clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of maternal HIV testing, prevention,
 and treatment approaches to reduce vertical HIV transmission and improve maternal health
 Aim 2: To identify the most effective and cost-effective infant HIV prophylaxis and testing strategies
 Aim 3: To optimize integrated maternal-child HIV prevention and treatment approaches
To make the findings of this work more broadly applicable, we will identify optimal packages of care in three
WHO-defined country “types,” based on HIV incidence, prevalence, and access to care. To make the findings
accessible to clinicians, program planners, and policymakers, we will develop optimization webtools for
different settings. This proposal leverages the substantial advances in pediatric HIV simulation modeling made
by the CEPAC-P team in the prior cycle to address the full range of approaches that will be needed to achieve
ambitious global goals of eliminating pediatric AIDS. This work directly addresses NICHD research priorities:
“efficient use of next-generation preventive and therapeutic technologies and prevention of HIV acquisition and
illness in women and infants.” It also uses novel optimization methods to bring the results of complex models
closer to policymakers to improve outcomes for mothers and infants affected by HIV worldwide."

The 3D folding of human chromosomes inside the nucleus affects critical biological processes, including gene
regulation and DNA repair, while also influencing the physical properties of the nucleus. To make progress
toward our overarching goal of understanding the principles of chromosome folding and their importance in
health and disease, my research program investigates the responses of 3D genome structure to physical
perturbations. We examine alterations of chromosome structure in the context of DNA damage, nucleus
structure disruption by lamin mutation, cell migration through narrow constrictions, and externally applied
forces. Our recent work has revealed a striking robustness of chromosome structure to many transient
perturbations, but has shown stable alterations in the 3D genome and cell phenotype can result from chronic or
repeated stresses. By comparing complementary systems, we have identified different levels of the
chromosome structure hierarchy that respond to different stresses: DNA damage results in strengthening of
the local loop and topologically associating domain (TAD) structure while physical deformations of the nucleus
associated with altered spatial segregation of heterochromatin and euchromatin. New research in a variety of
systems is revealing the important role of nucleus mechanosensation in cell fate decisions. We are now well-
positioned to connect cellular and imaging observations of such phenomena with the 3D genome changes that
accompany them. In this next funding period, our research will examine what molecular mechanisms contribute
to stable 3D genome and phenotype changes after cancer cells pass through multiple rounds of constricted
migration. We will contrast this constricted migration system with responses elicited by externally applied
forces on the cell. We will examine how disruption of nucleus architecture by a lamin mutation affects genome
structure reprogramming during differentiation and contributes to the patient phenotypes of the premature
aging disease Progeria. As many of these stressors also induce DNA damage, we will finally investigate the
effects of chromosome structure alterations after DNA damage on DNA repair, gene regulation, and cellular
response to subsequent stresses. Observations across our experimental systems combined with
computational analysis and modeling will clarify the relationship between changes in chromosome structure
and gene expression and reveal how microscopically observed alterations in chromosome conformation relate
to changes in contact patterns detected by chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) family techniques. Our
previous innovations in single cell genomic data analysis and integration position us to investigate how
average shifts in cell population behavior connect to the heterogeneity and dynamics of chromosome structure
and gene expression at a single cell level. Defining connections between physical perturbations, genome
architecture, and cell fate will inform future diagnostics and treatments for diseases such as cancer, premature
aging, cardiomyopathies, and any condition where the physical state of the cell influences cell function."

The overwhelming immune response to systemic infection and traumatic injury may result in
hyperinflammation, multiple organ failure, and death in sepsis. Sepsis is a complex and heterogeneous critical
illness with multiple dynamic dysregulated inflammatory pathways triggered by systemically released Damage
or Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs/PAMPs). Dysregulated inflammation also contributes to
the pathogenesis of many other diseases, e.g. autoimmune diseases, chronic wounds, etc. Clinical
challenges: Versatile immune modulation therapy to resolve inflammation in critical illness is still a significant
unmet need. Therapeutics targeting a specific inflammatory mediator, e.g. cytokines or DAMPs/PAMPs, have
failed to improve sepsis survival in the clinic. On the contrary, anti-inflammatory steroid drugs are associated
with immune suppression, resulting in an increased risk of secondary infections. Solutions: I have developed
a novel, well-defined linear-dendritic telodendrimer (TD) nanoplatform for structure-based nanocarrier design in
therapeutic delivery and immune modulation. In my on-going R01 project, I have developed TD nanotrap (NT)
platforms for both systemic injection and hemoperfusion therapy to passively capture a broad spectrum of the
overflowing inflammatory signals simultaneously, e.g. LPS, cytokines, and DAMPs/PAMPs, to restore immune
regulation. The optimized TD NT resins provide a cure in a severe sepsis mouse model when combined with a
moderate dose of antibiotics, as reported in our recent publications in Nature Communications 2020 and
Advanced Therapeutics 2022. Recently, we created a series of novel TD constructs with a well-defined and
optimal combination of negative charges and hydrophobic moieties that can actively block immune cell
inflammation triggered by various immune stimulating molecules, e.g. endotoxins from gram negative bacteria
(LPS) and gram positive bacteria (LTA), as well as bacterial cell lysate and even TNF-α. At the same time,
these TDs can assemble into nanocarriers for the encapsulation of vital antibiotics for infection control; they
can also effectively deliver endogenous potent pyroptosis inhibitors to control hyperinflammation and prevent
immune suppression in the later stage of sepsis. In the next five years, I will focus on the development of
transformative, next generation multimodal TD nanodrugs for sepsis treatment in three directions: PROJECT-
1: Develop a novel next-generation bioactive TD nanodrug for inflammation control; PROJECT-2: Develop
multi-functional TD nanotherapeutics to inhibit pyroptosis in sepsis; PROJECT-3: Develop multimodal TD
nanomedicine to control infection and inflammation in sepsis. In addition to sepsis, these TD nanodrugs can
also be applied in other inflammatory diseases, e.g., ARDS, chronic wounds, cancer perioperative
inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel diseases, etc. In summary, our innovative TD
nanodrugs are poised to provide resolution to inflammation and improve sepsis survival in the clinic by both
immune modulation and infection control."

Craniofacial anomalies (CFAs) comprise 75% of congenital defects and represent a biomedical
burden of almost 700 million dollars per year in the United States. Surgical repair of CFAs is
difficult and often requires a large source of skeletal tissue to replace/reconstruct the facial
skeleton. Bone grafts used to repair CFAs frequently fail to integrate and are commonly allografts
from mesodermally derived bone. This is a suboptimal tissue source since the facial skeleton is
embryonically derived from an entirely different population of cells called neural crest cells
(NCCs). NCCs; however, have not been used in tissue engineering approaches because a robust,
postnatal source of cells does not exist and their multipotent nature raises concerns of regarding
uncontrolled differentiation. The over-arching, long-term goal of my laboratory is to integrate our
understanding of the cellular, molecular and biochemical mechanisms of NCC development and
apply this knowledge towards generating novel therapeutic strategies for generating a robust
source of NCC-derived tissues amenable for the surgical repair of craniofacial anomalies. To
achieve this goal, we are focusing on precisely directing NCCs proliferation and differentiation
into skeletal tissue via manipulation of the primary cilia, the cellular organelle which functions as
the signaling hub of all cells. Gaining a firm understanding of how the primary cilia work to
transduce molecular signals in NCCs, and other cells, will likely identify several novel therapeutic
options for disease treatment. The impact of our work would be broad and far-reaching as it has
the potential to revolutionize how CFAs and ciliopathies are treated."

This competitive renewal is to continue the Aging and Development Training program in
the Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences at Washington University. As the
population of the US and many other countries shifts toward an older distribution, the
scientific and societal challenges of human aging continue to increase. There is a critical
need for researchers with a firm foundation of training in the behavioral and
psychological characteristics of aging, and for these researchers to have the cutting-
edge skills to integrate neurobiology, genetics, and socioemotional mechanisms of aging
into their work. This renewal builds on the program's unique role as a pipeline of aging
researchers with a rigorous training in psychological science, while building
transdisciplinary bridges. With this renewal a core group of 20 Faculty in the Department
are joined by 13 faculty with primary appointments in the Medical School, the Brown
School of Social Work, and the McKelvey School of Engineering to serve as program
mentors. Training is organized around four interrelated themes: cognitive changes in
aging, the cognitive neuroscience of aging and dementia, personality and socio-
emotional aging, and translational impact. Trainees will receive in-depth training in one
to two themes and broad exposure to the others. The program trains both clinical and
non-clinical PhD students, and postdoctoral fellows. Trainees benefit from the excellent
resources in the Department and across the University, including those of the Charles

Adolescence is a vulnerable period of postnatal development for the onset of major psychiatric disorders where
the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is involved. According to the NIMH Council's Workgroup Report, many psychiatric
disorders can only be understood as an interaction between brain development and susceptibility to risk
factors. Although many progresses have been made in the field during the past few years, a comprehensive
understanding of the cellular and circuit level mechanisms regulating the developmental trajectory of neural
processes involved in these disorders remains incomplete. Thus, our long-term goal is to identify sensitive
developmental processes during adolescence that contribute to the onset of psychiatric disorders where the
PFC is compromised. From studies performed during the preceding grant period, we have found that a
hallmark of PFC maturation during adolescence is the functional re-calibration of an excitatory-inhibitory (E-I)
balance state. In addition to the gain of GABA function, there is a facilitation of GluN2B and GluN2A NMDAR
transmission in the PFC that is intimately linked to ventral hippocampal and basolateral amygdalar inputs. Yet,
the extent to which coordinated activation of ventral hippocampal and basolateral amygdalar inputs during
adolescence are required for the functional maturation of the PFC remains unclear. We will fill this gap in
knowledge through the pursuit of 3 Specific Aims. We will use an input-specific chemogenetic strategy to
transiently inhibit PFC afferent transmission at 3 non-overlapping adolescent periods to establish the exact
window(s) of susceptibility for the gain/functional maturation of the GABA and NMDA synaptic components of
the PFC E-I balance and their impact on PFC-dependent behaviors in adulthood. Together, the proposed aims
are expected to uncover key neural circuit processes that contribute to the enhanced PFC vulnerability during
adolescence to developmental insults. Such knowledge is expected to provide insights on the implementation
of new therapeutic interventions to prevent/mitigate the incidence of cognitive and affective deficits often seen
in mental illnesses that emerge during adolescence."

HIV/AIDS remains a debilitating disease globally, with infections among young adults in the US in recent years
increasing. Although extensive efforts are dedicated to HIV vaccine and cure research, these approaches have
yet to yield candidates for routine clinical use. By contrast, combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has been
used to reduce disease burden and mortality since its introduction into the clinic in the mid-1990s.
Recommended cART formulations contain an integrase inhibitor that inhibits the enzyme active site and its
strand transfer activity (integrase strand transfer inhibitor or INSTI). Despite their resounding success,
incidence of resistance to second-generation INSTIs is increasing, and will predictably increase further as
these drugs are rolled out for global usage. Paralleling the success of active site and allosteric site inhibitors of
the reverse transcriptase enzyme, the clinic will benefit greatly from the addition of a second class of integrase
inhibitor, such as allosteric integrase inhibitors (ALLINIs). This grant over the current funding cycle made
seminal contributions to understanding the mechanism of action of pre-clinical ALLINI compounds, and such
compounds are today in development at pharmaceutical companies. In this grant application we will continue
to categorize the mechanism of ALLINI action, which is critical basic information required in advance of clinical
rollout and clinical drug resistance. This research will in part be focused on the mechanism of action of the
integrase binding protein lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF)/p75, which helps to guide the virus to
active genes for integration. In particular, some of the best-studied ALLINI chemotypes are effective inhibitors
of the LEDGF/p75-integrase binding interaction. Inspired by the success of LEDGF/75 binding site ALLINI
compounds, we will now characterize in detail interactions of additional host factors that are shown to bind
integrase. As evidenced by the large variety of mutations that cause pleiotropic replication catastrophe, HIV-1
integrase is extremely sensitive to change. Characterization of novel host factor-integrase complexes will
define new targets for future antiretroviral inhibitor development."
10845294,"SUMMARY
 Recurrent alveolar injury and dysregulated signaling in alveolar cell niche have been implicated in the
pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. While genome-wide association studies further supported this model, the
precise cellular triggers and the molecular mechanisms that drive alveolar fibroblasts replication and their
conversion into excessive extracellular matrix producing myofibroblasts remain elusive. Currently we lack a
comprehensive understanding of the cell intrinsic and extrinsic homeostatic mechanisms that normally control
fibroblasts replication and prevent their conversion into pathological myofibroblasts.
 Our recent finding that either conditional ablation of alveolar epithelial type-1 (AT1) cells, or loss of Pdgfra
specifically in PDGFRA-expressing fibroblasts (alveolar fibroblasts) in vivo, results in spontaneous conversion
of alveolar fibroblasts into myofibroblasts and fibrosis. Single cell transcriptome guided ligand-receptor pair
predictions coupled with alveolar fibroblast cultures in serum-free conditions suggest that AT1 cell-derived
PDGFA is required in proper amounts to both maintain alveolar fibroblasts identity (i.e., prevent their conversion
to myofibroblasts) and control replication. Exploring downstream mechanisms, we have uncovered an increase
in the expression of the transcription factor RUNX1 in both replicating alveolar fibroblasts as well as TGFβ-
induced myofibrogenesis both in vivo and ex vivo. Significantly, our preliminary data also indicate that genetic
loss of Runx1 abrogates PDGFA or TGFβ-induced alveolar fibroblasts proliferation or conversion into
myofibroblasts, respectively. These preliminary data lead us to hypothesize that AT1 cells maintain alveolar
fibroblasts identity via PDGFA – PDGFRA signaling axis and that a fine balance in the amount of PDGFA
is essential for fibroblast quiescence and replication at homeostasis and injury repair. We also
hypothesize that RUNX1 is an essential regulator of both PDGFRA and TGFβ signaling to regulate
replication and myofibrogenic programs in alveolar fibroblasts during regeneration and fibrosis.
The major objectives of this proposal are to define the communication between AT1 cells and alveolar
fibroblasts and to study transcriptional control of myofibrogenesis. In Aim1, we will test the hypothesis that
PDGFA-PDGFRA signaling between AT1 cells and alveolar fibroblasts is essential for alveolar homeostasis. In
Aim2, we will determine context specific functions of RUNX1 in alveolar fibroblasts replication and
myofibrogenesis. We will use novel in vivo genetic mouse models and pharmacological loss-of-function models,
human lung fibroblasts and precision cut lung slice cultures, and molecular assays to study these specific aims.
Our prior expertise in lung regeneration and transcriptional control of cell fates will aid us in studying the proposed
aims. The outcomes from the proposed studies will have broader impact on lung regenerative medicine and will
form the basis for development of therapeutics to prevent and reverse human lung fibrosis."
10845295,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Nearly every aspect of T cell biology is determined in part by the relative expression of a multitude of
cell-surface proteins. For example, the relative expression of co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory receptors impact
pro- versus anti-inflammatory outcomes. N-glycosylation is a critical but poorly understood regulator of cell-
surface protein turnover. Virtually every cell-surface and secreted protein is modified with covalently attached
complex carbohydrates at asparagine (N) residues. These N-glycans are variably edited by a large number of
glycosylation enzymes along the secretory pathway, producing many possible glycan structures. The N-glycan
branching pathway serves as a key gateway between relatively simple high-mannose structures and more
complex N-glycans that carry glyco-epitopes recognized by numerous families of carbohydrate-binding
proteins, known as lectins. The branching pathway controls N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) incorporation into
N-glycans, which are recognized by the galectin family of soluble lectins. At the cell surface, the interaction of
multivalent soluble galectins with glycoproteins carrying LacNAc units, leads to the formation of a molecular
lattice-like structure. This galectin-glycoprotein lattice affects cell surface organization, receptor mobility in the
plane of the membrane, and endocytosis rates. In part by regulating cell surface expression of CD4, CD8,
IL2Rα, CTLA-4, and the T cell receptor (TCR), N-glycan branching regulates T cell development, TCR
signaling, T cell activation, T cell proliferation and pro-inflammatory versus anti-inflammatory differentiation.
Based on studies of these receptors, a model has emerged of the lattice as a unidirectional regulator of cell-
surface retention which opposes glycoprotein loss and promotes cell surface retention. However counter-
examples to this model have recently emerged demonstrating that some receptors are regulated in the
opposite manner. Thus a comprehensive and unbiased analysis of branching regulated changes is needed.
Furthermore, an understanding of the mechanisms involved that promote expression of some receptors while
hindering expression of others is also lacking. Without such detailed information, therapeutic targeting of the
complex glycosylation pathways that regulate T cell function will be limited. We have developed an approach to
examine branching mediated effects on cell-surface expression at the proteome scale. We provide proof-of-
concept that this approach is reliable and informative and propose to use it to tackle this outstanding aspect of
T cell biology. In Aim1, we will extend this approach to more physiologically relevant primary T cells and
examine a range of N-glycan branching states to derive a complete and informative picture. We will also adapt
our approach to globally determine endocytosis and recycling rates of branching regulated proteins. In Aim 2,
we will test the hypothesis that cargo adapter proteins in the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway cooperate
with N-glycan branching to differentially regulate receptor turnover and expression. Together these studies will
dramatically increase our knowledge of branching mediated regulation of T cell biology."

Progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease (PF-ILD) is a group of diseases characterized by increasing self-
sustaining fibrosis, progressive worsening of dyspnea, progressive decline in lung function, limited response to
immunomodulatory therapies, and high mortality. Due to the highly variable rates of decline and poor prognosis,
accurate individualized prognostic prediction of patients with PF-ILD is crucial for therapeutic decision making
and management of the patients. However, no formal staging system based on prognosis has been established
for PF-ILD. This is because, despite many attempts, none of the developed existing prognostic biomarkers have
been found to be accurate enough for establishing such a staging system for PF-ILD. A clinically useful staging
system for PF-ILD would enable many important clinical use cases, such as determining the timing and benefits
of the currently available but costly therapies and interventions, identifying patients where treatment can be
safely delayed to avoid potential adverse drug effects and costs, and identifying new therapies in clinical trials.
Quantitative high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) images have recently emerged as the most
promising approach for providing accurate and reproducible biomarkers in PF-ILD patients, but current HRCT
biomarkers have still yielded only mediocre predictive performances of 64-77% for patients with PF-ILD, as
measured by the concordance index. Thus, there is an unmet clinical need for a prognostic biomarker that would
predict the mortality and disease progression in PF-ILD patients at a high accuracy. Artificial intelligence (AI),
especially deep learning, could be used to realize such a prognostic biomarker. In particular, a conditional
generative adversarial network (cGAN) was recently shown to outperform traditional survival analysis methods
in survival prediction, but there are no such cGAN-based methods to perform prognostic prediction from the
image data of patients. In this project, we propose to develop an unsupervised image-based 3D cGAN model
that would automatically estimate the distribution of the survival time directly from the HRCT images of patients
for prognostic prediction. Our goal is to develop an integrated AI survival prediction model that will combine
existing biomarkers with the image-based 3D cGAN model for performing accurate prognostic prediction in
patients with PF-ILD. We hypothesize that the integrated AI model will yield a high performance (concordance
index of ≥92%) in predicting the mortality and disease progression in PF-ILD patients. Successful development
of the proposed integrated AI model will significantly improve the accuracy of the current state-of-the-art in the
prognostic prediction of the mortality and disease progression in patients with PF-ILD, thereby ultimately making

On behalf of the ACE network, the Emory ACE Fund Management Core (EAFMC) at Emory
University proposes to continue to manage two funds. The first will be the Clinical Project Fund,
which will support all of the Clinical Projects (ClinProj) within the ACE. The second will be the
Collaborative Research Fund (CRF). The CRF will provide funding support for the Collaborative
Projects of the ACE, as well as additional studies that are added for achieving the ACE research
agenda. It is estimated from the RFA that the AFMC will manage $3.2M in direct costs associated
with these projects and that these will occur through about 100 consortium agreements emanating
from up to 50 different sites. It will accomplish this through the following aims: (1) Continue to
enhance the administration and management of the clinical and collaborative projects; (2)
Streamline the development of budgets and consortium agreements; (3) Establish templates for
the CliniPrj and CRP budget agreements; (4) Implement procedures to pay invoices and resolve
problems and (5) Develop procedures for accountability, communication and reporting to the ACE
Steering Committee and NIAID; all by utilizing the (6) EAFMC Templates developed."
10837889,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Phantom limb pain (PLP) is considered an extremely hard-to-treat disorder, given that traditional treatments are
not effective in targeting the maladaptive neuronal circuits associated with chronic pain. Transcranial direct
current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive, safe brain stimulation technique that has been shown to revert
maladaptive plasticity as well as reduce pain in neuropathic pain and other pain syndromes. Our previous R01
on this topic has demonstrated the efficacy of tDCS combined with somatosensory training in a controlled setting
to improve pain and that this intervention changes PLP associated cortical plasticity. Our previous R01 also
shown pain phenotypes based on PLP characteristics that are more responsive to this treatment. The objective
of this renewal is to provide novel data to address critical knowledge gaps such as (i) testing a portable device
that would reach underrepresented populations; (ii) validation of this therapy in a more pragmatic setting; (iii)
confirmation and testing of predictors of response with statistical and machine learning techniques; and (iv)
testing the parasympathetic tone changes (with the remote assessment) as a biomarker of neuropathic pain
relief. The central hypothesis is that a combination of home-based tDCS and somatosensory therapy will reduce
pain in PLP patients. Our long-term goal is to develop a cheap, efficacious, safe, and practical treatment for PLP.
Our rationale is that understanding the effects of tDCS in a real-life setting will validate this treatment for PLP
and identify predictors of response to this treatment will help health professionals better target and more precisely
treat individuals with this condition. Our specific aims will test the following hypotheses: (Aim 1) tDCS combined
with somatosensory therapy will be associated with a significantly larger effect size (of at least 1) compared to
the control condition in pain reduction; (Aim 2) identifying predictors of response of this combined treatment
using machine learning algorithms will help identify different pain phenotypes in patients with PLP and improve
their target treatment; (Aim 3) combined treatment will bolster the parasympathetic tone (as indexed by higher
heart rate variability) and reduce sympathetic activation, changes which will be correlated with PLP decreases.
This contribution is significant because, although several studies have tested the efficacy of tDCS for chronic
pain, there is a need to evaluate its effectiveness in a real-world setting, and this proposal provides critical data
to develop a safe and unique intervention to be applied at home, which can therefore increase its access to
underrepresented populations and decrease therapeutic costs. This investigation will also provide mechanistic
data on predictors of response and changes in parasympathetic tone associated with this intervention. The
proposed research is innovative because it offers a pragmatic trial design for PLP treatment and aims to validate
a home-based tDCS device that is feasible and able to provide longer treatments remotely. This proposal is also
investigating HRV as a surrogate marker for reducing PLP and assessing its feasibility in a real-life setting.
Finally, this proposal validates predictors of response to PLP treatment using machine learning algorithms."
10837890,"Currently, 5.4 million Americans are suffering from Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which is the only major disease
lacking good prevention methods, treatments, or a cure. Recent evidence suggests that age related
impairment of mitochondrial function and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production contribute to
cellular damage and AD progression. The object of this proposal is to understand the affects of O-GlcNAcylation on mitochondrial function and the development of AD. O-GlcNAc is categorized by the addition
of a single O-linked β-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine moiety to serine/threonine amino acids of nuclear and
cytoplasmic proteins. This modification is responsive to extracellular signals such hormones, nutrients, and
environmental cues and is involved in regulating numerous cellular functions such as the cell cycle, stress
response, transcription, and translation. The enzymes responsible for processing the modification are O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), which adds the modification, and O-GlcNAcase (OGA), which removes the
modification. Importantly, changes in O-GlcNAcylation alter mitochondrial function. Cells actively maintain
homeostatic levels in O-GlcNAc, and cells will alter the expression of OGT and OGA to modulate O-GlcNAcylation due to changes in the environment. We contend that O-GlcNAcylation is disrupted in chronic
metabolic disease, which exacerbates the decline in mitochondrial function. We have demonstrated that over-expression of OGT or OGA causes large changes in protein expression of electron transport chain and Krebs
cycle proteins, respiration is impaired, and mitochondrial morphology is disrupted. These data suggest that
alterations to O-GlcNAc homeostasis would affect mitochondrial function exacerbating AD. In the current
proposal, we will determine the mechanisms as to how O-GlcNAcylation regulates cellular function. First, we
will identify changes to the transcriptome, proteome, and O-GlcNAcome in mouse models of AD or after loss of
OGT. We will then determine how disrupted O-GlcNAc homeostasis affects electron transport chain function
and metabolic gene expression. We will address the effect of OGA inhibitors on ameliorating mitochondrial
dysfunction in AD mouse models. Furthermore, we will explore how O-GlcNAcylation influences mitochondrial
anti-oxidant response. Our preliminary data shows that alterations in O-GlcNAc induce changes in anti-oxidant
response and NRF2 activity, a critical transcription factor controlling the transcription of anti-oxidant genes. We
will ascertain the mechanistic role of O-GlcNAc in regulating NRF2 transcriptional activity and protein
interactions. Finally, we will use AD patient samples to identify the potential to use of O-GlcNAc, OGT or OGA
as AD biomarkers. These studies will provide new mechanistic details into how O-GlcNAcylation affects
mitochondrial function, how O-GlcNAc influences anti-oxidant response, NRF2 function, and will provide new
pathways for clinical intervention of AD."
10837891,"TRAINING PROGRAM IN PHARMACOLOGY
ABSTRACT:
The overarching goal of this predoctoral Training Program in Pharmacology (TPPh) is to educate next
generation of biomedical researchers in the concepts of drug discovery and development, inclusive a
clinical perspective. The four focus areas of this TPPh are cardiovascular, neurological, and immunological
diseases and cancer. UC Davis is a world leader in drug development with multiple trainers bringing drugs
to the clinic (most recently Dr. Rogawski the novel post-partum antidepressant Brexanolone) and biologics
including gene therapy vectors with >20 ongoing clinical trials (Director Dr. Nolta). Trainees from
Pharmacology & Toxicology, Physiology, Biomedical Engineering and Neuroscience develop expertise in
diverse areas. Areas include classic pharmacology & drug target identification with cutting edge methods in
biochemistry, structural biology, genomics & proteomics, molecular and cell biology; structural modeling and
rational drug design; medicinal chemistry; high & superresolution imaging; electrophysiology; behavioral
physiology; engineering of microfluidic and other devices; animal models of disease; novel in vivo whole
animal imaging; and translational therapeutics in clinical trials including stem cell and genetic therapies. The
TPPh will provide focused and student-tailored small group training in the core principles of pharmacology
for non-pharmacology trainees, and enmesh these students with pharmacology students for interdisciplinary
group learning in drug development. A related goal is to enable all trainees to communicate and collaborate
across the large array of research disciplines they represent. This goal is mainly realized in a highly innovative
student-driven, project-oriented course Problem Solving in Pharmacological Sciences, which rejuvenates
itself every year based on student initiative and interest. In this way our TPPh produces experts with a variety
of backgrounds that can effectively communicate and collaborate with experts from other related disciplines
in the increasingly complex realm of drug development. UC Davis grants more bachelors and doctoral
degrees in biological sciences than any other U.S. university. It received $961 million in extramural research
funding in 2020/21, which places it, as in earlier years, among the top 10 public universities. The 30 training
faculty are from 14 departments in 6 colleges, where extensive collaborative interactions already exist.
Trainers provide in depth expertise that ranges from identifying novel therapeutic molecular targets and
development of therapeutic molecules to clinical drug and stem cell trials at the NIH-funded UC Davis Clinical
and Translational Science Center (CTSC) and NIH-designated Cancer Center. Powerful and numerous state-
of-the-art core facilities and centers will provide trainees with outstanding research opportunities spanning
from Chemistry’s emphasis on pharmaceutical chemistry to unique animal models (internationally recognized
mouse biology center, Agricultural & Veterinary Schools, Primate Center)."
10836918,"The broad long-term objective of this project is to improve the success rate of novel mood
disorder therapeutics by enhancing the reliability and generalizability of Clinician Reported
Outcomes (ClinROs) in clinical trials. This will be achieved by developing and validating the
Depression and Anxiety AI-COA™, a machine learning-based drug development tool that
analyzes audiovisual recordings of clinical interviews to infer HAM-D and HAM-A scores, and
through doing so enhances the effective reliability of primary endpoints.
The specific aims of this project will reduce uncertainties around the design and dimensioning of
a prospective confirmatory trial which will be proposed in the Qualification Plan (QP)
1) Augment the pilot dataset: Assess 96 new participants to enhance the
 representativeness of the dataset, targeting 80% male and 82% non-white participants.
 Re-assess 30% of the new sample after 12 weeks to confirm sensitivity to change, and
 have each rating re-rated by two additional raters for enhanced reliability.
2) Assess overall model performance change: Re-train the AI-COA™ model with the
 augmented pilot dataset and evaluate the impact on performance. Adjust the assumed
 sample size based on the updated model's ICC to achieve the 95% CI around the
 expected ICC in the trial.
3) Evaluate generalization across biological sex: a) Assess biological sex generalization
 using a non-linear regression model with fixed-effects, b) experiment with normalizing
 features between biological sexes, and c) develop mixed-effects models (e.g., Maximum
 Likelihood Estimation, Bayesian hierarchical models) with gender nesting. If the model
 generalizes well across biological sexes, loosen biological sex split and sample
 requirements for the Qualification Plan.
Relevance to the Mission of the Agency: This project addresses the critical need for improved
reliability and generalizability in mood disorder clinical trials, which have historically suffered
from low FDA approval rates. By enhancing the quality of ClinROs, this research aligns with the
FDA and HHS’ missions to protect and promote public health and accelerate the development
of effective, safe, and innovative therapeutics for mood disorders. The AI-COA™ tool aims to
increase study power, reduce sample size requirements, and shorten trial durations, ultimately
contributing to more efficient and successful drug development processes."

2003. For pandemic reasons, LASDB meetings have not occurred since the one in Buenos Aires, Argentina in
2019. Hence, the 11th LASDB meeting, to be organized in Chile in 2024, is a very special and long-awaited
opportunity to re-connect the Latin American community by bringing together approximately 300 highly motivated
graduate students, postdocs and junior scientists from the region, as well top-notch researchers working in
different countries around the world for discussions of the recent advances in the field. This meeting will also
coincide with the inaugural meeting of the recently created Chilean Society for Developmental Biology (SBDCh)
and with the first meeting in Latin America of the Pan-American Society for Evolutionary Developmental Biology
(PASEDB) whose purpose is to integrate and help develop Evo-Devo in Latin America, a continent rich in
amazing, yet, understudied, biological diversity. The main goal of the LASDB is to promote active discussions of
the latest advances in Developmental Biology in a highly dynamic and interactive environment, favoring
synergies of ideas and networking opportunities. For preparing the list of 22 outstanding invited speakers, the

We are requesting funds to support the 52nd Annual Meeting of the American Aging Association (AGE) that will
take place on June 2-5, 2024 in Madison, WI. The 52nd Annual AGE Meeting will be held in conjunction with the
Nathan Shock Centers of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging Symposium (June 2). Since its first
conference in 1971, the American Aging Association has been the only scientific society in the United States
focused solely on the biology of aging. The annual AGE meeting is one of the premier meetings in
biogerontological research and serves as a critical mechanism by which AGE advances its mission to promote
biomedical aging studies that target increasing the functional life span of humans, to keep the public informed
on these activities, to increase knowledge of biogerontology among health care professionals, and to foster the
scientific and professional career development of AGE trainees and scientific members. The primary goal of the
conference is to convene senior and junior scientists in a forum where the latest discoveries in aging research
are discussed and debated, to highlight exciting new research in the field, and to promote the emergence of new
ideas and collaborative activities among participants. The theme for the AGE 52nd annual meeting is “Integrative
approaches to geroscience”. The invited speakers include prominent established scientists, early career
investigators, and trainees, all of whom will be selected based on the quality and impact of their science. We
have planned 9 non-competing oral sessions that will be held along with three special lectures and a panel
discussion. Fostering the next generation of biogerontologists is a primary goal of the society; therefore, one of
the sessions will be organized in its entirety by the Trainee Chapter of AGE. In addition, we have chosen to have
at least two speakers in each of the sessions as early career investigators or trainees selected from submitted
abstracts. Two poster sessions are planned that will not compete with oral presentations. Abstracts will be
reviewed and scored and the top 40 poster presenters will be given the opportunity to present their posters in a
two-minute oral “poster pitch” during the regular sessions. Gender parity will be achieved, with women
representing 53% of invited and confirmed speakers, and 63% of symposium speakers being early career
researchers; at least 20% of speakers are from underrepresented groups. We expect that the meeting will be
held in person with a live-streamed virtual component. AGE has experience with both fully virtual and hybrid
meetings. We will adhere to established meeting guidelines, including ensuring that day care opportunities and
special need access are provided."
10828086,"The rising prevalence with advancing age and the adverse impact of debilitating diseases like Alzheimer’s
disease and related dementias (ADRD) has led to a need for clinical and research methods for measurement
of effects of these diseases. Cognitive tests, biomarkers, informant reports, imaging data, and a wealth of other
measures play major roles in detecting, diagnosing and monitoring disease status and progression. Greater
demographic diversity creates special challenges for accurate measurement of cognition. Most cognitive tests
that are in clinical and research use were developed using psychometric methods from the first half of the 20th
century. There have been substantial advances in measurement theory and methodology, notably item
response theory (IRT) and associated latent variable modeling methods, that could have an important impact
on the measurement of cognition. There have been parallel advances in statistical methodology for modeling
longitudinal cognitive trajectories and identifying characteristics that impact these important outcomes. This
conference series is designed to promote the application of modern psychometric and statistical methods in
research on cognitive aging and ADRD. Specific goals are: 1) to expose developing and established
researchers in cognitive aging and ADRD research to modern psychometric and statistical modeling
techniques, 2) to expose experts in psychometric theory and statistics to the practical and theoretical concerns
of cognitive aging and Alzheimer’s disease research, and 3) encourage collaborations of researchers,
psychometricians, and statisticians during these conferences. We have conducted 14 successful annual
conferences since initial funding of this grant in 2008, which has generated 84 collaborative publications to
date. This experience has helped to shape our plans for the next generation of conferences. The format of the
conferences includes didactic presentations by experts in cognitive aging and applied psychometric theory,
demonstrations of methods, and most importantly, hands-on experience using real data. This content and
format is not only appropriate for encouraging education and collaboration of seasoned researchers but has
also been an extremely effective learning environment for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior
faculty. Conference themes for the proposed five-year renewal period are: 1) Cross-national comparisons of
cognitive aging outcomes and correlates, 2) synthetic data sets, 3) Advances in algorithms for diagnosing
cognitive impairment and dementia, 4) Advanced Methods for Understanding Racial and Ethnic Inequalities in
Cognitive Aging and Dementia, and 5) Global pandemic and Cognitive Aging. All conferences address
methods and substantive science issues that are relevant for research to understand, diagnose, monitor, and
treat ADRD and related causes of cognitive decline. There will be a heavy emphasis on workgroups organized
around scientific analyses of real data, and we plan to disseminate the information resulting from these
workshops through publications in peer reviewed scientific journals and through conference presentations."
10828237,"Summary/Abstract
The overall goal of this proposal is to better understand the role of the tyrosine kinase receptor EphA2 signaling
pathway in alveolar macrophages during Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia
(PJP) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in AIDS1,2. During AIDS and other
immunosuppressive states, the absence of CD4 lymphocytic immunity results in exuberant and often fatal PJP3,4.
Myeloid cells, particularly alveolar macrophages (AMs) are crucial for anti-PJP innate immunity5-8. The binding
of Pneumocystis to alveolar macrophages mediates early host immune response to the fungus9,10. AMs further
promote killing and clearance of organisms but are also major sources of proinflammatory mediators contributing
to profound pulmonary inflammation and lung injury during PJP11-13.
 To date, extremely little is known regarding the role of EphA2 receptor and Pneumocystis engagement
in mediating subsequent effects on the host immune response and fungal killing during Pneumocystis pneumonia
(PCP). We have previously shown the importance of the β-glucan receptor EphA2 in Pneumocystis organism
attachment to lung epithelial cells14. Furthermore, we demonstrated that following EphA2 receptor-ligand
engagement with Pneumocystis β-glucan carbohydrates, the tyrosine kinase receptor is activated in epithelial
cells14. Now, our preliminary studies further indicate the importance of the EphA2 receptors on AMs in
inflammatory responses to Pneumocystis. To date, there are no published descriptions of the potential roles of
EphA2 on AMs during fungal infection pathogenesis. We now provide exciting new initial in vivo data
demonstrating that EphA2-deficient mice have significantly less proinflammatory responses and significantly
greater organism burden in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent mouse models of PCP.
 We therefore hypothesize that EphA2 receptors signal following Pneumocystis binding to alveolar
macrophages mediating early host immune recognition and response to the organism. In addition, based on our
preliminary in vivo PCP model data, we further hypothesize that EphA2-receptor signaling in AMs is critical for
mounting proper lung inflammation and organism control during PCP. Two Specific Aims are proposed.
 Aim 1: We will characterize the function of EphA2 signaling pathways in AMs following in vitro organism
attachment. We will specifically study the resulting cytokine response in AMs, as well as subsequent
organism killing by AMs. To address this, we will examine the function of EphA2 in AMs derived from EphA2
(EphA2-/-) receptor knockout and wildtype mice challenged with mouse derived Pneumocystis murina.
Specifically, we will study the binding kinetics and inflammatory responses following P. murina interactions with
AMs. Initial data from our lab suggests significantly less inflammatory cytokine responses in macrophages from
EphA2-/- versus wildtype controls. Furthermore, we will analyze the uptake and killing of P. murina by
macrophages, as well as cytokine release by these cells challenged with either P. murina as well as isolated
Pneumocystis organism cell wall components.
Aim 2: We will further determine the role of EphA2-signaling on modulating lung inflammation, AM
subset recruitment, and organism burdens in the PCP immunocompetent and immunosuppressed
models in mice. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that CD4-depleted EphA2-/- mice with PCP exhibit
significantly increased organism burdens compared to their wildtype counterparts. Accordingly, we will evaluate
the time course and magnitudes of organism clearance and inflammatory cytokines in wildtype and EphA2-/-
mice. We will directly contrast these parameters in immune competent compared to CD4-depleted mice.
Furthermore, we will directly isolate and assess macrophages derived from both groups of infected mice to
assess their ability to kill Pneumocystis and generate adequate cytokine responses. We will also employ flow
cytometry to further isolate and characterize distinct pulmonary macrophages subset recruitment. This will
include whether the AMs are relatively Type 1 or Type 2 polarized and will further assess the recruitment
of other macrophage populations include tissue-resident alveolar macrophages (TR-AMs), monocyte-
derived alveolar macrophages (Mo-AMs), and interstitial macrophages (IMs). These determinations will be
performed in both mouse strains tested in the PCP models proposed. These studies promise valuable
insights into the role of EphA2 receptor signaling pathway in macrophages during PCP and should provide initial
data that may inform future targeted therapies of this pathway for the treatment of PCP.
 We anticipate that these studies will define the importance of the of EphA2 receptor signaling pathway in
organism killing and regulating the host response in PCP. Modulating these pathways may serve as a novel
strategy for therapeutic intervention potentially beneficial to patients with PJP when provided in addition to
traditional antibiotic agents."
10932289,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Covid-19 has increased the prevalence of substance use disorders (SUD) visits in primary care, which, when
coupled with problems of mental healthcare access for vulnerable rural populations, accentuates already
existing disparities for these patients. There is an urgent need to improve the timely identification and
management of SUD for rural primary care patients. Screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment
(SBIRT) is an evidenced-based strategy to address SUD in the primary care setting, but it is seldom fully used.
Building on our experience in depression collaborative care (CC) management and ability to scale telehealth
outreach, we built a digitally native integrated behavioral health CC platform using a novel app and provider
platform called Senyo Health. We will utilize this SUD CC platform to complement existing CC for depression
to deliver SUD care integrated into primary care. We feel this approach will enhance SBIRT care and improve
patient-centered outcomes. If our pilot succeeds, we will scale the Senyo Health platform for SUD treatment
among rural Midwest Mayo Health System patients.
With this study, we will apply two operational strengths of Mayo Clinic to a new domain of care delivery: a
demonstrated track record of implementing integrated behavioral health CC to improve the management of
depression in the primary care setting and a demonstrated ability to rapidly deploy telemedicine service for all
psychiatric and psychological care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through diverse stakeholder engagement,
we will explore specific barriers, facilitators, and optimal implementation processes to adapt and pilot test a
digitally native CC platform for SUD. Using a mixed implementation and efficacy study designed, we propose
enrolling patients from three clinical sites, including two rural health clinics, to evaluate the intervention's
acceptability, feasibility, and potential effectiveness. Building off this initial phase, we will expand our
intervention to include four more new clinics continuing the same mixed methods to adapt and improve
implementation processes and clinical outcomes. We will then disseminate our acquired knowledge through
research publications, web stories, and a manualized process to share with those interested in implementing a
virtual CC approach to delivering SUD services in primary care."

 The Association for Research in Otolaryngology (ARO) is requesting continued
support from of an NIDCD Conference Grant for its annual Midwinter Research
Meeting (MWM). The MWM is a unique meeting where current basic and clinical
research related to otolaryngology is presented. In addition to poster
presentations and podium sessions where cutting edge research is presented, the
meeting includes symposia and workshops that allow presentation of up-to-date
summaries of broad scientific issues that extend beyond the field of
otolaryngology. These symposia typically include invited scientists and clinician-
scientists from related fields whose work may be relevant to emerging areas of
research in otolaryngology. The symposia have been supported by the
Conference Grant for more than 25 years and have contributed to the success of
the meeting, as evidence by its growth over the years.
 The growth and development of otolaryngology research depends on bringing
young investigators into the field. Travel awards for young investigators, including
residents, medical students, and minority pre-doctoral and postdoctoral fellows
have been supported by the NIDCD Conference Grant. We request support to
continue these activities.
 In addition, the NIDCD Conference Grant would continue to enhance
accessibility of the MWM for individuals with disabilities, particularly those with
hearing impairments."
10829333,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects more than 2.5 million (US civilian and veterans) annually and accounts for
30% of all injury-related fatalities. TBI patients often develop long-lasting traumatic axonal injury, loss of myelin
sheath, and inhibition of oligodendrocyte maturation, which contribute to motor, cognitive, behavioral, and
psychiatric deficits. However, the underlying mechanisms of TBI-induced white matter injury and impairment of
axonal remyelination remain poorly understood. Microglia activation plays a role in white matter injury and tissue
repair. Regulation of a switch between pro-inflammatory and adaptive phenotypes of microglia/macrophage is
important for oligodendrocyte differentiation, remyelination, as well as remodeling of synapses. We recently
discovered that Na/H exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) protein-mediated H+ efflux maintains microglial intracellular
pH (pHi) homeostasis to promote NADPH oxidase-mediated free radical superoxide production and cytokine
secretion. We reported that selective deletion of microglial Nhe1 in the Cx3cr1-CreER;Nheflox/flox (Nhe1 KO) mice
preserved oligodendrocytes and improved sensorimotor function recovery in an experimental focal ischemic
stroke model, which may result from microglia-oligodendrocyte interactions and microglia-mediated synapse
plasticity. Our pilot study using a controlled cortical impact (CCI)-induced TBI model also reveals that Nhe1 KO
mice exhibited decreased pro-inflammatory responses and increased APC+ mature oligodendrocyte counts after
TBI. Especially, post-TBI administration of the NHE1 protein inhibitor HOE642 accelerated neurological function
recovery in mice after either stroke or TBI. These studies identified NHE1 protein as a potential therapeutic
target for modulating microglia-mediated inflammation in remyelination and tissue repair after TBI. In this
proposal, we will test a central hypothesis that: 1) activation of microglial NHE1 protein stimulates
proinflammatory responses and subsequently contributes to oligodendrocyte death and demyelination; 2)
selective deletion of microglial NHE1 protein promotes proliferation, differentiation, and survival of
oligodendrocytes; 3) inhibition of NHE1 protein activity also stimulates microglial phagocytic function for
clearance of myelin debris, which facilitates neuronal synapse pruning and remodeling after TBI. Completion of
this project will enable us to gain new knowledge about the roles of microglia-oligodendrocyte interactions in white
matter injury and tissue repair after TBI. The combined approaches with the microglial Cre-LoxP mouse line and
post-TBI pharmacological inhibition of NHE1 function will reveal therapeutic potentials of targeting NHE1 protein
for reducing white matter injury and improving tissue repair after TBI."

The primary goal of our summer research program is to immerse a selected group of 12
undergraduates (plus 4 supported by Seattle Children’s Research Institute) in a translational
environment of basic neuroscience, neural engineering, and neurological surgery.
In the first 12 years of program operation, we have placed 143 rising freshmen and college
undergraduate students age 18 and older from 80 different schools into the program. Students
have participated in 17 different laboratories engaging a total of 23 faculty, attended 96 separate
Grand Rounds presentations, observed over 500 surgical procedures and/or clinical shadowing
opportunities by following more than 20 different surgeons, and had weekly Q&A sessions
following student-centered presentations by 24 different faculty members. Students are selected
from a national applicant pool with 1200 full submissions being reviewed during the current award.
Several students from our earlier classes have now been accepted into medical school or PhD
neuroscience programs, and many have advanced to neuroscience or premedical studies in
college. Although the program is not exclusive to underrepresented minorities (URM), under the
R25 over 75% of participants have been women and almost 40% have been from URM groups.
While URM students are not the sole focus of the program, it is inherent in our mission to create
and provide conduits into the neurosciences fields for marginalized peoples. The program attracts
and recruits URM students through outreach programs to organizations such as the US
Department of Education TriO Program; the Washington Math, Engineering, Science Achievement
Program; Rainier Scholars; UW’s RISE UP/SKY GEAR UP (Gaining Early Awareness & Readiness
for Undergraduate Programs) Project; the US DOE-funded UW College Assistance Migrant
Program; the Center for First-generation Student Success; the Society for Advancement of
Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science; the Native Organization of Indigenous
Scholars; the Seattle University Foster Student Program; Chicanos/Latinos for Community
Medicine; and similar groups focused on advancing underrepresented students in STEM fields.
Coordinated recruitment has resulted in increased applications from underrepresented groups.

 This mentored career development award will provide Dr. Katherine Scovner with the resources,
additional training and protected time necessary to achieve her goal of becoming an independent clinical
investigator. Dr. Scovner has completed her master’s degree in Public Health and will continue to benefit from
her outstanding institutional support and resources through the pursuit of didactic courses for continued formal
education in biostatistics and study design through Harvard Catalyst and the Harvard Master of Medical
Sciences in Clinical Investigation program, research conferences, leadership courses and training in the
responsible conduct of research. These will complement her strong mentoring plan and institutional support
and will build upon her prior training in human investigation.
 Approximately 450,000 patients in the United States are treated with life-sustaining hemodialysis (HD)
for end-stage renal disease. These patients experience mortality rates of around 20% per year with nearly a
quarter of their mortality attributed to sudden cardiac death (SCD). This K23 Mentored Career Development
Award proposal (PA-20-206), entitled “Association of Dialysate Bicarbonate with Hemodynamic Instability and
Arrhythmia,” aims to investigate the role that dialysate bicarbonate plays in intradialytic hypotension and in
causing cardiac rhythms which increase the risk for SCD. The goal of this research is to understand how
dialysate bicarbonate interacts with serum pH and electrolytes to impact hemodynamics and cardiac rhythms
and to identify how individualized dialysate prescriptions may reduce hemodynamic instability, arrhythmia and
ultimately SCD in maintenance HD patients.
 In Aim 1, we will use data a large dialysis organization to assess how dialysate bicarbonate is
associated with intradialytic hypotension. In Aim 2, data from implanted loop recorders used in the Monitoring
in Dialysis (MiD) study will be analyzed to investigate the associations of serum and dialysate bicarbonate with
clinically significant arrhythmias (defined as sustained ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, asystole and
symptomatic arrhythmias), QTc prolongation and ventricular ectopy, parameters that are associated with SCD.
Aim 3 proposes a randomized, controlled, double-blind, cross-over trial in 44 maintenance HD outpatients to
measure how dialysate bicarbonate levels affect intradialytic QTc prolongation, ventricular ectopy, clinically
significant arrhythmias and intradialytic hypotension to assess how HD prescriptions might be improved to
prevent cardiac dysrhythmia and hemodynamic instability.
 During this award period, Dr. Scovner will employ her unsurpassed academic resources and
mentorship at Brigham and Women’s Hospital to acquire the skills and expertise required to attain R01 and/or
R03 funding, allowing her to continue her critically important research and to train future clinical investigators."
10829339,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Tibial shaft fractures are the most common major fracture of the lower leg and are frequently associated with a
break in the skin known as an open fracture. Because the bone is exposed by the open wound, open tibial
fractures are often complicated by infection and failure of bone healing, which can lead to long-lasting disability
and in some cases amputation. Intravenous antibiotics administered early after injury are a well-established
measure to prevent fracture-related infection (FRI), but their effectiveness is limited by poor blood flow at the
fracture site and inability to achieve high local concentrations with systemic administration. Gentamicin applied
locally within the open fracture wound is a promising adjunctive measure to reduce the risk of FRI after these
injuries, but there are no high-quality clinical trials evaluating its use.
The candidate proposes to gain skills in randomized controlled trials, observational research design, and cost-
effectiveness analysis. The primary study is a pilot trial to assess the feasibility of a masked, randomized trial to
compare the effectiveness of locally applied gentamicin to saline placebo to prevent FRI after open tibia fractures
(aim 1). The study will be conducted at the Muhimbili Orthopaedic Institute, a tertiary referral hospital in Tanzania
with a higher rate of open fractures and infection than trauma centers in North America. A secondary analysis
of pooled observational data from the pilot trial and prior studies evaluating open tibial fractures will be used to
assess the impact of FRI on quality-of-life and fracture healing (aim 2). The cost-effectiveness of local gentamicin
will be estimated by gathering cost data alongside the clinical outcomes in the primary study. These data will be
projected beyond the trial endpoint using modelling techniques (aim 3).
This will be the first randomized trial evaluating locally administered gentamicin to reduce infection in a fracture
population. If efficacious, local gentamicin is likely to be a highly cost-effective preventive strategy for FRI and
may ultimately be cost saving. Although these findings will originate from a low-income country, results may be
generalizable to populations in both high and low-income countries and could therefore significantly reduce the
global burden of open fractures. Through the conduct of the proposed studies, the principal investigator will gain
skills in clinical trial design, observational data analysis, and economic analysis from a multidisciplinary team of
experts in these domains. In addition, the candidate will gain the clinical research experience necessary and
generate preliminary data to successfully compete for an R01 award studying interventions that aim to improve
outcomes for orthopedic trauma victims."
10829443,"NAFLD is a major health problem in the developed world that is driven by the epidemic of obesity and metabolic
syndrome. Although the prevalence of early stage NAFLD (fatty liver) is nearly 100% in at-risk individuals, the
more severe form of the disease (NASH>fibrosis>cirrhosis>HCC) is much lower, indicating that other factors
drive interindividual risk for severe NAFLD. We hypothesize that vinyl chloride (VC) is such a factor. We have
shown that VC inhalation at concentrations relevant to human environmental exposure exacerbates experimental
NAFLD in mice by causing oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial quality and abundance,
regulated by autophagy, affect the cell’s bioenergetic capacity and resistance to stress. Mitochondria also
interact with other organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through mitochondrial-associated
membranes (MAMs). These contact sites are sensitive to (patho)physiological conditions and maladaptive
changes to MAM dynamics have been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Importantly, MAMs shelter key
components/functions that control mitochondrial function, ER stress and autophagy. We hypothesize that these
events create a ‘perfect storm,’ which sensitizes the hepatocyte to the biochemical stress of NAFLD exerted by
a ‘Western’-style high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet (WD) and exacerbates injury and that improved understanding
of the biology will yield novel therapies. Aim 1. To study the impact of the interaction of VC and WD on
mitochondria/ER dynamics. Electrophilic VC metabolites cause formation of protein adducts, which can induce
mitochondria and ER stress. This damage can then be amplified through altered mitochondrial-ER crosstalk via
MAMs, impairing the cell’s ability to metabolically recover from injury. We will directly investigate the impact of
VC exposure (±WD) on the damage, function and interaction (via MAMs) of these organelles in vivo and in
complementary in vitro models. Aim 2. Analyze the role of autophagy in VC induced hepatotoxicity. The
autophagic process degrades excess and/or damaged cytosolic components and is also an important
mechanism for mitochondrial quality control through mitophagy. MAMs are also critically involved in autophagic
processes. We recently demonstrated that although VC and WD increase general autophagy, mitophagy was
decreased. We will investigate the role of autophagic regulation and test the hypothesis that reduced mitophagic
flux is a protective feature during the interaction of VC and WD. Changes in mitophagy will be monitored and
quantified. To modulate autophagy in the liver key autophagy regulators will be induced or deleted. Aim 3.
Investigate the impact of protecting against mitochondria/ER/MAM dysfunction in VC-enhanced NAFLD.
Targeting critical components to the ‘perfect storm’ caused by VC exposure, may protect from the biochemical
stress and exacerbated injury during exposure. Therefore, alleviating ER stress with a chemical chaperone, or
by upregulating endogenous chaperones may be therapeutic and will be investigated. Likewise, preventing
mitochondrial depolarization with SS-31, a mitochondria-targeted peptide, will be tested for therapeutic benefit."
10829445,"Abstract
Despite advances in many domains, the field of solid organ transplantation remains limited by
two distinct but connected problems: (1) a critical shortage of donor organs and (2) suboptimal
graft longevity due to chronic alloimmune-mediated injury. For patients with end-stage renal
disease, these limitations are readily apparent, with over 90,000 individuals in the United States
awaiting kidney transplantation. This severe shortfall of donor kidneys is compounded by the
suboptimal longevity of transplanted allografts, with a median kidney graft survival of only 8-12
years despite advances in immunosuppression. These significant limitations indicate a clear
unmet need to develop novel approaches to improve the function of donor kidneys and enhance
graft longevity. The treatment of donor organs with gene therapies has long been recognized as
a promising strategy to enhance graft function and diminish graft immunogenicity, but until
recently there have not been feasible approaches for gene delivery in an organ-specific manner.
Over the last decade, the clinical development of ex vivo organ perfusion systems has created
an ideal platform for selectively delivering gene therapies directly to donor allografts. Advancing
this approach toward clinical use requires testing in a non-human primate transplant model
using clinically relevant immunosuppression regimens. For this proposal, we have assembled a
team of investigators with expertise in ex vivo organ perfusion, the use of adeno-associated viral
(AAV) vectors for gene therapy, immune management, and kidney transplantation. We have 3
specific aims: 1) Optimize ex vivo machine perfusion approaches for delivery of gene therapies
to kidney grafts in an auto-transplant model, 2) Determine the impact of the alloimmune
response on transgene expression in kidney allografts, and 3) Evolve novel AAV vectors with
tropism for human kidney grafts. Successful completion of this project will demonstrate the use
of genetic engineering approaches to achieve durable transgene expression in kidney grafts.
This approach has the potential to establish a new paradigm of genetically augmented solid
organ allografts and transform approaches in solid organ transplantation."

 This is a proposal for a diversity supplement to the MIRA award R35GM122610 to support Ms. Reem
Hussein-Fricke, MSc, to work as a research trainee for two years in the Blackwell lab. Ms. Hussein-Fricke is a
Black woman of Sudanese origin who was previously enrolled in a PhD program at Rutgers University, but
eventually withdrew from graduate school after experiencing a series of challenging personal circumstances.
With time Ms. Hussein-Fricke has decided to follow her passion for research and re-enter PhD training in order
to pursue a career as a research scientist. This award will allow her to train and develop further as a scientist
in critical ways, and to establish herself as a competitive candidate for top graduate programs.
 The Blackwell lab studies mechanisms that maintain metabolic, protein, and lipid homeostasis, primarily
in the powerful model organism C. elegans. The parent MIRA research addresses specific functions of the
SKN-1 transcription factors, which respond to oxidative, xenobiotic, proteasomal, and metabolic stresses, and
investigates how these and other protective mechanisms influence cellular redox regulation and its effects on
the organism. Ms. Hussein-Fricke will investigate an aspect of metabolic regulation that is an exciting new
direction, how specific metabolic cues control feeding behavior and food intake. Our work in this area so far
has shown that specific nutrients and metabolites profoundly influence feeding behavior and food consumption,
and has suggested models for how this occurs. Ms. Hussein-Fricke will work with a postdoctoral fellow in the
lab who pioneered this area. They will investigate neuronal interactions through which signals we have
identified operate to control feeding, and use genetic screening approaches to identify additional metabolic
cues that influence these behaviors. This research has already begun to profoundly alter our understanding of
relationships between diet, hunger, and satiety.
 During the two-year training period Ms. Hussein-Fricke will benefit from research training, mentoring,
and educational opportunities. In the laboratory she will expand her range of research skills, including gaining
experience in neuronal functional analysis, a specific interest of hers. Most importantly, the time spent in the
lab will provide a research opportunity of sufficient depth to allow her to generate publishable work. Ms.
Hussein-Fricke will benefit from mentoring from Dr. Blackwell, lab members, and a mentoring committee, and
will be deeply steeped in a rich and exciting scientific environment. Through this environment and attendance
at scientific meetings, she will learn scientific presentation skills. During this time she will also avail herself of
courses and workshops in the greater Harvard community in order to develop her knowledge and skills in
bioinformatic and data analysis, another key interest of hers. Together, this experience will allow Ms. Hussein-
Fricke to develop rapidly as a scientist, and build a record of current research accomplishments that will put
her in a very strong position for reentry into a graduate program and completion of a PhD."

SUMMARY
The Structural Biology Core will develop and optimize novel structural biology approaches that enable structure
determination of recombinant and reconstituted HIV virus-host complexes important to HARC Center Projects
and overall goals. We will apply state-of-the-art technologies in X-ray crystallography, single particle cryogenic
electron microscopy (cryo-EM), electron cryogenic tomography (cryo-ET), and antibody (Fab) technologies. A
major focus will be the development of novel functionalities for our graphene oxide (GO) based affinity grids

SUMMARY
The overall goal of the Computational Core is to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of multiple data types
across Projects and Cores to characterize the cellular networks, proteins, and protein complexes that influence

develop new methods to facilitate the unification of mechanistic and structural details with network biology, with
a strong emphasis on the analysis and integration of data derived from proteomics, genetics, and structural

PROJECT 3: GENETICS AND EVOLUTION OF HIV RESTRICTION FACTORS
SUMMARY
Host-virus interfaces of well-described effector complexes have been structurally characterized based on lab-
adapted strains of HIV and single host sequences found in cell line models of HIV infection. However, cell lines
do not reflect the functionally distinct molecular biology of HIV infections in primary CD4+ T cells and
macrophages. Moreover, HIV is one of the most diverse human pathogens, yet most of the available structural
data are based on a handful of lab-adapted strains and not primary isolates, and host-pathogen protein interfaces
are known to change in evolutionary history. In Project 3, we will investigate host and virus diversity by using
primary cells isolated from multiple donors and infecting them with diverse HIV strains, and then identifying novel
strain-specific proviral and antiviral host factors from a variety of genome-wide pooled screens. In collaboration
with the Genetics Core, we will apply a suite of innovative technologies in gene editing of human primary cells,
to investigate restriction factors that are under positive selection and identify interactions important for HIV
restriction.
Our project will identify the universe of functionally relevant HIV effectors using genome-wide, pooled CRISPRko,
CRISPRi and CRISPRa screening in primary CD4+T cells. These results will be integrated with previous datasets
to define functional HIV-host networks (with the Computational Core). Novel host factor candidates will be
validated by multiplexed, arrayed editing in primary activated CD4+T cells, generating high-confidence
interactors that will be further investigated by arrayed editing in resting CD4+ T cells to examine their role in HIV
latency. To define the function and structure of host complexes required in primary CD4+ T cells and
macrophages, we will perform high-throughput arrayed CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing of functionally validated
factors and infect both cell types with different viral strains and mutants. Protein interaction networks of specific
effector proteins will be further analyzed through the HARC endogenous protein structure (HEPS) platform (in
collaboration with the Proteomics and Structural Biology Cores). Furthermore, we will map evolutionary and
structural constraints by mutational scanning of host-pathogen protein interfaces known to be changing over
time. Residues under positive selection will be assessed for position on protein surfaces and known complex
interfaces and subjected to mutational scanning in primary T cells by knock-in of polyclonal repair libraries
(Genetics Core). The impact of each repair outcome on viral replication will be used to genetically define the
flexibility of the interaction, and to inform the evolutionary trajectory of host-pathogen interfaces. In summary,
Project 3 will identify novel HIV-host factor complexes for structural interrogation that can be therapeutically
targeted and reveal new insights in viral evolution, transmission, and pathogenesis."
10829908,"Abstract
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains a major public health problem causing severe morbidity
and mortality in affected patients. The majority of CKD patients are treated with inhibitors of the
renin-angiotensin system (RAS) or sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) but the protection
afforded by these agents is incomplete. Novel treatments are needed to advance substantially
the care of CKD patients. In this regard, it is known that renal nerve activity is increased in CKD
and can lead to downstream effects including hypertension, reduced function, proteinuria, and
kidney disease progression. Renal denervation has been shown to protect against these effects
but most clinical trials only include hypertensive-CKD patients or exclude advanced CKD
patients entirely. Therefore, it is not known exactly which types of CKD can be effectively
treated with renal denervation. Furthermore, the relative contributions of renal sensory afferent
and sympathetic efferent nerves are not known. We hypothesize that CKD-related increases
in renal inflammation activates renal sensory nerves, leading in turn to increased efferent
nerve activity to worsen renal function, CKD progression and hypertension. Our proposal
will analyze the activity of renal nerves during various forms of CKD in mice and whether
denervation impacts disease progression. We will also search for the mediators of renal nerve
activation during CKD. These novel insights would provide the rationale to broaden denervation
studies to CKD patients and to understand more fully the role of renal nerves in the
pathogenesis of CKD."

dental, oral, and craniofacial (DOC) tissue and organ regeneration to human clinical trials. Our overall vision for
C-DOCTOR is to be a comprehensive national resource center for the clinical translation of innovative
regenerative technologies to replace DOC tissues or organs lost to congenital disorders, traumatic injuries,
diseases, and medical procedures. We have recruited interdisciplinary teams with promising DOC regeneration
therapies and developed the comprehensive, customized infrastructure through which we provide these teams
the necessary clinical, scientific, technical, regulatory, financial, business-oriented, and managerial resources
to facilitate their IND/IDE-enabling activities. We now propose to direct the Center's considerable resources to
advance only those technologies that optimally align with unmet clinical needs, market potential, anticipated
patient value, and high probability of clinical adoption. We will continue to provide ITP teams with fully
customized support from expert scientists, clinicians, commercialization strategists and regulatory advisors as
the teams refine their products, complete their IND/IDE-enabling preclinical studies, transition to current good
laboratory/manufacturing practices for scale-up, develop clinical study protocols, form strategic partnerships,
and interact with the FDA ahead of Phase I clinical trials. As such, C-DOCTOR will create positive outcomes
for ITP teams that may not otherwise have access to the requisite knowledgebase and resources necessary to
be successful. To achieve this vision, we propose the following four Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1: To coordinate and integrate C-DOCTOR infrastructure and strategic partnerships to
support ITPs and overall DOCTRC programmatic function
Specific Aim 2: To assemble a balanced ITP portfolio and provide comprehensive support to ITPs for
pre-clinical scientific studies, protocol/technical methodology development, commercialization strategy,
and regulatory interactions supporting IDE/IND submission and associated clinical study protocols
Specific Aim 3: To validate key ITP results and perform preclinical testing, developing a shared
knowledge base of standard operating procedures, protocols, best practices, and educational
resources to ensure rigor and reproducibility of ITP research and serve as a knowledge hub for the
scientific community
Specific Aim 4: To build a strong and sustainable collaboration between C-DOCTOR and MPWRM to
support the development and commercialization of ITPs
Achieving these aims will make C-DOCTOR a comprehensive resource network to support DOC TE/RM that
will be sustainable and have a long-lasting impact on our efforts to improve human health."

The biological functions of microbiomes are critical to human health. Perturbations of these
microbiomes can lead to damaging consequences including improper host development and
increased susceptibility to infectious disease. Competitive interactions among microbial
populations are predicted to influence the structure and function of microbiomes, yet the
molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions remain unclear. Understanding
microbiome dynamics is therefore critical to predicting and mitigating dysbiosis and disease risk
in humans. Type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) are a conserved protein export mechanism
found in both pathogenic and beneficial human-associated bacteria. T6SSs act as molecular
syringes to translocate toxic effector proteins directly into competitor cells, resulting in inhibition
or death. Given their role in interbacterial competition, T6SSs are capable of structuring
microbiome communities within a host-associated niche. The goal of this proposal is to
understand how T6SS-mediated interactions shape host-associated microbiomes. The results
of this work will facilitate the development of strategies to improve host health. Recent findings
using the squid light organ as a model system indicate that bacteria can use their T6SS to
compete for a limited number of colonization sites in the host. The proposed work will determine
the molecular mechanisms underlying T6SS-mediated killing among co-colonizing bacteria, and
determine the spatial and temporal dynamics of these competitive interactions in the host, and
its effect on structuring the resulting microbiome."
10834282,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically changed the landscape of chronic HIV infection and massively
reduced mortality in persons living with HIV (PWH). Yet, many PWH present with intestinal dysfunction, residual
immune activation and inflammation, incomplete immune restoration and a hypercoagulable state, all of which
drive a poor prognosis and development of non-AIDS comorbidities, such as the cardiovascular disease (CVD).
The pathways involved in the development of CVD in PWH and SIV-infected macaques are not completely
elucidated. We recently reported that neutrophil dysfunction may be a key driver of this process, through
overwhelming activation and excessive production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). By studying the
dynamics and functions of NETs in SIV infection, we showed that they may contribute to disease progression
and comorbidities: (a) proinflammatory NETosis increases throughout untreated SIV infection, and is only
partially reduced by ART, (b) NETs may be a determinant of the indiscriminate depletion of immune cells that
are not virus targets, and of the incomplete CD4+ T cell restoration observed in PWH on ART, and (c) NETosis
may promote thrombosis in the thrombocytopenic environment of HIV/SIV infections by capturing platelets and
expressing tissue factor. We thus propose a project to assess the role of NETosis in HIV disease progression
and response to ART through a direct intervention in vivo. We will use an SIVsab/PTM model developed in our
laboratory that faithfully reproduce both key aspects of SIV pathogenesis on ART and the CV disease. We will
also use a NET inhibitor that has been validated in vivo by numerous studies in murine animal models. In
preliminary studies, we demonstrated that this drug has the ability to inhibit ex vivo production of NETs by
neutrophils isolated from our SIV-infected PTMs. We will first test the hypothesis that NETosis is involved in
driving SIV pathogenesis and disease progression. To this goal, we will administer the NET inhibitor during
chronic infection to untreated SIV-infected PTMs and assess its impact on the natural history of SIV infection,
including CV comorbidities. These experiments are designed to model those PWH who either do not receive
ART or do not achieve complete virus suppression on ART. Second, we will test the hypothesis that NETosis
is involved in driving the response to ART and development of CV comorbidities. To this goal, we will
administer a NET inhibitor to ART-treated SIV-infected PTMs and assess the consequences of this intervention
on the CD4+ T cell restoration, inflammation, coagulation and CV disease development. These experiments are
designed to model PWH, who receive ART. This highly innovative project will improve our understanding of HIV
pathogenesis and mechanisms of HIV-related comorbidities, particularly the CVD, a major cause of death in
PWH, and thus may have a critical impact on the clinical management and survival of the PWH."
10834284,"The ability to adapt to environmental challenges is critical for cellular and organismal function. A frequent
challenge is dehydration which increases osmotic pressure on the cells causing water loss and cell shrinkage.
Cells respond by accumulating organic osmolytes to accommodate decreases in cell volume and ionic strength
in a process called osmoadaptation. This cellular stress response is critical for survival of all organisms and
tissues. Defects in osmoadaptation induce a pro-inflammatory program that decreases cell survival and has
implications for multiple pathologies, including inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, cancer and dry eye
syndrome. Diabetes associated hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) is life threatening. It is therefore
important to understand the molecular mechanisms of osmoadaptation. Our application focuses on the
regulation of protein synthesis during osmoadaptation, a critical process that is poorly understood. The overall
goal of this proposal is to develop a mechanistic, transcriptome-wide understanding of translation regulation
during osmoadaptation that will lead to development of therapeutics of diseases that cause decreased tissue
osmotolerance. We will examine the function of key regulators, including the amino transporter SNAT2 for
establishing osmoadaptive mRNA translation programs using Human Corneal Epithelial Cells (HCEs). Corneal
Epithelial cells are the cells in the eye that develop the pathology of dry eye syndrome in diabetes. To develop
a mechanistic, transcriptome-wide understanding of translation regulation during osmoadaptation we
characterize the translation landscape during osmoadaptation and define the regulatory RNA features that
control the changes in mRNA translation (Aim 1). We then focus on the interplay between translation
regulation, amino acid homeostasis and liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of RNA binding proteins (RBPs)
during osmoadaptation and delineate how mTOR and SNAT2 activities affect the translation landscape in
response to hyperosmotic stress (Aim 2). Finally, we examine the function of RBPs that link LLPS and
translation regulation, by determining RNA binding patterns and LLPS for specific RBPs during
osmoadaptation (Aim 3)."

macromolecular complexes that are intrinsically flexible and often challenging to purify for structure determination
by single particle cryo-EM. Moreover, in situ cryo-ET can inform on structures of complexes within their native

structural information on assembly and maturation intermediates as well as capsid-host interactions during
nuclear import and integration. Furthermore, the Core will offer new capabilities of cryo-EM and cryo-ET imaging
of infectious samples in a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) environment and develop new technologies and workflows
for single-molecule correlation between cryo-ET and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. These

10878909,"Project Summary
Understanding a single disease or condition requires large-scale mining of genetic, epigenetic,
environmental, and clinical observations from large amounts of human data. Widespread and
easy access to such data is imperative to decipher the vast trove of data that has been collected
at the individual and population level. However, there is a direct conflict between protecting the
privacy of patients and research participants and sharing genetic, epigenetic, and clinical data for
biomedical advances. This conflict is partly due to a disconnect between the fields that generate
and analyze personal biological data and the fields that establish theories and implementations
for data privacy and security. The goal of this project is two-fold: 1) to quantify private information
leakages from various types of human-derived biological data in a systematic manner to inform
data-sharing efforts and 2) to develop privacy-enhancing analysis software for data at various
molecular levels (genomics, transcriptomics, phenotype data) at scale. We will create an evolving
and modular tool suite to both quantify and preserve privacy; this suite will have the ability to be
adopted to new data modalities and analysis needs as they arise. The proposed tools will help
prevent future catastrophic privacy leaks, which may result in a loss of access to all medically
actionable data; democratize data access for all researchers; and create trust between patients
and researchers, thus increasing participation in studies."
10878912,"The use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as a therapeutic intervention is FDA-cleared for treating
depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and migraine, and shows promise for a host of other brain disorders.
The appeal of TMS is its safety, non-invasiveness, and well-established capacity for modulating the activity of
brain regions. In human subjects, that modulation is assessed only at the gross scale of behavioral, cognitive,
or aggregate physiological effects (e.g. EMG, EEG, fMRI). The fine-scale responses and mechanisms of TMS,
at the level of biophysical and biological effects on neurons and circuits, remain poorly understood. This
knowledge gap hinders rational design of TMS protocols and leaves researchers and clinicians dependent on
trial-and-error approaches and inferences from macroscopic data to improve the methodology. The lack of
reductionistic insight is particularly detrimental when targeting non-motor areas such as prefrontal cortex where
a readout of the immediate neural response is unavailable, for example due to the stimulus artifact in EEG. Our
overall goal is to fill in this knowledge gap by studying the neural circuit mechanisms of TMS in the non-human
primate brain. The approach integrates neurophysiological experiments featuring direct single-unit and local field
potential recordings and multiscale computational simulations of neural circuits in both primary motor cortex and
prefrontal cortex. Aim 1 is to establish the circuit mechanisms of acute responses to single and paired TMS
pulses. Determining the pulse response of single neural elements and recurrent cortical circuits permits a
detailed examination of the biophysics and biology of neural recruitment at a short time scale. A main goal of
TMS therapy is to achieve controlled, lasting neuromodulation, however, so in Aim 2 we will extend the same
neurophysiological and modeling approaches to the study of responses to repetitive TMS (rTMS). Here the goal
of the neurophysiology will be to quantify the effects of rTMS pulse trains on long-lasting changes in neural
activity and, accordingly, the neural simulations will incorporate synaptic plasticity. Critically, in both Aims we will
conduct the experiments and modeling both in primary motor cortex, where spinal potential recordings and
electromyography can supplement direct readout of neural effects in cortex, and prefrontal cortex, where only
cortical-level recordings are suited to characterize neuromodulatory effects. The overall product will be an
experiment- and model-driven mechanistic understanding of the effect of TMS on cortical circuits, enabling a
transformational advance in the interpretation of the effects of TMS. Taken together, the results will promote a
more biologically-grounded, rational approach to designing TMS protocols for neuromodulation."
10879026,"For dentin repair or regeneration, it is important to have the timely appearance of blood vessels.
Therefore, tissue-engineering strategies to regenerate the dentin-pulp complex require
establishment of vasculature to deliver oxygen, nutrients, hormones, immune cells, minerals
and also help in clearing cellular debris and metabolic waste products during the inflammatory
and regenerative phases of healing. DMP1 (dentin matrix protein1) is a key regulatory protein in
bone and dentin mineralization. We first demonstrated that it has a regulatory role in the
regulation of hydroxyapatite nucleation and growth in the extracellular matrices of bone and
dentin. Subsequently, we demonstrated that DMP1 was localized in the nucleus of
preosteoblasts and preodontoblasts and thus served as a signaling molecule and promoted the
differentiation of these precursor cells. Recently we discovered that DMP1 can stimulate the
release of intracellular calcium in preosteoblasts and preodontoblasts. Depletion of intracellular
calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum leads to ER stress. Cells cope with ER stress by
activating the “Unfolded protein response” (UPR). One of our recent observations is that DMP1
stimulation can promote the secretion of VEGF and other pro-angiogenic factors. Therefore, we
hypothesize that ER stress activated by DMP1 functions to promote the transformation of adult
stem cells such as dental pulp stem cells to endothelial cells and thereby promote
vasculogenesis. In order to determine the mechanism by which DMP1 promotes
vasculogenesis, we will examine the UPR signaling pathway. The UPR is initiated by three ER
transmembrane proteins, of which our preliminary data show that DMP1 stimulation activated
the ATF6 (Activating Transcription Factor 6) arm of the UPR. Accordingly, here we propose to
study the mechanism by which ATF6 mediate transcriptional regulation of VEGF under ER
stress. During dentin repair and regeneration, a major challenge is the maintenance of cell
viability which depends on the availability of a functional vascular system. Accordingly, we will
test the in-vivo vasculogenic competence and therapeutic potential of DMP1 in an in vivo pulp
regeneration model.
Understanding the complex functions of DMP1 could be valuable to develop therapies for
fracture repair in bone or in the tooth to restore lost, damaged or diseased dentin-pulp
complex."

Individuals with chronic rheumatic diseases including arthritis comprise approximately 25% of the U.S.
population. Racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in adverse, often avoidable outcomes occur in nearly
all rheumatic diseases particularly among Black and lower socioeconomic status individuals. Despite the
importance of vaccinations in patients with rheumatic diseases, and the high rates of serious infections,
vaccine uptake is consistently poor. In the U.S., COVID-19 vaccine uptake is lower and vaccine hesitancy
higher among Black patients compared with White patients, and this holds true in rheumatic diseases. With the
profound disparities uncovered by the COVID-19 pandemic aggravated by proven disparities in rheumatic
disease outcomes, and heightened vulnerability to infections, there is an urgent need to address low vaccine
uptake and hesitancy among Black individuals with these conditions. In addition, it is critical to also increase
vaccine uptake among the social networks of individuals with rheumatic diseases who are immunosuppressed
and may have less robust vaccination responses. Our team has forged longstanding community-academic
partnerships in the Boston and Chicago areas to understand the needs of Black individuals with lupus, a
systemic rheumatic disease, and the role racism plays in health and healthcare access. Framed by the Public
Health Critical Race Praxis that recognizes the pervasiveness of racism in our society, we will leverage our
community-academic partnerships to implement the CDC's Popular Opinion Leader (POL) model whereby
trusted community leaders are trained to disseminate information regarding COVID-19 vaccination through
their social networks in predominately Black communities to increase vaccine uptake and reduce hesitancy. In
response to the NOSI NOT-MD-21-008: Research to Address Vaccine Hesitancy, Uptake and Implementation
among Populations that Experience Disparities, we propose the following aims: Aim 1. To leverage community-
academic partnerships across two U.S. cities to develop training and evaluation materials for POLs. Aim 2a. To
establish the efficacy of a community-based intervention with and without a racial justice framework to increase
COVID-19 vaccine uptake and reduce hesitancy among social networks of Black individuals with rheumatic
conditions. We will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial to test whether POLs trained with racial justice
framing embedded in information on vaccine safety and efficacy will result in greater COVID-19 vaccine uptake
among their social network members compared to safety and efficacy training alone. Aim 2b. To determine the
structure and composition of the outreach social networks of POLs. We will enhance the existing POL model
by adding a validated mixed methods approach to compare the social networks reached by POLs in each arm.
We hypothesize that incorporating a racial justice lens will empower POLs to disseminate information more
broadly and more persuasively and increase vaccine uptake by reducing fear and mistrust."

 The rise of drug resistant bacteria is a rapidly evolving threat to human health. Pathogenic bacteria have
developed several mechanisms to battle the threat posed by antimicrobial compounds and survive in niche
environments within the human body. The overarching goal in our laboratory is to understand at a molecular
level how pathogenic bacteria utilize specific membrane protein complexes to meet these specialized needs. We
place a particular emphasis on understanding the structure and function of membrane transporters that move
molecules and signals across bacterial membranes, and protein complexes that allow bacteria to sense and
respond to environmental stimuli. In order to achieve these goals, we routinely combine high-resolution cryo-
electron microscopy with biochemical and computational methods to gain insight into the structure,
conformational dynamics, and overall function of membrane transporters and signaling complexes.
 Our primary focus during the award period will be to understand how Gram-positive species use
dedicated membrane protein machinery to sense and evade attack by antimicrobial peptides. Antimicrobial
peptides such as vancomycin are some of the most powerful antibiotics currently in clinical use and are
considered a treatment option of last resort. However, infection with Gram-positive organisms such as
vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus or Staphylococcus continue to threaten healthcare settings, and leave
infected patients with limited treatment options. Many Gram-positive species express membrane protein
complexes known as “Bce modules” (BCEMs) that contain an ABC transporter and a two-component system
that work in tandem to sense and respond to attack by antimicrobial peptides. Our primary goals are to obtain a
complete understanding of how the ABC transporter component of BCEMs recognizes and provides resistance
to antimicrobial peptides, and how conformational cycling of the ABC transporter initiates signaling through the
two-component system via a flux-sensing mechanism. A comprehensive study of the structure, conformational
dynamics, kinetic mechanisms, and in vivo activity of BCEMs will be performed in order to understand how the
constituents of these modules work in synergy to sense and respond to antimicrobial peptides.
 At the culmination of our studies we will have established a structure-driven understanding of the
membrane protein complexes that allow Gram-positive pathogens to sense and respond to different antimicrobial
peptides. Our long-term vision is to build a comprehensive model of the different protein machineries used by
microbial pathogens to circumvent our most powerful antibiotics. Detailed structural and functional analysis of
these protein complexes will set the stage for development of new and improved antimicrobial compounds and
targeted therapies for drug resistant microbial infections."

Corneal scarring is a public health problem and a very common indication for corneal transplantation.
Disorganized deposition of extracellular matrix or scarring occurs after different pathological processes
including corneal infections, congenital diseases and trauma. The long term goal of this proposal is to address
the innovative concept that reestablishment of a unique environment or stromal niche with its unique
mechanical and chemical cues is critical after injury to ameliorate scarring. Understanding the mechanisms
that direct reestablishment of stromal function after injury is a potential target for therapuetic interventions. Our
preliminary results support these concepts. The specific aims are to: (1) elucidate the regulation of collagen V
reexpression in the reestablishment of corneal stroma function; (2) determine the role of this unique
microenvironment in regulating keratocyte-fibroblast- myofibroblast differentiation; and (3) determine the roles
of collagens V, in regulating latent TGF-β activation and therefore modulating matrix deposition and scarring.
This work will provide critical information for the development of future medical or surgical therapies for
patients with corneal scarring and will open the door for therapeutic manipulation of the corneal stroma."
10840638,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The overarching goal in my lab is to identify mechanisms that promote maintenance, reinforcement, and
remodeling of cell-cell adhesion and barrier function in response to cell-scale and tissue-scale forces. Epithelial
cell-cell junctions including adherens junctions, tight junctions, and tricellular junctions adhere epithelial cells to
one another, transmit forces between cells, and generate barrier function that selectively regulates what can
pass in the paracellular space between cells. Each of these cell-cell junctions is connected to a contractile apical
actomyosin array, and the connections between junctional proteins and the cytoskeleton are highly dynamic.
Cells sense their mechanical environment as mechanical forces challenge cell-cell junctions – from cell-scale
forces like a dividing cell pulling on its neighbors, to tissue-scale forces like morphogenesis sculpting the
organism. Epithelial cells modulate their cell-cell junctions and connections to the actin cytoskeleton to ensure a
stable yet adaptable architecture. My group seeks to understand how signaling proteins like Rho GTPases,
RhoGEFs & RhoGAPs, scaffolding proteins, mechanosensitive proteins, calcium, and the cytoskeleton work
together to create a strong but flexible epithelial barrier. We use developing Xenopus laevis embryos as a model
for the vertebrate epithelium, an array of innovative molecular tools for live microscopy of key molecular players,
a live imaging barrier assay developed in our lab, and several approaches to mechanically challenge the
epithelium either globally or locally. The major research themes of this R35 MIRA are: 1) “Rho flare-mediated
tight junction remodeling” where we will address the question: What are the signaling pathways that promote
tight junction repair when tight junctions are damaged as cells change shape? 2) “Mechanics of epithelial
cytokinesis” where we will address the question: How do cells neighboring the dividing cell contribute to
maintenance of adhesion and barrier function during epithelial cytokinesis? 3) “Tension transmission & signaling
at tricellular junctions” where we will address the question: How are tricellular junctions reinforced and remodeled
when mechanically challenged? By pursuing these research goals over the next five years, my group will
discover novel mechanisms that promote maintenance, reinforcement, and remodeling of cell-cell junctions and
their cytoskeletal connections in response to physiological mechanical forces."

 The research goals of my laboratory are focused on advancing our understanding of physiologic processes
that provide the necessary flexibility to the metabolic network of prokaryotic cells. Such flexibility is needed for
cells to survive challenges encountered under the diverse conditions they find themselves in, be it free-living, in
association with a host as a commensal, or during the process of infection. We are particularly interested in the
molecular basis of metabolism and on the physiological consequences brought about by genetic and epigenetic
events that change the function of proteins either permanently or temporarily. Here we propose to define the
function of two enzymes that chemically modify other proteins altering their activities. The first protein-modifying
enzyme appears to target a global regulatory protein, whilst the second one appears to target an enzyme whose
activity can balance the biosynthesis of building blocks with energy generation via oxidative phosphorylation.
 We are also continuing our work on the biosynthesis of coenzyme B12, the largest coenzyme known that is not
a polymer. Specifically, we are interested in the late steps of the pathway, which occur as a multi-enzyme
complex anchored in the cell membrane. Our work has advanced to the point that allows us to assemble the
complex using liposome methodologies, and in so doing we can now investigate the molecular details of the
assembly process. Ultimately, we will engage a microscopy expert to help us visualize what is likely to be a
magnificent molecular structure.
 Finally, we will continue to work on a recently discovered transcription factor that we have shown modulates
the expression of a large set of genes involved in iron metabolism during a Salmonella infection. We will engage
a colleague working on Salmonella pathogenesis to provide insights into how genes affected by the function of
this regulator impact the ability of Salmonella to establish and maintain an infection.
 To perform the proposed we will use innovative combinations of genetic, molecular biology, biochemical,
bioinformatics and global approaches and will complement those through collaborations with spectroscopists,
crystallographers, molecular biophysicists, and membrane biologists to provide comprehensive, rigorous testing
of hypotheses and working models. We seek answers to questions in metabolism of microbes relevant to human
health, and in so doing contribute to the mission of the NIH."

We wish to continue our study of a new paradigm for the selective functionalization of complex molecules. Our
approach is predicated on the development of fundamental reactions of functional groups that are ubiquitous in
bioactive agents. Enantio- and site-selectivity will be pursued in an integrated fashion. Importantly, bioactive
analog generation by this approach spans multiple therapeutic areas, and categorizes these chemical studies
as a quintessential “General Medical Science.” The main approach under study is the development of easy-to-
make catalyst libraries that target a broad set of reaction types. These will include site-selective reactions of
hydroxyl groups, alkenes, amines, C-H bonds and carbonyl groups. In addition, we now target a host of redox-
based processes, and some of these include photochemical and electrochemical possibilities. Overwhelmingly,
these processes have been developed in our laboratory, with our initial studies often focused on enantioselective
catalysis – a field of high significance, with relevance to the synthesis of drugs and drug candidates. Yet, our
focus is increasingly moving to the study of high-complexity molecular scaffolds, wherein enantioselectivity
serves as a prelude to exploration of substrates for which stereoselectivity represents just a subset of the issues
that need to be addressed. We have many preliminary results in a number of complex molecular frameworks,
including those provided by some venerable natural products, such as erythromycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin
geldanamycin, and thiostrepton. We wish not only to continue these studies, but also to expand them to analog
generation in contexts presented by additional complex frameworks represented by emerging drug-like scaffolds.
All of these objectives will require the development of new catalysts and new reactions. Foci will include high
value catalytic, site-selective deoxygenation chemistry, glycosylations, amine and heteroarene functionalizations,
site-selective C-H bond functionalization, various redox reactions, as well as unusual catalyst-controlled
macrocyclizations – all in complex molecular scaffolds. An important parallel effort in our group includes the
development of catalysts for selective control over unusual stereochemical issues, such as atropisomerism and
other types of dynamic stereochemistry, which is an area of growing concern in medicinal chemistry. The
significance of our overall goals may reside most in new catalysis principles, and in their application to the site-
selective modification of complex, bioactive natural products. These investigations thus extend fundamental
studies of enantioselectivity to the less well-studied arena of site-, regio- and chemoselectivity. Thus, we wish
to expand greatly our studies of the selective derivatization of fascinating biologically active agents, with site-
selective catalysts as the principal device. In all cases, we will continue to study reaction mechanisms, and
assess new analogs for their biological properties, hoping to advance the field of medicinally relevant chemistry."

This interdisciplinary proposal brings together three highly successful but independent technologies to create
an effective and broadly neutralizing universal influenza vaccine. Our approach combines breath of immunity,
by using a consensus HA strategy, production speed and capacity by working with Kentucky BioProcessing
(KBP), who can express HA protein in plants, and vastly improved subunit vaccine potency using a TMV-HA
conjugation approach to create a candidate universal influenza virus vaccine. Based on our preclinical data on
three influenza A strains, we expect our approach will drive long term immunity that is balanced between
antibody and cellular immunity, providing potential for overlapping mechanisms of immune protection. We
bring together a strong team of different disciplines with a combined goal to quickly show proof of concept with
H1, H3, H5, and M2e antigens. Our Specific Aims are as follows: 1) Production of TMV-HA conjugates of
centralized H1, H3, H5 genes and M2e peptide, 2) Immune response analysis, murine challenge studies and
3) Translational and ferret studies of TMV-HAc and TMV-M2e vaccines. Dr. Weaver has developed a
computational method to express an ancestral sequence of HA, representing a consensus of sequences within
an Influenza subtype. These vaccines protect against drifted seasonal influenza variants better than a
traditional trivalent inactivated virus vaccine. In partnership with KBP, we will use established plant expression
methods to produce centralized HA proteins, with the capacity to produce protein for the planned studies and
for future clinical trial development. HA consensus protein will be fused to the surface of Tobacco Mosaic virus
(TMV) by chemical conjugation, a method developed by Dr. McCormick to improve HA subunit vaccine
potency. TMV-HA vaccines will also be combined with a highly conserved M2e peptide vaccine, to broaden
protection and reduce vaccine dose. Immunological analysis will be used to confirm vaccine potency, in order
to optimize dose, schedule and route of administration. Vaccine efficacy and broadly protective immunity will
be confirmed by lethal influenza challenge using 9 divergent virus types in a murine model of disease. Finally,
vaccine formulations will be re-tested in ferrets, a models of influenza infection which more closely mimics the
progress of disease in humans. Our vaccine is designed to drive local and systemic immunity after either
intranasal or intramuscular routes of administration, and we will use immunogenicity and pathogen challenge
data to define an optimized single dose vaccine formulation. Our goal is to generate an effective universal
vaccine against influenza that can be manufactured at scale, with significant potential for translation into a
universal vaccine product that is ready for clinical testing."
10843259,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a global epidemic affecting a high proportion of child-bearing women. The drastic
4-fold increase in OUD among pregnant women from 1999-2014 has promoted opioid maintenance therapies
(OMT) such as buprenorphine (BUP) to mitigate effects associated with opioid abuse. BUP is a mixed (partial
mu-receptor agonist/kappa-receptor antagonist) semi-synthetic OMT that produces better infant outcomes after
gestational treatment as compared to other OMTs (i.e. methadone). However, effects of BUP on pregnant
women transitioning to motherhood is not well understood. Endogenous opioids play a significant role in
orchestrating neuronal adaptations within the maternal brain network (MBN) for the successful ‘switch’ from a
nulliparous brain to a maternal brain to incentivize nurturing maternal behaviors from the dam. It is well known
that exogenous opioid exposure to morphine (full mu-agonist) during gestation can alter the endogenous opioid
system and disrupt maternal care. However, there is a knowledge gap about the effects of BUP on the
endogenous opioid system during the transition to motherhood and thus on maternal care behavior in the context
of OUD during pregnancy. The proposed studies aim to address this knowledge gap by implementing a
translational rodent model to evaluate the effects of BUP compared to morphine on the maternal brain, behavior
and the microbiome well as on the long-term outcome of the offspring. Female rats will be exposed to BUP
and/or morphine in clinically relevant paradigms starting before conception and continued throughout early
postpartum. Effects of gestational BUP and morphine exposure on neurochemical and activation pattern
changes in the maternal brain will be evaluated using state of the art imaging techniques. We will also evaluate
the effectiveness of oxytocin as a potential intervention to increase maternal-offspring interaction in opioid-
exposed dams and investigate the role of the microbiome in the long-term health outcome of exposed offspring.
Our proposal will be able to add to the preliminary human findings on altered functional connectivity in
buprenorphine-exposed mothers by using ‘whole (half) brain activity mapping’ which will allow us to
simultaneously illuminate activity at cellular resolution in several brain areas of the MBN and compare patterns
between opioid-exposed and control dams and investigate associations with changes in maternal behaviors. We
expect that perinatal exposure to BUP inhibits the neuronal ‘switch’ from aversive to rewarding perception of
pups that is necessary to initiate appropriate maternal behavior thus subsequently influencing offspring survival.
The scale of the opioid epidemic requires an urgent response in order to promote treatment of OUD in pregnancy
within an already marginalized population. We hope to advance science on the consequences of opioid drug
use/therapy during gestation and to apply these outcomes toward clinical knowledge to improve public health
via effective translation, implementation, and dissemination of our scientific research findings."

Spine fusion surgery is one of the most common, and complex, orthopedic procedures. Complications occur in
over 30% of cases, highlighting the need to identify modifiable factors associated with these negative sequelae.
Bone quality is a critical determinant of post-operative outcomes, as stability of hardware in bone and de novo
bone formation are required for successful fusion. Despite the importance of bone quality to post-operative
outcomes, there are limited tools for pre-operative detection of abnormal bone in candidates for fusion. The most
common clinical tool for skeletal assessment, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), is subject to artifact from
spinal abnormalities and infrequently performed for pre-operative evaluation. High resolution peripheral QCT
(HRpQCT) can detect pre-operative skeletal abnormalities and predict complications after fusion but is a
research tool not available in clinical practice. In contrast, MRI is routinely performed prior to fusion, for diagnosis
of spinal disease and surgical planning, making an MRI-based technique ideal to screen for pre-operative
skeletal deficits. Our group has recently developed a novel method to evaluate bone quality using standard,
clinically acquired MRIs which analyzes the irregularity, or heterogeneity, of trabecular bone texture. In prior
work, we found that postmenopausal women with fractures had greater heterogeneity of bone texture than age-
matched controls. The proposed study will assess MRI trabecular bone texture as a new technique to detect
poor bone quality, predict complications, and track post-operative skeletal changes in patients undergoing spinal
fusion. We hypothesize that pre-operative MRI bone texture will relate to volumetric BMD (vBMD) and
microarchitecture by HRpQCT and will predict skeletal complications after surgery. Post-operative changes in
MRI bone texture will relate to baseline patient characteristics and clinical post-operative treatment regimen,
including use of anabolic agents. We will prospectively enroll 100 patients having lumbar spine fusion and follow
them for one year. Baseline DXA, HRpQCT, and our MRI-based method will be performed. MRIs will be repeated
at 6 months post-operatively to determine whether early changes in MRI bone texture relate to patient
characteristics, medication use, and predict complications. CT scans will be performed at one year to assess
skeletal complications and completeness of fusion. This proposal aims to: 1) Investigate the relationship between
pre-operative MRI bone texture and HRpQCT measurements of vBMD and microarchitecture; 2) Investigate
whether MRI bone texture predicts skeletal complications after fusion; 3) Assess longitudinal changes in bone
texture and the clinical factors that influence these changes in patients after spine fusion. The long-term goals
of our research are to improve identification of patients at high risk for post-operative complications and provide
knowledge that will advance future interventional trials. In subsequent work, we plan to extend this technique to
other orthopedic populations. Ultimately, we hope to improve the outcomes of patients undergoing fusion and
other high-risk orthopedic surgeries by facilitating the creation of new peri-operative treatment paradigms."

attributable to cardiovascular disease (CVD), driven by elevated rates of CVD risks (unhealthy diet, physical
inactivity, tobacco smoking, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia) influenced by interconnected
biologic, health behavior, and contextual (e.g., system, policy) factors. Despite the existence of tailored,
effective interventions to decrease CVD risk in people with SMI, adoption of these interventions remains

Mental Illness, our goal is to continue to build on this foundational work and amplify the Center’s impact
through an enhanced focus on health equity, partnership engagement, methods innovations, and building
capacity amongst mental health researchers and community partners to improve physical health for persons
with SMI. Our uniquely qualified and diverse team will conduct a signature R01 and three R34s to rigorously
plan, test, and model implementation strategies addressing all CVD risks in persons with SMI in community
settings. We propose: 1) conducting an implementation trial of a behavioral weight loss intervention in two
states; 2) piloting a system-level strategy for a CVD risk factor care evidence bundle tailored to people with
SMI in primary care; 3) developing and piloting strategies to scale a healthy weight intervention in youth; and
4) systems modeling to inform scaling of evidence-based tobacco cessation treatment in community mental
health settings. The Methods Core will grow its transdisciplinary approach incorporating clinical and behavioral
intervention research, implementation science, biostatistics, systems science, and health services and policy
research to support Center work, and advance methods in: 1) developing a policy implementation
measurement framework; 2) identifying implementation strategies’ core components; 3) improving the
precision and robustness of implementation trials; and 4) building “hybrid” systems models in implementation
science. The Administrative Core will engage partners, building on its well-established Community Advisory
Board, lead Center-wide health equity efforts, and bring together all Center activities. The grave disparities in
life expectancy and CVD risk burden in persons with SMI call for continued, concentrated, transdisciplinary
approaches to solutions. Our Center provides a nexus of innovation and momentum around T3 translation, and
the proposed work will make important, needed contributions to advance health equity for persons with SMI."

Despite tremendous advances in diabetes, Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a leading cause of preventable death and
disability in the U.S., and more than 1.5 million more Americans develop T2D every year. More than half of
those new cases could be prevented or delayed if high risk adults were offered resource-intensive lifestyle
intervention programs while they have prediabetes – a readily identifiable stage of abnormal glucose
metabolism that precedes the development of type 2 diabetes. Currently, 88 million Americans have
prediabetes, but about 5 in 6 of them is unaware, and fewer than 1% have participated in an intensive lifestyle
intervention.
CDC created the National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP) to address the increasing burden of type 2
diabetes in the United States. The NDPP lifestyle change program is offered through CDC recognized
organizations, including community-based organizations, hospitals, provider groups, pharmacies, and health
plans in a variety of delivery approaches (in person, online, remote classroom or telehealth). Since 2018, the
Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program (MDPP) has also offered a structured lifestyle intervention program
designed to prevent type 2 diabetes in individuals 65 years and older with prediabetes.
We propose to develop and implement a collaborative research data collection and evaluation plan that
emphasizes the unique, complementary strengths of several organizations with experience supporting the
delivery of National DPP and/or Medicare DPP interventions to reach diverse populations in multiple contexts
and in multiple formats. Our proposal will integrate several sources of data needed to successfully evaluate
participation barriers and facilitators, effectiveness, costs, and cost-effectiveness of efforts to implement
evidence-based diabetes prevention services as part of the NDPP and MDPP. In collaboration with large
health systems and DPP suppliers in several representative “sentinel” locations nationally, we will collect,
manage, harmonize, and analyze multiple data sources, including: (1) health system partner data regarding
participant eligibility characteristics, participation barriers and facilitators, and change in biometric outcomes
over time; (2) NDPP supplier data regarding attendance levels, weight changes, participant experience, and
implementation challenges; and (3) large health payer data for traditional Medicare beneficiaries nationally,
UnitedHealthCare (UHC) commercially ensured health plan enrollees nationally, UHC Medicare Advantage
enrollees nationally, and UHC Medicaid Managed Care enrollees in select states that participate in NDPP."

The opioid pandemic highlights the urgent needs to understand pain mechanisms and identify novel,
non-opioid therapeutic targets to treat pain. Ion channels involve in almost all aspects of pain sensation.
Therefore, targeting ion channels has been considered as one of the most promising strategies to replace
opioid analgesics for pain treatment. However, most of ion channels are widely expressed in the nervous
system. Thus, how to specifically target ion channels in pain transmission pathway without affecting their
other critical functions becomes a bottleneck in translating this strategy into clinical applications.
Interestingly, the activities of many ion channels are controlled by their cell-type specific regulatory
proteins. Targeting these regulatory proteins to control ion channels in pain pathways thus presents a
novel and highly specific approach to prevent ion channels-mediated pain with minimal to no side effects.
Our preliminary results showed that Lrrc55, an understudied regulatory subunit of BK potassium channel,
is expressed in a subset of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and spinal cord lamina i-ii neurons. Our
preliminary data also demonstrated that knockout of Lrrc55 abolishes mechanical pain without affecting
thermal heat pain in an inflammatory pain model and a nerve injury pain model. Our findings suggest that
LRRC55 might be a novel candidate target for treating pain, possibly selective for mechanical pain. In
this high-risk, high-reward application, two investigators will bring complementary and unique expertise
in ion channel biology and pain to: 1) delineate LRRC55’s roles in chronic pain behaviors using the Lrrc55
deficient mice; 2) quantify functional changes of Lrrc55 expression in DRG and spinal cord neurons after
chronic pain; and 3) test if knockdown of Lrrc55 in DRG and spinal cord neurons can be an effective
strategy to suppress chronic pain. Our study will be the first to demonstrate LRRC55’s neurological
function in pain. More importantly, success of this project can open a new avenue to develop novel and
specific therapeutics to target cell-type specific ion channel regulatory proteins to replace opioid-based
pain killers."

of Operations to guide research protocols involving all aspects of the clinical operations (Phase I). Phase II
began in the fall of 2019 with all human clinical centers showing excellent progress towards initial recruitment
goals and implementation of the protocol. The initial goal set forth by NIH was to recruit 270 children (10-17
years of age) and 1980 sedentary adults (age 18 years or greater) that are randomized to endurance training
(170 youth, 840 adults), resistance training (840 adults), or non-exercise controls (50 youth, 300 adults). An
additional group of highly active endurance (50 youth, 150 adults) and resistance (150 adults) trained individuals
serve as comparators and are not participating in the MoTrPAC exercise training programs. The recruitment and
enrollment approach are sex balanced and with participants across a wide range of ages (10-17, 18-39, 40-59
and >60-year age groups) and of different races. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, MoTrPAC activities were
suspended for over a year (beginning in March 2020) with continued constraints through 2022. Despite the
numerous challenges encountered as a result of the pandemic, recruitment activities at the adult and pediatric
clinical centers have accelerated to a rate that is projected to successfully achieve the target enrollment numbers
by the end of the new award period. This led to the NIH Common Fund to release the current NOFO (RFA-RM-
23-010) to provide MoTrPAC with funding to complete recruitment and follow-up for the clinical studies, including
finishing mechanistic randomized controlled trials of sedentary adults and children and observational studies of
highly active adults and children. This will enrich the participant cohorts that are critical to understand exercise
adaptations and heterogeneity across age, gender, and minority groups. Altogether, this extension will allow
MoTrPAC to complete the intended goals as originally envisioned and will provide a more complete public
database of the health benefits of exercise and provide insight into how physical activity mitigates disease."

Drosophila (fruit flies) are an exceptional model for evolutionary genetics, with many species that can
be subjected to the full suite of modern genetic and genomic methods that have been developed in
the model species D. melanogaster. Hybrids between D. melanogaster and its sibling species D. sim-
ulans are a long-standing model of speciation and our group has made several key contributions to
understanding the genetic basis of hybrid incompatibilities between them. One major effort here will
be to identify the maternal factors in D. simulans that interact with a large satellite block specific to D.
melanogaster to cause F1 hybrid lethality. This will allow us to obtain a mechanistic understanding of
how rapidly evolving non-coding DNA can lead to chromosome instability and lethality between spe-
cies. Drosophila have also played a major role in the discovery of the phenomenon of meiotic drive,
where different alleles segregate non-randomly from heterozygous parents in violation of Mendel’s
first law of equal segregation. Meiotic drive can cause reductions in organismal fertility, drive rapid
changes in karyotypes including of sex chromosomes, and contribute to species isolation. Yet little is
known about fundamental questions such as the prevalence of meiotic drive in natural populartions or
the differences in frequency between male and female meiotic drive. In a second project we will con-
duct a high-throughput and sensitive screen for meiotic drive across all chromosomes in D. melano-
gaster and D. simulans populations. In a third project we will investigate evolution of the primary sex
determination signal. This signal comprises a group of positive and negative regulators of a central
switch gene, that allow the developing Drosophila embryo to distinguish whether it has one or two X
chromosomes and thus develop as a male or female. Surprisingly, there is substantial variation within
D. melanogaster populations affecting the fidelity of the sex determination signal, which we will genet-
ically map and characterize. We will also identify gains and losses of the signaling elements in ~100
fully sequenced species from across the Drosophila phylogeny. These approaches will provide data
essential for understanding the evolutionary forces that drive changes in sex determination signals
across animals. Our experience along with many reagents and methods we have previously devel-
oped position us to accomplish these projects in Drosophila evolutionary genetics with the flexibility
provided by the MIRA funding mechanism."

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of people
worldwide, is currently incurable. As the population ages, AD and related dementia are becoming the biggest
epidemic in medical history: the number of people aged 65 and older with AD is projected to increase between
two- and three-fold by 2050. As shown by imaging and biomarker studies, age is a major risk factor for
developing dementia, and the pathophysiological processes of AD begin more than a decade before the
diagnosis of dementia. However, AD is a heterogeneous and multifactorial disease; thus, it is challenging to
fully understand how the multiple etiologies and age-related prodromal processes contribute to its
pathophysiology. Among other factors, deficits in cerebral microvascular structures and functions may play a
key role in the onset and development of AD. Despite its importance for early diagnosis and as a therapeutic
target, it is still unclear whether they are a causal factor for AD pathogenesis or an early consequence of
multifactorial conditions that lead to AD at a later stage. Especially, two critical knowledge gaps exist: (1)
Temporal relationships between vascular and other key factors during the onset and development of AD are
not clear; (2) Little has been studied about how individual defects in various microvascular structural and
functional properties distinctly correlate with and/or contribute to neuronal degeneration.
 Here, we will develop, optimize, and integrate experimental and computational technologies for the
lifespan tracking and analysis of progressive microvascular alterations in AD versus normal aging in model
mice. First, we will optimize our optical coherence tomography imaging and 3D image processing techniques
to track the time-course of 32 vascular and non-vascular measures longitudinally over the mouse’s lifespan,
including microvascular structure, microcirculation, functional reactivity, Aβ plaque accumulation, neuronal
loss, and cognitive decline (Aim 1). These unprecedentedly comprehensive temporal dynamics data and
advanced statistical/correlation analyses will enable us to determine whether the microvascular deficits
precede neuronal loss or Aβ accumulation, and how those alterations are correlated, directly addressing the
first knowledge gap. In Aim 2, we will improve our computational model of microvascular flow and functional
hyperemia, and then combine the model with the experimental data of Aim 1 to investigate complicated cause-
effect relationships. Our computational model will enable us to essentially “turn on” and “turn off” each
microvascular deficit (e.g., thinner vessels, tortuous capillaries, hypoperfusion, capillary stalling) and test its
effect on oxygen delivery to neurons, which is difficult and sometimes impossible to achieve experimentally.
This combined approach will provide a powerful and unique strategy for testing the role of vascular deficits in
neuronal degeneration, directly addressing the second knowledge gap, and informing future research for
diagnosis and therapeutic target development."
10843840,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with higher risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is
a growing health problem afflicting over 37 million US adults with cost over $80 billion every year. However, the
underlying mechanisms, especially the risk factors that contribute to development into CKD for people with AKI
has not been fully elucidated. Additionally
, no specific therapy is available in prevention of AKI to CKD transition.
Therefore, further understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms is essential for identification of new
therapeutic targets for prevention of AKI to CKD transition.
Decrease in GFR is a hallmark for AKI and CKD. TGF response is one of important mechanisms that regulate
GFR. NOS1β is the primary splice variant and contributes to most of the NO generation by the macula densa.
Recently, several studies from our laboratory demonstrated the decisive role of macula densa NOS1β-modulated
TGF response in the long-term control of GFR, sodium excretion and blood pressure. However, whether the
macula densa NOS1β-modulated TGF responsiveness plays a significant role in transition to CKD from AKI is
unknown.
 In the present proposal, we propose to test our central hypothesis that following renal IRI, NOS1β expression
and activity in the macula densa are decreased, which enhance TGF responsiveness and decrease GFR,
thereby promoting transition to CKD. Rescue of macula densa NOS1 prevents AKI to CKD transition."
10843936,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cigarette smoking remains the leading preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States.
Developing effective cessation interventions remains a public health priority, and mHealth offers the
opportunity to reduce barriers to dissemination and implementation of cessation treatment. This project will test
the emerging technology of augmented reality (AR) to enhance smoking cessation among individuals who
contact the Tobacco Free Florida quitline for treatment services. AR inserts virtual objects into the real-world
environment as viewed on a screen (e.g., smartphone). Cue-exposure treatments have demonstrated efficacy
for decreasing tobacco craving in the laboratory, but these effects do not appear to generalize well beyond the
extinction setting. This post-extinction “renewal effect” has been demonstrated in both animal and human
studies. With the emergence of AR technology, it is now possible to conduct extinction trials across multiple
environments throughout smokers’ own real-world smoking settings. The potential to extend the effects of cue-
exposure to naturalistic settings offers the opportunity for an innovative and scalable cessation treatment that
can be administered remotely. With funding from an R34 treatment development grant, the research team has
already developed an app with the basic AR platform. Importantly, we have tested the app in controlled
experiments and found that the AR stimuli satisfied the key criterion for extinction cues in that they: (a) elicited
substantial cue-reactivity, comparable to in vivo cues and that (b) repeated exposure to the cues reduced
craving (i.e., extinction). The primary goal of the proposed project is to extend this initial work by adapting the
app for clinical use, with the objective of testing the efficacy of AR when combined with quitline treatment, while
also considering key questions relevant to future implementation. Aim 1 will expand the app to be an engaging
and user-friendly treatment tool for smokers, and to coordinate all referral procedures between the study team
and the Tobacco Free Florida quitline. Aim 2 will recruit participants from the Tobacco Free Florida quitline and
randomize individuals either to receive quitline services only or receive quitline services plus the AR app. The
primary outcome is biochemically-confirmed tobacco abstinence at 6 months post-enrollment. Aim 3 will
evaluate treatment implementation questions to guide future quitline adoption. If the AR app proves to be
efficacious, it will be ready for dissemination and implementation through quitlines as well as other smoking
cessation programs (e.g., traditional cessation counseling, text messaging interventions, other mobile
cessation apps). This work has the potential to inform a range of existing treatments not only for tobacco
dependence, but also for other substance use disorders and mental health conditions that are maintained by
principles of conditioning."
10843939,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sepsis is a formidable public health problem, and there is a need to better understand the basic mechanisms
of sepsis and immunomodulation. Our studies will define the anti-inflammatory mechanisms and functional
effects in sepsis of N-oleoyl dopamine (OLDA) and N-arachidonoyl dopamine (NADA), which are endogenous
acyl-dopamines produced in the peripheral and central nervous systems (PNS, CNS). OLDA and NADA exhibit
activity at the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) and cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R). In mice with
S. aureus pneumonia, intraabdominal polymicrobial sepsis, or endotoxemia, we found that OLDA or NADA
administration 1) induces an early substantial upregulation of systemic IL-10, 2) decreases pro-inflammatory
cytokines and chemokines, and 3) reduces acute lung injury and sepsis scores at 24 hours. NADA also
reduces CGRP and increases Substance P in the plasmas of LPS-treated mice. Our studies in bone marrow
chimeras of Trpv1-/- and wild-type mice indicated that NADA induces IL-10 via TRPV1 expressed by non-
myeloid cells. Our further preliminary data suggest that neuronal TRPV1 mediates the anti-inflammatory and
protective actions of OLDA in LPS-treated mice, and more specifically, that these effects are mediated by
TRPV1 neurons in the CNS rather than the PNS. Finally, we observed increased plasma and brain levels of
OLDA and NADA in LPS-treated mice, which suggest that these novel endogenous lipids may be dynamically
regulated during acute inflammation and sepsis. Collectively, our data have led to our central hypothesis that
there is a CNS based neuro-immunomodulatory link that involves the activation of neuronal TRPV1 by
endogenous lipids, such as OLDA and NADA, and regulates inflammatory responses and outcomes of acute
inflammation and sepsis. Aim #1 will localize the TRPV1 neurons responsible for the anti-inflammatory actions
of OLDA and NADA in acute inflammation and sepsis and determine the role of CB1R in the TRPV1-dependent
anti-inflammatory actions of OLDA and NADA. Aim #2 will identify the downstream mechanisms by which the
activation of neuronal TRPV1 by OLDA or NADA upregulates IL-10 production by circulating monocytes in
sepsis, focusing on the roles of Substance P, CGRP, and the sympathetic nervous system. Aim #3 will define
the effects of OLDA and NADA on sepsis outcomes, and the effects of sepsis on endogenous production of
OLDA and NADA, and expression of TRPV1 and CB1R. These studies will advance the understanding of the
neuro-immunomodulatory effects and endogenous roles of NADA, OLDA and TRPV1 in sepsis, with the
ultimate goal to identify novel therapeutic targets."

Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment that promotes sustained weight loss and remission of type 2 diabetes
(T2D) and fatty liver diseases. Although bariatric surgery produces the most dramatic metabolic improvements
of any obesity and T2D treatments available, it is invasive and has severe long-term side effects. Moreover,
the surgery is not routinely available to low-income populations, which are disproportionately affected by
obesity and T2D. Therefore, safer and more affordable therapies are urgently needed. Developing a greater
understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the metabolic benefits of bariatric surgery may
provide a roadmap to develop innovative approaches to treat obesity, T2D, and other metabolic complications.
Our preliminary data and the experiments proposed in this application rely on vertical sleeve gastrectomy
(VSG) in mice as a model to interrogate the molecular consequences of bariatric surgery. VSG produces
prominent physiological effects and generally results in fewer complications than other bariatric surgeries. It
has thus become one of the most popular bariatric operations performed in clinical practice. After performing
VSG in obese mice, we observe dramatic changes in serum bile acid (BA) composition, as well as
downregulation of the enzyme CYP8B1. Specifically, we observe reduced ratios of 12α-hydroxylated (12α-OH)
BAs relative to non-12α-OH BAs. 12α-OH BAs require CYP8B1 for synthesis in the liver and have been
associated with insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Intestinal lipid absorption, which
contributes to weight gain, is also substantially lower in mice after VSG. Based on these exciting preliminary
results, we hypothesize that VSG alters specific BAs in enterohepatic circulation by downregulating CYP8B1,
thus restricting intestinal lipid absorption and changing the gut microbiome, which contributes to the metabolic
effects of the surgery. We propose three specific aims to test our hypothesis: (1) To characterize the
redistribution of BAs along the enterohepatic circuit after VSG; (2) To determine the extent to which CYP8B1
downregulation mediates the metabolic effects of VSG; and (3) To investigate the mechanisms by which
CYP8B1 downregulation contributes to the metabolic effects of VSG. We will compare the effects of VSG on
wild type, Cyp8b1 knockout (KO), CYP8B1 overexpressing, as well as Cyp2c70 KO mice that confer more
human-like BA pool composition. These studies will provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms
underlying the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery. We anticipate that our findings will lead to the
development of safer, non-invasive, and more cost-effective therapies for obesity, T2D, and other metabolic
diseases."

The overall goal of our Autoimmunity Center of Excellence (ACE) renewal proposal is to
investigate the altered states of B cells and macrophages that contribute to the
pathogenesis of SLE. Three individual projects will examine basic questions related to
the role of immune cell states that are induced during periods of disease activity. The
Principal Project will study the differences in B cell states between patients with active
SLE, patients in long-term remission, and healthy individuals to determine which
programs are associated with disease activity. The Pilot Project will determine the
mechanisms by which age associated B cells acquire antigen presentation functions
that amplify T cell activation. The Collaborative Project will study the activation of
myeloid cells that infiltrate SLE kidneys and determine whether their presence in blood
or urine precedes flare. All three projects will share samples from the same patient
cohorts that include legacy ACE cohorts, a cohort of patients in long-term remission and
a newly acquired prospective cohort of patients at high risk of disease flare. The
Administrative Core will be central to the functioning of our ACE by providing
budgetary and financial oversight, by managing interactions with the clinical
investigators who will be recruiting patients for the proposed translational studies, by
providing biostatistical oversight and by providing logistical support to facilitate scientific
interactions within the Feinstein ACE, with collaborators and with other ACE members.
The Core will continue to be co-directed by Drs Anne Davidson and Betty Diamond who
have vast experience with collaborative studies and will have complementary roles in
managing interactions with collaborators. In addition, the Administrative Core will be
supported by an established clinical infrastructure that includes a large patient pool,
well-established patient cohorts, expert clinical collaborators, IRB approved protocols
for data and blood collection, an established mechanism to obtain samples from
patients at home or work, an experienced biostatistics collaborator and appropriate
scientific technology. The close existing relationships between all the investigators and
collaborators and with our long-time administrative staff should ensure smooth
functioning of the Core and successful implementation of all projects."

The Animal Modeling Core (AMC) of the University of Michigan Skin Biology and Diseases Resource-based
Center (UM-SBDRC) serves as a critical shared resource that facilitates the design, development, and
characterization of mouse models aimed at gaining deeper insight into skin biology and disease, significantly
advancing the overall goals of our Center and the NIAMS mission. Genetically-engineered mouse models
(GEMMs) provide a powerful tool for testing hypotheses that emerge from the sophisticated sequencing and
gene editing studies driven by the Functional Analytics Core (FAC), extending them to the physiologically
relevant setting of an intact organism. Although many GEMMs are available, new project-specific models are
frequently needed. However, there are major impediments to successful new mouse model development and
characterization, including the significant time investment and cost needed to acquire detailed empirical
knowledge and expertise to be consistently successful. In addition, commercial GEMM development is frequently
suboptimal and costly. The continued long-term goal of the AMC is to override these and other obstacles for
Center Members by offering comprehensive GEMM services for skin-related studies through the following aims:
1) provide hands-on support for the design and development of new GEMMs and proper use of existing mouse
models; 2) provide training for consistent and reproducible in vivo GEMM manipulation; and 3) provide detailed
instruction and assistance for conducting comprehensive GEMM phenotyping. The work performed with AMC
support during the current grant period has greatly benefitted Center Members by advancing their skin-relevant
research leading to impactful publications, collaborations, and grants. Given the complex interplay of multiple
cell types that is best studied in an intact organism, rigorous mouse modeling remains critically important as a
powerful tool for understanding the pathogenesis of skin disease and as an engine for producing pre-clinical
disease models that should ultimately lead to much-needed new therapies."

 Four decades into the global HIV pandemic, HIV/AIDS remains a pressing public health challenge
contributing to almost 1 million deaths per year. Highly efficacious biomedical interventions have emerged,
including multiple modalities of long-acting anti-retroviral (ART)-based treatment and prevention. However, not
all people have equal access to these lifesaving technologies. Many of the same social-structural determinants
(e.g. structural racism, gender-based violence, intersectional stigma and discrimination) that have historically
constrained HIV protective behaviors, limit the potential for people and communities at the most marginalized
intersections of race, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, and sexual and gender minority status, to benefit
from the real-world impact of these new technologies. Although there is increasing attention in the field to the
role of social-structural factors on prevention and treatment, substantial gaps exist about how best to
conceptualize, research, and develop effective interventions to address the influence of power structures and
systems on HIV prevention, treatment and care outcomes, including from an intersectional lens. The proposed
predoctoral Training Program in Approaches to Address Social-Structural Factors Related to HIV
Intersectionally (TASHI) will prepare the next generation of community-engaged researchers to rigorously
study and strategically intervene on these determinants to promote health equity and to end the HIV epidemic.
 The program will leverage the multi-faceted strengths of the Departments of Prevention and Community
Health (PCH) and Psychological and Brain Sciences (PBS) at the George Washington University (GW) Milken
Institute School of Public Health (SPH) and the College of Arts and Sciences (CCAS), respectively, as well as
the GW Intersectionality Research Institute (IRI), the SPH’s Department of Epidemiology and the GW School
of Medicine’s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. Pre-doctoral trainees will undertake a
rigorous program of coursework including a solid foundation in critical theoretical frameworks (e.g., critical race
theory, intersectionality), multiple research methodologies (e.g., Community-Based Participatory Research,
mixed methods), and social-structural and multi-level intervention development and evaluation. Trainees will
participate in cross-cutting and integrative activities including a monthly seminar series, mentored research
projects, and community and stakeholder engagement rounds. Trainees will be supported by a group of 18
program faculty members with expertise in the social, structural and intersectional aspects of HIV and related
health outcomes. Proposed Co-Program Directors, Dr. Lisa Bowleg and Dr. Deanna Kerrigan, are recognized
leaders in the U.S. and global HIV response and both are executive committee members of the District of
Columbia Center for AIDS Research (DC CFAR), which will serve as a foundational platform for TASHI."
10828897,"Nitrogen-rich small molecules are critical to human health as they constitute the vast majority of all known pharmaceutical agents. As the requirements for new drugs become stricter, and as the diseases that are targeted become more complex, the chemical structures of those compounds are also becoming more complex. This is driving the need for more efficient means to prepare ever more complex nitrogen-containing small molecules. 
Typically, in synthetic chemistry, most chemical reactions of nitrogen centers involve low valent, nucleophilic nitrogen atoms. Over the past 100 years, countless synthetic transformations have been developed to prepare nitrogen-containing molecules using this paradigm. In contrast, this proposal seeks to leverage nitrogen compounds in higher oxidation states to seek new reactivity and chemical processes that can prepare complex nitrogen-containing molecules in new ways. 
Specifically, based upon a strong set of published preliminary results, we will develop new Heck-like reactions of electrophilic nitrogen centers as a means to construct highly substituted stereochemically and topologically complex nitrogen heterocycles. Our studies will discover new nitrogen electrophiles that can participate in these aza-Heck cyclizations, develop novel routes to important classes of biologically active heterocycles, design asymmetric entries into these compounds to control absolute stereochemistry, and dig deeper into the fundamental mechanisms of the reactions to enable further understanding of the processes. To demonstrate the importance of aza-Heck cyclizations, we will also prepare several highly complex natural products with interesting biological profiles in highly expedient ways. Each synthesis will feature aza-Heck technologies as the key enabling reaction. As reflected in our support letters, we are well positioned for follow-up studies at the completion of these synthetic efforts. We will also continue to develop new catalytic methods to prepare complex nitroalkanes and seek to use those compounds in novel transformation for preparing bioactive molecules.
Overall, we expect that the development of this chemistry will positively impact human health by providing synthetic, medicinal, and process chemists valuable new tools for the construction of nitrogen-rich bioactive small molecules. At the same time, this study will provide fundamental advances in transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling chemistry.
Modified Specific Aims
Nitrogen-rich small molecules are critical to human health as they constitute the vast majority of all known pharmaceutical agents. As targeted diseases are more complex and the requirements for new drugs become stricter to increase safety, the requirements and structures of the drug compounds have also become more complex. In particular, the need for increased selectivity and improved pharmacokinetics is driving a move away from traditional “flat” pharmaceuticals towards those that are chiral and rich in sp3 centers.1 In turn, this has driven the need to develop new methods that can efficiently prepare complex and highly substituted stereogenic nitrogen-containing small molecules. 
The proposed research will focus on new methods for preparing topologically complex, nitrogen-containing small molecules. We will focus on two strategies that are thematically related in the utilization of high-valent nitrogen precursors. These reactions are a departure from the vast majority of synthetic transformations that rely on low-valent nucleophilic nitrogen centers and will allow rapid access to compounds that traditional methods struggle to prepare. First, we will develop cyclizations of stable, readily prepared nitrogen electrophiles to prepare highly substituted stereogenic aza-heterocycles. These aza-Heck cyclizations will allow facile access to biologically and medicinally relevant heterocycles that other methods struggle to access. Second, we will develop new reactions of nitroalkanes to prepare complex amines. 
Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1: New Reactions of Electrophilic Nitrogen to Prepare Complex Heterocycles We will develop innovative Heck-type cyclizations of nitrogen electrophiles. This will include developing new routes to highly substituted nitrogen heterocycles of high biological importance, accessing larger heterocycles than are currently possible using aza-Heck reactions, developing asymmetric versions of these cyclizations, and studying the novel mechanisms of these transformations. This will allow rapid entry into heterocyclic systems and enable the synthesis of many bioactive compounds and natural products.
Specific Aim 2: Synthesis of Complex, Biologically Active Molecules Using Aza-Heck Strategies We will apply aza-Heck cyclizations to the synthesis of complex natural products of direct interest to human disease. The proposed routes are extremely efficient and will demonstrate the power of aza-Heck technology over traditional synthetic methods. The synthetic efficiency, combined with the bioactivity of the chosen targets, will enable biological follow-up studies.
Specific Aim 3: Nitroalkane Alkylation We will develop new reactions of nitroalkanes, including photodependent alkylations of highly substituted nitroalkanes, asymmetric nitroalkane alkylations, and asymmetric reductions of nitroalkanes, enabling innovative entries into biologically important alkyl amines. The unique and complex mechanisms of these transformations will also be elucidated.
Overall, this research program will discover and seek to understand new methods for preparing complex, biomedically relevant compounds and enable the synthesis of target molecules of specific interest to the treatment of various human diseases."
10828901,"Project Summary: Perioperative opioid adverse effects--from common but less-serious post-operative
nausea and vomiting to the more serious respiratory depression and death—are current but preventable
challenges in managing surgical pain. Severe surgical pain is still poorly managed, yet clinicians must also
avoid unpredictable and life-threatening opioid adverse effects as well as long-term opioid use/misuse. This
application innovatively proposes to translate evidence into a proactive clinical practice to optimize post-
surgical pain control and decrease opioid-related adverse effects. Current evidence shows that opioid me-
tabolism, opioids’ analgesic and adverse effects are influenced by genetic variations. The FDA warns
against the use of codeine and tramadol in children (due to postoperative anoxic brain injuries and deaths)
and in nursing mothers (due to serious breathing problems and infantile death). Preoperative genotyping
and personalized analgesia are not practiced despite evidence, regulatory warnings, CPIC guidelines, cost-
effectiveness and insurance coverage for CYP2D6 testing due to translational bottlenecks, lack of infra-
structure and knowledge gaps in how to personalize opioid use and dose precisely for optimal outcomes.
Thus, there is an urgent and unmet critical need for a perioperative precision analgesia infrastructure to
overcome the translational barriers and to improve safety and effectiveness of opioids in children and nurs-
ing mothers. Personalizing analgesia based on genetic risks will reduce opioid use, adverse-effects, and
accelerate value-based care opportunities. However, these opportunities are constrained by lack of trans-
lational platforms and major gaps in our understanding of how to personalize and precisely dose opioids. In
this collaborative CTSA project, we propose to overcome the translational barriers by developing an inno-
vative perioperative precision analgesia platform (PPAP) to reduce serious adverse outcomes of opioids,
and improve safety of opioids in: 1) children undergoing painful surgery, and 2) nursing mothers and their
infants. We have robust evidence and implementation expertise on genetic risk factors including CYP2D6
and other genetic variations for opioids’ analgesic efficacy and opioid-related serious adverse effects, meth-
ods of implementation of genotypes with clinical decision support in electronic health records, genotype-
based perioperative opioid use and innovative digital tools for electronic patient reported outcomes at all
participating CTSA hubs. This application with innovative preoperative genotyping, integrated personalized
decision support aims to enhance understanding of opioid metabolism, personalized opioid selection, pre-
cision dosing, and clinical outcomes in neonates, children, and nursing mothers, and to disseminate findings
to other CTSA hubs. A unified CTSA-wide PPAP will enable genetic risk predictions and personalized in-
terventions to maximize pain relief while minimizing opioid use and adverse effects in millions of children
and nursing mothers undergoing surgery each year."
10830314,"Project Summary
The surface of the skin is persistently colonized with a community of bacteria that includes numerous different
species and strains of coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS). There is mounting evidence that these CoNS
prevent colonization of the skin by pathogens such Staphylococcus aureus, thereby protecting the skin from
damage. Our central hypothesis is that CoNS on the skin use a peptide quorum-sensing system to limit S.
aureus-induced damage to the host. All Staphylococci have a quorum-sensing system, which is also called the
accessory gene regulator (agr). The agr system responds to a secreted peptide signal (autoinducing peptide or
AIP), and this system controls expression of toxins and exo-enzymes from S. aureus. In CoNS, the function of
the agr system is less clear, but our recent data suggest CoNS uses the agr system to survive on the skin,
establish diversity, and compete against S. aureus. In support of this hypothesis, we have discovered that several
common skin CoNS species produce AIP signals that inhibit the S. aureus agr system and limit skin damage.
However, strain-specific knowledge of the genetic basis for this hypothesis is essential since not all CoNS strains
are benefical and some can trigger inflammation. To better understand these mechanisms and their significance
to human skin immune defense, in Aim 1 we will investigate whether CoNS AIP signals prevent skin damage by
S. aureus. To carry out this aim, we will identify the AIP structures from culture media of selected skin CoNS
strains, and test their activity as S. aureus agr inhibitors in vitro and in skin models of deep tissue infection and
superficial colonization that drives skin inflammation. We will also compare CoNS and S. aureus polymicrobial
interactions on the skin using explants and animal models, and assess the contribution of CoNS agr function to
antimicrobial peptide production and mixed infection with S. aureus. In Aim 2, we propose that dysregulation of
agr-regulated factors is a major mechanism that influences skin disease. Our preliminary studies indicate that
high expression of the S. epidermidis EcpA protease promotes epidermal damage and subsequent inflammation.
We will investigate S. epidermidis EcpA protease expression and the host target(s) of cleavage, and we will
compare WT and mutant strains to define the impact on skin barrier disruption and inflammation. We will also
investigate protective CoNS species that use AIPs to inhibit S. epidermidis EcpA production. Defining deleterious
mechanisms will enable better understanding of factors favoring survival of beneficial vs harmful CoNS. In Aim
3, we will determine how CoNS use agr-regulated factors to survive on the skin. Based on our preliminary studies
with S. epidermidis, we hypothesize that CoNS strains colonize the skin using the agr quorum-sensing system.
We will assess the requirement of various agr-regulated loci for CoNS survival on skin and evaluate the function
of identified loci for skin barrier entry. We will also determine the CoNS agr regulon using RNAseq and investigate
identified targets. Collectively, the findings from the proposed work will elucidate the mechanisms used by the
skin microbiome to promote health and establish homeostasis."
10830316,"Abstract. This MIRA proposal is a continuation of R01GM096767, which recently began its eighth
year of funding. 64 papers have been published that acknowledge support from this grant.
 Two overarching themes form the proposed work:
 The first theme addresses the inherent inefficiencies in metagenomic analysis of microbiomes.
Metagenomics is a culture-independent technique for the study of microbial communities. In metag-
enomic studies, the genomes of all organisms in a microbiome are extracted, sheared, and subject-
ed to next-generation sequencing. The sequences are then assembled into contigs and mapped
to genomes. Current technology is extraordinarily inefficient because the genomes from abundant
species inevitably dominate the sequencing data. As a result, huge data sets are needed to resolve
genomes of low-abundance taxa. In addition, sequences from related species and strains confound
accurate assembly. To address these issues, we use capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) to fraction-
ate an aliquot of a complex wastewater microbiome into wells of a microtiter plate before metagenom-
ic analysis. Fractionation segregates highly abundant species in a few wells of the microtiter plate,
allowing successful sequencing of rarer species in other wells. We have demonstrated that CZE
fractionation can produce a 5.8-fold increase in the number of resolved taxa, a three-fold increase in
the number of taxa resolved at the genus level, a 30-fold increase in the number of taxa resolved at
the species level, a 13-fold increase in the number of genes per genus, and a 23-fold increase in the
number of genes per species compared with conventional analysis of the unfractionated microbiome.
We demonstrate that CZE resolved bacterial strains into different fractions. We propose a systematic
study of separation modes and conditions to further increase the numbers of identified genus, spe-
cies, and strains.
 The second theme is high sensitivity and high-throughput protein analysis. We have developed
a method for sample preparation based on a microliter volume microreactor that uses two sample
transfer steps for sample preparation; the reagent volumes required for cleaning and eluting the sam-
ple are both <3 µL. The small size of the microreactor, low reagent volume, and small number of sam-
ple processing steps greatly improve the recovery of sub-microgram samples. We use a UPLC-ESI
coupled with a Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometer for analysis of processed sample; the system has
identified 20,943 unique peptides and 2,597 protein groups from a single Xenopus laevis stage 50
blastomere. Our goal is to investigate alternative separation methods and to extend this technology to
the parallel processing of 192 blastomeres taken from Xenopus laevis embryos."
10830317,"ABSTRACT
Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer among women and is the leading cause of cancer death in
women worldwide, with 1.6 million new cases and 500,000 BC deaths annually. Patients diagnosed in low-
resource settings (LRS) account for half of new cases, and the majority of deaths from BC worldwide. The first
critical step to starting life-saving treatment for BC is the accurate and timely pathologic confirmation of a cancer
diagnosis, a task which remains challenging in many LRS. Traditional pathology assessment involves processing
surgically excised specimens with cell-block methods for: (1) cellular histopathology, which identifies abnormal
cellular morphologies indicative of malignancy, and (2) molecular pathology, which identifies tumor biomarkers,
specifically estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2
(HER2), and the proliferation maker Ki67. Breast cancer subtyping using these markers is essential for
determining prognosis, as well as for selecting subtype-specific therapies. Unfortunately, histology-based
pathology services require a strong pathology infrastructure and trained pathologists, limiting access to these
services in many LRS. For example, there are only 15 trained pathologists in Tanzania, a country of over 55
million people. There is hence an urgent need for new methods to accurately diagnose cancer, as well as to
analyze expression levels of molecular biomarkers for tumor subtyping. A technology driven solution that could
automate cellular pathology with minimal user-intervention and virtually no infrastructure requirements could thus
enormously impact the management of breast cancer in LRS. Motivated by this need, the objective of this
proposal is to finalize the development of the EpiView-D4 point-of-care test (POCT) to analyze both the cellular
and molecular features of breast cancer from needle aspiration specimens. The EpiView component of the
device enables easily accessible, low-cost, smart-phone based brightfield cellular imaging of fine needle aspirate
breast biopsies without the need for pathologist assessment. In parallel, the D4 POCT component of the device
images a point-of-care antibody microarray for the quantification of ER/PR/Her2/Ki67 levels from breast FNA
lysate with picomolar sensitivity within 30 minutes at point-of-care, eliminating the need for additional visits before
a treatment plan can be initiated. The EpiView-D4 will enable automated readout of both cytopathology and the
molecular profiles of breast cancer, using machine learning algorithms integrated into a smartphone application.
In this proposal, we will conduct final device development and training of ML algorithms, followed by pre-clinical
validation and clinical investigation of the Epiview-D4 POCT, first at Duke University Medical Center, and then
in the intended LRS of Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center. The impact of this technology lies in its potential to
dramatically improve breast cancer management worldwide by enabling rapid and accurate diagnosis and
subtyping of breast cancers, thereby driving timely and appropriate treatment for breast cancer patients and
hence improving the outcomes for hundreds of thousands of women with BC annually in LRS."
10830318,"The NINDS has provided me the opportunity to study neuronal ion homeostasis, GABA signaling, and
epileptogenesis for 30 years. That sustained support enabled the completion of a successful bench-to-
bedside translation of a new therapy for neonatal seizures, which are largely unresponsive to available
therapies. This new therapy is based on manipulation of neuronal anion homeostasis, which subserves
both GABAA receptor signaling and volume regulation. These studies led us to appreciate the magnitude of
the Donnan effects of intra and extracellular anionic macromolecules on neuronal chloride and volume
homeostasis. The delicate balance between intra and extracellular ionic and osmotic forces could be easily
upset by changes in membrane permeability or mobilization of osmoles on one side of the membrane. Here
we propose that brain injury results in both of these perturbations, with consequent catastrophic effects on
neuronal volume regulation. In the mature brain, this results in cytotoxic edema and brain swelling, for
which there are no curative and only modestly effective symptomatic therapies. In the premature brain,
volume changes are equally problematic, but our analyses predict that they are opposite in sign. We
propose that immature neurons shrink after injury, resulting in an absent MRI DWI signature as well as local
tissue shrinkage, vascular stretch, and potential hemorrhage. These effects contribute to the current
problems in the care of very low birthweight infants: brain injury is rampant, but the immediate causes are
not clear because the injury cannot be imaged with MRI or ultrasound. Only the consequences
(hemorrhage and atrophy) are visible. We propose to investigate neuronal ion and volume shifts after injury
in vitro and in vivo, using advanced imaging techniques and ion-sensitive fluorophores. The results will
provide robust indicators as to whether these new insights into volume shifts in injured neurons are ready
for translation to novel therapeutic strategies for both the developing and the mature injured brain."
10893588,"The overall goal of the UIC BIRCWH Program is to align with the 2019-23 Trans-NIH Strategic Plan for
Women’s Health Research to “promote training and careers to develop a well-trained, diverse, and robust
workforce to advance science for the health of women” (NIH ORWH, 2019). Our long-term objective is to
promote training and career development of a new generation of researchers equipped with the knowledge
and career skills necessary to advance science for the health of women in the next decade and beyond. We
are based in the UIC College of Medicine, but draw on the interdisciplinary strengths of UIC’s seven health
colleges. Our past success directing a BIRCWH from 2007-2017 fostered the academic careers of 18 Scholars
(33% under-represented minorities; URM). Their success is evident in 24 NIH grants as Principal Investigator
and 32 as Co-Investigator, as well as numerous non-NIH grants (55 as PI and 50 as Co-I). We also have a
record of success mentoring in the UIC-funded Women’s Health Research (WHR) Associates Program which
supported 8 Scholars (38% URM) and the UIC-funded Bridge Program which currently supports 3 Scholars. All
three programs have received strong institutional support from UIC leadership. We seek BIRCWH funding over
the next 5 years to train 6 junior faculty researchers in women’s or sex/gender-based health research: 3 MDs
for 3 years and 3 PhDs for 2 years. We will build upon our demonstrated success by capitalizing on 4 program
strengths: (1) our success in launching the careers of 29 junior faculty in women’s health research; (2)
alignment with the Trans-NIH Strategic Plan for Women’s Health; (3) the highly interdisciplinary nature of the
program and integration across UIC and regional BIRCWH Programs; and (4) the use of evidence-based
mentoring practices to prepare scholars to conduct team science and address barriers facing new female and
URM investigators. Our short-term objectives build upon these strengths through ongoing program activities
and several new initiatives. Ongoing activities include: a) supplementing team mentoring programs with new
training and tools, b) optimizing existing and new UIC partnerships, and c) augmenting our strong didactic
curriculum in women’s health research. We also have 4 novel initiatives. First, the Diversification of the
Sciences Initiative identifies institutional and other barriers to optimal academic quality of life among new
investigators, and pursues policy changes and program activities to improve recruitment, retention, and
advancement of women and URMs. Second, we will engage in the Midwest BIRCWH Program, an initiative to
increase collaboration across Midwestern BIRCWH Programs. Third, we will incorporate new curriculum
content on reproducibility, transparency, and rigor. Lastly, we will provide training on fundamental research
approaches, hands-on bioinformatics training, and experimental design for personalized medicine. BIRCWH
activities at UIC related to sex and gender influences in health and disease will advance the ORWH goal to
accelerate the translation of knowledge into improved health care for women."
10834881,"Visual field loss is a common corollary of stroke (Pollock et al,The Cochrane Library:John Wiley & Sons; 2011,p
p. 1-83) that is prevalent in the VA population. Posterior and middle cerebral artery infarcts often injure visual
cortical networks resulting in partial or complete homonymous hemianopia or quadrantanopia. The most
common clinically significant visual cortical injury involves the primary visual cortex and adjacent regions (area
V1+). Area V1 is the chief relay of visual input to higher (extrastriate) cortical areas, and V1 lesions result in a
dense contralateral scotoma within which visual perception is severely impaired. The resulting visual deficit is
long thought to be resistant to rehabilitation, i.e. to be essentially irreversible, and impairs quality of life
significantly. Visual field loss impairs many activities of daily living, including the ability to ambulate safely, drive,
read, cook, supervise minors, and others, markedly reducing the independence of the patient (Veterans Health
Initiative 2002: Visual Impairment and Blindness). Loss of visual motion perception is particularly problematic for
navigating the environment and for avoiding collision with moving objects. Here we focus on studying
rehabilitation of visual motion perception.
Several studies demonstrated that visual cortex can be driven from the interior of the scotoma, i.e. from areas of
the visual field where there is no visual perception. One such area that can be visually modulated in the
absence of V1 input is hV5/MT+, an area important for visual motion perception. Although this modulation is
weak and does not generally confer useful vision (“blindsight”), it raises the hope that appropriately designed
new rehabilitative strategies may be able to strengthen these partially functioning pathways promoting recovery.
Recent work (Huxlin et al. J Neuroscience 29(13):3981-91, 2009) has shown that intensive training in a visual
motion discrimination task can improve visual motion perception in some subjects with cortical V1 lesions (see
fig 5-6). However, this work is still at the preliminary stage. Specifically, not all subjects appear to benefit
(section C2), it is not clear which parts of the visual field are amenable to visual rehabilitation, and the
mechanism of recovery remains unclear. Our goal here is twofold: 1) To pilot functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) population receptive field mapping methods for identifying regions of the visual field that are
more amenable to visual rehabilitation after lesions of the primary visual cortex (area V1+). 2) To probe the
mechanisms underlying the recently reported rehabilitation-induced improvement in visual performance that
occurs in some subjects (preliminary data fig. 5-7). We will address the following specific aims:
Aim 1: We will show that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) population receptive field mapping
methods can identify regions of the visual field that are more amenable to visual motion perception rehabilitation
after lesions of the primary visual cortex (area V1+). Hypothesis 1: Regions of the scotoma that elicit visually
driven fMRI activity in both spared area V1 and hV5/MT+ (see fig.1) will be easier to rehabilitate, and will reach
higher behavioral thresholds, compared to regions that activate only area hV5/MT+.
Aim 2: Study how the strength of visual modulation changes in early visual areas, in hV5/MT+, and in fronto-
parietal networks subserving attention & higher-order visual processing, following rehabilitative training.
Determine whether observed changes are correlated with recovery. Hypothesis 2: Training will increase the
signal to noise ratio of the response to visual motion stimuli in area hV5/MT+, while responses in spared V1+
and early extrastriate areas will remain relatively unchanged. Increase in hV5/MT+ response strength will
correlate best with recovery. The change in hV5/MT+ response strength will likely be mediated via top down
pathways, potentially associated with attentional networks (see [43] [44] and preliminary data fig. 5-7).
Our long-term goal is to use information obtained from fMRI methods to implement a principled strategy for
developing rehabilitative treatments following visual cortex injury."
10893583,"There is a demonstrated need to increase the number of exceptional researchers in women's health and
sex/gender differences to better understand basic mechanisms of disease and develop treatment that
addresses the heterogeneity of treatment effects by sex. The Tufts University Building Interdisciplinary
Research Careers in Women's Health (BIRCWH) Scholars Program proposes the continuation of a model
program to recruit, select, and train early career faculty to conduct basic research in sex/gender differences
and clinical and health services research on women's health issues. The long term goals of the Tufts BIRCWH
Program are to develop the next generation of leaders in research in sex/gender differences and women’s
health. The Program will fund faculty within six years of their training. We will fund two types of trainees, Basic
Science Scholars and Clinical Scholars, who have completed their doctoral training but require more in depth
interdisciplinary research training. The Program will achieve its goals through five key activities, tailored to
meet each Scholar’s training needs: 1) interdisciplinary mentoring teams, 2) formal research training including
courses at the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 3) interdisciplinary research seminars, 4) a mentored
research project, and 5) development of skills in grant proposal preparation. The Tufts BIRCWH Program will
promote all stages of translational research from basic science in sex/gender differences to clinical and
outcomes research focusing on several important questions in the care of women: a) discovery of sex
differences, b) health equity in disease prevention, management, and outcomes, c) nutrition science, d)
women’s cardiovascular health, and e) maternal health and impact on the life course. We propose to fund
three scholars annually, with initial appointments of two years with an option to be considered for a third year."

THIRD COAST CFAR CORE E: VIRAL PATHOGENESIS CORE (VPC)
The Viral Pathogenesis Core (VPC) brings highly sophisticated tools, services and reagents of biological HIV
research to the interdisciplinary research teams of the TC CFAR. The largest number of VPC users address
Overall aim 3: to discover/develop scientific innovations that better prevent HIV and improve treatment of all
conditions for persons living with HIV (PLWH). We provide, and are enhancing, consultation and training to
facilitate the ability of our diverse teams spanning the breadth of HIV research disciplines at the University of
Chicago and Northwestern University to contribute to development of new biological interventions that will
reduce transmission of HIV, address the increased risk of chronic diseases of aging in the HIV+ population, and
advance HIV cure research. VPC has already strongly grown opportunities for adding biological tools to the work
of clinical and behavioral HIV researchers addressing Overall aims 1 (improving HIV prevention and care
continuums) and 2 (non-AIDS co-morbidities). New activities will add engagement of laboratory researchers
studying aging biology and aging-related disorders who are interested in collaborations on aging in HIV, in
support of Overall aim 2. The specific aims of the VP Core are: 1) provide an expanding menu of virological,
imaging and immunological assays, as well as consultation and navigation to other disciplines and technologies,
that will advance innovative, interdisciplinary HIV research; 2) provide expert design/performance of HIV
experiments, as well as consultation/navigation on imaging, systems biology, -omics; 3) strengthen information
exchange and partnerships with other HIV research disciplines and with laboratory / translational researchers
new to HIV who are interested in non-AIDS comorbidities. The VPC’s cutting edge tools for studying HIV at the
molecular, cell, tissue, and organismal levels include highly sophisticated instrumentation; experienced technical
support and customized training; and expert consultation / navigation for new technologies, creative
experimental designs and innovative pathogenic hypotheses. A primary objective of the VPC is to make these
approaches equally available to the molecular virologist, the clinical/translational researcher, and the
behavioral/social scientist. VPC adds value and the necessary rigor in all experimentation, including for projects
that previously had limited or no access to approaches such as multiplex biomarker assays and virologic
assessments. The Data Insight Group (DIG) is expanding consultation and navigation to specialized multi-omics
approaches to studies of this virus, as well. The DIG brings together an exciting group of young investigators
utilizing advanced technologies in their own research programs as a mechanism to extend incorporation of these
approaches into other TC CFAR members’ research. Customized mentorship, navigation and training will also
build and strengthen partnerships and collaborations. In this way, the VPC will advance the mission of the TC
CFAR to catalyze scientific innovations that will slow, and eventually stop, the HIV epidemic."
10835949,"PROJECT SUMMARY
SCIENTIFIC WORKING GROUP: INNOVATION AND IMPLEMENTATION FOR IMPACT ON ENDING THE
HIV EPIDEMIC (EHE SWG)
Chicago has made some progress in curbing the HIV epidemic. However, more effective prevention, diagnosis,
treatment, and public health responses are each needed to accelerate improvements to the continuums of HIV
prevention and care that will help meet goals of the Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America (EHE) initiative.
Most new HIV diagnoses in 2017 were within the 20-29 year age group (38%), and among black/African
Americans (55%) and MSM (63%) residents (Chicago Department of Public Health. HIV/STI Surveillance Report
2017. December 2018). One study found that only 43% of non-Hispanic black/African American MSM in Chicago
were maintained in PrEP care at 12 months. Limits in antiretroviral treatment (ART) access/success across all
race/ethnicities compound these challenges to HIV prevention. Fewer than half of all persons living with HIV
(PLWH) in Chicago achieved viral suppression in 2017 (HIV/STI Surveillance Report 2017). The Innovation
and Implementation for Impact on Ending the HIV Epidemic Scientific Working Group (EHE SWG) has
the broad objective of maximizing progress in Chicago toward a goal of EHE: reduce new HIV infections in Cook
County by 90% in 2030. It will catalyze and develop new collaborations and innovative proposals that fill
prioritized gaps and address emerging opportunities. The EHE SWG fully utilizes our strong academic expertise,
and engages diverse and able community partners, to efficiently learn how to advance implementation of new
strategies and spread the successes. In addition to emphasizing local partnerships with community-based
service providers already working productively with the Third Coast Center for AIDS Research (TC CFAR), the
EHE SWG will start new partnerships with community organizations and service providers across Chicagoland.
The EHE SWG will also learn and adapt lessons from the implementation of EHE administrative supplements
to CFARs and ARCs around the country (as the TC CFAR-led Implementation Science Coordination,
Consultation, and Collaboration Initiative (ISC3I) shares information across all EHE awardees, the NIH, and
DHHS). The specific aims of the EHE SWG are: (1) to ensure efficient dissemination of information about funding
opportunities for service delivery/evaluation and implementation research from the evolving DHHS EHE initiative
as they emerge and engage any and all interested Chicagoland partners in collaborations addressing EHE goals;
(2) to form, support, and regularly refresh “action teams” developing topic-focused research-practice
partnerships aligned with EHE goals and local public health priorities; (3) to ‘pre-position’ proposal-focused
research-practice partnership action teams to submit responsive and competitive proposals for transformative
innovations they develop with input from TC CFAR implementation science experts and other relevant TC CFAR
resources, as soon as EHE-focused funding opportunities are issued from the NIH (via annual CFAR
Administrative Supplement RFAs), CDC, or HRSA."

10840273,"Research Abstract
The spinal cord appears, at least in part, to structure movement through combining a limited number of
stereotyped ‘motor modules’. Module structure and combination is often dysfunctional in motor system
diseases, such as spinal cord injury (SCI). The long-term goal of this research is to identify mechanisms of
motor module structure and recruitment, to enable artificial activation or restoration to ameliorate maladaptive
motor control. The objective of this proposal is to determine how spinal motor modules are activated in the
spinal cord and how these modules then recruit motoneurons from the motor pools in the simpler spinal
bullfrog model. The central hypothesis is that motor modules are partially independent, generate both rhythm
and pattern, and recruit particular motoneurons across coactivated motor pools in turn. The rationale
underlying this proposal is that frogs have unique physiology allowing chronic survival despite destruction of
supraspinal centers, permitting the intrinsic capacities of the spinal cord to be studied within the intact
musculature over an extended period of time. This proposal builds off historical research which activated motor
modules through electrical stimulation or excitatory neurotransmitters. I will test the central hypothesis through
two specific aims: 1) Evaluating independence of module activation during manipulation of spinal state,
and 2) Discerning the granularity of recruitment of motor pools contributing to motor modules. I utilize
two innovative methods to refine these investigations: 1) a new type of electrode which can record from many
single motor units simultaneously and 2) a new mathematical tool to identify state-dependent effects between a
spiking neuron with continuous signals, such as muscle activity. The proposed research is significant as it will
bridge modularity research in the spinal wiping reflexes with hierarchical models of spinal motor pattern
generation (e.g. locomotion). A more refined understanding of motor module organization may clarify muscle
and motor pool recruitment in higher species, including humans, where direct analysis is often obscured or
impossible due to increased complexity. The expected outcome of this work is an understanding of how
modules are activated by the spinal cord and their capacity to be flexibly combined. This work will have a
further positive impact by validating new tools and techniques for experimental use, and lay the groundwork for
proactively activating motor modules in a task-dependent fashion in neuroprostheses. Towards this end, I have
finished my neuroscience coursework and proposed cross-disciplinary training in biomedical engineering
through Drexel University’s neuroengineering initiative to increase his quantitative skills to better pursue these
questions. This training plan will combine the historically-strong program of spinal cord biology and motor
control within the Department of Neurobiology and Anatomy with the quantitative rigor of formal mathematics
and engineering, further equipping me to accomplish these aims and pursue a successful career as an
independent research scientist."
10835966,"Liposome, composed of a lipid bilayer comprising phospholipids (PL) and sterols such as cholesterol (Chol), has
been extensively used for packaging and delivery of therapeutic agents due to its intrinsic biocompatibility and
biodegradability. While most approved liposomal nanotherapeutics can improve pharmacokinetics (PK) and
reduce systemic toxicities, improvements in therapeutic efficacy and overall survival are disappointing,
underscoring the urgent need for enhanced therapeutic delivery. Chol plays a critical role in fortifying membrane
packing and reducing bilayer fluidity and permeability by promoting the liquid condensed state in lipid
membranes, enhancing bilayer rigidity and strength. Lipid bilayers with high levels of Chol are generally more
stable than those without or with less Chol. However, under the physiological environment, Chol is rapidly
extracted from the bilayer by biomembranes and serum proteins, which jeopardizes bilayer stability and results
in premature content leakage, fast blood clearance and unwanted adverse effects, leading to suboptimal clinic
efficacy. In addition, although enhanced permeability and retention effect allows nanotherapeutic accumulation
to the periphery of diseased tissues, intracellular internalization and tissue penetration remain inefficient due to
the tenacious resistance imposed by high interstitial fluid pressure and dense extracellular matrix, compromising
the therapeutic outcome. These phenomena present formidable barriers for lipid bilayer-based therapeutic
delivery. To tackle these key challenges, the overall vision of my research program is to establish a stabilized
lipid bilayer with improved physicochemical properties that can further improve drug delivery and selectively
fortify intracellular uptake and infiltration at target sites. We have established a Chol-derived PL via covalently
attaching Chol to a PL with varied stimuli-responsive linkages. Via systemic structure activity relationship studies,
we demonstrated that Chol-derived PL blocked Chol transfer, prevented payload leakage, prolonged circulation
time, and augmented efficacy in treating lung inflammation, Alzheimer’s disease, lymphoma, pancreatic and
triple negative breast cancer models, which were linker chemistry dependent. For the next five years, the goals
of this proposal are to 1) unravel the underlying mechanisms and principles on how the structural alterations of
a sterol-modified PL bilayer that forms liposome but cannot shuttle between biomembranes will affect drug and
gene delivery via substituting Chol with other membrane sterols; and 2) establish a universal ultra pH-sensitive
charge-reversal delivery platform to boost the cellular uptake and tissue penetration efficiency via incorporating
an intelligent build-in cationization mechanism that selectively triggers effective adsorption-mediated endocytosis
and transcytosis at diseased tissues. Completing these studies will provide fundamental and functional
correlations of bilayer properties with therapeutic delivery, enable us to establish a set of design rules governing
the optimal interactions between lipid bilayer and encased drugs, and provide a paradigm-shifting toolbox to
advance the drug delivery technologies, facilitating clinical translation of treating human diseases."
10835968,"Project Summary/Abstract
Most preclinical research on neuropathic pain has focused almost exclusively on mechanical allodynia and
thermal hyperalgesia as endpoint readouts. While these are pertinent to assess stimulus-evoked
hypersensitivity, they leave out the two top complaints reported by neuropathic pain patients: spontaneous pain
and sleep disturbances. There is currently no technique to measure spontaneous pain reliably in rodents,
limiting our study of the mechanisms responsible, and the nature of the sleep disturbances in neuropathic pain
states are not known.
We analyzed sleep and pain responses in two mouse models of peripheral neuropathic pain and found that
while peripheral nerve trauma did not change total sleep amount, it caused a severe non-rapid eye movement
sleep (NREMS) fragmentation in both models, which was only detected when mice also displayed signs of
abnormal pain hypersensitivity and resolved when evoked pain sensitivity returned to pre-injury values. The
temporal profile of the wake episodes that fragment sleep fits with the very brief sharp pain burst reported in
patients with traumatic neuropathic pain (1), and also with the rare occurrence of spontaneous pain-like
behavior observed in awake rodents after trigeminal nerve injury (2-4).
In our pilot data, we used a combination of genetic and pharmacological approaches and found that the
increase in sleep fragmentation after nerve injury originates from injured peripheral sensory neurons, does not
appear to be caused by peripheral inputs and can be blocked by analgesics. In this project we hypothesize that
sleep fragmentation caused by nerve injury is causally linked to the spontaneous activity in sensory
fibers that activates pain pathways, and that therefore it could be used as a surrogate readout for
quantifying neuropathic spontaneous pain.
We propose 3 Specific Aims to test if sleep fragmentation after nerve injury is caused by ectopic activation of
injured sensory neurons that activates ascending pain pathways, while it does not involve innocuous stimuli or
require evoked noxious stimuli.
Aim 1: Identify which peripheral sensory neurons drive NREMS fragmentation after nerve injury.
Aim 2: Determine if the neural activity responsible for NREMS fragmentation is generated spontaneously at
the injury site or requires external stimuli.
Aim 3: Test if the spino-parabrachial pathway contributes to nerve injury-induced NREMS fragmentation
Because we cannot measure spontaneous pain in live animals it has been impossible to perform mechanistic
studies. Identifying a novel readout measure for neuropathic spontaneous pain would represent a fundamental
breakthrough to study the underlying mechanisms and test the efficacy of potential novel analgesics."
10835970,"OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY
The California Center for Population Research (CCPR) is a university-wide interdisciplinary research center at
the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). CCPR stimulates, advances, and supports ambitious, high-
impact, interdisciplinary research on the most important issues in population dynamics by 1) sustaining and
strengthening an intellectually stimulating, supportive, and collegial environment for interdisciplinary population
research; 2) investing in the next generation of population scientists through extensive mentoring and support;
3) providing excellent administrative, technical, and methodological support at all stages of the research
process; 4) promoting the development and use of innovative research methods; 5) reducing barriers to
accessing population data and supporting new data collection; 6) disseminating CCPR research and data to a
variety of audiences. CCPR benefits from a supportive university environment that encourages interdisciplinary
research and in which all units – from the social sciences to the public health and medical schools – are
located on the same walkable campus. UCLA provides CCPR with generous support, contingent on CCPR
maintaining its NICHD funding.
With this NICHD and UCLA support, CCPR has been thriving these past two decades and now has 139 faculty
Affiliates from 17 departments across campus. To maintain CCPR centeredness, we have introduced a new
form of affiliation for the most active Affiliates, with currently 70 faculty “Fellows.” Concurrently, as CCPR
collaborations and activities extend beyond the UCLA campus, we have 32 external affiliates, including
colleagues from under-resourced institutions (URIs). CCPR's research focuses primarily on four areas: 1)
increasing diversity of the family and its consequences for family members' well-being, focusing mainly on
family disruption, families in poverty, and multigenerational families; 2) migration and immigration and its
consequences for society, health, and well-being; 3) racism and discrimination, poverty, and other structural
factors in producing wide gaps in health and mortality, as well as the means for reducing these gaps; 4) long-
term and recent fertility and contraceptive use changes, how to improve reproductive health outcomes for
women and children, and the social and policy contexts of HIV/AIDS. While conducting cutting-edge
fundamental research in these areas, CCPR Fellows frequently work with governmental agencies and non-
profit organizations on applied research projects and policy issues.
We are requesting funding for CCPR's Administrative, Development, and Scientific and Technical Cores.
These cores substantially increase the cost-effectiveness of NICHD and other NIH funding for a large portfolio
of CCPR research projects. The research opportunities and services these Cores provide also enhance the
productivity, quality, and impact of CCPR Fellows' research and are prioritized for early-stage researchers."

Kidney stones are a major cause of morbidity and account for $11 billion in health care spending in the U.S.
Low urine citrate and high urine oxalate both increase risk of stone formation. Mechanisms that regulate renal
citrate and oxalate excretion affect kidney stone risk. Physicians use knowledge of mechanisms for stone
prevention (e.g. potassium citrate to raise urine citrate, low oxalate diet to lower urine oxalate). The overall
objective of this proposal is to expand our knowledge of mechanisms contributing to low urine citrate and high
urine oxalate. This will advance scientific knowledge and improve kidney stone prevention strategies. The
proposal will include study of mechanisms in two patient groups that are at high risk for kidney stones: obesity
and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Studying risk in these patient groups is important as obesity and
bariatric surgery rates are on the rise in the U.S. This study will test the effect of diet on the association
between higher urine oxalate and higher urine citrate in non-kidney stone patients that is disrupted in kidney
stone patients. This will lead to future studies including testing the oxalate and citrate association under
conditions of alkalosis. This may change clinical practice with new strategies such as providing alkali
simultaneously with dietary oxalate to improve oxalate-citrate balance. It will also test the contribution of diet
and paracellular gastrointestinal oxalate absorption to high urine oxalate in obese and RYGB kidney stone
patients. This will lead to improved clinical care by focusing providers on higher yield strategies. Future studies
will test these strategies. Furthermore, this study and support from the K23, will be vital to my career
development. I will learn how to apply epidemiologic data to clinical research center (CRC) based human
studies to investigate mechanisms responsible for the epidemiologic findings. I will learn how to design,
implement, and conduct such studies, how to recruit and retain patients, and how to analyze repeated
measures data. I will learn about management of kidney stone patients and high risk obese and bariatric
surgery patients from a patient-centered perspective. I am in a rich research environment at the University of
Chicago. I have developed a strong mentorship team with world experts in human based studies of kidney
stone physiology and CRC study design and implementation. My advisory team includes world leaders in basic
science, translational, and human studies related to citrate and oxalate and an expert in bariatric surgery. This
team will support my scientific and professional development. At the end of the K23 award, I will be prepared to
use the data collected to apply for an R01 in a follow up intervention study that I will lead as an independent
investigator. My future studies will build on the data and skills I learned from this study. Therefore, through the
research experience, training, and mentorship from this award, I will become a leader in kidney stones
research and clinical management, including obese and bariatric surgery patients, with the ultimate goal to
improve patient care."
10836461,"Work in the last decade from many labs has underlined the critical importance of RNA-mediated cellular
pathways, and clear connections of specific RNAs to human health. RNAs are increasingly viewed both as
appealing therapeutic targets, and as therapeutic agents themselves. We hypothesize that obtaining a
deeper and broader understanding about how ligands interact with the many RNA species of the cell will
provide important new insights into RNA networks and functions, provide new understanding of how current
drugs cause cellular toxicity, and lend novel insights into improving RNA therapies. We are convinced that the
analysis of RNA interactions transcriptome-wide is essential to future biomedicine. Unfortunately, methods for
assessing RNA interactions directly in the cell lag well behind those for protein and proteome analysis.
 Recent work from this laboratory has established numerous new molecular tools for analysis of
biologically and clinically relevant RNAs. We developed the first high-yield reaction strategy for functionalizing
RNA 2'-OH groups, establishing broad utility of acylimidazole reagents. We designed the cell-permeable and
broadly used structure-mapping reagents NAI and NAI-N3 - now commercially available - and applying them
with RNA Seq, we mapped folded structures of 16000 mRNAs in mammalian cells. We developed rapid and
simple chemical approaches for functionalizing RNA with fluorescent labels, biotin, hydrophobic groups,
crosslinkers, and caging groups. Further, we designed strategies for labeling RNA either broadly or at specific
sites. Unlike recent enzymatic approaches for RNA labeling, our methods require no engineered structure or
sequence, and thus can be employed rapidly and easily with native RNAs of any origin or length.
 The proposed project will consolidate our RNA work into a broad program that will develop a new set of
RNA-reactive reagents and methods, and will apply them to provide specific, quantitative information about
ligand interactions with the transcriptome. We will develop first-in-class methods for functionalizing native
RNAs at specific sites, and novel strategies for controlling RNAs with red light. Combining our reactive acyl
tools and methods with next-gen sequencing, we will pinpoint and quantify ligand binding sites in the whole
transcriptome. These methodologies, together termed Reactivity-Based RNA Profiling (RBRP), will be
applied to analyzing off-target RNA binding by known small-molecule drugs with clinically limiting toxicity, to
profiling RNA interactions of endogenous secondary metabolites, and to the analysis of how modified bases
in next-generation mRNA vaccines and therapeutics affect their structures and interactions in the cell. This
work is significant because it seeks answers to system-wide clinically-relevant questions regarding RNA
interactions. Further, it develops the 2'-OH group as a nearly universal handle for manipulation, conjugation,
and study of RNAs, introducing enabling molecular technologies that will broadly benefit researchers in the
fields of RNA biology and contribute to improving future RNA therapies."

Overall
The epidemiology of malaria in Southeast Asia (SEA) is multifaceted and rapidly evolving, marked by immense
spatial heterogeneity in disease distribution across different regions and countries. As SEA countries strive to
eliminate malaria, they encounter unique challenges, including the transition from P. falciparum to P. vivax and
persistent malaria-endemic areas that are remote and exhibit rich ecological diversity. Additionally, the
emergence and rapid spread of human P. knowlesi infections in Malaysia and Thailand are serious concerns
that necessitate integration into the elimination program. This new iteration of the International Centers of
Excellence for Malaria Research (ICEMR) program builds on the groundbreaking scientific discoveries of its
predecessors (ICEMR 1&2), which has fostered international collaborations among researchers from academic
institutions in Thailand, Malaysia, Japan, and the United States. The program's primary aim is to comprehend
the intricate interplay between malaria epidemiology and vector biology in SEA, with a particular emphasis on
the dynamics of human and zoonotic malaria transmission, to inform strategies for malaria elimination. To
achieve this, research sites across Thailand and Malaysia have been meticulously selected to encompass
diverse landscapes and malaria transmission patterns. The research program consists of two interdependent
projects, with Project 1 probing the epidemiology of malaria in Thailand and Malaysia, and Project 2 scrutinizing
the impact of vector biology on the transmission dynamics of both human and zoonotic malaria in these countries.
By analyzing malaria parasite distribution and transmission dynamics in human populations, Project 1 seeks to
glean insights into disease heterogeneity, clinical outcomes, and to identify new antigens for improved diagnostic
tests. Project 2 seeks to improve our understanding of the vectorial system and its role in malaria transmission
in SEA, by examining vector community structure, population genetics, vector-parasite interactions, and vector
control tools related to human and zoonotic malaria. Both projects will be executed concurrently at selected study
sites across two countries in SEA (Thailand and Malaysia), focusing on border regions where active malaria
transmission is ongoing. The program's multidisciplinary approach, which blends epidemiology, vector biology,
and advanced diagnostic tools, aims to devise integrated control strategies tailored to SEA's distinctive
challenges. The outcomes of this program will inform policy decisions related to malaria control and elimination,
ultimately contributing to efforts to reduce the burden of this disease in the region."
10934366,"ALS is a lethal neurodegenerative disease accelerated by neuroinflammation. Current FDA-approved
therapies have modest benefits and do not address inflammation. To address this, RAPA Therapeutics, LLC
(RAPA) has developed an autologous T cell therapy (RAPA-501) that reduces inflammation, with the goal of
reducing ALS morbidity and mortality. RAPA-501 are manufactured ex vivo to attain dual TREG/Th2 anti-
inflammatory activity and a T-stem phenotype that permits T cell therapy without conditioning chemotherapy. In
an ongoing clinical trial of RAPA-501 in people with ALS (pwALS) (NCT04220190), RAPA-501 cells were found
to be safe (no product-related adverse events), biologically active (diverse anti-inflammatory effects in pwALS),
and showed early trends toward stabilizing pulmonary function decline. A phase 2/3 expansion cohort was added
to the trial to assess whether RAPA-501 is efficacious in standard-risk pwALS.
 We will extend RAPA-501 therapy to pwALS not eligible for this ongoing phase 2/3 trial or other ALS trials,
which nearly universally require that participants have a slow vital capacity (SVC) value of ≥50% of predicted
normal. The proposed EAP will enroll pwALS who have SVC values <50%. This population of pwALS is
considered “high risk” (~50% chance of respiratory failure or death within 180 days) and thus particularly suitable
for experimental immune therapies such as RAPA-501. In addition, the RAPA-501-EAP will not exclude pwALS
who have a prolonged time from ALS-related symptoms or low ALSFRS-R scores. Participants will receive four
RAPA-501 IV infusions (every 42-days at established safe dose, 80 x 106 cells/infusion). This RAPA-501-EAP
will further evaluate the safety of this therapy, expand an understanding of the RAPA-501 therapeutic mechanism
of action, and evaluate signals of efficacy in this real-world population of pwALS using standard methods and
Origent Data Sciences machine learning ALS prediction algorithms.
 The RAPA-501 EAP will be led by investigators at Mass General Hospital (MGH; Drs. Berry, Babu, and
Paganoni) and sponsored by RAPA, which is responsible for RAPA-501 manufacturing and FDA regulatory
filings under existing IND 019480 (Dr. Fowler, Sponsor). Clinical trial site investigators have experience with
RAPA-501 therapy (MGH; Hackensack University Medical Center; and Mayo Clinic Arizona) or other cells
therapies. Sites are geographically diverse and likely to accrue a significant number of underserved pwALS (U
of Iowa; U of Idaho; Providence Hospital, Portland, Oregon; UC-Irvine; Columbia, NYC). In addition, several
research collaborations will emanate from the intensive study of the clinically-annotated, valuable research
samples obtained from the RAPA-501 EAP."

10837195,"OVERALL SUMMARY

India, the world's largest democracy and soon-to-be most populous country, has shown a sustained decline in malaria cases over the past decade. However, malaria remains an enormous public health problem, and India faces several challenges in its elimination drive. Infections in India can be caused by all four species of human malaria parasite and transmitted by at least six different Anopheles vectors. Several important barriers to elimination have recently come to light, including persistent malaria parasite transmission in areas of intense elimination efforts, inadequacy of PfHRP2-based RDTs, and cryptic reservoirs of transmission. “Hidden Plasmodium infections: reservoirs, impact, and biomarker discovery”, is the main theme of the CSCM in this application. The overall goals of the Center are to develop the knowledge, tools, and evidence-based strategies needed to support Indian intervention and control programs, and to build research capacity in India. The CSCMi research proposed in this application comprises two projects: Project 1: Monitoring the changing epidemiology of malaria in Odisha, India, will comprise of a four-year community-based cohort in three districts of differing endemicity to investigate factors supporting persistent malaria transmission. This will include the analysis of malaria parasite diagnostic failure, complemented by a passive surveillance of patients with febrile illnesses presenting at district healthcare centers, the assessment of Pfhrp2/Pfhrp3 gene deletions, the monitoring of historically low prevalence parasite species, as well as the assessment of Anopheles vector species composition, density, and resistance to insecticide. Project 2: Developing new diagnostic tools for the detection of Plasmodium infection will leverage a prospective cohort sub-study nested within Project 1 to the focus on the characterization of local malaria parasite transmission patterns through sero-epidemiology and the detection of anti-Plasmodium antibodies, as well evaluating new circulating host- and parasite-derived biomarkers of infection. The CSCMi projects will be supported by an Administrative Core and Data Management and Biostatistics Core, and advised by a team of other significant contributors and a Scientific Advisory Group."

Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium’s (ANTHC) vision is that Alaska Native people are the healthiest
people in the world. Alaska is homeland to an estimated 151,405 Alaska Native people who belong to
culturally distinct communities in rural and urban areas of the state.8 Similar to the rest of the United
States, the health and wellbeing of Alaska’s Indigenous peoples is linked to its colonial past, and health
disparities regarding substance use, overdose and mental health mirror national statistics. In 2022,
Alaska Native people experienced the highest rate of fatal drug overdose in Alaska with 78.2 deaths per
100,000.9 This is a sharp increase from 36 per 100,000 in 2020.10 Despite having suffered a number of
traumatic events throughout Alaska’s history of colonization and contemporary substance use, overdose
and mental health disparities, Alaska Native people continue to be extremely resilient and connected to
their strong cultures through fishing, hunting, harvesting, singing, dancing, speaking Native languages,
and practicing oral traditions.14-17 A growing body of evidence suggests that Indigenous-based healing
approaches are successful in addressing the impacts of historical and community traumas.18,19 The
proposed project entitled Heal(th) From Within: A Research Collaborative to Share our Journeys to
Wellness plans to look into this further.
The proposed goal is to ANTHC’s research capacity and infrastructure in the areas of substance use,
overdose and mental health. While ANTHC has a 65-year record of successfully conducting health
research to improve the health and wellness of Alaska Native people, there is a lack of research in these
specific focus areas. The outcome is to decolonize and indigenize the way we collectively address
substance use, overdose, mental health and pain through culturally appropriate health research. To
meet the intended goal and outcome the proposed Heal(th) From Within project aims are:
Specific Aim 1. Expand research expertise, knowledge and skills to engage in culturally-based health
research to address overdose, substance use and mental health among AN people.
Specific Aim 2. Build a network for collaboration with tribal and community partners who are engaged
in substance use prevention and treatment as well as mental health efforts.
Specific Aim 3. Assess local and culturally grounded approaches and strategies that show promise in
addressing substance use, overdose and mental health in partnership with AN tribes and communities.
Completion of this first phase of the proposed project will provide the foundation for moving forward
with conducting culturally-based intervention research to develop evidence-based approaches that will
alleviate disparities in substance use, overdose and mental health among AN people and communities
during Phase II of the N CREW Program.

10977023,"Summary. Historically marginalized U.S. communities have inequitably high risks of experiencing climate-
induced health impacts. The primary care safety net community health centers (CHCs) serving these
populations are uniquely positioned to prepare for and mitigate these impacts, as CHCs are trusted, culturally
competent care providers in their communities and have expertise in reducing health disparities. To intervene
successfully, CHCs need to be equipped with evidence on: (1) how extreme climate events impact health
outcomes in CHC populations (which differ substantially from those in other care settings); and (2) what
interventions CHCs can enact to effectively prepare for and mitigate these impacts. The Community Catalyst
(Community Climate health equity research center) CCHRC will provide this evidence and the proposed
planning process will prepare the CCHRC to do so as follows. Our Administrative Core will assemble a
transdisciplinary team of experts in climate and health, health equity, social risks and related interventions,
intervention development and implementation / dissemination, health policy, community-engaged research,
and primary care in CHCs. The Administrative Core will also create the data infrastructure needed to study
climate-induced health impacts in CHC populations by linking existing, robust, geocoded research-ready
electronic health record data from the OCHIN Practice-based Research Network (>1,700 CHC clinic sites in 36
states) with existing granular data on extreme heat events and air quality created by Harvard’s Confluence
Project. Our Research Program Core will use this dataset in novel analyses to identify how extreme heat and
poor air quality impact hypertension and asthma incidence and exacerbation in CHC patients, and the effect
modifiers of these impacts. Our Community Engagement Core will convene a learning community of
researchers and diverse representatives from CHCs (leaders, staff, patients) and other relevant community-
based organizations (e.g., public health departments, environmental non-profits). In a multidirectional, iterative
process, this CCHRC learning community will identify: (1) interventions that have potential to mitigate patterns
of climate-induced health impacts in CHC populations, and (2) the research needed to generate evidence on
such interventions’ effectiveness. The CCHRC will then be prepared to immediately begin conducting research
that is led by community-researcher partnerships and designed to address community-identified evidence
needs on how CHCs can prepare for and mitigate climate-induced health impacts in their populations."

Cancer cells require the proteins encoded by certain genes in order to proliferate. These “genetic dependencies”
are promising targets for therapeutic intervention, as drugs that block the function of a dependency can induce
apoptosis and durable tumor regression. The discovery and characterization of genetic dependencies and the
drugs that can inhibit them are key goals of preclinical cancer research.
My laboratory has investigated multiple putative genetic dependencies using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis. We
have found that verified mutagenesis of many cancer drug targets fails to recapitulate published results obtained
when these genes were knocked down with RNAi. Moreover, we find that multiple “targeted inhibitors” currently
in clinical trials continue to kill cancer cells harboring CRISPR-induced null mutations in their reported targets,
demonstrating pervasive off-target cell killing among clinical inhibitors. These results – coupled with the
observation that 97% of drug-indication pairs that enter clinical trials in oncology fail to receive FDA approval -
suggest the existence of fundamental shortcomings in how cancer genetic dependencies are identified and
studied. In this work, we will develop a robust, preclinical target validation pipeline to characterize both the
consequences of loss-of-function alterations in potential drug targets and to validate on-target activity of putative
clinical inhibitors. In particular, we will select genes that are reported to be cancer dependencies and that are
targeted by small-molecule inhibitors, and we will study the cellular consequences of their deletion or inhibition
(Aim 1). Next, we will use cells harboring CRISPR-induced knockouts of these putative drug targets to investigate
the chemical inhibitors that had been used to target them (Aim 2). If these reagents continue to kill cells that
totally lack their reported targets, then this would indicate that they induce cell death through an off-target
mechanism. Then, we will deploy both spontaneous- and CRISPR-directed mutagenesis in order to generate
mutations that confer resistance to these small-molecule inhibitors, thereby helping to identify their true cellular
targets (Aim 3). Finally, by isolating drug-resistance mutations, we have discovered that one mischaracterized
anti-cancer drug is in fact the first potent and specific inhibitor of the CDK11B kinase to be described. Using this
knowledge, we will seek to identify biomarkers that can predict therapeutic responses to this drug (Aim 4). In
total, these experiments will delineate a robust preclinical pipeline for target validation, shed light on the genetic
architecture that underlies cancer-essential genes, and allow drug re-purposing studies of multiple clinical
inhibitors by uncovering their true targets."
10977310,"The prognosis of HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) treated with standard radiation at 70 Gy is excellent.
However, 80% of these patients experience grade ≥2 mucositis and 30% have permanent swallowing
dysfunction. Clinical data suggest that 70 Gy may be overtreatment for some HPV+ OPCs. A modest
reduction of 10-16 Gy for an unselected cohort with HPV+ OPC showed a 2-year progression-free survival
(PFS) of 80%, but 40% of patients still had difficulty swallowing at 1 year. The proposed research will employ
imaging (PET/MRI) biomarkers to identify patients with HPV+ OPC who may benefit from a major dose
reduction to 30 Gy, a dose based on experience in HPV+ anal cancer, with the goal of maintaining tumor
control and cure while substantially reducing treatment-related toxicity. A pilot trial of 19 HPV+ OPC patients
treated at 30 Gy followed by neck dissection was encouraging, with a 2-year PFS of 93%. Significant toxicity
reduction was observed. The proposed research will expand on the initial findings of the proof- of-principle
study to a larger cohort of patients. The proposed imaging metrics to select patients for major dose de-
escalation will include baseline and early intra-treatment [18F]-FMISO PET imaging, which will provide
information on tumor hypoxia, a marker of radioresistance (Aim 1). Eligible patients will have no evidence of
hypoxia on baseline imaging or have resolution of hypoxia during treatment, which will portend tumor
radiosensitivity. We will interrogate the tumor microenvironment (Aim 2) by deriving quantitative imaging
biomarkers (QIBs) from multi-parametric diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) consisting of non-Gaussian
intravoxel incoherent motion (NG-IVIM) as well as [18F]-FMISO) PET imaging to select appropriate 30 Gy
candidates to avoid neck dissection, with the goal of further toxicity reduction. The change in intra-
treatment diffusion (D, surrogate of tumor cellularity) and kurtosis (K, surrogate of tissue microstructure) from
baseline DW-MRI will guide which patients de-escalated to 30 Gy can avoid neck dissection. HPV is known to
dysregulate the DNA damage response (DDR) and double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways to facilitate
viral replication. Preclinical work suggests that this dysregulation accounts for the radiosensitivity of HPV+
OPC, although there are conflicting data regarding the precise nature of the responsible defect. For Aim 3,
whole-genome sequencing (WGS) with mutational signature analyses will be used to identify DDR and
DSB repair defects in individual HPV tumors and characterize the clinical influence on radiosensitivity. The
relationship between genomic signatures and non-invasive imaging of tumor hypoxia and tumor cellularity that
portend radiobiological sensitivity also will be explored. The proposal's central hypothesis is that PET/MRI of
HPV+ OPC classification with the underpinnings of a molecular characterization of the cancer biology will
yield a robust decision tool to stratify patients for whom dose de-escalation to 30 Gy will provide a
clinical benefit and significantly reduced toxicity, without compromising treatment outcome."

 The broad objective of this proposal is to understand the mechanism of homologous recombination and its
relationship to chromosome maintenance in both Bacteria and Eukarya. Our approach is to reconstitute
increasingly more complex reactions that recapitulate the steps of the homologous recombination process,
using purified proteins from Escherichia coli and from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and to use sophisticated
biochemical and biophysical methods of analysis. In particular, we will use single-molecule visualization to
image key steps and intermediates of these complex biological processes. We have developed new
experimental strategies for studying protein-DNA interactions at the single-molecule level. We devised several
approaches wherein we can easily manipulate an individual DNA molecule and expose it to a variety of
different proteins, enzymes, and buffers. Using fluorescent detection, we can image individual proteins on DNA
or detect their action on individual DNA molecules, typically in real-time. We propose to continue to use these
approaches to study unresolved aspects of recombinational DNA repair and its interface with the important
biological processes of chromatin remodeling and DNA replication. We seek to continue to address unresolved
questions regarding the dynamic behavior of RecA/Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments and their regulation by
protein mediators and modulators; the mechanism by which RecA and Rad51 find DNA sequence homology;
the reconstitution increasingly more complex recombination processes using purified proteins; the mechanism
and function of DNA helicases and their partner proteins; and understanding the mechanism of DNA
transactions that intersect with recombination, namely, chromatin remodeling and DNA replication."

This proposal is requesting continued support for the renewal of the NIH funded T32 ""Graduate
Training Program in Magnetic Resonance Imaging"" (TPMRI), which was established in 2019 and
provides funding to support five predoctoral PhD students in Radiology and Biomedical Engineer
(BME) at Northwestern University.
The TPMRI program is multi-disciplinary in nature, covering complementary imaging science
topics for broad training in translational Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) projects. The
objective is for students to obtain in-depth understanding of MRI physics and engineering
principles and clinical applications based on participation in innovative MR research with a specific
emphasis on PhD-MD interactions to facilitate informed clinical translational research. The TPMRI
program is committed to developing proficient scientists who have the full range of professional
skills required for success along any of the numerous career paths that PhD scientists follow. The
TPMRI program elements have continuously evolved in response to changes in relevant scientific
and technical knowledge, educational practices, and evaluation of the training program. Training
elements included written and oral communication, grantsmanship, responsible conduct in
research (RCR), experimental rigor and reproducibility (R&R), and networking and career
development. We seek to instill in trainees a clear understanding of what constitutes responsible
and professional scientific conduct, and to make trainees aware of ethical issues, particularly
those most relevant to translational diagnostic imaging. Finally, the MRI training program strives
to increase participation in biomedical research by female trainees and train qualified students
from underrepresented groups (URGs).
During the past 4 years, 11 predoctoral PhD BME students have been appointed to the TPMRI
program, with excellent representation of female trainees (80%) and 2 female trainees from
underrepresented groups. The TPMRI trainees have excellent productivity (52 original papers, 17
first-author papers), 7 of 11 PhD students (64%) have been or will be awarded subsequent NIH
F-type fellowship or K-type training grants, and graduates have successfully transitioned to
physician/scientist or academic clinical research positions. The established interdisciplinary
medical imaging research and access to state-of the-art imaging equipment at Northwestern
provide a prime opportunity to continue to train predoctoral BME students. Our goal is to build on
the successes of the TPMRI to achieve an even higher level of integration of interdisciplinary and
clinical translational research in medical imaging."
10842609,"Project Summary
The research of the Sun group can be divided into two directions. In the first direction, the Sun group
focuses on the development of novel capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS)
techniques to advance bottom-up proteomics (BUP, peptide-centric), top-down proteomics (TDP,
proteoform-centric), and native proteomics (protein complex-centric) towards complete proteome
coverage of human cells with single-cell resolution. CE-MS is a powerful analytical tool for the highly
sensitive characterization of peptides, proteoforms, and protein complexes in complex biological
samples. In the second direction, the Sun group is applying the CE-MS techniques to developmental
biology and cancer biology. For developmental biology, we are pursuing a better understanding of the
roles played by specific proteins, proteoforms, and protein complexes in modulating the important
events during early vertebrate embryogenesis (i.e., early cellular differentiation and zygotic genome
activation (ZGA)). For cancer biology, we aim to discover new proteoform biomarkers of colorectal
cancer (CRC) metastasis by quantitative TDP studies of CRC cell lines and tumors.
In this MIRA application, the Sun group will advance CE-MS-based TDP techniques to achieve the
first draft of the proteoform atlas of a human cancer cell line (i.e., HeLa cells) and enable TDP
measurement of a few even single human cells. The Sun group will also apply the novel techniques
to developmental biology to discover crucial proteoforms that modulate early cellular differentiation
and ZGA during early vertebrate embryogenesis via quantitative TDP studies of zebrafish embryos
and blastomeres. The proteoform atlas of HeLa cells will contain at least one intact proteoform per
protein-coding gene, and it will be an extremely valuable resource for fundamental and translational
research. The generation of the first proteoform atlas of human cells will be a pivotal step toward the
“Human Proteoform Project”. The novel CE-MS techniques will play crucial roles in advancing TDP
toward the comprehensive characterization of proteoforms in various biological systems. The TDP
studies of zebrafish embryos and blastomeres will provide new insights into the roles played by
specific proteoforms in modulating early cellular differentiation and ZGA. The single-cell TDP
technique can be applied to various biological fields, e.g., cancer biology, developmental biology, and
neuroscience, to better our understanding of cell-to-cell heterogeneity."

My research program addresses fundamental questions about population-scale infectious disease dynamics and
brings to light the role of social factors in these dynamics. The impact that carefully formulated and extensively
validated models can have in predicting spatio-temporal disease dynamics and providing a rational assessment
of alternative intervention strategies is understood by policymakers and clinical practitioners alike. However, as
the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated, continuing to neglect socio-behavioral processes presents a critical
barrier to future model development: behavioral surveillance gaps jeopardize our ability to predict pathogen
emergence; a poor understanding of the feedback loops between behavior and disease hampers the forecasting of
disease dynamics; and a limited appreciation of the nonlinear impacts of anti-mitigation behavior reduces hope of
eliminating diseases before they take hold. At the same time, public health inequities fueled by income inequality
and systemic racism pose a dire and urgent threat.
To address these pressing gaps, my research team uses a multi-scale socio-behavioral disease modeling approach
to integrate interacting elements of health, physical and socially-constructed environments, and community and
individual behavior to predict social and spatial heterogeneities in respiratory disease burden. We develop
generative and inferential models for a systematic understanding of the constant, compounding socio-behavioral
processes that give rise to disease heterogeneities across individuals, communities, and systems. We also leverage
opportunistic datasets to characterize behavior and disease across geography and time to resolve questions that
have eluded explanation without socio-behavioral data.
Our future work will advance the theory of respiratory disease dynamics with a focus on two case studies, SARS-
CoV-2 and influenza, in the United States. The work will make significant contributions to our understanding
of respiratory virus epidemiology, seasonality, spatial epidemiology, health inequities, and public health policy
and will spur innovation for integrating large data streams into infectious disease models. These advances will
generalize to improve our understanding of other respiratory, partially immunizing viruses that cause epidemics
or pandemics. Our focus on the US public health system also serves as a crucial case study to characterize the
consequences of intense variation across social, environmental, economic, and demographic dimensions and inform
the impact of heterogeneity on data collection, model complexity, disease outcomes, and management strategies.
Our work has broad implications at a time when heterogeneities will be amplified by future perturbations, including
emerging diseases, climate change, and sociopolitical unrest. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the causes
of epidemiological heterogeneity across space, time, and the landscape of vulnerability will help inform resource
allocation, design outbreak intervention, optimize disease surveillance, strengthen health systems, and improve
access to healthcare."

Our research aims to comprehensively understand the molecular mechanisms and functions of RNA splicing in
regulating cellular phenotypes. RNA splicing is a critical process that removes introns from pre-mRNA and is
essential to gene regulation and transcriptome diversity. In humans, introns constitute approximately one-fourth
of the whole genome, representing a vast expansion compared to lower eukaryotes and other mammals. Long
introns contain a high number of pseudo splice sites that closely resemble those of coding exons. Misuse of
pseudo splice sites gives rise to cryptic splicing, which leads to the erroneous insertion of intronic elements into
mRNA. Consequently, cryptic splicing results in disruption of transcriptome integrity and is associated with
numerous pathologies including neuronal degeneration and cancer. Our proposed work aims to build on our
recent discoveries in investigating the regulatory mechanisms of cryptic splicing and its consequences. We
recently conducted a survey of RNA binding protein (RBP) interactions with introns and identified a group of
RBPs, including heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M (hnRNPM), whose binding is highly enriched in
introns. We found that depletion of hnRNPM by shRNA causes over a thousand cryptic splicing events,
suggesting that hnRNPM is a crucial repressor of cryptic splicing. Our bioinformatics analysis shows that
hnRNPM binding is enriched in regions that contain repetitive sequences. It further predicts that hnRNPM-
repressed cryptic splicing products can be targets of nonsense-mediated decay or templates to generate
truncated proteins. The cryptic splicing products also have the potential to form double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs)
that trigger an interferon response, leading to significant increases in the expression of interferon-stimulated
genes. Building on these findings, we will first comprehensively investigate the underlying mechanisms by which
RBPs repress cryptic splicing to maintain transcriptome integrity. We will investigate the role of RBPs that
preferentially bind to introns, including hnRNPM interaction partners, in repressing cryptic splicing. We will also
delineate the nature of interactions between these RBPs and hnRNPM. Furthermore, we will determine the
molecular details of how loss of hnRNPM affects spliceosome factor binding at pseudo splice sites, resulting in
cryptic splicing. Second, we will investigate the fate of cryptic splicing transcripts by experimentally characterizing
them at both the mRNA and protein levels and evaluating their impact on cellular activities. Given our finding
that hnRNPM depletion leads to a dsRNA-dependent upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes, we plan to
further investigate the pathways mediating the crosstalk between dsRNA of cryptic transcripts and upregulation
of interferon-stimulated genes and their impact on cell fitness. Successful completion of these studies will shed
light on the regulatory mechanisms for cryptic splicing suppression and how failure to control cryptic splicing
impacts cellular behavior. With the centrality of cryptic splicing to disease states, the fundamental insights
learned from this research may pave the way for novel therapeutic interventions."

A significant shift is underway in many fields of biomedical research that are rapidly adopting
microphysiological systems, also known as tissue chips. Microphysiological systems are being
used by biomedical scientists for drug and toxicity testing, disease modeling, and to answer
fundamental questions about cell-cell interactions in complex, but tightly controlled
environments that can be parallelized for high throughput studies, often with high-resolution
microscopy and other real-time readouts. In some studies, induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs) allow patient-specific models of drug testing, offering physiological relevance that
cannot be matched by any animal model.
A central component of nearly all microphysiological systems is the semi-permeable synthetic
membrane that facilities co-culture or establishment of a tissue barrier model. This membrane
serves to compartmentalize cells or microenvironments while also selectively allowing some
species and even cells to transit or transmigrate, typically based simply on a pore size cut-off.
While pore size is important for controlling communication between compartments or opposing
sides of a barrier model, the membrane also serves as a support scaffold and culture substrate
of nearly all cells involved in the system. The overall vision of this MIRA research program is to
answer key questions in two interrelated domains: Improve the Understanding of Biological
Mechanisms of Cell-Substrate Interactions on Porous Materials, and Advance Ultrathin
Membrane Development and Engineer the Ideal Membrane for Physiologically Relevant Tissue
Barrier and Co-Culture Models. For the next five years, this research program is focused on
building upon my laboratory’s expertise in cell-substrate interactions and materials engineering,
and evolving from biophysically focused analysis to understanding the molecular and signaling
pathways that are likely driving cellular behaviors with the goal of engineering advanced
membranes for more physiologically relevant tissue barrier models. Additionally, my laboratory
seeks to move toward an understanding of the dynamics and equilibrium of cell-substrate
interactions, particularly in the context of the transition between healthy and disease states in
these microphysiological systems."

 Interactions between proteins and DNA control several fundamental biological
processes, including gene regulation, DNA repair, replication, transcription, translation,
and recombination. The PI’s previous research in instrument design, biological mass
spectrometry, ion mobility spectrometry, and structural biology have enabled the study of
the intra- and inter- molecular interactions and conformational landscape that drive
protein, DNA, protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions in several model systems. The
goal of this project is to advance mass spectrometry (MS) based techniques with
complementary structural tools to better describe biomolecular complexes in their native
solution environment. Coupling solution- and gas- phase separations (e.g., accessible
solvent area labeling, ion-neutral reactions, and trapped ion mobility spectrometry), new
dissociation methods (e.g., electron- and UV- based methods) with new developments in
ultra-high, resolution MS will provide new structural biology tools capable of dissecting
the molecular complexity and energy landscape of protein isoforms and protein-DNA
complexes. These advanced MS tools will be used for the characterization of model
systems of the non-histone chromosomal HMG protein family (e.g., high mobility group
AT-hook 2 protein-HMGA2), type IA topoisomerase (TOP1) family and nucleosome
dynamics (e.g., interplay of histone composition and histone post-translational
modifications, PTMs). We will study HMGA2 transitions from unstructured to structured
that allow HMGA2 to be involved in multiple biological processes, including DNA
replication, translation, recombination, and gene regulation. We will capture the structural
intermediates of the TOP1-DNA complexes associated with the catalytic cycle to search
for new antibiotic candidates. We will study the influence of histone variants and PTMs
in the nucleosome dynamics (e.g., partial, and full assemble); nucleosome dissociation
and alteration of nucleosomal structure are crucial features by which chromatin regulates
gene expression and DNA replication. The development of MS-based technologies
capable of studying intrinsically disordered and dynamic biomolecular systems will
significantly advance our understanding of the biological machinery associated with
disease mechanisms, identification of therapeutic targets and disease prevention."

My lab develops and applies statistical models to make sense of genomic and biomedical data with the ultimate goal
of understanding the biological basis of diseases and improving human health. The dramatic decrease in the cost
of DNA sequencing has led to the emergence of datasets of genetic variation across large numbers of individuals
(sample sizes upwards of hundreds of thousands). This genetic data is paired with deep phenotypic and disease
information. While o ering the potential to answer important questions in biology and medicine, these complex
and massive datasets present formidable challenges of statistical modeling and inference. Extracting meaningful
insights from these datasets needs expressive and scalable statistical and computational methods. Our recent work
has focused on understanding evolutionary processes that shape genetic variation within homogeneous and admixed
populations and in understanding how genetic variation modulates variation in complex traits and disease risk. A
major discovery from our work is our nding that west African populations derive substantial genetic ancestry from
an unidenti ed ghost archaic population that was enabled, in turn, by new statistical methods that we developed
to infer local ancestry in admixed populations in the challenging setting where reference genomes for ancestral
populations are unavailable. Work from my lab has also led to statistical inference algorithms that are capable of
analyzing millions of genomes to provide new insights into both evolutionary processes and genetic architecture of
complex traits.
We now propose to substantively expand our research applying statistical machine learning to population and
quantitative genetics with the aim of understanding the interplay between evolution, genes and traits. We will
develop algorithms to uncover complex evolutionary histories from genome sequence data in the presence of
admixture, expressive and scalable models to infer the genetic architecture of complex traits within homogeneous
and admixed populations, and methods for deep learning-based phenotype imputation that deal with the high-
rates of missingness in biomedical datasets. Taken together, our e orts will provide powerful analytical tools to
e ectively probe the structure and function of the human genome."

Stroke - like many brain diseases - is clearly associated with aging and a plethora of age-related co-morbid
conditions, including cognitive decline, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), AD related dementias, multi-infarct dementia,
cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, immune suppression,
metabolic syndrome and obesity, sleep deprivation, and depression. However, age-related co-morbid conditions,
as a variable in stroke occurrence, severity and long-term recovery is seldom studied experimentally, but is one
of the identified factors in the lack of progress in the discovery of new therapies for acute stroke brain damage.
To optimize the impact of our research on the discovery of new preventatives, acute treatments and rehabilitation
methods for stroke, we need to train the next generation of stroke researchers to assess stroke in the context of
the affected patent population: those who are elderly and have multiple co-morbid conditions. The Stroke and
Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias Predoctoral Training Program will formalize and standardize our already
strong training programs in the biomedical sciences and focus on stroke research. A number of innovative
aspects of this training program are semester-long didactic courses in “Stroke” and the “Neurobiology of Aging”,
a clinical immersion in our WVU Stroke Center, a in Stroke Journal Club, an Associate Scholars Program, and
experience in community engagement. The proposed training program will select the best PhD students from
the participating Biomedical Sciences Training programs at the West Virginia University (WVU) Health Science
Center (WVU HSC) and will prepare them with the skills, knowledge and acumen needed for a successful career
in stroke research. The specific training for each of 8 mentee will be tailored based on their annually updated
Individualized Development Plan (IDP), and an “Exploring Career Paths” Program will help prepare them for their
chosen career. Program training is expected to last 2-to-3 years. This pre-doctoral training program will create a
new generation of young scholars who can address the need for innovative stroke research for the citizens of
West Virginia and the nation."

colleges and all of the major levels of research—cognitive, systems, cellular/molecular, and disease. The 48
Trainers selected from this community are highly collaborative and value interdisciplinary approaches to their
research. Our innovative Program trains the next generation of neuroscientists to bridge the gaps between the
major levels of LaMP research—cognitive, systems, cellular/molecular—in order to promote our understanding
of LaMP disorders and reduce their tremendous burden on families, society, and public health. This renewal
application for our 4-year-old program proposes to continue to support 6 advanced predoctoral Trainees per
year, a size essential for creating a group that crosses traditional disciplinary boundaries, spans levels of
analysis, and addresses both basic and translational research. Trainees from 8 participating graduate groups
will be eligible to apply to the LaMP Training Program in Years 2 and 3 of their graduate training. The 1-year
Training Program has 6 components. (1) Trainees will conduct research in at least one of the LaMP faculty
labs and will be co-mentored by another trainer from a distinct area of LaMP research. (2a) Trainees will be
exposed to the essential and emerging concepts in each of the fields of LaMP through a 2-quarter core course
consisting of interactive lectures as well as lab-based immersion to give trainees the tools to understand the
pros and cons of both the concepts and methods used at each level of analysis. Methods to enhance
reproducibility will be addressed in every session. (2b) Trainees will also be exposed to LaMP disorders
through a course consisting of didactic and interview/video sessions that span clinical, cognitive, systems and
molecular aspects of each disease. (3) Trainees will receive targeted career development training through a
weekly meeting with the Program Directors—emphasizing critical and cross-disciplinary thinking, presentation
skills, formal discussion of research-related careers outside of academia, and pressing issues in the field such
as data analysis, ethics, and reproducibility. (4) Trainees will receive extensive training in grant writing prior to
submission of their NRSA or equivalent. (5) Trainees and Trainers will participate in a monthly meeting to bring
the community together around networking opportunities within the NeuroCareer Pathways program as well as
invited experts in the field. (6) Trainees will participate in an annual program retreat and attend an invited
LaMP speaker series. Our Program also emphasizes participation in outreach and diversity, equity, and

10837815,"MERTK and AXL are members of the TAM (TYRO3, AXL, MERTK) family of receptor tyrosine kinases that are
aberrantly expressed in cancer cells where they function to promote cell survival. Both MERTK and AXL mediate
resistance to a variety of cytotoxic chemotherapies and molecularly-targeted agents and have additional roles in
macrophages, natural killer cells, and other innate immune cells where they function to suppress anti-tumor
immunity, leading to enhanced tumor growth and metastasis. These and other data implicate MERTK and AXL
as therapeutic targets in a wide variety of human tumors. Moreover, because of the oncogenic roles for MERTK
and AXL in both tumor and immune cells, inhibitors are expected to provide anti-tumor action mediated by both
direct tumor cell killing and modulation of the innate immune response. Numerous small molecule inhibitors and
antibodies targeting AXL or MERTK are in development, including several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that
are currently in clinical trials.
Despite robust initial responses, clinical efficacy of TKIs that target a single oncogenic driver has historically
been limited by development of resistance as a result of acquired mutations or activation of compensatory bypass
signaling. Closely-related proteins that share common downstream signaling pathways can often provide bypass
signaling and thereby mediate resistance. Indeed, MERTK mediates resistance to AXL inhibitors and vice versa,
suggesting that at least in some cases, dual inhibition of MERTK and AXL may be a more effective therapeutic
strategy than MERTK or AXL inhibition alone. Consistent with this hypothesis, MERTK and AXL inhibitors
mediate synergistic anti-tumor activity in a variety of epithelial cancers. Thus, the overlapping roles for MERTK
and AXL in tumor and immune cells, their roles in resistance to a variety of therapies, and their dual roles in
tumor cells and the innate immune system support development of agents that target both MERTK and AXL. To
date, INCB081776 is the only dual MERTK/AXL TKI described; however, the structure and selectivity of the
compound have not been publicly disclosed.
We have previously developed and optimized MERTK-selective TKIs. We hypothesize that in some cases a dual
MERTK and AXL inhibitor will be more effective for treatment of NSCLC and other cancers than agents targeting
MERTK or AXL alone. Here, we propose to utilize a novel computational methodology in combination with
enzymatic, cell-based and pharmacodynamic assays to develop novel, potent, and selective dual MERTK and
AXL inhibitors and validate their biochemical and functional activities in MERTK and AXL-dependent
subcutaneous and orthotopic NSCLC xenograft models and immune-competent syngeneic NSCLC models. At
the completion of this work, we expect to deliver a dual MERTK/AXL-selective inhibitor suitable for advancement
to GLP toxicity studies in multiple species, all of the preclinical validation studies to support an IND application

This R01 application will provide a multidisciplinary One Health approach to an imitation-based physical
activity intervention for adolescents with developmental disabilities and their family dog. The novel inter-
vention approach includes the use of the family dog in an established dog training protocol, focused on
physical activity and aimed at improving physical activity, quality of life and social wellbeing for children
with developmental disabilities. The study team has tested the feasibility of this program and their
preliminary findings have revealed phyiscal and social-emotional improvements in children with
developmental disabilities following this animal assisted intervention. There has been relativeily limited
research focused on the physical activity of adolescents with developmental disabilities and there re-
mains a critical need to develop strategies that will encourage an active lifestyle for adolescents with de-
velopmental disabilities. Animal assisted therapy has known positive impacts on morale and is also
known to reduce depressive psychological symptoms for children and adults. Yet, traditional ‘service
dogs’ are prohibitively expensive for many families. Dog ownership alone is known to improve health-
related physical activity. Thus, a critical need exists to create physical activity interventions that are easily
accessible and provide manageable home-based physical activity adherence, but that are less expensive
than traditional service dogs. To achieve these goals the investigators of this project have developed the
following specific aims: 1) To evaluate a novel imitation-based dog training program to promote physical
activity in children with developmental disabilities; 2) To evaluate the impact of participation in an
imitation-based dog-training program on the child’s quality of life, feelings of social wellbeing and the
child-dog relationship; 3) To evaluation the human-animal-interaction of the child and the family dog
based on participation in the program. The long term goal of this research is to improve the lives of
adolescents with developmental disabilities. This research supports the One Health initiative and brings
together aspects of improving health related to human and animal development."
10838554,"SUMMARY Aging in mammals is complex, with hallmarks including reduced propensity for stem cell self renewal,
deficiencies in DNA repair, reduced responses to growth stimulating hormones and nutrients, metabolic
disruption and increased susceptibilities to the onset of diseases. The origins of the deficits in self renewal, self
repair, and metabolic homeostasis are central questions in the aging field. Arguably, no single factor can be
identified that provides a causative effect. We have focused upon deficits in NAD+ metabolism as a potentially
pleiotropic effector leading to downstream dysfunctions in cellular, tissue and organism health. Processes such
as senescence, which can more readily arise from genetic factors such as defects in DNA repair genes (e.g.
Werner and Bloom Syndromes) present an interesting opportunity to further investigate the role of NAD+
deficiency, given that genetically altered fibroblasts are commercially accessible as potential tools in this regard.
We propose to generally characterize how aging affects NAD+ metabolism in progeroid cells, and in aged mice.
Specifically, we will characterize NAD+ biosynthetic potential as well as rates of NAD+ turnover. Moreover we
will assess how cells respond to pharmacologic interventions that increase NAD+ biosynthesis in order to
determine if these interventions mitigate age-dependent phenotypes in these fibroblast cells. These studies will
provide a deeper view of how NAD+ decline occurs in cells and tissues, and if some cells and tissues are more
susceptible to this decline than others and why. A second part of the application focuses on the discovery of a
novel NAD+ enhancer called dihydronicotinamide riboside (NRH), which can raise NAD+ concentrations from 3-
10 fold in mammalian cells. Preliminary data shows that NRH uses a novel mechanism of action,wherein it is
converted to NMNH, independent of the known kinases Nrk1 or Nrk2, leading to biosynthesis of NAD+. In mice
this compound increases NAD+ concentrations many-fold over control in most tissues. This application
investigates its mechanism of action in fibroblasts and in mice to elucidate a novel biosynthetic pathway to NAD+
with translational potential for treatment of disease. Thus, in the latter part of the application, we characterize
NRH effects in aged mice and ascertain if it can induce mitochondrial biogenesis. We provide studies to
characterize its effects using metabolomics approaches. Finally we test NRH to treat a model of metabolic
syndrome and to characterize the effect of age on disease and treatment outcomes. The objectives of the grant
are accomplished via 3 specific aims: 1. To characterize NAD+ homeostasis in cells and mice as a function of
age. 2. To elucidate effect and metabolic pathway of NRH in fibroblasts and mice. 3. To determine the effect of
NRH on aged mice in altering NAD+ metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis and mitigation of a model of metabolic
syndrome. The accomplishment of the objectives will provide new understanding of how NAD+ is a key factor in
aging and whether next generation NAD+ precursors can alter phenotypes that are hallmarks of aging."
10838508,"Abstract
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by pulmonary endothelial inflammation that leads
to alveolar edema and poor gas exchange. It has a high mortality, and effective treatment options to date are
limited. Acute kidney injury increases the mortality from ARDS and there is substantial evidence that kidney
injury can directly worsen the lung injury. The mechanisms underlying this kidney-lung interaction are not well
understood and could hold therapeutic potential. Following renal ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI), endogenous
stress molecules (DAMPs or damage associated molecular patterns) are released from dying renal tubular cells
and bind to pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) on neighboring cells, initiating an inflammatory cascade that
worsens renal injury. In preliminary data we have already seen that renal derived DAMPs cause upregulation of
inflammatory cytokines and MAPK activation in uninjured renal tubular epithelial cells. Expanding this model to
kidney-lung cross talk, human pulmonary endothelial cells exposed to renal tubule-derived DAMPs were found
to upregulate inflammatory cytokines and specific PRRs. These preliminary data also revealed that NOD2, a
PRR known to play a key role in acute kidney injury, was disproportionately upregulated when compared to other
PRRs. Our lab has previously shown that NOD2 knockout protects mice from renal IRI, and preliminary data
suggest that inhibition of NOD2 via pharmacologic blockade decreases the inflammatory response of renal
tubular epithelial cells to renal derived DAMPs. The hypothesis of this proposal is that NOD2 plays a critical role
in lung injury following renal IRI by inducing proinflammatory responses in the pulmonary microendothelium,
contributing to ARDS. Given the importance of microvascular endothelial cells in the pathogenesis of ARDS, this
proposal focuses on the role of NOD2 on injurious responses in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells after
renal IRI. I will focus on the canonical NOD2 signaling pathways in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells in
response to renal derived DAMPs and also use an in vivo model of renal IRI to correlate NOD2 activation with
lung injury. This proposal will provide important new knowledge and skill sets needed to set the stage for the
development of my career as a physician-scientist. The work proposed in this application will be conducted in a
rich training environment at UC San Diego and the Scripps Research Institute with an exceptional
interdisciplinary mentoring team including leaders in the field of innate immunity, endothelial cell biology, and
ARDS."

 Transposable elements (TEs) are prolific genetic parasites infiltrating >45% of the human genome and are
major proportions of all animal genomes. TE activation during aging and disease affects the transcriptomes of
neurons and alter animal activity. This hypothesis is attractive because all animal genomes harbor a major
reservoir of active TEs that are latent when animals are young but are activated during aging and disease. Our
lab studies how the natural RNA interference (RNAi) system recognizes and silences TE transcripts to
preserve genome stability. To fundamentally uncover the regulatory mechanisms between animal genomes
and TEs in neurodegenerative disorders, we are deploying genetics, genomics, biochemical and small RNA
analytical approaches on the RNAi pathway.
 This proposal will investigate how TE RNAs activated during aging are regulated by processing into small
RNAs via natural RNAi pathways. This study leverages our lab’s previously established investigations of TE
regulation during Drosophila aging, and we will bring new insight into how human TE RNAs are also processed
into small RNAs during human aging and how these TE small RNA levels are affected in diseased states. The
ultimate goal will be to examine how TE RNA regulation is affected during animal aging and in
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s diseases.
 This project will achieve the following aims in this project: Aim 1: Decipher the chromatin states associated
with elevated TE expression in aging Drosophila and human cells; and test genetic interventions that modulate
RNAi regulation of TEs in human cells and Drosophila with knockdowns and mutations of genes linked to
neurodegeneration in order to measure the feedback to disease phenotype suppression and preserving
chromatin states. Aim 2: Determine the range of human brain TE small RNAs during development and aging;
and determine the range of human brain TE small RNAs being affected in neurodegenerative diseases. Since
the field still lacks a complete understanding of TE RNA processing events during animal aging, our multi-
prong genetic and genomics approach in the Drosophila model system will complement the translational
objectives of characterizing the TE RNA regulation process in human cells and brain samples."

10828120,"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Conference on
 The PARP Family and ADP-ribosylation
 April 3 – 6, 2024
ABSTRACT
 This proposal seeks support for a meeting on “The PARP Family and ADP-ribosylation” to be held at
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) on April 3 – 6, 2024. ADP-ribosylation is a posttranslational
modification (PTM) of proteins, RNA, and DNA catalyzed by a family of enzymes known as PARPs (17 in
humans). PARPs use nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to catalyze ADP-ribosylation. A curious, and
critically important, feature of PARPs is their ability to catalyze two forms of ADP-ribosylation: (i) mono-ADP-
ribosylation (MARylation), which involves the transfer of a single unit of ADP-ribose, and (ii) poly-ADP-
ribosylation (PARylation), which involves the transfer of multiple units of ADP-ribose. Similar to other PTMs,
ADP-ribosylation is reversible. Indeed, enzymes that reverse PARylation (e.g., PARG, TARG1) and
MARylation (e.g., MacroD2, ARH3) have been identified. In the early days of the PARP field, the focus was
solely on PARP1, which revealed critical roles for PARP1 in the DNA damage response (DDR). These studies
ultimately lead to the validation of PARP1 as a therapeutic target for the treatment of DDR defective cancers.
To date, there are four FDA-approved PARP1 inhibitors for a subset of breast and ovarian cancers and several
more in the pipeline. In several cases, PARP1 inhibitor treatment resulted in distant disease-free survival,
demonstrating their tremendous clinical success and how the field has translated fundamental discoveries into
therapeutics. And we are just getting started. Recent studies have expanded our understanding, not only of the
role of PARP1 outside of DNA repair but also of the roles of lesser-understood PARP family members in
diverse cellular processes, including post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation, protein degradation,
and innate immune signaling. These studies have been advanced with the advent of new technological
developments in the field, especially in chemical biology, structural biology, and mass spectrometry. Several
PARPs beyond PARP1 have emerged as therapeutic targets not only for cancer but also for inflammation and
infectious diseases. Indeed, inhibitors of PARP7 and PARP14 are currently in clinical development. These are
indeed exciting times for the PARP and ADP-ribosylation field, both in terms of the expansion into new areas of
physiology and disease and novel therapeutic development.
 This meeting will assemble leaders in the field, together with junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and
graduate students, to present, review, and discuss current research on PARPs and ADP-ribosylation. Critically,
this unique and timely meeting will bring together scientists from both academia and industry working in
various biology and chemistry disciplines, enhancing scientific diversity and providing a good balance between
fundamental and translational research. Each session will be chaired by two leading scientists in the field, both
in academia and industry. Longer format, oral presentations will be given by distinguished scientists as well as
rising stars in the field. Shorter format, oral presentations will be given by scientists selected from the
abstracts; these will include graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty, aiming for maximal
inclusion of young investigators, and importantly scientists from groups historically excluded and
underrepresented in the biomedical sciences. We expect about 175 people to attend, with the vast majority
presenting a poster or talk. Overall, this meeting - the premier meeting in the PARP field - will support the
robust exchange of ideas and promote collaborations."
10828837,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Defective clearance of apoptotic cells (AC) by macrophages (efferocytosis) contribute to many diseases
including atherosclerosis. Given the therapeutic potential of genes that regulate efferocytosis, we sought to
identify novel regulators of this pathway in an unbiased manner. We established a genome-wide pooled CRISPR
knockout screen for efferocytosis in Cas9-overexpressing murine bone marrow-derived macrophages. Individual
validation of the strongest screen hits has uncovered Wdfy3 (WD repeat and FYVE domain containing 3) as a
novel regulator previously never implicated in the regulation of efferocytosis or phagocytosis. The goal of this
study is to focus on Wdfy3 for in-depth mechanistic studies of its molecular mechanisms and roles in
atherosclerosis. Degradation of engulfed AC requires the recruitment of a subset, but not all of the autophagy
machinery for LC3 lipidation and subsequent phagosome-lysosome fusion. There remains a significant
knowledge gap to identify which autophagy genes participate in the degradation of phagocytosed cargos. Those
that are not required for non-selective canonical autophagy (“self-eating”) are of particular interest for their
potential of therapeutic targeting for activation. Wdfy3 regulates selective autophagy for clearance of aggregated
proteins, but is dispensable for non-selective canonical autophagy during starvation, making it such a candidate.
Our data show that Wdfy3 knockdown reduces efferocytosis in murine and human macrophages; WDFY3 is co-
localized with engulfed AC; Wdfy3 expression is increased in plaque macrophages during atherosclerosis
regression; in human plaque, WDFY3 expression is correlated with M2-like macrophage markers. Within this
context, we hypothesize that Wdfy3 is required for macrophage efferocytosis by regulating phagosome formation
and maturation and Wdfy3-mediated efferocytosis protects against atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic mice
models. Aim 1 will determine the molecular mechanisms of Wdfy3 by addressing (A) which stage of efferocytosis
is regulated by Wdfy3; (B) How Wdfy3 is recruited and participates in phagosome formation and downstream
events; (C) whether and how overexpression of Wdfy3 enhances efferocytosis. Aim 2 will determine (A) whether
mice lacking myeloid Wdfy3 have defective efferocytosis in dexamethasone-induced thymic apoptosis and
in advanced atherosclerosis; and whether myeloid overexpression of WDFY3 will enhance in vivo
efferocytosis and alleviate atherosclerosis; (B) whether human iPSC-derived macrophages with WDFY3 null
mutations demonstrate defective efferocytosis and enhanced inflammation. Aim 3 will examine whether other
autophagy genes among the top screen hits are also key regulators of efferocytosis and their dependence on
Wdfy3. This study will (1) reveal novel fundamental mechanisms of efferocytosis regulated by Wdfy3 and the
potential of Wdfy3-mediated efferocytosis as a target for pro-efferocytotic therapy in atherosclerosis, and (2)
provide a broadly-applicable platform for genome-wide screen of complex functional phenotypes in primary
macrophages for unbiased novel discoveries."

Schizophrenia (SZ) is a debilitating and complex disorder with many symptoms, and current treatments often
don't address the totality of the illness. One symptom that is often overlooked is social processing deficits, and
these difficulties can cause significant functional impairment for these patients. Patients with SZ are also
known to have subtle perceptual deficits, and it is possible that these may be related to social processing
deficits. More research examining how these social and perceptual processing difficulties manifest in the brain
is needed, especially research utilizing naturalistic stimuli that mimic real life. Here, we use episodes of the
comedy TV show, The Office, as our stimulus because it contains a rich variety of social interactions, including
some that may be violating social norms (i.e., awkward events). These episodes are also rich in speech
content that will allow us to examine language at many different hierarchical levels of processing. We will use
two complementary neuroimaging imaging modalities to examine social brain network differences in patients
with SZ and how more basic perceptual language processing deficits may be influencing these measures. Our
analysis will allow us to quantify specific stimulus parameters related to social understanding, like
awkwardness, and language processing, such as low-level envelope tracking and higher-level linguistic
meaning. We will then quantify how the neural signal reflects these stimulus parameters using linear methods.
For Aim 1, we will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques to characterize neural
dynamics of social and perceptual processing deficits in SZ. We will first assess the neural tracking of
language features during the episodes utilizing a general linear model approach (GLM). Next, we will quantify
group differences in how the brain tracks with social parameters, like awkwardness. We will also characterize
neural dynamics between important nodes in the social processing brain network. For Aim 2 will use
electroencephalography (EEG) to characterize neural tracking of speech features with more temporal precision
compared to fMRI. We will also examine how social features are reflected in the neural signal and characterize
functional connectivity of social processing regions within specific frequency ranges. We predict that across
both aims, the brains of patients with SZ will track less with the perceptual and social features of the stimulus,
and that any perceptual deficits may be contributing to social deficits. We aim to recruit the same participants
for aim 1 and 2, so we can capitalize on the strengths of both methods and examine how these measures may
be providing complementary information about language and social processing deficits. We hope that this
research can be used to inform future research for biomarkers of SZ and ultimately improve healthcare
outcomes for patients with SZ."

Epidemiological studies have shown that severe childhood adversity explains 32-44% of psychiatric disorders,
and is associated with 4.6-fold risk for depression and 6.6-fold risk for substance abuse later in life. In spite of
these epidemiological data, the neurobiological underpinnings associated with maladaptive sequelae of CSA
remain largely unknown. Preclinical research strongly suggests that early adversity leads to (1) structural
abnormalities in medial prefrontal cortex regions critically implicated in stress regulation; (2) increased
oxidative stress; and (3) glutamatergic abnormalities. The current competing renewal was specifically designed
to prospectively test the contributions of these abnormalities in individuals exposed to CSA. Together, these
studies will test the hypotheses that abnormalities within “immuno-oxidative” mechanisms, including abnormal
balance of redox regulation, oxidative stress and glutamate metabolites are linked to MDD and CSA
pathophysiology. We expect that interactions among these abnormalities (1) lead to excitatory/inhibitory
imbalance of local neuronal circuits and morphometrical abnormalities within key regions (mPFC); (2) are
associated with key MDD phenotypes; and (3) prospectively predict future symptoms and functioning. These
goals will be achieved by evaluating young adult females with a history of CSA between the ages of 12-16
years with a current (“MDD/CSA” group) or former (“rMDD/CSA” group) diagnosis of major depressive
disorder. To disentangle CSA- vs. MDD-related effects, these groups will be compared to both healthy controls
and MDD females without a history of CSA (“MDD” group). All subjects (N=160) will be tested at both 3T and
4T scanners using an integration of state-of-the-art 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) (to quantify
redox ratio and brain bioenergetics in vivo), high field multinuclear MRS (to assess glutamate metabolites and
glutathione), functional magnetic resonance imaging (to probe the neural correlates of anhedonic behavior and
cognitive control deficits). To track disease course, all participants will be prospectively assessed at 6- and 12-
month follow-up sessions. Based on our extensive set of preliminary findings, we hypothesize that, relative to
both healthy controls and the MDD group, MDD/CSA individuals will show greater cortical thinning in the
medial prefrontal cortex, lower redox ratio, lower glutamine/glutamate ratio, and higher inflammatory markers
(Hypothesis 1). We further expect that these abnormalities will persist in euthymic rMDD/CSA subjects,
particularly with increasing number of lifetime depressive episodes. Moreover, we expect that these
abnormalities will be associated with increased anhedonic behavior and cognitive deficits (Hypotheses 2), and
will predict anhedonic symptom, cognitive deficits and poorer general functioning at the follow-up assessments
(Hypothesis 3). Improving our understanding of neurobiological mechanisms associated with different CSA
outcomes is of paramount importance in order to (1) identify individuals at risk for psychopathology and
maladaptive behavior, (2) prevent revictimization, and (3) develop more targeted therapeutic interventions."
10828846,"ABSTRACT: Background: Chronic abdominal pain is the hallmark symptom of chronic
pancreatitis (CP), with 50-80% of patients seeking medical attention for pain control. While several
management options are potentially available, outcomes are often disappointing, and opioids
remain a mainstay of therapy. Opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) may occur, a phenomenon
resulting in dose escalation, and appears to be due in part to the effect of opioids on pain-
associated voltage-gated sodium channels. Lacosamide blocks and stabilizes these channels
and may inhibit the effects of OIH. This may result in improved pain control with a decrease in
opioid use. In pre-clinical and clinical trials with neuropathic pain, lacosamide reduced pain scores
and was well tolerated. There are no data, however, evaluating the use of lacosamide in CP
patients. Aims: 1. To evaluate the safety, tolerability and dose-limiting toxicity of adding
lacosamide to opioid therapy in subjects with suspected and definite painful CP; 2. To assess the
feasibility of performance of a pilot study adding lacosamide to opioid therapy in these subjects.
As an exploratory aim, we will assess the efficacy of adding lacosamide to opioid therapy for the
treatment of abdominal pain due to CP. Methods: This is a Phase 1 trial, utilizing the Bayesian
optimal interval (BOIN) design to find the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). The target dose-
limiting toxicity (DLT) rate for the MTD is ɸ = 0.3 and the maximum sample size is 24. Given the
small sample size, anticipated relatively short study period and potential for patient recruitment at
several clinical centers, it is anticipated that all data will be accrued within 36 months of study
initiation. Significance: This study will generate new knowledge regarding the safety, toxicity and
dose-limiting toxicity of lacosamide in CP patients. It is anticipated that lacosamide will prove to
be safe and well-tolerated. The results of this pilot study will then support proceeding with a phase
2 trial assessing the efficacy of lacosamide added to opioid therapy to alleviate abdominal pain
from CP."

Exposure to chronic stress is a known risk factor for neuropsychiatric disease and yields structural and molecular
changes to the brain and immune system. The nucleus accumbens (NAc), a hub for integrating reward and
motivation, exhibits molecular and cellular alterations that are found in postmortem tissue of patients with stress-
related disorders, such as major depressive disorder, and drive motivational deficits in rodents. Specifically,
dendritic atrophy of dopamine receptor type 1 (D1), but not type 2 (D2) expressing medium spiny neurons
(MSNs) is necessary and sufficient for stress-induced negative behavioral outcomes. Emerging evidence
implicates microglia as potential mediators of neuronal atrophy and motivational deficits after social stress. Since
microglia can interact with neurons and facilitate neuronal dysfunction and cell death, they are prime candidates
for investigating the relationship between chronic stress and D1-MSN atrophy. Recent work from the lab shows
that chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) reduced overall D1-MSN and microglia contact, but not D2 MSNs, and
analyses of individual microglia within the D1-MSN microenvironment revealed reductions in microglia
complexity in animals that exhibited negative affective behavior after CSDS. Thus, while it is evident that CSDS
alters D1-MSN-microglia contact and morphology, the molecular mechanisms driving these cell-subtype specific,
stress-induced changes in the NAc microenvironment remain unclear. Preliminary RNA-seq analysis from the
lab points to vitronectin, an extracellular matrix substrate, as a promising molecular messenger mediating D1-
MSN and microglia interactions because it plays a driving role in a network of genes altered by chronic stress
and is specifically differentially expressed in D1-MSNs. In this proposal, I will virally knock down vitronectin
expression in D1-MSNs using a Cre-dependent CRISPR/Cas9 construct in mice before subjecting them to either
CSDS or Chronic Witness Defeat Stress (CWDS) to interrogate the role of vitronectin expression in D1-MSN-
microglia interactions, D1-MSN and microglia morphology, and stress-induced behavioral outcomes. It is
hypothesized that knocking down vitronectin expression in D1-MSNs will rescue D1-MSN stress-induced
dendritic atrophy, restore D1-MSN-microglia contact, and prevent negative affective behavior. Understanding
the molecular mechanisms driving altered stress-induced behavioral states can shed light on novel therapeutics
designed to protect and/or treat the deleterious effects of chronic stress. The proposed training at the University
of Maryland Baltimore, School of Medicine will facilitate my transition to a postdoctoral fellowship and allow me
to continue to research stress-related neuropsychiatric disease by characterizing neuron, microglia, and
extracellular matrix relationships in the context of stress exposure. With the support of my excellent scientific
community comprising of my mentor, thesis committee members, collaborators, and neuroscience and
Meyerhoff communities, I am excited to complete the technical and career goals outlined in the F99/K00 phases
of my proposal and working and growing into the role of an independent investigator in neuroscience."

The 2023 SoCal Genome Stability Symposium is a one-day conference that will be held at the University of
Southern California, Los Angeles. The conference will focus on genomic instability, DNA mutagenesis,
environmental mutagens, DNA damage signaling, mechanisms of DNA repair, and their implications in cancers
and therapies. In recent years, many novel cancer therapies have been developed to target DNA repair
pathways. These new therapies are currently moving from the lab to the clinic, and we are poised for a rapid
expansion of DNA repair pathway-targeting drugs that will be used to treat different types of cancer. At the
same time, treatments can induce DNA damage accumulation and cancer recurrences. Thus, understanding
the mechanisms of DNA repair and cell responses to DNA repair-targeting chemicals is necessary to improve
treatments. At the conference, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows from laboratories located in
Southern California will present their ongoing unpublished research. The goals and objectives of the
conference are: 1) to expose students and postdocs to the new frontiers of rapidly progressing research areas
critically important to addressing cancer; 2) to provide a formal platform for presentations to trainees, and an
opportunity to receive feedback on their research progress; 3) to stimulate new collaborations between
laboratories across different research institutions; 4) to catalyze opportunities for young scientists to network
with a diverse group of scientists, including by receiving formal and informal mentoring and by opening future
postdoctoral or faculty position opportunities; 5) to provide an atmosphere of inclusion and rigor for the trainees
participating in the symposium. The symposium will enhance interactions among students and postdoctoral
fellows from all genders, backgrounds, and origins, including historically marginalized groups such as those
from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, individuals with disabilities, individuals with different sexual
orientations, and individuals from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds. Broader awareness of the
field gained through local meetings such as this is particularly important to prepare trainees for their next
career stages as postdoctoral fellows, principal investigators, or other careers in science."

The goal of this proposed research is to optimize a dual-use calcium ion sensor for recording single-cell activity
from the entire dorsal cortex or hippocampus of freely-moving mice. It is widely accepted that optical imaging
with genetically-encoded fluorescent calcium sensors is currently the only method to obtain measurements of
genetically-identified neuronal populations with dense sampling. Over the past several years, the recording
capabilities of two-photon microscopes have been improved to record from millimeter-scale tissue, and new
miniaturized microscopes have been developed to record from moving mice. However, most behaviors arise
from collective interactions between neurons from multiple brain areas, which cannot be simultaneously
monitored with these systems. Therefore, there is a clear need to develop a new approach to directly monitor
the synchronized activity of distributed neural circuits. CaMPARI is a unique calcium sensor that can detect
activity in two calcium-dependent ways: 1) permanent color change (green to red) upon illumination with violet
light, a process known as photoconversion, and 2) dynamic changes in fluorescence intensity. Our data show
that CaMPARI allows recording of brain activity from freely-behaving mice, without using microscope objectives
or implanted devices. Moreover, natural degradation of the red CaMPARI protein enables multiple longitudinal
measurements. However, previous attempts to improve CaMPARI using in vitro assays reduced some of its in
vivo properties, which resulted in low dynamic recording sensitivity and a low photoconversion rate that requires
long illumination times to accumulate a sufficient amount of red protein. Therefore, the project goal is to optimize
CaMPARI to allow sensitive recording of cellular-resolution, cortex-wide activity snapshots in freely-moving mice,
followed by subsequent dynamic recording from the same mouse using two- and three-photon microscopy. To
optimize CaMPARI’s performance, we will combine in vitro testing in purified protein, HEK cells, and neurons,
and the most predictive assay: large-scale in vivo screening of ~30-fold more constructs than previous studies.
Aim 1 will focus on enhancing CaMPARI’s photoconversion efficiency to facilitate large-scale recordings in
freely-moving mice. Aim 2 will focus on improving CaMPARI’s dynamic recording properties and sensitivity. In
Aim 3, we will combine beneficial mutations from Aims 1-2 to generate a new CaMPARI with optimized
photoconversion and dynamic recording capabilities. Our proof-of-concept experiments will demonstrate multi-
regional cortical mapping during a battery of behavioral and cognitive tests to detect cellular-resolution changes
in cortex-wide activity patterns. This optimized CAMPARI is expected to facilitate new hypothesis-driven studies
by providing volumetric, multi-regional brain activity data of genetically-targeted neurons during cognitive and
behavioral testing of freely-moving mice, enabling studies that involve both head-fixation and free movement in
the same mice, and to utilize complementary techniques like optogenetic stimulation and single-cell sequencing
methods to enable studying the properties of active (red-labeled) cells during behavioral studies."
10828866,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Coordinated protein signaling is required to orchestrate many functions in the body. During tissue repair, the
spatiotemporal presentation of proteins in the injury site affects protein-receptor binding, downstream cellular
responses, and overall healing outcomes. Many biomaterials have been designed to deliver proteins to treat
injured tissues. However, few biomaterials can independently control the delivery of multiple proteins from a
single material, limiting their utility for delivering numerous proteins involved in the natural wound healing
cascade. One strategy to control protein delivery is the use of affinity-based biomaterials, which employ non-
covalent affinity interactions between proteins and materials. My lab is developing affinity-based biomaterials to
enhance tissue repair by determining how the timing and local presentation of complex combinations of proteins
affect regenerative processes. Our objective is to develop new biomaterial tools to understand how protein-
material affinity interactions impact protein release and activity, modulate complex healing responses, and
interrogate the role of protein presentation in tissue repair. We will tackle two critical knowledge gaps that have
hindered the development of effective biomaterials for protein delivery: 1) How do protein-material affinity
interactions affect protein release and activity? 2) How does biomaterial-based control over protein presentation
affect tissue repair? Our innovative approach involves engineering new protein-material affinity interactions using
directed evolution and rational protein design. Yeast surface display will be used to evolve small protein domains
(i.e., affibodies) that bind to proteins of interest with high specificity and a wide range of affinities. Computational
modeling will be used to design affibodies that interact with different areas of the protein to inhibit or maintain
protein-receptor binding. The resulting expansive array of affibodies will allow us to determine how protein-
material affinity interactions affect protein release and activity over different timescales. Affibodies will be
conjugated onto biomaterials to tune protein release and cellular responses. Using our library of affinity-based
biomaterials, we will systematically investigate how the temporal presentation of multiple proteins affects the rate
and quality of tissue repair. We will implant biomaterials to restore key aspects of the healing response by 1)
using moderate affinity affibodies to provide sustained delivery of exogenous proteins to the injury site and 2)
using high affinity affibodies to sequester endogenous proteins within the injury site and enhance, maintain, or
inhibit protein activity. While our approach is flexible and tissue-agnostic, we will first test it in a bone injury model,
which is a central area of expertise in my lab. By replicating the complex protein presentation of the wound
healing cascade, we will gain new insights into the roles of many proteins that govern tissue repair and create a
new class of highly modular biomaterials that can be tailored to orchestrate cellular responses to treat multiple
types of injuries. Our approach will have an immediate benefit to society through the creation of a transformative
new regenerative medicine strategy with the potential to significantly improve tissue repair."

The promise of immune-based therapeutics to ameliorate or even provide functional cures for autoimmune
diseases and malignancies, together with the grave threat from pandemic, zoonotic, and possibly even
bioterrorist infectious agents, demand a next generation of biomedical researchers with deep understanding of
basic immunology, microbiology, and molecular and cell biology. But the increasingly rapid pace of
immunological and microbiological research based on insights from interdisciplinary and systems approaches
requires broadly-trained investigators skilled at adapting to new developments across many areas of science
and technology. To train investigators to meet these challenges of scientific inquiry, our training environments
embrace cross-disciplinary themes and provide both state-of-the-art research opportunities in this area, and also
training in other aspects of career development. Therefore, the specific goals of this program will be to: (1)
provide talented PhD candidates with conceptual and technological skills to tackle meaningful, clinically relevant
topics in immunology and microbiology; (2) facilitate communication and collaborative interactions amongst
trainees and training faculty; (3) provide opportunities for the translation of research discoveries to the clinics;
(4) establish mechanisms for recruiting and retaining predoctoral trainees from all backgrounds including those
traditionally underrepresented in biomedical sciences, (5) provide trainees with strong oral presentation,
manuscript writing, grant writing, networking, and other essential career development skills; and (6) provide
trainees with opportunities to participate in local, national, and international meetings where they can share their
own research findings. Progress towards these goals will be monitored by regular evaluation that will guide
continuing development and improvement of the program. The program is highly cross-disciplinary, incorporating
30 accomplished investigators as mentors who represent a broad spectrum of research interests, expertise, and
technologies. The training faculty includes MD, PhD and MD-PhD scientists engaged in basic immunology and
microbiology as well as translational, disease-oriented research. Faculty members are already involved in highly
productive collaborations and have extensive experience in predoctoral training. The program director will be
advised by a Steering Committee, to help select IMTG students and faculty through a transparent nomination
process and provide advice on academic and programmatic issues. The program director will work with the
UMMS Office of Faculty Affairs to provide IMTG preceptors with leadership, communication, and mentoring
training. The program director and mentors will work closely with the UMMS Center for Biomedical Career
Development to provide training in critical career skills that will further enable trainees to carry their research
accomplishments forward to successful careers in biomedical research."

The goals of this project are to develop novel dynamic longitudinal functional models and to apply
them to the electrocardiographic (ECG) data that are measured repeatedly over time in the
Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) study of individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
We will also develop real-time risk prediction algorithms to identify individuals at high-risk of
cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The CRIC study is an ongoing study of individuals with chronic
kidney diseases (CKD), funded by the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney
Diseases (NIDDK) since 2001. The CRIC study has recorded standard twelve-lead
electrocardiograms (ECG) annually in all participants recruited from seven clinical centers. Our
primary objective is to evaluate whether longitudinal ECG patterns are precursors to CVD and
thus can be used to identity high-risk individuals. We propose new statistical methods to extract
novel features from the raw ECG tracing both at baseline and in terms of longitudinal changes
that are predictive of complications from CVD such as hospitalizations for heart failure (HF),
myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and cardiovascular death. The
information will be incorporated in the proposed real-time, computationally efficient risk prediction
algorithms. We will also validate our discovery using an external cohort of CKD patients collected
from the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS).The proposed methods are not
restricted to ECG data analysis and have a wide range of applications. We will develop user-
friendly software packages for the new statistical models and risk prediction algorithms and share
the validation data to promote their use in both statistical and clinical communities."

Drug addiction is highly comorbid with neuropsychiatric disorders, especially major depressive disorder (MDD).
Both conditions are moderately heritable and exacerbated by environmental factors, particularly stressful life
events, suggesting combined genetic and epigenetic liability. Furthermore, both illnesses feature dysregulation
of dopaminergic (DA) and serotonergic (5HT) systems modulating motivation and cognitive function. The
habenula (Hb) is one of the few brain regions controlling both DA and 5HT systems and is a highly organized
central node for reward circuits governing motivated behavior and affective states. Hb dysfunction is
associated with impaired mood regulation and substance use disorder (SUD), but the genetic and epigenetic
mechanisms mediating this dysfunction are unknown. Given the close relationship between brain structure
and function, assigning gene expression to functionally distinct anatomical subdivisions and cell populations
within the human Hb would significantly advance our understanding of how Hb dysregulation contributes to
neuropsychiatric disorders and SUD. Towards this end, we propose to employ 10x Genomics Multi-ome and
Visium technologies to generate corresponding single cell and spatial molecular reference maps of human Hb
to identify genetically-defined and topographically-organized cell types across medial and lateral subdivisions
of this brain region. We will also generate transcriptomic data from homogenate human Hb in patients with
MDD and comorbid MDD/opioid use disorder (OUD), and contrast these gene expression patterns to those
derived from matched neurotypical controls. We will integrate complimentary topographic and cell type-
specific reference maps with homogenate data from patients with depression and addiction to implicate
specific Hb cell populations and subregions in illness state and genetic risk for these highly comorbid
conditions. By generating the first molecular neuroanatomical atlas of the human habenula, we will facilitate
refined annotation of cell types with brain architecture in a key integration hub of brain reward circuitry that can
be targeted for prevention and treatment of debilitating neuropsychiatric and substance use disorders."

Toxoplasma gondii is an important human pathogen that causes severe disease in immunocompromised
individuals, such as those undergoing chemotherapy, organ transplantation, and AIDS patients. It also afflicts
women who become infected for the first time during pregnancy. A healthy immune system or current drug
regiment controls the replication of the tachyzoites associated with clinical toxoplasmosis. However, there are
no effective therapies to eliminate the chronic stages associated with encysted bradyzoites and, importantly, to
prevent the cyst reactivation. To find new avenues for combating the chronic and reactivated toxoplasmosis, we
focus on the mechanisms of the tachyzoite and bradyzoite interconversions that are poorly understood. The
critical difference between a tachyzoite and a bradyzoite is the rate of parasite replication and the cell cycle
architecture. A tachyzoite divides fast and has a relatively short G1 period. In contrast, a bradyzoite rarely divides
and spends a progressively longer time in the G1 phase. The time parasite spends in the G1 period is regulated
by the RESTRICTION checkpoint (R-point) that in T. gondii lacks conventional regulators. The current
application is based on the central hypothesis that the atypical TgCrk2 kinase and P-type cyclins define the
novel G1 checkpoint that governs transitions between acute and chronic toxoplasmosis. In our preliminary
studies, we showed a differential expression of three P-cyclins in the fast- (RH) and slow-dividing (ME49) T.
gondii strains, which also differ in their ability to differentiate. We also showed that all three P-cyclins interact
with G1 kinase TgCrk2 in vivo. We believe that P-cyclins differentially regulate levels of TgCrk2 activity, therefore,
facilitate or block R-point passage. This dictates the parasite’s choice to either replicate as a tachyzoite or to
convert into a resting bradyzoite. To prove our hypothesis, we will define the mechanism of the R-point regulation
by TgCrk2 kinase and cyclins TgCycP2, and TgCycP3 in the tachyzoite and bradyzoite development in
vitro (Aim 1); in the natural progression of the disease using mouse model (Aim 2); and determine function of
the novel R-point components TgCables1 and TgRch1 (Aim 3). Our proposal is built on a strong foundation of
advanced genetics, which is bolstered by our extensive experience in studying cyclin/Crk regulators of the T.
gondii tachyzoite cell cycle. Using a panel of strains with novel auxin-dependent conditional protein expression
of P-cyclins, we will test whether differences in regulation of TgCrk2/P-cyclin complexes explain the dynamics of
the bradyzoite differentiation and cyst reactivation. Altogether, our experiments will break new ground in
understanding the mechanics and regulation of the developmental switch that regulates the progression of the
disease."

The podocytopathies are a group of glomerular diseases that affect the kidney’s ability to filter the blood and often lead to kidney failure. Healthy podocytes cover the glomerular capillaries with thousands of extensions called foot processes that interdigitate with one another and maintain their elaborate cell shape by tightly regulating their actin cytoskeleton. Podocytes respond to insults in a typical fashion by undergoing foot process effacement, a dramatic shift in podocyte morphology and the disappearance of the intricate foot processes, which often associates with the “actin mat”, an actin condensation at the bottom of the effaced areas. We recently used super-resolution imaging to study the podocyte actin cytoskeleton in 3D in both healthy and diseased conditions. We showed that healthy podocyte foot processes contain non-contractile actin cables, while contractile cables are maintained high in the cell bodies. In contrast, injured podocytes appear to have contractile actin cables in effacement areas juxtaposed to the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), indicating a shift in the spatial distribution of actin cables after injury. The overall goal of this proposal is to define the molecular mechanisms that regulate the various types of actin cables in podocytes and the nature of the changes that cause the contractile actin cables in the cell body to shift towards the effaced areas adjacent to the GBM after injury. In Aim 1, we will investigate the roles of the two isoactins, beta and gamma actin, in podocyte pathobiology. Podocytes express high levels of these almost-identical evolutionally-conserved isoactins. While beta actin in non-muscle cells is considered the main isoactin, as evident from the embryonic lethality when inactivated, the role of gamma actin is still elusive. we will use various kidney disease mouse models, including the gamma-actin knockout mouse, to answer some fundamental questions about the role of the two isoactins in podocyte biology. Furthermore, we will utilize a novel technique to study primary podocytes as they spread out of isolated kidney glomeruli onto a substrate-micropatterned hydrogel. This approach will allow us to study the dynamic changes in the actin cytoskeleton in injured podocytes and will shed more light on the fate of the actin mats in effaced podocytes. It will help us identifying the role of Rho small GTPases and its downstream effectors, formins, in the actin mat formation. In Aim 2, we will study the tropomyosin isoform composition in podocytes and their roles in specifying the spatial distribution of different types of actin cables in the kidney podocytes. We hypothesize that changes in tropomyosin composition in injured podocytes causes the ectopic appearance of contractile actin cables in the effaced areas, and this, in turn, is regulated by different formins. Understanding how tropomyosins regulate the various types of actin cables could provide the missing link to podocyte foot process effacement. Our goal is to expand our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate the composition and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton, a step that will help us in designing novel therapeutic approaches to directly impact podocyte foot process architecture and help cure kidney glomerular diseases."

Neurodegenerative disorders represent a significant challenge to human health. Many therapeutic strategies
revolve around suppressing death of the neuronal cell body. However, neuronal connectivity depends on long
projections called axons that use specialized mechanisms to survive in isolation from the soma. The
degeneration of axons is a common, sometimes initiating event in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders
including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and peripheral neuropathies. Protecting axon health is
necessary for sustaining functional connectivity and will have broad relevance to many diseases. In the aging
nervous system there is a well-documented decline in protein homeostasis and accumulation of protein
aggregates that threaten neuronal function. Protein homeostasis is predominantly studied in context of the
neuronal cell body. However, axons are also susceptible because protein aggregates interfere with transport
and disrupt synaptic function. Polypeptides are most vulnerable to misfolding and aggregation as they exit the
ribosome. Axons locally synthesize many proteins needed for survival however there is a gap in knowledge
regarding basic mechanisms that protect axons from protein misfolding. This project will determine the capacity
of axon segments to resist protein misfolding and aggregation. We will also determine the preferred
mechanisms used within axon segments for degrading non-native polypeptides and disposing of aggregates.
NAD+ levels decline as we age and this project will identify the consequences local NAD+ depletion on protein
homeostasis within the axon compartment. Altogether, this project will generate new insight on local
mechanisms controlling axon health and reveal treatment opportunities in neurodegenerative disorders."

 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major health concern facing the U.S. population, with the impact of risk
factors accumulating over the lifespan and beginning well before older age. Increasingly, the study of
cardiovascular health for people living with HIV is vital given the growing number of middle- and older-aged
adults living with HIV as a chronic condition and its complex effects on cardiovascular health directly, and
indirectly through HIV's impact on inflammation. In the general population, poor or inadequate sleep has been
linked with increased risk for CVD, in part through its impact on inflammation and other physiological
mechanisms.
 In our own work, among sexual minority men living with HIV, poor sleep has also been linked with lower
rates of adherence to antiretroviral (ART) medications. Therefore, the study of cardiovascular health among
people living with HIV requires special consideration of the pathways from poor sleep through worsened HIV
health to increased CVD risk both directly, and indirectly through inflammation (principally, IL-6, TNF-alpha,
and CRP). Further, we hypothesize that, contributing to this larger picture of physiological pathways from sleep
to CVD risk, is a day-level psychosocial-behavioral dynamic whereby experiences of minority stress affect
subsequent ART adherence through the impact of minority stress on sleep. Accordingly, in the proposed
observational, longitudinal study of 240 racially-diverse sexual minority men living with HIV, aged 45-64, we
aim to use longitudinal data to test the hypotheses that poor sleep longitudinally predicts greater CVD risk
among SMM-LWH aged 45-64, in part through the impact of poor sleep on HIV health, and in part through the
impact of poor sleep on inflammation. Additionally, we aim to test the day-level hypothesis that the impact of
multiple, intersecting sources of minority stress (sexual minority stress, racial/ethnic minority stress, and/or
HIV-related stress) on next-day ART adherence in SMM-LWH operates, in part, through the day-level impact of
minority stress on poor sleep.
 This proposed study aligns with the growing recognition of the importance of sleep in numerous mental,
behavioral, and physical health outcomes, and also contributes to our understanding of how minority stress
“gets under the skin” (here, through its impact on sleep) to affect physical health outcomes in individuals with
marginalized identities."
10829794,"Title: Transformable Theranostics for imaging-guided interventions in head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma
Summary/Abstract
The overall goal of this Phase II SBIR proposal is to translate our highly effective and non-toxic Transformable
Nano-Theranostics (TNTs) into clinical trials for precision image-guided intervention of head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma (HNSCC). HNSCC is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. There are around 550,000 new
cases worldwide annually and 65,630 cases in the U.S. alone. The overall survival rate of HNSCC remains
unchanged over the past 25 years. Tumor recurrence and metastasis are the leading causes of mortality.
Patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC have a median overall survival of only 10 months. Even with
intensive surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, prognosis for these patients is still dismal. Complete surgical
removal (with negative margins) is the goal of the treatment, but can be difficult to achieve due to the infiltration
of vital structures. Since positive surgery margin is associated with poor prognosis, there is a great need to
develop novel treatments which can not only guide surgery but also destroy any residual cancer while sparing
critical organ structure and function. Moreover, development of theranostic agents that can detect and eliminate
early HNSCC lesions, particularly aggressive sub-types, could have tremendous impact in survival and function
for many patients. We recently developed a set of highly innovative TNTs that possess outstanding capability to
circumvent the sequential biological barriers which have generally hindered drug delivery to tumors, including
HNSCC. In our Phase I SBIR grant, we have optimized TNTs and demonstrated that 1) the smart dual
size/charge- transformation of TNTs in response to ubiquitous hallmarks of tumors (e.g. tumor acidosis induced
acidic extracellular pH, pHe) dramatically increased the tumor accumulation and penetration of TNTs in HNSCC
tissue, and facilitated uptake in cancer cells; 2) TNTs enabled effective visualization of tumor, drug delivery and
therapeutic effect by near infrared fluorescence imaging (NIRFI) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); 3) the
synergistic trimodal therapy via TNTs achieved a 100% complete cure rate in orthotopic HNSCC mouse models.
Those promising results built a solid foundation for us to move forward to the SBIR Phase II project, in which we
plan to 1) synthesize large scale Good Manufactory Production (GMP) grade TNTs, 2) perform Investigation
New Drug (IND) enabling pharmacology and toxicology studies in two species (dog and rodent), and 3) draft IND
application and design a phase I first-in-human clinical trial for HNSCC patients to determine the dose for phase
II. Our long-term goal is to develop safe, highly efficacious and cost-effective theranostic agents for human
HNSCC. The successful completion of this research will make the proposed TNTs ready for clinical trials. The
proposed transformable, tumor hallmark targeting yet easy-to-make nano-theranostic agents that are highly
capable of overcoming the important barriers for drug delivery to HNSCC offer tremendous opportunities for
precision image-guided intervention of HNSCC, therefore have great pharmacological, clinical and commercial
potentials to lead to a marketable nano-formulation to improve the treatment of HNSCC."

The significant cellular demand of the hematopoietic system is maintained by a rare pool of tissue-specific,
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) that are primarily found in a quiescent state. Upon
hematopoietic stresses, such as significant bleeding, overwhelming infection, radiation exposure and
myelosuppressive therapy, HSPCs are rapidly recruited into cell cycle, but ultimately must return to
quiescence. The ability to transiently modulate HSPC return to quiescence has the potential to extend the
activation of HSPCs and significantly improve overall patient outcomes from hematopoietic stresses and for
transplantation therapies. However, in order to leverage a transient extension of HSPC activation to improve
the regenerative response to stress, we must first understand the mechanisms by which the complex network
of cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic signaling within the bone marrow are coupled to regulate HSPC quiescence. The
objective of our current proposal is to evaluate the tetraspanin membrane-scaffold protein, CD82, as a
tractable target to modulate HSPC quiescence signaling within the bone marrow. Tetraspanins are a family of
membrane-scaffold proteins with the unique ability to regulate cell-cell/cell-matrix interactions and modulate
intracellular signaling, thus linking cell-microenvironment interactions to downstream signaling consequences.
Our new preliminary data indicate that the CD82 scaffold promotes a quiescent HSPC phenotype when cells
are niche engaged and implicate a role for Transforming Growth Factor  (TGF) signaling. Thus, in this
proposal, we will test the hypothesis that the CD82 membrane scaffold promotes HSPC quiescence by
organizing and enhancing the signaling activity of a TGF receptor complex within the bone marrow niche. In
Specific Aim 1, we will determine the molecular mechanisms by which CD82 modulates the TGFβ signaling
response of HSPCs. For Specific Aim 2, we will identify the mechanism by which CD82 promotes the spatial
activation of TGF signaling locally within the bone marrow niche during hematopoietic stress. In Specific Aim
3, we will evaluate CD82 as a therapeutic target to improve the hematopoietic regeneration response to
hematologic injury. In pursuit of these aims, we will apply an innovative combinatorial approach that includes
mutational analysis, biochemistry and sophisticated imaging techniques, which will enable us to obtain a multi-
scale understanding of the mechanisms by which CD82 regulates TGF signal transduction in the context of
hematopoietic stress. Moreover, the successful completion of the proposed aims will be significant because we
expect to integrate mechanistic insights across multiple scales to identify the multifaceted contribution of CD82
to the regulation of TGF signaling in the context of hematopoietic stress and quiescence, which will build a
foundation for the development of improved therapeutics that locally target the complex TGF signaling
cascade within the bone marrow."

While mortality rates for breast cancer (BC) have dropped precipitously over the past few decades due primarily
to advances in treatment and detection, more than 42,000 individuals in the US will still die of this disease in
2019. These BC deaths are largely attributed to recurrent and metastatic disease. While classifiers such as ER
positivity and HER2 status provide insights into BC prognosis and treatment, local and distal BC recurrence
occurs across all BC subtypes. Due to our current inability to predict or prevent BC recurrence, BC is one of the
most overtreated diseases with patients undergoing extended rounds of chemotherapy and treatment that may
provide only marginal benefit. This is especially evident with ER+ (luminal) BCs where long term treatment with
hormonal therapies is recommended for many patients, despite side effects, as a result of our inability to
effectively predict the risk of late recurrence within this group. As such, there is a clear need to better understand
the biology of BC recurrence and to devise a means to treat and/or prevent BC progression. Toward this goal,
we have identified the RON receptor tyrosine kinase and the nuclear DEK oncogene as a signal transduction
axis whose upregulation promotes BC growth and supports BC stem-like cell (BCSC) populations, which are
considered a prime driver of recurrent and metastatic disease. Clinically, RON and DEK are frequently
overexpressed in BC and their combined expression is highly predictive of BC recurrence, distant metastasis
and death in patients across all human BC subtypes. We previously reported that high RON-DEK levels are
strongly associated with β-catenin accumulation in human BC samples and that β-catenin is a synergistically
activated target of RON and DEK. Recent discoveries in our laboratories show that RON or DEK overexpression
increase the levels of key enzymes required for glycolysis, lactate production, and for cholesterol biosynthesis.
We further show that RON and DEK expression increase glycolytic flux consistent with new studies highlighting
metabolic shifts in response to β-catenin activation. Based on this data, we hypothesize that RON-DEK signaling
acts, at least in part, through β-catenin to reprogram metabolic flux for sustaining the energy and macromolecule
synthesis required for BC progression. Thus, the goal of this application is to determine the mechanistic roles of
β-catenin and metabolic reprograming in RON/DEK-driven BC recurrence, and to define and therapeutically
block metabolic effectors of this signaling axis to prevent BC progression and recurrence. Metabolic flux studies
will be carried out in syngeneic animal models of BC and in live human BC specimens. These studies will be
performed by a team of scientists and clinicians, and include a renowned expert in stable isotope resolved
metabolomics approaches, that will be utilized to define RON/DEK dependent anabolic/catabolic processes. This
untargeted approach is expected to identify candidate biomarkers and effectors of aggressive tumors with high
RON/DEK expression. The supposition is that targeting vulnerable nodes of the RON/DEK metabolic signature
will be an efficacious strategy for the treatment of advanced BC phenotypes."
10848469,"PERIPHERAL INFLAMMATION AND STRESS DRIVE VENTRAL STRIATAL MALADAPTATIONS
PROJECT SUMMARY Mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety are a major disease burden linked to
suicide and mortality. It is well known that exposure to stress can precipitate neuropsychiatric complications. The
immune system also has a large influence on psychological symptoms and chronic conditions like inflammatory
bowel disease dramatically increase risk of depression and anxiety. Surprisingly, little is known of the brain
circuitry-specific mechanisms that drive this comorbidity. Our goal is to address this need by studying how
systemic inflammation and stress cause maladaptations in reward/aversion circuitry of the ventral striatum
(nucleus accumbens, NAc). In preliminary studies, we found that gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation, as a
pervasive form of systemic inflammation, modulates stress-response behavior, and dysregulates NAc synaptic
plasticity and excitability of D1 dopamine (DA) receptor (D1R) expressing medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Multi-
omic exploration of the mechanistic basis for these effects implicated a novel dynorphin (DYN)-kappa opioid
receptor (kOR)-Cdk5/p35-b adducin (ADD2) signaling cascade in the NAc which we hypothesize mediates these
maladaptations. Based on these findings we propose to study the effects of peripheral inflammation, stress, and
their interactions on neurobehavioral functions (Aim 1), and NAc synaptic plasticity, cell type-specific excitability,
and DA neurotransmission (Aim 2). The novel kOR-Cdk5/p35-ADD2 pathway we have identified provides a
mechanism by which maladaptive changes in DA neurotransmission can actuate alterations in DA-cAMP-PKA
signaling and alter structural plasticity. We will study the mechanisms by which this pathway functions and its
contribution to the effects of inflammation and stress on structural plasticity (Aim 3). Innovative components of
this proposal include the study of inflammation/stress interactions, NAc cell type-specific interrogation of the role
of kOR-Cdk5/p35-ADD2 signaling in mediating these effects, in vivo fiber photometry to study DA dynamics, and
a novel systemic Cdk5 inhibitor as a targeted therapeutic approach. This research connects a strong field of
striatal signal transduction to a major clinical problem. The impact will be to provide a detailed picture of the
mechanistic basis for systemic inflammation-mental illness comorbidity and possible new approaches for
therapeutic intervention."

 Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in bone marrow provide regenerative capacity for bone, replacing and
reinforcing the skeleton at load bearing sites. When we age or in prolonged bedrest, MSCs lose their
regenerative potential, often measured by their proliferative and differentiation capacity. This loss of MSC
health causes osteoporosis and delayed healing, ultimately resulting in decreased quality of life and
increased medical costs. A fundamental knowledge gap preventing effective therapies in aging and MSC
related regenerative medicine is how aging and bedrest impedes MSC health.
 The nucleus, central to all cellular activity, relies on both mechanical input as well as its molecular
transducers to regulate intra-nuclear chromatin organization that ultimately determine cell function and
fate. Thus, failure to transmit this information to the nucleus would lead to the breakdown of these
processes. Here, we ask if aging is a process that limits information flow into the nucleus, ultimately
diminishing its organizational capacity and responsiveness to outside stimuli. As we will show, disabling
the mechanical connection between cytoskeleton and nucleus facilitated by Linker of Nucleoskeleton and
Nucleoskeleton (LINC) complexes, impairs mechanosensitivity by affecting βcatenin and YAP/TAZ
signaling. This leads to decreased proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells.
Our principal hypothesis is that loss of LINC-connectivity significantly contributes to MSC aging by
 disrupting nuclear mechanotransduction.
 Through this revision submitted in response to [PA16-442] - Changes in Cellular Architecture
During Aging (R01), we will address our principal hypothesis through two specific aims, each using a
distinct hypotheses to examine how inhibiting LINC complex function as well as how aging related loss
of LINC complex limits MSC mechanosignaling of known mechanotransducers βcatenin and YAP/TAZ.
We will further determine the force-induced mechanisms of how sustained physical activity protects LINC
complex expression to augment MSC and bone mechanosignaling within the context of aging.
If successful, we will establish, for the first time, a mechanistic understanding of how loss of LINC complex
drives decreased mechanosensory capability in aging. Completion of these aims will provide research
communities with (1) efficacy of LIV based regenerative modalities that improve LINC-mediated
mechanosignaling and (2) foundational structure-function relationship data in healthy and aged stem
cells."

10834175,"Project Summary/Abstract
Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is associated with deficits in sensory and motor function, including complete
paralysis in severe cases. Severe SCI is currently incurable as there are no medications that can reverse the
injury-related nerve tissue damage. Indeed, unlike peripheral tissues that can heal and regain function
following lacerations and contusive injuries, the spinal cord is notoriously resistant to regrowth or replacement
of neural connections with the brain after injury. The overall goal of this research is to increase understanding
of neuroregenerative mechanisms and uncover novel pharmacological targets for the treatment of SCI.
Experiments in animal models suggest that boosting the biological activity of nerve growth factors in the spinal
cord can nudge the tissue toward a program of regeneration. We have developed a strategy that could deliver
such boost using synthetic small molecule compounds. Following rational selection and screening of several
small-molecule compounds, we found several members to potently promote the regrowth of damaged nerve
cells in a tissue culture model. Some of these compounds are being used as approved drugs for other
disorders, and all six compounds are capable of crossing into the CNS from the bloodstream. The shared
biochemical properties of the compounds allowed to develop a unifying hypothesis that links the actions of
these nonpeptide neurotrophic compounds to the pathways of growth factor signaling and regenerative effects.
We believe that the logical next step is to clarify the mechanism by which these compounds work. Completion
of the experiments proposed in this project will generate results that should advance such understanding.
Thereafter, we will use the knowledge gained to begin to work toward repurposing existing medications or
designing new compounds that would promote nerve cell regrowth and repair damaged nerve connections to
treat SCI patients."

10934580,"SUMMARY – RESEARCH PROJECT
This project will characterize intra-urban inequities in the effects of extreme heat on mortality and examine
individual-level and neighborhood factors associated with these inequities in five cities of the Americas, one of
the most urbanized and unequal regions of the world. Understanding these inequities is critical for the
development of urban policies and practices aimed at reducing the inequitable impacts of climate change in
diverse urban populations. The combination of high levels of urbanization and associated heat island effect, an
aging population, and extreme levels of inequality and economic and racial residential segregation makes
urban populations in the region particularly susceptible to the effects of climate change. However intra-urban
inequities associated with neighborhood and individual-level characteristics have not been systematically
examined across multiple settings. A better understanding of how inequities in the impacts of heat on health
vary across cities and countries is critical to adaptation policies and strategies and for targeting of resources.
The overall goal of this project is to conduct policy-relevant climate change and health research across multiple
countries in the Americas by studying inequities in the impact of extreme heat in five cities in four
countries: Philadelphia (USA), São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), Guatemala City (Guatemala), and
Panama City (Panama). We will investigate both neighborhood and individual-level factors and disentangle
equity impacts of differential exposure to heat and differential effects of heat using a novel approach we will
develop in collaboration with the Research and Capacity Building Core. We will leverage expertise on health
disparities, biostatistics, urban planning, and policy translation at the Drexel Urban Health Collaborative (UHC)
and our partners in this project (UC Berkeley, INCAP, and University of São Paulo). We will accomplish the
following aims: 1) estimate intra-city heterogeneity in the temperature-mortality association; 2) investigate
associations of neighborhood social, built, and natural environment factors with differential heat impacts on
mortality; and 3) study the differential impact of heat on mortality by age, gender, race/ethnicity, and education.
We will contribute to the data infrastructure created by the Administrative Core, advance methods development
and training in partnership with the Research Capacity Building Core, and coordinate engagement of
policymakers with the Community Engagement Core. Specifically, we will develop dissemination and
engagement strategies using the results of our research projects that will influence policy in the cities of
interest but also inform future dissemination and engagement efforts. In addition, through this project we will
refine an approach to between- and within- city analysis from multiple countries, and conduct cross-country
multi-city comparative analyses that can be leveraged and expanded to multiple cities across Latin America
and the US in future work of the Drexel Climate Change and Urban Health Research Center."
10834875,"Difficulty retrieving words is one of the most common language complaints in individuals with stroke-
induced aphasia. The negative consequences related to word retrieval impairment include increased health
care costs and decreased quality of life. A variety of treatment approaches exist to improve word retrieval, and
most of the treatments result in immediate improvement on trained words. However, long-term improvement
and improvement on untrained words or behaviors is less common. Additionally, we currently know very little
about optimal treatment administration parameters and we know even less about predictors of treatment
response. Our current healthcare system is not resourced to provide ongoing treatment for individuals with
chronic aphasia. To make the best use of the clinical resources available for aphasia treatment, and to
maximize outcomes for Veterans with aphasia, we must: 1) develop clinically translatable treatments that yield
widespread and lasting effects and 2) develop clinically accessible ways of identifying who will acquire benefit
from a specific treatment approach. The proposed study in this Merit Review Application takes on these two
challenges by investigating dose frequency (massed vs. distributed practice) effects and identifying the
language, cognitive and neural predictors of response to Intention treatment (INT), a novel word retrieval
treatment. Our preliminary studies provide strong support for the proposed study, which we expect will
increase the efficacy, clinical translatability, and potential for use of INT as an adjuvant to other word retrieval
treatments. From a broader perspective, our results will help guide selection of the right treatment for the right

10834876,"The striatum is critically important to health and well-being, and to our ability to adapt behaviorally to our
environment. As the great input-output center of the basal ganglia, the striatum receives projections from all
parts of the neocortex including mood-related areas connecting to specialized striatal zones called striosomes,
and sensorimotor areas projecting to action control circuits, involving mainly the other compartment, the matrix.
Crucially, the striatum is the main target of the tract input carrying dopamine (DA) from the substantia nigra pars
compacta (SNc), which degenerates in Parkinson’s disease. Striosomes project back to the SNc, so as to form
the nigro-striato-nigral loop famed in the clinic. The DA SNc cells not only modulate movement initiation, but also
mood, vigor, learning and decision-making. The ‘return’ striatonigral tract mainly arises in striosomes. Thus
striosomes are strategically wired to directly influence these DA neurons. Due to formidable technical hurdles,
the functions of this critical part of the nigro-striato-nigral loop remain unclear. Yet, there are clues about the
functions. Previous studies suggest that striosomes could process mood-related cortical information and send
the resultant neural signals to DA neurons in SNc. Models suggest, among others, that striosomes could serve
as critics in actor-critic reinforcement learning models. However, critically lacking is the understanding of the
relationship between the striosome-matrix axis—striosomes (S) receiving limbic, and the surrounding matrix (M)
receiving sensorimotor/associative cortical inputs—and the D1-D2 axis of the striatum—composed of direct (D1)
movement-promoting striatal projection neurons (dSPNs) and indirect (D2) movement-suppressing iSPNs, due
to the lack of experimental tools to dissociate the two axes. We have overcome some of the technical hurdles
and propose to address these issues guided by our overarching hypotheses, that the cortico-striosomal circuit
gates the state transitions of brain networks underlying mood, motivation, or vigor of action; that this circuit
modulates learning processes through its powerful connections with DA-containing SNc neurons; and that
striosome-dopamine circuits can adjust functional balance across distinct SPN subtypes with identities
multiplexed across S-M compartments and D1-D2 pathways. We will use intersect methods in mice to dissect
individual SPN subtypes according to their D1-D2 and S-M identities, DA sensors to measure DA release under
the control of the striatonigral path, and chemogenetics to manipulate each component of the nigro-striato-nigral
circuit so as to assess its causal role in behavior. Thus, we are fully equipped, standing on our groundworks that
found that cost-benefit, approach-avoidance conflict recruit the cortico-striosomal circuit, that identified by
snRNA-seq differential gene-expression patterns of individual SPN subtypes, and that have developed strategies
for simultaneously recording and individually manipulating the SPN subtypes. This work is directly in line with
the goals of the NIMH to advance human health and well-beings by directly addressing profoundly important
gaps in knowledge about key functional circuits affected in a range of mental health disorders."

The small vessel diseases of the brain are responsible not only for ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes but also
vascular cognitive impairment and dementia, major sources of disability and death in older adults. Despite the
fact that hypertensive cerebral small vessel disease (HTN-cSVD) is the most common type of brain
microangiopathy, the mechanisms linking this condition to brain tissue injury and cognitive impairment are
unknown, therefore no specific preventive or therapeutic method targeting physiopathological processes exist.
We propose a systematic, multidisciplinary analysis of the mechanisms underlying HTN-cSVD related
cerebrovascular dysfunction, impaired perivascular clearance and their connections to brain damage including
pathological amyloid/tau protein accumulations. The unique patient cohort is composed of nondemented
survivors of a hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (HTN-ICH), a well-characterized indicator of severe HTN-
cSVD. Specific experiments are designed to compare advanced physiological MRI measures of vascular
reactivity and vascular compliance between patients with HTN-ICH and healthy older adults in addition to
delineating the relationship of vascular dysfunction with established markers of HTN-cSVD [Specific Aim (SA)
1a and 1b]. These experiments are geared towards testing the hypothesis that HTN-cSVD causes vascular
dysfunction which in turn might mediate larger-scale brain tissue injury. The second set of experiments will test
the potential effects of HTN-cSVD on accumulation of amyloid and tau proteins in the brain, answering the key
question of whether decreased clearance related to small vessel dysfunction might contribute to the
accumulation of these pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s Disease (SA 2a and 2b). The third set of studies
will analyze the effects of vascular, structural and molecular changes on cognition using both cross-sectional
and longitudinal assessments (SA 3a and 3b). The proposal builds on a wide range of cutting-edge
methodologic advances such as multimodal physiological imaging with 7T ultrahigh field functional MRI,
molecular Aß and tau PET imaging, and the use of state-of-the-art structural imaging markers of HTN-cSVD.
Successful completion of the proposed highly translational experiments will determine the physiological and
molecular mechanisms of brain tissue damage related to HTN-cSVD and the impact of these processes on
cognition. These results will represent a major step towards understanding the contributions of the most
common vascular brain disease (HTN-cSVD) to dementia, thereby allowing design of clinical trials aimed at
preserving or enhancing vascular function using validated imaging markers of the vascular physiology."

10836430,"A central goal of neurobiology is to understand how the brain forms, stores, retrieves, modifies and
encodes information, and to determine how these operations go awry in neurological and psychiatric
diseases. The focus of this application is astrocytes, a type of glia. Long considered simply the brain's
glue, astrocytes are emerging as important regulators of neuronal function. Astrocytes are ubiquitous,
highly branched cells that tile the entire central nervous system, making contacts with neurons and blood
vessels, and serving diverse roles. Established roles include ion homeostasis, neurotransmitter
clearance, synapse formation/removal, synaptic modulation and contributions to neurovascular coupling.
Deciphering and exploiting the physiological roles of astrocytes in the brain is one of the major open
questions in neuroscience. This R35 application seeks to exploit technical and conceptual advances
made with R01, R21 and DP1 awards and combine them into a single nimble, long-term research
program to systematically explore and comprehensively understand the fundamental biology of
astrocytes within adult vertebrate intact neural circuits with the compass-driven goal of exploiting this
information for advancing new therapies. In this context, we define dysfunction as astrocyte process
withdrawal from synapses or altered astrocyte signaling, including trophic support, to synapses. Such
dysfunctions would alter established astrocyte roles including neurotransmitter clearance, synapse
regulation and maintenance. This in turn would alter the timing of synaptic transmission and microcircuit
function, contribute to excitotoxicity and perhaps trigger synapse removal. By exploiting novel
experimental tools and concepts generated as part of DP1 and R21 awards, and by applying them to the
exemplar striatal microcircuitry studied as part of successive R01 awards, we will determine how
astrocytes regulate intact neural microcircuits in vivo. We will test the overarching hypothesis that
astrocytes represent a hitherto largely overlooked mechanism in neural circuit function and in
neurological disorders. As part of these efforts, we will utilize, and if necessary develop, state-of-the-art
tools for molecular, cellular and circuit levels of evaluation. As described herein, our long-term
programmatic goal, therefore, is to deliver pivotal molecular, physiological and mechanistic insights on
astrocyte contributions to brain function and disease, laying the groundwork for therapeutic advances to
occur. We will continue to share openly our database resources and tools in order to enable additional
advances by others. In addition, the research program represents an outstanding opportunity and
laboratory environment for training the next generation of scientists and physician-scientists."
10836431,"Project Summary:
 A longstanding and fundamental question of neural development in sensory pathways is: What is the
role of the organization of the sensory epithelium in establishing central topographic organization? In the
auditory system a direct approach to addressing this question has been elusive because it has not been
possible to manipulate the input to the brain from the auditory periphery without either complete ablation of the
inner ear or induction of hearing dysfunction. The proposed experiments will establish for the first time, a model
of repatterned frequency representation in the chick inner ear by utilizing a new genetic manipulation in
embryos. This manipulation takes advantage of the known genetic factors that establish the organization of the
ear at a very early developmental stage that precedes the auditory nerve innervation of the central nervous
system. By overexpressing one of these factors, bone morphogenic protein 7 (BMP7), inner ears develop
almost exclusively low frequency hair cell phenotypes. In the first brain structure to receive auditory nerve
input, the cochlear nucleus, neurons express a number of well characterized biophysical and morphological
specializations for processing sound in specific frequencies. Frequency specific tuning is topographically
mapped in both the ear and auditory brain regions, a feature known as 'tonotopy.' Thus, neural specialization
occurs along an orderly tonotopic map in the cochlear nucleus. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that
tonotopic refinement of specializations in the cochlear nucleus is developmentally determined by patterned
input from the inner ear, and is not independently induced by local cues in the developing brain. This
hypothesis is now testable using animals with tonotopically altered inner ears. The first aim of this proposal is
to examine whether the BMP7 manipulation indeed induces repatterning of hair cell tuning mechanism in the
inner ear. The second aim investigates the electrical input response properties of cochlear nucleus neurons in
animals that have developed with tonotopically altered inner ears. Finally, the third aim will investigate the
dependence of cochlear nucleus structure on normal topographic innervation from the auditory nerve. These
research objectives, if successful, will provide new insights into the mechanisms that establish the functional
organization of auditory structures. Revelation of these mechanisms may be informative to optimization
strategies for therapeutic interventions in early deafness or hearing loss that aim to preserve normal function
and capacity in auditory circuitry."
10836433,"Aggression—acting with the intent to inflict harm—is a universal component of social behavior, and all too often
the grim subject of the daily news. One of the most reliable triggers of aggression is frustration, or failing to
achieve an expected reward. This state can be adaptive, energizing behaviors to overcome barriers. But it can
also lead to anger and violence. In disorders as disparate as PTSD, bipolar disorder, and autism, low frustration
tolerance and uncontrolled aggression are among the most prevalent and impairing symptoms in psychiatry. Yet
the neurobiology of these behaviors is poorly understood, and current treatment options are grossly inadequate.
This proposal aims to define the role of two neuromodulators—dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5HT)—in the
neural response to frustrating events. In Aim 1, the candidate will create a mouse model of frustration by
combining conditioning tasks with the resident-intruder assay, in which an intruder mouse is added to a
resident’s cage to elicit aggression. On test days, the conditioning task will end with an unexpectedly negative
outcome, eliciting greater aggression from the resident mouse. In Aim 2, the candidate will use fiber photometry
and optogenetics to record and manipulate DA neuron activity and DA release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc)
while mice perform the frustration task. DA is a key modulator of motivated behaviors, and has long been
considered pro-aggressive. Few studies, however, have recorded DA during frustration or aggression. This
experiment will test whether DA release tonically increases with frustration, triggering aggression. In Aim 3, the
candidate will use fiber photometry and optogenetics to record and manipulate 5HT neuron activity and 5HT
release in the NAc during the frustration task. Unlike DA, 5HT is thought to inhibit behavior, including
aggression. But 5HT neurons have not been recorded during aggression. This Aim will test the hypothesis that
5HT release decreases with frustration, and that larger decreases facilitate greater aggression.
The proposed studies would be among the first to examine the neural circuit mechanisms of frustration. In the
process, the candidate will supplement his background in electrophysiology in head-fixed animals to become
proficient in social behaviors and calcium imaging. He will work with an advisory committee comprising world
leaders in human (Dr. Emil Coccaro) and rodent (Dr. Klaus Miczek) aggression, frustration (Dr. Ellen
Leibenluft), and 5HT (Dr. Liqun Luo), in addition to his primary mentor Dr. Rob Malenka and his career
development mentor Dr. Alan Schatzberg. He will take full advantage of the intellectually vibrant environment
at Stanford and supplement his technical training with high-quality didactic and professional training via
frequent mentor interactions, targeted coursework, and other career and intellectual growth opportunities. By
the end of the fellowship, the candidate will be positioned to launch a career as an independent investigator
leading a translational research program on the neural basis of aggression and irritability."
10836557,"Abstract
 Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a unique type of breast cancer that does not express or
overexpress estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2. During the past several decades,
the standard care of TNBC remains the highly toxic chemotherapy with little progress in more effective treatments.
To address the urgent unmet need to develop targeted therapies specific for TNBC, we developed a totally
protein-based nanoplatform called ProNano that is composed of two recombinant proteins, including the first an
elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) nanocore that displays multiple calmodulin-binding short peptides on the surface,
and the second a recombinant calmodulin protein genetically fused with a highly stable and modular protein
domain possessing either tumor homing or therapeutic features. The docking of the ELP nanocore with a TNBC-
targeting module together with a functional module with therapeutic feature results in bifunctional ProNanos that
can be used for tumor-homing delivery of therapeutic agents for the combination therapy for TNBC. Three
specific aims will be pursued in this project. The first specific aim is to develop a ProNano platform that allows
tunable targeting of TNBC cells based on their surface antigen expression profiles. The second specific aim is
to develop a bifunctional ProNano platform that allows tumor-specific blockade of the aberrant Wnt signaling for
the treatment of TNBC. The third specific aim is to develop a bifunctional ProNano platform that allows tumor-
specific inhibition of the ENPP1-catalyzed hydrolysis of extracellular cGAMP for combination immunotherapy of
TNBC. The bifunctional ProNano platforms developed in this project have several major advantages over
conventional nanoplatforms, including all protein components each can be precisely and genetically engineered,
oriented and self-assembled introduction of both tumor homing and/or therapeutic moieties at desired ratios
without need of any chemical conjugation, and use of highly stable and easily expressed modular polypeptides
with no or low immunogenicity. Although we focus on the targeted treatment for TNBC, the ProNano platforms
developed in this project can be easily adapted to address other cancer types simply by changing the tumor
targeting module."
10836561,"The detrimental effects of prenatal alcohol exposure, including cognitive, behavioral, and physical impacts,
have been well documented over several decades. They include long-standing effects on multiple domains of
function. Alcohol-affected individuals often go unrecognized. In addition, wait times for evaluation can be quite
long, further delaying the accurate identification of affected individuals. Effective online screening tools can
decrease wait times and streamline evaluations in specialty clinics.
Prenatal alcohol exposure continues to represent a significant public health concern and increased efforts at
documenting risk, improving identification, and providing clinically-efficient tools are paramount. As such, the
overarching aim of this proposal is to improve the screening for prenatal alcohol exposure and fetal alcohol
spectrum disorder (FASD) by deploying web-based tools that aid in clinical evaluation. Two main tools will be
used, the FASD-Tree and the Brief Assessment of Individual Neurobehavior – online version (BRAIN-online).
Both tools use web-based technology for collecting data and provide the clinician with information about the
individual’s physical, behavioral, and cognitive attributes. Specifically, the FASD-Tree records physical and
behavioral data, and BRAIN-online measures impulsivity, attention, problem-solving, processing speed,
memory, spatial working memory, and set-shifting.
To achieve the aims of this study, child subjects (6-17y) will be evaluated using either the combination of
FASD-Tree and BRAIN-online or BRAIN-online alone (Aim 1-3). Parents will complete online questionnaires
regarding their child’s background, demographics, and behavior and some children will be given a
standardized in-person neuropsychological test battery. In Aim 1, we will examine the relation between
FASD-Tree and BRAIN-online, including classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for each tool and
their combination. In Aim 2, data from these novel tools will be combined with traditional and advanced (e.g.,
MorpheusQ and 3D facial imaging) physical measurements collected through other CIFASD projects. The
combination of measures used in the proposed research will result in a convenient, scalable, and cost-effective
adjunct to standard diagnostic tools."

10836388,"Background: Nearly 80% of Veterans meet criteria for overweight (body mass index [BMI] of 25-29.9 kg/m2) or
obesity (BMI≥30). VA offers three evidence-based obesity treatments at little to no cost to Veterans: MOVE! (to
improve dietary intake and physical activity through behavioral modification); obesity medications; and bariatric
surgery, but all are significantly underutilized: <10% of Veterans with obesity participate in MOVE!; 2% receive
obesity medications; and 0.3% of those who meet BMI criteria for bariatric surgery (BMI≥35) undergo it. There
is an urgent need to increase use of all three treatments to improve Veteran health.
Significance/Impact: Nearly 4,000,000 Veterans meet BMI criteria for overweight/obesity. It is essential that
Veterans with overweight/obesity are aware of the three treatment options and are motivated to pursue them.
Currently, no interventions in VA seek to increase use of all three evidence-based obesity treatment options for
Veterans not currently participating in MOVE!. The TOTAL intervention (Teaching Obesity Treatment Options to
Adults Learners), if effective, would increase obesity treatment initiation for Veterans, lead to greater weight loss,
and improve quality of life. Given that TOTAL is deliverable via VA telemedicine, it could be implemented
throughout the VA healthcare system without requiring significant resources and could be integrated into the
existing VA behavioral weight management program, MOVE!.
Innovation: The research in this proposal would be the first adequately powered RCT in VA testing an
intervention to increase use of all three evidence-based obesity treatments: MOVE!, obesity medications, and
bariatric surgery. It would leverage the power of the VA electronic health record and would improve access to
care by expanding use of a recently developed telemedicine technology – VA Video Connect (VVC) – which was
developed by VA researchers. It could be implemented and disseminated efficiently within VA given that MOVE!
is available at every VAMC and is supported by NCP.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Compare the effectiveness of TOTAL vs. usual care for increasing obesity treatment
initiation among Veterans with overweight/obesity who are not participating in MOVE!; Aim 2: Compare the
effectiveness of TOTAL vs. usual care for increasing sustained MOVE! participation, receipt of an obesity
medication prescription or bariatric surgery referral, and weight loss; Aim 3: Inform future dissemination efforts
of TOTAL via interviews with key stakeholders, a “Reach” analysis, and cost analysis.
Methodology: Study population: Veterans at two VAMCs, age 18-75 with a BMI ≥30 or 27-29.9 + an obesity-
related comorbidity who have not had a MOVE! visit within the past 12 months and thus are not participating in
obesity treatment will participate in the RCT; Intervention: The TOTAL intervention consists of an 18-minute
obesity treatment educational video and three motivational sessions (all delivered via VA Video Connect [VVC]);
Comparison: Usual care (Veterans who have not had a MOVE! visit in the previous 12 months); Outcomes:
MOVE! initiation, sustained MOVE! participation, obesity medication use, bariatric surgery referral, weight
change; Timing: Primary and secondary outcomes will be measured 18 months post-randomization.
Implementation/Next Steps: Facilitators and barriers to TOTAL implementation will be assessed in Aim 3
interviews with Veteran, provider, and operations stakeholders using the Consolidated Framework for
Implementation Research (CFIR). [We will also perform “reach” and cost analyses. We will collaborate with NCP
to disseminate TOTAL to all VAMCs that have a MOVE! program. The National MOVE! Director will present
study results on a national MOVE! call and make presentation materials available on the national MOVE!
SharePoint dissemination site. The National MOVE! Director will support MOVE! coordinators who work directly
with health behavior coordinators at every VAMC with MOVE!. The study team will consider partnering with NCP
to conduct a QUERI National Partnered Evaluation evaluating how TOTAL can be implemented throughout VA."
10836390,"Background: Evidence of risks for serious adverse outcomes and limited benefit of long-term opioid therapy
(LTOT) have driven VA recommendations for LTOT tapering or discontinuation when benefits no longer
outweigh harms. However, LTOT tapering may also pose risks of harm. Significance: The study addresses a
critical need for clear demonstration of LTOT tapering risks and a specific VA call for evaluation of
nonpharmacological pain treatments including complementary and integrative health services (NPM/CIH). The
goals of this project are to assess the role of NPM/CIH use in effecting safe and clinically meaningful
reductions in LTOT regimens for Veterans with chronic pain. Changes in outcomes associated with two major
periods -- the implementation of the Whole Health System of care (WHS) and COVID-19 – will be assessed.
Innovation and Impact: In ongoing partnership with the Office of Patient-Centered Care and Cultural
Transformation (OPCC&CT), the study will broaden the scope of ongoing NPM/CIH evaluation to include
outcomes related to substance dependence and addiction. Partnering with Pharmacy Benefits Management
Services’ VA Center for Medication Safety (MedSAFE), informed by new pilot data, our team will be one of the
first to apply a novel method to optimize determination of LTOT tapering to improve analyses of tapering-
related outcomes. The study will inform clinical guidelines addressing multimodal approaches to tapering.
Specific Aims are to (1) Characterize NPM/CIH access and utilization among Veterans with LTOT,
considering the impact of implementation of the VHA Whole Health System of Care and COVID-19; (2)
Compare the effectiveness and safety of opioid tapering for Veterans with LTOT with and without NPM/CIH; (3)
Assess the moderating effect of buprenorphine on NPM/CIH effects on outcomes. We hypothesize that use of
NPM/CIH will be associated with higher rates of effectiveness and safety, and that use of buprenorphine will be
associated with more positive effects of NPM/CIH on these outcomes.
Methodology: The project will identify a retrospective cohort between 2016-2020 of approximately 200,000
Veterans receiving LTOT at ≥ 30 mg morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD) across 54 VA facilities.
Leveraging Veterans Health Administration (VHA) electronic health record data, Veterans’ utilization of
NPM/CIH within VHA and in the community will be assessed. Applying a novel method developed by VA
MedSAFE using VHA electronic pharmacy data within the Corporate Data Warehouse, we will develop models
of opioid tapering within the target period. Using quasi-experimental methods, Veterans will be “assigned” to
NPM/CIH treatment or no treatment based on their observed service utilization. Propensity score matching will
balance baseline differences due to nonrandom assignment. In multilevel models, opioid tapering outcomes
will be modeled as a function of NPM/CIH use. The primary tapering effectiveness outcome will be the
proportion of Veterans achieving a reduction in prescribed opioid dose of ≥50% of baseline mg MEDD,
maintained over six months in the absence of worsened pain intensity. Tapering safety will be measured as the
proportion of Veterans experiencing any serious adverse event (SAE), allowing tapering to take all values,
including no taper and dose increases. SAE will include hospitalization, emergency department visit, opioid
overdose, new mental health disorder, new opioid or other substance use disorder, suicide attempt, and all-
cause mortality. Models will assess moderation of NPM/CIH effects by buprenorphine treatment for opioid
tapering and for chronic pain. Secondary models will assess the effect of NPM/CIH on LTOT-related side
effects and differences in NPM/CIH effect by age, race/ethnicity and gender. Next Steps/Implementation:
Operational partners and a Veteran engagement panel will guide interpretation of results and promote
dissemination and translation to practice. Results will inform an implementation study to support the scale-up
and sustainment of effective practices for pain management and facilitating safe and effective opioid reduction."
10836496,"Mutations in the gene that encodes the skeletal muscle type I ryanodine receptor (RYR1) result in a wide range
of muscle disorders that collectively comprise the most common cause of non-dystrophic myopathy. The most
severe cases of RYR1-related myopathy (RYR1-RM) exhibit a recessive pattern of inheritance and present in
infancy with muscle hypotrophy, weakness, respiratory insufficiency, short stature, and a marked reduction in
RYR1 protein expression in muscle. Despite their severity, high prevalence and association with significant
disability and early mortality, there are no treatments or disease-modifying therapies for RYR1-RM. A major
barrier to therapy development has been the lack of an animal model that mirrors the early onset and clinical
severity of recessive RYR1-RM. To overcome this barrier, we developed two mouse models of recessive
RYR1-RM that pheno-copy key characteristics of the human disorder including myofiber hypotrophy, reduced
muscle/body mass, muscle weakness, markedly reduced RYR1 expression, and premature death.
The scientific premise of this proposal is that these new mouse models of RYR1-RM provide a unique
opportunity to explore the underlying patho-mechanisms of RYR1-RM and test the therapeutic efficacy of
mechanism-based interventions. The overall goal of the project is to elucidate the patho-mechanisms
responsible for muscle dysfunction in recessive RYR1-RM and to develop and validate effective treatments.
We hypothesize that reduced folding/stability of mutated RYR1 homotetramers results in increased RYR1
protein degradation that markedly reduces RYR1 expression, and that even a modest increase in either RYR1
expression or function will ameliorate the myopathy and prolong survival. Furthermore, we also hypothesize
that reduced myofiber size in RYR1-RM is a key aspect of disease pathogenesis, that hypotrophy is due to
epigenetic abnormalities, and that drugs that target the epigenome or promote muscle growth can ameliorate
the disease phenotype. The validity of these hypotheses will rigorously evaluated in three specific aims.
Aim 1 will characterize RYR1 expression, function and myopathy in two mouse models of severe, recessive
RYR1-RM and assess the therapeutic potential of systemic treatment with ebselen, an FDA-approved drug
and known RYR1 activator. Aim 2 will elucidate the mechanism(s) for reduced RYR1 expression in our mouse
models of RYR1-RM mice and evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of systemic treatment with a chemical
chaperone and ER stress inhibitor (4PBA). Aim 3 will determine the mechanisms leading to muscle hypotrophy
in RYR1-RM mice and test the potential of treatment with either HDAC inhibitors or modulators of myofiber
size. The results of these studies will provide novel insights into the patho-mechanisms responsible for
reduced RYR1 expression and muscle fiber hypotrophy in recessive RYR1-RM and determine the therapeutic
potential of several mechanism-based interventions designed to enhance RYR1 function, reduce RYR1
degradation, and limit muscle hypotrophy in pre-clinical models of recessive RYR1-RM."
10836407,"Abstract
Although the adverse effects associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) are well known, many women
continue to drink heavily during pregnancy, putting their infants at risk for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.
Given the limited effectiveness of psychosocial and informational interventions, there is a growing interest in
new approaches, such as nutritional interventions, that may be more effective. Animal studies have shown that
choline supplementation during the equivalent of the 3rd trimester in humans can mitigate effects of PAE on
growth and development. However, findings from studies in humans to date have been inconsistent and
difficult to interpret. Choline, an essential nutrient, serves as a methyl-group donor for DNA methylation and is
a constituent of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and a precursor to major components of cell membranes. In
an R21 feasibility trial, 70 heavy drinkers were randomly assigned to receive a daily dose of 2g of choline or a
placebo from time of enrollment in antenatal care until delivery. Participants were recruited from the Cape
Coloured (mixed ancestry) community in Cape Town, South Africa, where the incidence of heavy drinking during
pregnancy and fetal alcohol syndrome are among the highest in the world. Infants in the choline-treated arm
were more likely to meet criterion for eyeblink conditioning than those in the placebo arm. Infants born to both
the choline- and placebo-treated mothers were small at birth, but those in the choline arm showed
considerable catch-up growth in weight and head circumference by 6.5 mo, which persisted through 12 mo. At
12 mo, infants in the choline arm showed markedly better recognition memory compared to placebo-treated on
the Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence, which is known to have predictive validity for school-age IQ. Key features
of this study included the higher choline dose (4.4 times adequate intake (AI), compared to 1.7-2.5 in previous
human studies) and initiation of treatment early in pregnancy. We propose to recruit heavy drinking pregnant
women from a rural Cape Coloured community to participate in a fully-powered, double-blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled choline supplementation trial (1) to assess the effectiveness of maternal choline
supplementation during pregnancy to mitigate effects of PAE on three primary outcomes: infant recognition
memory and postnatal growth restriction (weight and head circumference); (2) to assess the efficacy of this
supplementation for mitigating alcohol effects on the following secondary outcomes: infant eyeblink
conditioning, postnatal length, and information processing speed; (3) to use innovative methods from causal
inference analysis to examine protocol adherence as an important source of variation in treatment efficacy and
to identify socio-demographic factors associated with non-compliance in order to facilitate implementation of
the intervention protocol in clinical settings; and (4) in exploratory analyses, to examine whether maternal
choline supplementation is particularly effective in women with lower dietary choline intake or poor nutritional
status.

10836408,"PUBLIC HEALTH ABSTRACT
 Co-use of alcohol and opioid medications is known to be a serious health/safety hazard—yet persists
despite these negative ramifications. With limited information available within peer-reviewed literature, large-
scale system and clinical research have demonstrated 24-38% of those with alcohol use disorders also have an
opioid addiction, with rates of past 30-day opioid medication misuse among those seeking alcohol treatment as
high as 68%. Our research has shown that among community pharmacy patients receiving opioid medications
for pain management, approximately 20-30% are engaged in co-use of alcohol. Community pharmacy is a highly
valuable but underutilized resource and setting for identification and intervention to address the US opioid epi-
demic. We propose to adapt, manualize, and test the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of an
Alcohol-targeted Brief Intervention-Medication Therapy Management (ABI-MTM) intervention with community
pharmacy patients. ABI-MTM will be a pharmacy-based medication management intervention, combined with
Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to treatment that will target: (1) alcohol use elimination during opioid
treatment OR (2) non-opioid pain management substitution (in consultation with the prescriber). We will conduct
a small-scale trial in 3 community pharmacy locations wherein we will randomize patients with heavy alcohol use
and with non-heavy alcohol use (1-to-1 ratio) to ABI-MTM (n=20) or standard medication counseling (SMC,
n=20). Results will demonstrate intervention acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy. This study will also
work to identify pharmacy system and practice-level barriers and facilitators for universal alcohol screening and
intervention among opioid recipients. We will develop a mixed methods assessment guide to interview pharmacy
technicians (N=20), pharmacists (N=20), and corporate leaders (N=20). Interviews will assess perceptions to-
wards screening/intervention, internal organizational challenges, and processes related to ABI-MTM implemen-
tation for large-scale research and practice. Altogether, results of this study will provide critical insights, founda-
tional data, and strategies for executing a powered trial and possible future system/practice-level implementation."
10836538,"Although the impact of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on early development has been well established,
the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis suggests there may be longer-
term consequences that increase the risk for adult diseases or disorders. Previously, it has been difficult
to isolate the effects of PAE from those associated with other life experiences in affected individuals so
that, often, the role of PAE may be overlooked. In fact, viewed from this context, PAE may be considered
the first in a series of adverse exposures that result, eventually, in a higher risk for negative outcomes in
this vulnerable population. Programing of fetal systems by PAE may alter the developmental trajectory
and result in a sensitized organism that is vulnerable to later life challenges. The endocrine and immune
systems have been found to be highly susceptible to programming by early life events, and together are
thought to play key roles in linking early life adverse exposures with long-term health and functional
outcomes. Thus, programming of these systems may be one mechanism by which PAE impacts adult
health and neurobehavioral outcomes. In our ongoing CIFASD4 research negative impacts of PAE on
physical and mental health outcomes in midlife were observed and attributable to both PAE and to
associated early life adversity and social factors. Also noted were long-lasting, adverse changes in
immune function, with inflammation starting in infancy and lasting into adulthood, suggesting an
increased inflammatory burden over the life course. In the proposed study, we will test a “multiple hit”
hypothesis that PAE results in a vulnerable organism that may be further impacted by social adversity
and lack of resources/coping skills, resulting in immune and endocrine dysregulation that in turn, may be
key drivers of early-onset health and neurobehavioral problems over the life course. 360 individuals
representing a diverse sample of affected individuals from three sites, Atlanta, Seattle, and Canada, will
participate in a quasi-experimental study of PAE effects in midlife. In addition to measuring PAE/FASD
and environmental conditions, we will use state-of-the-art methodologies to identify biomarkers
(inflammatory, angiogenesis, vascular injury, metabolic, and neurodegenerative markers, transcriptional
profiling of individual cells, and telomere length) of early-onset functional deficits including both physical
and mental health. Specifically, within the context of the negative effects of social adversity and the
positive influences of social resources and coping skills, we will evaluate: Aim 1. the role of immune and
endocrine dysregulation in physical and mental health outcomes in adults with FASD/PAE; Aim 2 the
impact of PAE and the possible role of PAE-induced immune and endocrine dysregulation on
neurocognitive performance and markers of early-onset functional deficits in adults with FASD/PAE in
comparison to age-matched controls and healthy older individuals."

Plasmodium vivax threatens half of the world’s population and is surprisingly resilient to on-going malaria
elimination efforts, partially due to its unique characteristics and our poor understanding of its biology. Here, we
propose to conduct state-of-the-art transcriptomic analyses using materials derived directly from Cambodian
patients to rigorously assess the importance of red blood cell polymorphisms, host immunity and parasite factors
in modulating the efficacy of red blood cell invasion and P. vivax intraerythrocytic development. Our studies will
not only provide a better understanding of the fundamental molecular and cellular processes underlying blood
stage P. vivax infections but will also provide a solid foundation to develop better malaria vaccines against this
important but understudied human pathogen."
10840969,"The central nervous system (CNS) changes throughout life, and its interactions with the world produce activity-
dependent plasticity that enables it to acquire and maintain useful behaviors. Recent scientiﬁc and technical
advances support the development of systems that create novel interactions with the CNS that can induce and
guide beneﬁcial plasticity. These systems, called adaptive neurotechnologies, measure signals from the CNS and
concurrent behavior, derive from those signals the state of the CNS, and adaptively provide real-time feedback
that can restore, replace, enhance, supplement or improve CNS functions impaired by injury or disease. Thus,
they can provide important new therapies for neurological disorders.
 The development and use of adaptive neurotechnologies is an inherently multidisciplinary endeavor. The
integration of knowledge and ideas from these diverse areas, and their implementation by highly sophisticated
software/hardware systems, requires substantial time, effort, and multidisciplinary expertise. This slows progress
in research and development of adaptive neurotechnologies and limits the number of groups that are successful in
realizing these technologies. The present proposal seeks to address these two major problems.
 Over the past 18 years, we have developed and disseminated a software platform, called BCI2000, that
supports interactions with the CNS and can implement a wide range of adaptive neurotechnologies. To date,
we have provided it to more than 6,000 users worldwide who have used it to support experiments described
in over 1,200 peer-reviewed publications. Despite this demonstrated value, BCI2000 adoption is limited by the
requirements of substantial programming expertise and in-depth understanding of BCI2000 concepts needed to
adapt and integrate BCI2000 into the speciﬁc experimental protocols and hardware technologies of a particular
laboratory. Thus, most research groups cannot take advantage of the advantages provided by BCI2000. We
propose to address this deﬁciency by simplifying the task of conﬁguring BCI2000 for all major classes of adaptive
neurotechnology experiments (Aim 1), and by providing a succinct introductory course and on-site training for
scientists, engineers, and clinicians (Aim 2). We hypothesize that this work will greatly accelerate realization of
adaptive neurotechnologies that will reduce the devastating impact of neurological disorders.
 Achieving these two aims will create and disseminate a major new software resource for adaptive neurotechnol-
ogy research. Its unique utility should enable more scientists, engineers, and clinicians to engage in this exciting
work. Furthermore, this common, interoperable, readily adopted, and easily adapted platform should foster a
collaborative environment that enables diverse investigators to work together and complement each other. In sum,
we expect that the work of this proposal will accelerate realization of novel adaptive neurotechnologies that will
hasten scientiﬁc investigations to improve treatment for many devastating neurological disorders."
10840837,"Project Summary
 Bacterial Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS) “effector” proteins are the primary virulence factors that guide
the progression of numerous Gram-negative bacterial infectious diseases. Recent studies have estimated that
a single pathogen delivers up to 250 unique effector proteins directly into host cells. Collectively, these
virulence factors suppress host innate immune responses and facilitate bacterial replication, dissemination,
and disease progression. Therefore, determining how bacterial effector proteins control host intracellular
communication pathways at the structural, biochemical, and cellular level is an ongoing challenge in infectious
disease research. This proposal seeks to reveal a structural and functional understanding of these host-
pathogen relationships. Prior to this proposal, we identified a class of bacterial E3-ubiquitin ligases that
protects the human pathogen Shigella flexneri from the innate immune system activation and execution of
bacterial lysis. Here, we will specifically examine the molecular mechanism for bacterial regulation of the
newly identified Gasdermin-family of mammalian pore forming cytolysins. This includes determining how
Gasdermins function to suppress Shigella flexneri at the molecular and cellular level (Aim 1). We will also
examine this host-pathogen interaction at atomic level resolution by solving the effector-Gasdermin structure
using X-ray crystallography (Aim 2). The resulting structure-based theories will be tested in murine models of
Gasdermin function that are designed to evaluate mucosal immune protection against a broad spectrum of
enteric pathogens (Aim 3). Developing new drugs that target bacterial effector – host enzyme complexes would
be an innovative approach to combat emerging infectious disease. While this idea holds great potential, the
paucity of mechanistic information gleaned from virulence factor structure/function studies has so far hampered
their development as suitable drug targets. As a means to this end, these studies will allow us to predict new
mechanisms of action for understudied Shigella effector proteins, and provide a glimpse into the structural-
based evolutionary progression of a related pathogen groups."
10842284,"Project Summary/Abstract
Humans possess extraordinary flexibility in our behavior: Given the same environmental input, we can act
differently depending on our goals and the context. For example, when facing the same data, we can process
them differently depending on our goals (e.g., visualize the data to obtain a figure, perform statistical analysis
to test a prediction, or even delete the data if the goal is to free storage space). To date, research on this topic
has focused on how such flexible behavior is implemented via cognitive control, which is a set of cognitive
mechanisms supporting goal-directed and top-down modulation on information processing in the brain. In other
words, much research has been conducted to study how a task is executed. However, less is known about
where such task knowledge is from, that is, the mnemonic mechanisms that encode, reinforce, and generalize
the neural representations of task knowledge. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial to fully understand
human intelligence, as the remarkable abilities of learning and retaining task knowledge promptly and
efficiently distinguish humans from other animals and artificial intelligent agents and make us adaptive to this
ever-changing world. Furthermore, filling the knowledge gap of how we learn and remember task knowledge is
also key to understand, detect and treat task learning deficits that are common in mental disorders such as
schizophrenia and attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In this project, we will focus on the
hippocampus, a central brain structure for learning and memory. To achieve the objective of uncovering the
hippocampal contributions to task learning, six experiments are proposed using a combination of behavioral
methods and human functional magnetic resonance imaging. Specifically, Aim 1 will identify hippocampal
contribution to constructing a task representation by assembling task information and experiences to build a
task model. Aim 2 will identify how the hippocampus encodes a new task representation into a memory
network of existing representations. Aim 3 will identify how the hippocampus reshapes existing task
representations when they become associated with other tasks via compositional relations. This work is
expected to identify how the human hippocampus constructs key content of task representations (Aim 1) and
organizes multiple task representations in relation to each other (Aim 2 and 3). These findings will further our
understanding of how the hippocampus contributes to task learning, cognitive control and adaptive behavior.
This work will also have clinical impact in bridging the gap between hippocampal abnormality and task learning
deficits, which were separately observed in mental disorders such as schizophrenia and ADHD. Ultimately, this
work will have a broad impact in helping detect and treat task learning deficits."

opportunities for Center faculty, trainees, and community partners, including an innovative physical health
training series for peer support professionals (Aim 4) and build on the Center’s established R03 program by
soliciting, selecting, and administering two pilot feasibility studies per year that align with the Center’s scientific
goals and mission (Aim 5). In Aim 6, the Core will enhance the Center’s strong communication and
dissemination infrastructure through an improved Center website and expanded social media presence. In Aim
7, the Core will coordinate the use of Center and University facilities and resources, including administrative
support, to create an environment where Center project teams and faculty can maximize their scientific
productivity. It will also work with the Methods Core, through Aim 8, to evaluate the Center’s research activities
and public health impact based on milestone achievement and annual debriefings with the External Advisory
Board, Internal Steering Committee, and CAB. Last, in Aim 9, the Executive Committee will lead an annual
strategic planning process to guide the Center’s future work, including next steps for research and plans to
disseminate findings and resources to community partners. Overall, this Core will support the Center’s
innovative implementation research projects through coordinating access to resources and leading the
Center’s approaches to community engagement, health equity, training, dissemination, and evaluation."
10843611,"A transdisciplinary approach blending methods from a range of disciplines is needed to produce the evidence
required to broadly scale evidence-based interventions to improve physical health and reduce premature
mortality among individuals with serious mental illness (SMI). The Methods Core leverages the collective
expertise of a diverse group of researchers including leading experts in implementation science, clinical
research, biostatistics, epidemiology, behavioral science, organizational behavior, quality improvement,
health services and policy research, systems science, and cost effectiveness research. The Methods Core is
designed to facilitate synergies across these disciplines to support rigorous development, adaptation, and
evaluation of interventions to reduce premature mortality among individuals with SMI and implementation
strategies to bring those interventions to scale. Led by Drs. Elizabeth Stuart and Beth McGinty, the Methods
Core will leverage the study team’s deep and broad transdisciplinary expertise and take full advantage of the
resources at Johns Hopkins to ensure comprehensive operational support across the Center’s research
projects. The Core will provide leadership and support for all methodological aspects of Center research,
including design, implementation strategy development, measurement, and analysis. In addition, the Core will
develop innovative methodological approaches that will inform translation of evidence-based interventions to
improve physical health among people with SMI. These innovations are a hallmark of the Johns Hopkins
ALACRITY Center that will continue in this renewal. The Methods Core includes four Aims. First, to provide
comprehensive operational support for Center research projects via seven Sub-Cores focused on partner
engagement; intervention development and adaptations; implementation strategy development;
measurement of implementation outcomes; recruitment and data collection; data management and analysis;
and healthcare policy and systems science. Second, to advance innovative methods supporting scale-up of
evidence-based interventions to improve physical health and reduce premature mortality among people with
SMI. These four projects will a) develop a policy implementation measurement framework; b) apply new
methods to identify core components of interventions and implementation strategies; c) refine methods to
improve precision and robustness in implementation trials; and d) build methods for “hybrid” systems science
models in implementation science. Third, to broadly disseminate the Center’s methodological advances
through scientific publications, trainings, web tutorials, and other avenues. Fourth, to support the
Administrative Core in evaluating the Center’s productivity and impact. Overall, the Methods Core will support
ambitious and innovative implementation research projects like those proposed in the signature R01 project
and R34s and contribute key methods advances to support the scale-up of effective interventions to reduce
premature mortality and advance health equity in persons with SMI."
10843612,"Obesity is highly prevalent among people with serious mental illness (SMI), and through its effects on other
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, represents a principal cause of preventable death in this population.
There is an urgent need to scale behavioral interventions that can effectively address obesity in persons with
SMI, however, rigorous testing of implementation strategies is needed to address the numerous system-,
organizational-, and individual-level barriers that hinder their widespread adoption and sustainment. One such
behavioral intervention, tailored to address this population’s unique needs, demonstrated clinically significant
weight loss in persons with SMI through the NIMH-funded ACHIEVE trial. During the ALACRITY Center’s initial
funding period, our team adapted the ACHIEVE intervention so that it could be delivered by community mental
health staff – resulting in the ACHIEVE-D weight management program – which incorporated implementation
strategies such as training, coaching, and organizational strategy meetings to support intervention delivery.
The pilot showed high levels of staff engagement and client participation, however, there were several barriers
to program sustainment. In the proposed study, we will partner with community mental health organizations in
New Jersey and Delaware, state leaders, and other partners to adapt and test strategies to support the
implementation and sustainment of ACHIEVE-D, including: 1) Replicating Effective Programs (REP), the
foundational implementation strategy that includes ACHIEVE-D program materials, training, and technical
assistance, and 2) an enhanced implementation strategy package with: a) an internal facilitator to support site-
level communication and coordination, leadership for implementation, and a supportive implementation
climate, and b) bi-state learning networks to promote knowledge-sharing, peer influence, skill development,
and high-quality relationships. We will test these multi-level strategies in a cluster-randomized Type 3 hybrid
effectiveness-implementation trial. Our uniquely and highly qualified team propose the following Specific Aims:
1) establish a collaborative partnership with 32 community mental health programs (64 staff implementers and
320 clients participants) in New Jersey and
Delaware and state mental health leadership to plan for ACHIEVE-
D implementation and sustainment, integrating cost planning; 2) determine the effectiveness of the enhanced
implementation strategy package (compared to REP alone) on the uptake and delivery of ACHIEVE-D at six
months; measure implementation from 7 through 12 months; and 3) determine the costs, budget impact, and
cost-effectiveness of deploying REP plus the enhanced implementation strategy package versus “standard”
REP to support scaling and sustainment of ACHIEVE-D. By engaging with partners across two states to test
multi-level strategies to inform implementation, sustainment, and scaling of an evidence-based weight
management program, this study represents a significant step towards advancing our ability to scale effective
interventions that can address obesity and improve cardiovascular health for persons with SMI."
10843614,"There are more than 5 million youth in the U.S. with serious emotional disturbance (SED), defined as the
presence of an emotional or behavioral disorder and functional impairment. Youth with SED have a prevalence
of obesity that exceeds that of the general youth population, and youth mental illness has been identified as a
risk factor for early cardiovascular disease; thus, addressing risk for overweight and obesity among youth with
SED is critical. While behavioral lifestyle interventions for healthy weight are effective in the general population,
these interventions do not typically address the influence of mental health symptoms on health behaviors. To
address this gap, our team developed and tested CHAMPION, a tailored behavioral lifestyle intervention for
youth with SED at risk for or with overweight/obesity, which was the first such intervention to demonstrate
efficacy. To facilitate the integration of CHAMPION into treatment settings serving youth with SED, we propose
to use the Enhanced Replicating Effective Programs (REP) framework, a multi-component strategy designed
to translate evidence-based interventions into community settings. REP uses partner-engaged methods, with
activities informed by a community working group comprised of potential intervention users (e.g., youth with
SED and their families); implementers (staff who might deliver the intervention); adopters and sustainers (e.g.,
administrative leadership). We will work with three distinct types of mental health settings serving youth with
SED (Psychosocial Rehabilitation Programs, Coordinated Specialty Care programs for early psychosis, and
Therapeutic Day Schools). We propose to: 1) Adapt the CHAMPION intervention package to facilitate ease of
delivery by diverse staff within a range of contexts serving youth with SED through a mixed methods usability
evaluation with community working group members; 2) Refine multi-level implementation strategies for the
sustained delivery of CHAMPION via a series of structured community working group meetings focused on
refining and operationalizing the Enhanced REP strategies (e.g., defining activities included in Facilitation); and
3) Conduct an open pilot and mixed methods evaluation of the 6-month CHAMPION intervention package and
selected implementation strategies in partnership with at least six sites, 24 implementing staff, and 60 youth.
Primary outcomes will include: 1) session delivery and fidelity; 2) sites’ fidelity to the implementation
intervention; 3) feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of the intervention package and implementation
strategy to implementing staff; and 4) patient satisfaction with the intervention. Secondary outcomes will
include youth BMI z-score, dietary behavior, physical activity, and behavioral functioning, implementation cost;
and strategy mechanisms (provider self-efficacy and knowledge; organizational implementation climate and
teamwork/relational coordination). This study will provide preliminary data to inform a subsequent fully-
powered hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial, setting the stage for integration of the first evidence-based
behavioral lifestyle intervention for youth with SED into a range of mental health treatment settings."
10843615,"Tobacco smoking represents the single largest contributor to premature mortality in people with serious mental
illness (SMI). Although effective, evidence-based smoking cessation treatment exists, fewer than 1 in 10
smokers with SMI receive it. One of the keys to scaling cessation treatment is to identify implementation
strategies that can effectively address implementation determinants that facilitate or hinder implementation
efforts. However, the process of identifying strategies appropriately matched to determinants can be
challenging, with opportunities to test possible combinations and variations of strategies largely limited to costly
and time-intensive randomized implementation trials. In this study, we propose a novel application of systems
science methods to identify implementation strategies to facilitate the delivery of smoking cessation treatment
in community mental health settings. Systems science is an interdisciplinary field of science focused on
modeling complex systems which can be used to simulate the potential effects of implementation strategies on
outcomes prior to implementation. The proposed study seeks to build on our Center’s existing systems
modeling work to develop a system model that will serve as a “virtual laboratory” to explore the potential effects
of various implementation strategies on the delivery of cessation treatment for people with SMI. To do so, we
will leverage our team’s complementary sets of expertise, theory-driven constructs of an implementation
science framework, and an extensive array of data sources. In Aim 1, we will iteratively engage with
community partners to develop and refine a conceptual model that identifies candidate implementation
strategies that can increase delivery of smoking cessation treatment in community mental health settings.
Using the conceptual model as a foundation, in Aim 2, we will build an integrated agent-based and system
dynamics model to assess the impacts of different implementation strategies on delivery of cessation
treatment. The integrated system model will be calibrated using robust empirical data from our team’s prior
studies on cessation treatment for people with SMI, new data that will be collected as part of the proposed
research, and a literature review of anticipated effect sizes of candidate implementation strategies. In Aim 3,
we will follow a User-Centered Design approach to construct an interactive, online dashboard that displays the
results of the system model. The purpose of the dashboard will be to assist community partners with decision-
making on how to implement and scale-up cessation treatment by allowing users to “virtually test” how
adjustments in the selection, dosing, and combination of implementation strategies would potentially affect
intervention delivery. This innovative study will result in a system model that will advance our efforts to support
scaling of smoking cessation treatment in community mental health settings, including the design of a future
implementation trial. Moreover, our overall approach will serve as the basis for building additional system
models that can enhance the delivery and scale-up of other physical health interventions for people with SMI."

This Center strategically addresses a key developmental driver of the youth mental health crisis: Currently, 1 in
5 children has an identified mental health problem as early as age 3. This Mental Health, Earlier (MHE) ALAC-
RITY Research Center addresses the grand challenge of achieving population-level impact of early childhood
mental health prevention efforts within routine care. The Center targets toddler transdiagnostic behavioral vul-
nerability at this pre-clinical phase to impact lifespan mental health. Pediatric primary care is a promising setting

10841248,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Diverse animals can regenerate appendages and organs, or even their entire bodies, but the gene regulatory
networks underlying regeneration remain largely unknown because most of the commonly used research
organisms have limited regenerative capacity. However, technological advances are now enabling sophisticated
gene regulation studies in highly regnerative animals. To reveal the regulatory events that drive regeneration,
we use the small freshwater cnidarian Hydra, which has several advantages including: (1) The ability to
rapidly regenerate its whole body, including the nervous system, in two days, (2) Transgenesis and gene
knockdown approaches are well established, and (3) Hydra has a simple cellular composition consisting of ~25
cell types, allowing my research group to leverage transcriptomic and genomic approaches to study gene
regulation at the organismal level. In the previous funding period, we built a chromosome-scale assembly of
the Hydra genome with gene annotations and defined the cis-regulatory elements (CREs) genome wide. In
addition, we built a cell-type expression atlas of the whole animal, including a spatial and molecular map of the
Hydra nervous system. These resources enabled us to identify the transcription factors and CREs involved in
the specification of all Hydra cell types. Towards understanding how these specification pathways are activated
by injury during regeneration, we transcriptionally profiled the early stages of regeneration and discovered an
injury-induced activation of the Wnt-signaling pathway, which directs Hydra head morphogenesis. Our future
work will focus on two research themes. (1) We are defining the regulatory mechanisms that connect the
general injury response to the morphogenesis of new structures. The molecular response to injury is
conserved in animals regardless of their regenerative abilities. Therefore, it is critical to understand the GRNs
that connect the injury response to the activation of developmental pathways (e.g., the Wnt signaling pathway)
in regenerative animals, so that we can ultimately understand why these connections are not made in humans.
Furthermore, we aim to discover how regeneration GRNs drive the morphogenesis of new structures. (2) We
are leveraging the unique biology of Hydra to understand the regulatory mechanisms directing nervous
system regeneration. Adult stem cells in Hydra support the replacement of all neurons in an uninjured animal
every twenty days and allow Hydra to regenerate its entire nervous system after catastrophic injury to restore
behaviors in two days. Our goal is to uncover the neuronal specification pathways under homeostatic conditions,
and then determine how these pathways are activated during regeneration. Ultimately, we aim to connect the
injury induced GRN (defined in theme #1) to the activation of neurogenesis. The long-term goal of our
laboratory is to obtain a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of whole animal regeneration from
the initial injury through the restoration of form and behaviors. Unraveling the regeneration GRNs in diverse
animals to reveal basic principles is a key to harnessing these powers for the benefit of regenerative medicine."

The goal of the UAMS K12 program is to build a diverse cohort of successful translational scientists that
enable the mission of the UAMS Translational Research Institute (TRI) to “develop and test translational
science innovations that will drive real world solutions to enhance health equity for rural and underrepresented
populations. This proposed program emphasizes gaining experience and expertise in Translational Science
through interdisciplinary training opportunities, mentored research projects, individualized training, and
education of mentors. The program aims to develop scholars that will be productive, funded and generate
meaningful results for rural and underserved populations. Mentored research projects will be able to leverage
unique resources in Implementation Science, Community and Stakeholder Engagement, Informatics, and
Telehealth that are available through our TRI. The program plan includes training in the seven foundational
knowledge, skills, and abilities of a Translational Scientist: Domain Expert, Boundary Crosser, Team Player,
Process Innovator, Skilled Communicator, Systems Thinker and Rigorous Researcher. The K12 program
includes a robust plan for evaluation to assess and improve its effectiveness in producing translational
scientists with careers that yield Health and Societal Benefits. To enhance the evaluation, we are participating
in a CTSA collaborative group developing competency-based assessment tools. The K12 program includes a
robust plan for recruitment and retention to enhance diversity. The proposed K12 builds on the success of our
current KL2 program. Since 2019, we have trained 22 productive scholars, 14 of which are still in the program,
who already have received five NIH grants as PI and published 124 manuscripts. The 22 scholars include 59%
women, 18% URM and an additional 14% from NIH-defined disadvantaged backgrounds, thus demonstrating
our ability to recruit diverse scholars. Current research projects involve populations across the lifespan, and
more than half specifically involve rural and underserved populations. The K12 program leverages the
strengths of our collaborating partners by utilizing the geographic reach across Arkansas of the Central
Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System (CAVHS) and Arkansas Children's Hospital/Arkansas Children’s
Research Institute (ACH/ACRI), incorporating the unique resources of the Partners, and receiving support for
Partner Scholars. The two partnering organizations along with the Winthrop P Rockefeller Cancer Institute and
the College of Medicine have enabled us to support 16 additional scholars over the first four years of the
current funding period. In summary, our proposed K12 program will leverage the unique resources available
through the TRI to produce a successful and diverse cohort of investigators that will produce Health and
Societal Benefits for rural and underserved populations."

10843194,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Cocaine use disorder (CUD) has no FDA approved therapies putting stimulant use disorders at a unique
treatment disadvantage, necessitating further research on stimulant use neural dysregulation for novel
interventions. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is at the core of valence-based stimulus processing and associative
learning, and its dysregulation by cocaine is a primary component underlying the development of CUD in human
and animal models. The NAc is not only an incredibly plastic area but receives numerous glutamatergic inputs
from across the brain that integrate complex information in order to drive the activity of the NAc. Long-term
cocaine exposure leads to plasticity in synaptic strength of glutamatergic inputs into the NAc and this plasticity
has been directly linked to maladaptive behaviors associated with cocaine exposure. While a large body of work
has highlighted the synapse-specific mechanisms that occur following cocaine exposure, this has been largely
done in ex-vivo preparations and on individual inputs into the NAc; however, information encoding within these
projection populations is a dynamic process that occurs on a fast timescale and understanding how their
relationship encodes complex information requires their simultaneous recording in awake and behaving animals.
I will be using a range of calcium imaging and viral-mediated expression approaches to 1. identify the
glutamatergic inputs that modulate and drive neural activity within the NAc and 2. understand how these signals
facilitate the encoding of stimuli to drive behavior at baseline and following cocaine use. First, using multisite
fiber photometry in glutamatergic projections from the basolateral amygdala (BLA-NAc), Hippocampus (vHPC-
NAc) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC-NAc) into the NAc, I will define how these circuits are simultaneously
activated by unconditioned and conditioned stimuli to drive behavior (Aim 1). Next, using cocaine self-
administration, I will define how these circuits are altered by repeated drug exposure, leading to neural and
behavioral impairments in learning for non-drug stimuli (Aim 2). As a future physician-scientist, understanding
the complex factors that contribute to addiction, especially as they relate to learning from drug and non-drug
stimuli, are a critical component of effective CUD treatment and intervention. This proposal with provide the
technical training needed to answer such questions in the laboratory, while also providing the theoretical training
to provide optimal care for patients in my clinical practice."
10843266,"The rapid evolution of influenza viruses has led to reduced vaccine efficacy, episodic drug resistance, and the emergence of novel seasonal and pandemic strains. The influenza virus polymerase complex is central to the evolution of influenza A viruses (IAV), as it is a major factor in adaptation to new hosts, and its replicative fidelity determines the rate at which the virus will acquire mutations that lead to host range expansion, drug resistance, or antigenic drift. The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the mechanisms through which novel viral variants are generated, which is critical to understanding how viruses emerge and spread. The objective of this project is define how competing selective forces drive the evolution of the IAV polymerase. The central hypothesis is that there is an inherent conflict between replication speed and fidelity, and that the evolution of the IAV polymerase is highly constrained by the high mutation rate of PB1, its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). This project will apply phylogenetic analysis, mutation rate assays, deep mutational scanning (DMS), molecular dynamic modeling, and in vitro polymerase assays to define the structural and functional constrains on the IAV polymerase. The feasibility of this approach is supported by preliminary data, which show that: (i) phylogenetic approaches can define the mutational pathway taken by the IAV polymerase as it adapts to human hosts; (ii) deep mutational scanning (DMS) can systematically define the impact of amino acid substitutions on polymerase function; (iii) a novel fluctuation test provides precise measurements of mutation rates for each nucleotide substitution class; (iv) the combination of molecular dynamic modeling and biochemistry can define functionally important interactions within the polymerase heterotrimer. Detailed analyses of the IAV polymerase will be accomplished in three aims. (Aim 1) Define the trade-off between replicative speed and fidelity over 50 years of H3N2 evolution. Competition assays and fluctuation tests will be used to determine the functional impact of adaptive mutations that have arisen in the natural evolution of PB1. (Aim 2) Measure the structural and functional impacts of all amino acid mutations in the influenza virus RdRp. DMS of the PB1 protein with serial passage in the absence and presence of mutagenic nucleosides will be used to evaluate the impact of each mutation on viral replication and mutation rates. (Aim 3) Define how amino acid interactions within the polymerase complex affect replication and fidelity. Dynamic modeling and in vitro assays will be used to mechanistically interrogate how co-selected mutations in PB2, PB1 and PA determine mutation rate. This work is innovative, because it uniquely combines a range of complementary approaches to test a novel hypothesis regarding the evolution of viral polymerases. The proposed research is significant, because it will define how selection on replication rate and fidelity shape the short- and long-term evolution of influenza viruses."
10843268,"Clinical electrical stimulation systems are increasingly common therapeutic options
to treat a broad range of medical conditions, such as cardioverter-defibrillators,
pacemakers, spinal cord stimulators, and deep brain stimulators. Despite their
remarkable success, a significant limitation of these medical devices is their limited
compatibility with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a standard and widely used
diagnostic tool in medicine. A primary concern when performing MRI examinations in
patients with electrically conductive implants is the antenna effect, which can potentially
cause a large amount of energy to be absorbed in the tissue, leading to heat-related
severe injury. In this application, we propose designing, developing, and testing a novel
metamaterials technology to produce MRI conditional leads that could be used in
implanted electrical recording and stimulation devices. The innovative nanoscale thin-
film metamaterial is truly the only MRI cloaking technology that does not occupy any
""brain"" space compared to additional RF-choking components. We will develop a
general framework for any arbitrary electrical stimulation lead implanted in the body to
prevent a build-up of induced currents and reduce imaging artifacts during a 3 Tesla MRI.
 Furthermore, we propose novel electrocorticography (ECoG) electrodes based on
biocompatible materials that will be stretchable, and conformable for optimal
biocompatibility, safety, and performance. These novel electrodes will be thin and
flexible and can be created in a wide range of configurations (i.e., strips, grids, and
various combinations) for different applications. Notably, the electrodes will be MRI-safe
and CT artifact-free, allowing for perfect registration of the electrode location to the brain
anatomy. The electrodes also permit the combination of intracranial (depth and cortical)
recordings with fMRI imaging, leading to a greater understanding of the neural
organization in both individual patients and for neuroscientific knowledge.
 A complete test plan is in place that includes electromagnetic numerical simulation to
support the design of both depth and ECoG Neuropace electrodes and bench-top and
large animal testing for efficacy validation and biocompatibility on rodents. This project's
long-term goal is to develop electrical stimulation system leads compatible with 3 Tesla
MRI and other external radiofrequency sources, providing significant benefits to patients
who may require implanted stimulators to treat pathological conditions such as heart
arrhythmias and Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and stroke."
10841952,"Abstract
Apical constriction is a change in cell shape that drives critical morphogenetic events, including gastrulation
and branching morphogenesis in diverse animals and neural tube formation in vertebrates. Fundamental
questions about mechanisms of apical constriction remain unanswered. Research in this laboratory focuses on
understanding how cells accomplish this change in shape. Apical constriction is being studied to uncover
insights into how animals are shaped, and to contribute to a foundation of basic science leading to improved
diagnosis and prevention of neural tube defects. This proposal will support projects to answer how the
molecules that contribute to apical constriction generate and transmit the forces that change cell shapes, how
a cell’s actin architecture is dynamically altered, how developmental patterning mechanisms deploy cell
biological players with the necessary spatial and temporal precision, and how novel mechanisms contribute to
apical constriction. The laboratory has developed technical innovations to address critical barriers to progress
in this field, and the proposed projects build on the lab's strength in dissecting cell biological mechanisms of
development more generally. Study of apical constriction intersects with some of the major themes in cell and
developmental biology including cell polarization, control of motor activity, and dynamic control of forces, in a
complex in vivo context. The proposed projects seek to combine in a single model system the tools that are
valuable to different model systems, plus the new tools that the lab has developed, to produce unique and
sustained contributions to unraveling mechanisms that are relevant to critical morphogenetic events."
10844226,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Musculoskeletal disease and disorders affect 1 out of 2 Americans and continue to be responsible for the majority
of physician/hospital visits and medical costs. Addressing this serious health issue requires teams of investigators
and clinical scientists with training and experience in studying the tissues and organs of the musculoskeletal system
as well as their interactions with other body systems. The Indiana Center for Musculoskeletal Health, ICMH,
was established in 2017 to address this need. The over 100 ICMH members, from 5 schools and 26 departments,
have formed focused research teams to investigate specific musculoskeletal health issues such as post-traumatic
osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, sarcopenia, and fracture healing, as well as the musculoskeletal impacts and contribution
in systemic disease processes such as aging, diabetes, cancer cachexia, renal disease and others. To
identify targetable cellular and molecular mechanisms involved or responsible for these conditions, investigators
collaborate in areas as diverse as periodontal disease, muscle/bone crosstalk, osteosarcopenia, and osteocyte
mechanobiology and function. The goal of the ICMH Resource Cores, ICMH-RC, is to promote and support advancements
in the field of musculoskeletal research through understanding muscle/bone interactions, mechanobiology,
and the roles of the musculoskeletal system beyond movement. To accomplish this goal, it is imperative
individual investigators and research teams have access to core facilities that provide services and cutting-edge
technology specific to bone/cartilage/connective tissue and muscle. The ICMH-RC will be composed of the Ad
min/ Enhancement Core, Core A and three resource cores: Core B: Histology and Histomorphometry core, Core
C: Systems Biology and Multi-Omics core, and Core D: Mechanobiology/3D Bioprinting Core. The Ad min Core will
not only be responsible for efficient and productive operations of these cores but also for the selection of promising
pilot applications proposing novel yet feasible concepts in the study and treatment of musculoskeletal disease.
Core A will also place high priority on the training not only of faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students,
but also will introduce underserved high school students and faculty to the field of musculoskeletal research to
ensure that the next generation of critical musculoskeletal scientists, engineers, and physicians will comprise a
diverse and well-trained workforce. New cutting-edge technologies such as 3D tissue and organ bioprinting will be
further developed. The ICMH-RC will interface with the clinical cores of the ICMH Clinical Research Center, ICMH
CRC, to promote transfer of discovery to clinical application, using the ""bench-to-bedside"" translational approach
to achieve the ultimate goals of musculoskeletal research."

The Administrative (ADMIN) Core will coordinate and integrate the research cores of the Indiana Center for Musculoskeletal
Health-Basic Science Research Center (ICMH-BSRC) with all center activities, will ensure effective
communication between all internal and external components, and will be responsible for arranging oversight
bodies to monitor progress and efficiency. In addition, the ADMIN Core will administer the Enrichment Program,
designed to identify and support new investigator funding, new collaborations, feasibility proposals, and innovation
initiatives. Outreach initiatives will include introducing underrepresented minorities to core technology for
musculoskeletal research and reaching out to other P30 Directors to share information in order to advance the
field as a whole. To accomplish these responsibilities, the specific aims of this core include the following: Aim 1:
Provide administrative support to the resource cores. Here, the ADMIN core will provide overall administrative
support to the program, including budget construction and management, account updates, coordination of institutional
support and scientific/project meetings, and liaison to the oversight boards. Aim 2: Provide statistical support
and data management to the resource cores. Here, the ADMIN core will provide study design consultation,
data management strategies, and statistical support services to projects supported by the resource cores and
pilot projects. Aim 3: Serve as a liaison between the ICMH-BSRC and the multitude of other relevant units on
campus to maximize interaction, synergy, and growth. Here, the Admin Core will serve as the lead contact for
ICMH-BSRC interaction with the highly fortified resource environment at IU that comprises other functional units.
Aim 4: Administer pilot grant programs that fund the use of the resource cores. Here, the ADMIN core will administer
pilot funding for new, collaborative, innovative projects that involve core usage and also funding for our pipeline/
retention programs to fortify the MSK workforce into the future. Aim 5: Provide communications, education,
and outreach for the resource cores. Here, the ADMIN core will engage in outreach to the broader community
including undergraduate and high school students, as well as other research groups around the country whose
programs would benefit from our core services. In summary, the ADMIN core will facilitate basic science research
by supporting MSK investigators, providing a roadmap of existing resources for the conduct of basic research,
and training investigators in study design, measurement techniques, methodologies, and outcome measures in
musculoskeletal science. It will serve as a critical resource that will enhance and grow basic MSK research
across Indiana and beyond."

and technical innovation to facilitate ICMH investigators from vastly different subspecialties to use histological
approaches in order to assess tissue/cell level mechanisms in their developmental/physiological/disease
models. The HHC will facilitate histological and histomorphometric analyses of bone, muscle, cartilage, ligament,
tendon, intervertebral disk. The HHC will provide consultation on study design and post-study data interpretation
and provide training programs and education in all techniques covered by the Core. Aim 1: Provide histological
processing and quantitative analysis of musculoskeletal tissues. Histological preparation of bone, muscle, cartilage,
ligament and tendon utilizing outcome-specific staining techniques will be provided. Processing techniques
will include undecalcified/decalcified hard tissues, frozen sections, immunohistochemistry, and special staining.
Experienced analytical support for histomorphometric and immunohistometric assessments will also be a Core
service. Innovation will focus on integrating with Core C to develop spatial transcriptomics of musculoskeletal tissue
using histological sections. Aim 2: Provide consistency and comparability of measurement modalities across
studies. The Core will ensure consistency in the protocols among projects and provide quality control standards
for technical procedures. This will contribute to the cost-effectiveness and comparability of measurements across
all projects. Coordinated guidance will be provided to investigators on selection and quality management of appropriate
preclinical and clinical assessments, and centralized assessment of outcomes. Aim 3: Provide consultation

study design and post-study interpretation related to any Core analytical service. Services will be made available
to internal investigators outside of musculoskeletal biology who need analysis of musculoskeletal tissues and early
career investigators outside the University who could benefit from services. Aim 4: Provide training and education
in histological analyses. Faculty, fellows, and graduate students will be offered annual training sessions in
analytical methods in research related to histology. A one-day training session will be provided twice each year,
each focused on one of the approaches utilized by the Core; slots will be made available for early career investigators
outside the univeristy. We will also arrange 1 :1 training with laboratory supervisors on request. The Core
will also support technical personnel professional development training to allow them to expand methodologies
incorporated into the Core. By providing consistent methodological support, reproducibility will be improved and
by providing training and advice to investigators, the quality of their data will be improved, thereby advancing understanding
of the musculoskeletal system."
10844229,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall goal of the Systems Biology and Multi-Omics Core (SBMOC, Core C) is to establish local infrastructure
in the Indiana Center for Musculoskeletal Health (ICMH) to support the unique and undiscovered technical solutions
for advancing genomic and metabolomic applications specifically, in the field of musculoskeletal science.
This unique innovation would parallel the adaptation of high-throughput omics approaches well established in oth-er
fields such as cancer biology and neurological diseases. This core will address the unique aspects of working
with skeletal muscle (e.g., multi-nucleation, predominantly sarcomeric protein), bone (e.g., isolation of osteocytes,
osteoblasts, osteoclasts from densely mineralized matrices that are difficult to overcome), and tendon/ligament
(e.g., isolation of tendon cells from a tough, fibrous environment). The SBMOC will also serve as an educational
hub for ICMH investigators to design musculoskeletal genomics and metabolomics studies, emphasizing training
in study design, data integration, interpretation, and insights. The ultimate aim of the core is to use the investigatorgenerated
large datasets along with the publicly available data to yield new mechanistic hypotheses and discoveries
in the musculoskeletal field by leveraging the computational, bioinformatics, genomic, and metabolomics infrastructure
in the Indiana University School of Medicine. SBMOC will be founded as an extension of existing and
highly successful institutional cores and centers, namely the Center for Medical Genomics, and the Center for
Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, along with a newly established state-of-the-art metabolomics facility.
The creation of the SBMOC will allow the three units to coordinate the critical services to all ICMH investigators,
including study design, assay selection, data generation, data processing, data interpretation, data integration and
data dissemination. In addition to providing critical coordination between these three resources and offering subsidized
service rates, the SBMOC will also facilitate new technology and methodology development and implementation
which will be crucial to promoting musculoskeletal research. In summary, SBMOC will facilitate musculoskeletal
research through the following aims: (1) Provide and further develop state-of-the-art genomics services to
meet the needs of ICMH members to advance their musculoskeletal research programs; (2) Perform and customize
state-of-the-art metabolomics services to meet the needs of ICMH investigators; (3) Integrate datasets from
various omics platforms to address research hypotheses and develop novel research directions; and (4) Facilitate
development of ICMH investigator knowledge of, and training in, omics-based approaches to enable expansion of
systems-level experiments. The SBMOC will provide the musculoskeletal research community with cutting-edge
genomic and molecular biology services, bioinformatics/big data computational processing and handling, and
multi-platform omics integration, network, to address high-impact scientific questions and expedite discovery of
treatments and therapies for MSK diseases."

The mechanical environment is a foundational input to the proper development, composition, and function of
the musculoskeletal system. Probing the integrity of mechanical signaling mechanisms in bone and muscle
require very specialized techniques, expertise, and instrumentation, all of which have been a hallmark of the IU
bone group for many years. This application describes the creation, scope, operation, and administration of a
unique core facility, housed within the newly created Indiana Center for Musculoskeletal Biology (ICMH), that
provides dedicated infrastructure to support investigators in the area of mechanobiology for in vivo and in vitro
applications. The core is directed by Dr. Alex Robling and co-directed by Dr. Joey Wallace, who bring considerable
experience and breadth to the core leadership. The core will offer services related to in vivo skeletal loading,
in vivo muscle loading, in vivo disuse experiments (for both bone and muscle), in vitro mechanotransduction
models, and development of new techniques to move the field forward. Training and outreach components
are included, to bring more investigators into the field and to educate those who wish to mechanobiology
approaches into their lab as standard practice. Aim 1: Provide in vivo bone and muscle mechanotransduction
services, including anabolic (ulnar loading, tibia loading, muscle electrostimulation, vibration, treadmill), and
catabolic (tail suspension, Botox paralysis, immobilization) techniques. Aim 2: Provide in vitro bone and muscle
cellular mechanotransduction services, including parallel plate fluid flow and substrate strain techniques for
cultured bone and muscle cells from a variety of sources (e.g., CRISPR-targeted cell lines, primary cells from
mutant mice, transfected/infected cells, drug-treated cells). Aim 3: Provide training and education in the use
and interpretation of mechanobiology models, including theory, application, technical constraints, and advice
on next steps, to investigators, with the goal of increasing the awareness of mechanobiological approaches to
MSK-related research questions. Aim 4: Innovate and advance the mechanobiology field in technical aspects
of research strategy and tools, so that current and future investigators have a greater selection of appropriate
models to test more focused hypotheses related to mechanobiology. In summary, this core will support the existing,
highly experienced investigators, will train new investigators in these approaches, and will offer services
to those that had not previously considered these technologies to address their scientific questions and expedite
discovery of treatments and therapies for MSK diseases."

 Despite efforts to prevent suicide, US rates are climbing, and suicide is the second leading cause of death
amongst youth. While suicide safety planning interventions can be effective in reducing suicidal behavior,
adolescents often face challenges in sustaining their engagement with them. Studies have found that many
adolescents do not review their safety plans or attempt to use coping strategies following discharge. Digital
tools can provide a powerful means to enhance engagement with these interventions. The overall aim of this
SBIR Fast Track proposal is to enhance the effectiveness of safety planning amongst at risk youth by
developing and commercializing an augmented version of the BRITE smartphone app that provides enhanced
features that will optimize effectiveness by addressing known barriers to user engagement. The BRITE app
facilitates self-efficacy by encouraging self-monitoring of emotional distress and utilization of effective coping
strategies as well as providing ready access to a safety plan on the adolescent’s smartphone. The BRITE app
was developed on evidence-based principles and has undergone rigorous formative development and
effectiveness evaluations. However, to optimize its functionality, commercial viability, and scale its
implementation, issues related to user engagement need to be addressed. Recent developments in Ecological
Momentary Assessment (EMA) and mobile sensing (MS) can provide useful triggers to automatically “push”
pertinent safety planning information to individuals during periods of higher risk, which will allow the integration
of just-in-time adaptive intervention features within BRITE and should result in more sustained engagement
with the plan and increased effectiveness. In Phase I we will develop an augmented version of the BRITE app
(BRITE 2.0) that integrates just-in-time automated push notifications for consistent practice of coping skills and
for safety planning resources during periods of escalating risk, and will evaluate the usability and acceptability
of this product with practitioners and end users. The aim of Phase II is to conduct a micro randomized trial to
optimize treatment components, and to conduct an initial RCT to evaluate whether these enhancements
increase user engagement."

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is best known for its role as the locus of protein folding, calcium storage, and
lipid metabolism. The organelle also integrates numerous other molecular pathways and contributes to cellular
calcium homeostasis, reduction-oxidation regulation, and cell death. Given the many vital and complex functions
of the ER, it is little wonder that its failure can trigger a range of diseases. It has been shown that dysregulation
of ER homeostasis may underlie β cell dysfunction and death in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, as well as in
monogenic forms of diabetes, including Wolfram syndrome, Wolcott-Rallison syndrome, microcephaly, epilepsy,
and diabetes syndrome (MEDS), and mutant insulin gene-induced diabetes caused by pathogenic variants in
the WFS1 and CISD2, EIF2AK3, IER3IP1, and INS genes respectively. To further understand the contribution
of ER dysfunction to β cell death and design novel treatments targeting ER for diabetes, we need to establish
functional studies of gene variants affecting ER homeostasis, design treatments targeting common molecular
pathways altered in ER stressed β cells, and identify other ER genes involved in β cell dysfunction and death. In
this proposal, we will characterize WFS1 and CISD2, EIF2AK3, IER3IP1, and INS variants using functional
assays and bioinformatics and test novel treatments targeting the common molecular pathways altered in β cells
expressing pathogenic variants of WFS1 and CISD2, EIF2AK3, IER3IP1, and INS genes. Successful completion
of this study will lead to the establishment of precision medicine for hereditary ER diabetes."

candidate has found that repeated binge drinking is associated with reduced microvascular function, measured
as flow-induced vasodilation (FIV) in small resistance arteries. The candidate has also found that repeated
binge drinking is associated with increased levels of urinary norepinephrine, a vasoconstrictor and a marker of
sympathetic nerve activity. In a later mid-life stage, the synergistic effect of repeated binge drinking and aging
may aggravate these adverse changes in FIV and sympathetic activity, causing elevated SBP. The proposed
study will determine the effect of repeated binge drinking on microvascular function, sympathetic activity, and

of norepinephrine as a potential moderator of reduced arteriolar FIV associated with repeated binge drinking.
FIV will be measured in resistance arteries, the major regulatory site of SBP, isolated from fat biopsies of mid-
life adult binge drinkers vs. alcohol abstainers/moderate drinkers. Aim 2 will determine sympathetic nerve
activity (directly via microneurography) and SBP (resting and ambulatory) in mid-life adult binge drinkers vs.
alcohol abstainers/moderate drinkers. The findings of this approach will potentially establish therapeutic targets
for alcohol-attributable contribution to elevated SBP and have broader implications for understanding
hypertension development in mid-life adults. The findings will also launch the R00 phase of independent
research where in Aim 3 the candidate will investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of high-intensity interval
training on improving FIV and reducing sympathetic activity, thereby reducing SBP in mid-life adult binge
drinkers. The clinical and mechanistic data will build the foundation for an R01 studying the mechanisms of
alcohol induced elevated SBP, and an intervention focusing on microvascular function and sympathetic activity.
The study has high impact for understanding the mechanisms of cardiovascular risk development in mid-life
adults and is highly responsive to the mission of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism."

10830402,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
The UCLA Microbial Pathogenesis Training Grant (MPTG) provides the foundation for an integrated research
training program in the biochemistry, cell biology & genetics of microbial pathogens and host-pathogen
interactions. The program’s goal is to train scientists to conduct research in microbial pathogenesis using
molecular, cellular, genetic, immunological, genomic, proteomic and “post-omic” approaches. Our training
faculty includes 22 preceptors with a broad range of related research interests in the areas of bacteriology,
parasitology, virology, and immunology. Faculty preceptors have excellent publication, funding and training
records. The program was first funded in 1988 and is currently in its 29th year of funding. MPTG is small, with
five predoctoral and two postdoctoral funded positions; yet it plays a vital role, not limited to trainees, in
educating PhD students and postdoctoral fellows in the field of microbial pathogenesis at UCLA. Most of our
predoctoral trainees are recruited through the Graduate Program in Biosciences (GPB) which provides an
excellent pool of 92 predoctoral students on average yearly. For many years, >25% of entering PhD students
express interests in microbiology, immunology and host:pathogen interactions. Our faculty are also highly
successful in attracting qualified postdoctoral fellows, having a mean of 16 postdoctoral fellows eligible for
support in any given year. Trainees are selected for funding on a competitive basis, after a thorough review of
their academic and research accomplishments. Progress is reviewed throughout the year and appointments
are competitively renewed yearly with a maximum of three years of support for predoctoral trainees and two
years for postdoctoral trainees. The training program requires the completion of coursework focused on
microbial pathogenesis, annual presentations of trainee research in symposia attended by all trainees and
training preceptors, and participation in a Microbial Pathogenesis seminar series composed of external,
preeminent scientists in the field & associated literature discussions. Trainees also participate in a journal club
focused on host:pathogen interactions and newly emerging infectious agents. These journal clubs are jointly
facilitated by training preceptors and trainees and serve to broaden trainee education. Participation in a course
devoted to ethics and accountability in biomedical research and a scientific writing course is also required. All
trainees are required to develop career objectives guided by “My Individual Development Plan (IDP)”.
Postdoctoral trainees are also required to participate in the PhD Career Training Series and research-related
career focused workshops. Career counseling by the program director and training grant advisory committee is
also emphasized. Annual research presentations at national meetings and UCLA scientific retreats are
expected. The focal point of our training program is excellence in research. Several mechanisms are in place
to monitor and facilitate trainee progress in research and career development. Our past training efforts have
been successful and continued success is anticipated following the plan described in this proposal."
10834993,"Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is an often chronic and disabling condition prevalent in the Veteran
population. Many effective treatments, such as medications and psychotherapy, for PTSD have been
developed and deployed in the VA. Other more procedural or “somatic” treatments appear promising but are
understudied. One such understudied somatic treatment is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).
TMS has shown clear efficacy in the treatment of depression, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has
approved TMS for this indication. Beyond this, early studies indicate that TMS is a highly promising somatic
therapy for PTSD.
While functional improvement and recovery are central goals for PTSD treatment, the majority of PTSD
treatment studies do not include measures of functional improvement. Moreover, none of the TMS treatment
studies in PTSD have examined functional outcomes. Therefore, research is needed to determine: (1) if TMS
is an effective treatment for PTSD; and (2) if TMS is associated with functional improvement.
The immediate objective of this study is to determine whether TMS is an effective treatment for PTSD. We will
also compare the efficacy and functional improvement associated with treatment. The long-term goal is to
improve the health of Veterans with PTSD through development of effective treatments.
We seek to study several interrelated research questions. First, is transcranial magnetic stimulation delivered
to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of Veterans with PTSD more effective in decreasing symptoms of
PTSD compared to sham treatments? Second, does transcranial magnetic stimulation delivered to the right
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex effective for improving functioning Veterans with PTSD?
We propose a four-year study to answer these questions regarding the use of TMS for the treatment of PTSD.
During the study, 91 participants from the White River Junction VA Medical Center will be randomized to either
TMS or sham TMS; all TMS will be applied to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. All participants will meet
DSM-V criteria for PTSD. The primary outcome will be change in severity of PTSD symptoms as measured as
a continuous variable using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). Secondary outcomes include
function, depressive symptoms, and side effects."
10835128,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) metastasizes preferentially to the omentum, which is a well-
vascularized fold of peritoneal tissue covered by mesothelial cells and a major site of intra-abdominal fat
accumulation. It was reported that HGSC and stromal cell-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines downregulate
omentin (ITLN1), a novel mesothelial cell-derived adipokine to promote the invasive potential and proliferation
of cancer cells in the omental microenvironment. Omentin has been shown to suppress ovarian cancer invasive
potential and cell growth through suppressing MMP1 expression and cell traction force in cancer cells, and
inducing a local rapid metabolic coupling between ovarian cancer cells and neighboring adipocytes. Besides,
higher levels of pre-operative serum omentin in patients with HGSC were associated with longer survival times.
In addition, mice treated with omentin had marked increase in activated CD8+ T cell density compared to the
untreated control. These findings suggested that adipocytes play an important role in mediating the suppressive
effect of omentin on the malignant phenotype of ovarian cancer cells, and the immune microenvironment.
Therefore, we focus on secretory proteins that can be upregulated by omentin in mature adipocytes. A recent
proteomic study demonstrated that an anti-inflammatory protein tumor necrosis factor-inducible gene 6 protein
(TSG-6) was the top gene upregulated by omentin in adipocytes. Previous studies demonstrated that TSG-6
inhibits infiltration of immune cells during inflammation. It can also bind to specific chemokines such as CXCL12
and prevent them to bind to glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-rich tumor stroma and endothelial cell surface, suggesting
that TSG-6-mediated blockade of these cytokines to suppress tumor growth, angiogenesis, and regulatory T cell
trafficking. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that omentin normalizes the pro-inflammatory omental
microenvironment in ovarian cancer through upregulating anti-inflammatory TSG-6 in adipocytes, which binds to
pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted by cancer cells and various stromal cell types, which attenuate the
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, prevent omental metastasis, and suppress tumor progression,
and subsequently improve patients’ survival rate. To test this hypothesis, first, we propose to determine the
roles of omentin in normalizing the immunosuppressive microenvironment and preventing tumor development in
ovarian cancer. Second, we propose to determine the mechanisms by which omentin reprograms the immune
landscape in ovarian tumor tissues and suppresses the invasive potential of ovarian cancer cell. Third, we
propose to determine the efficacy of omentin administration alone or in combination with paclitaxel in ovarian
cancer treatment, and determine the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and toxicity of omentin using various
mouse models. Our studies will enable us to delineate the immune modulator role of omentin in HGSC
pathogenesis, and to further develop omentin as a chemopreventive and therapeutic agent in the treatment of
HGSC to improve patients’ survival rates."

neurotypical normally aging (NA) subjects from adolescence into the 90s, and 40 Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)
brains, with BRAIN Initiative-generated datasets from human brain tissue. We are implementing high resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS) (Stephens et al., 2018; Wobma et al., 2018a; Wobma et al., 2018b), 10X Genomics
single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), sn Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing
(snATAC-seq), Visium spatial transcriptomics (10X Genomics), and our custom-made slide-seq technology,
using deterministic barcoding in tissue for spatial omics sequencing (DBiT-seq), for co-mapping mRNAs
and proteins (Liu et al., 2020), ATAC spatial sequencing (Deng et al., 2022) and RNA-ATAC co-profiling (Zhang
et al., 2023). We will integrate our data with publicly available datasets from GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus),
SCORCH (Single Cell Opioid Responses in the Context of HIV), PsychENCODE Consortium, NeMO
(Neuroscience Multi-Omic Data Archive), SEA-AD (Seattle Alzheimer’s Disease Brain Cell Atlas), Psych-AD
(Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Alzheimer’s Disease) and the BICCN (BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network).
We will include external datasets on hippocampus and other brain regions, to implement analyses on gene
regulatory networks (GRNs) that are common to neurons and glial cells across brain regions, and identify GRNs
that synergistically regulate functional brain circuits involved in cognitive, emotional, and behavioral changes in
AD. The hippocampus, fundamental for memory, the amygdala, regulating emotional responses to stress and
“fight or flight” reactions, and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), involved in set shifting, attentional control, and decision
making, are all progressively affected in AD, and they are involved in AD neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS),
such as disinhibition, impulsivity, anxiety, emotional distress, aggression, paranoid ideation, and other psychotic
symptoms. Understanding how those brain regions are regulated by cell-type specific epigenetic and gene
expression changes, will shed light on molecular mechanisms of AD pathogenesis and provide targets for new
therapeutic approaches to AD and NPS in AD. This supplement is within the scope of the active award and
improves the discovery potential of our dataset. This project will provide scalable pipelines for analyzing
multimodal and spatial omics cell profiling datasets, and will deliver a developmental and adult cell atlas of cell
type diversity. It will provide information on the regulome, the interaction between regulatory components that
control the state of expression of genes and their isoforms, their subcellular location, tissue state, development,
and pathology. These regulatory mechanisms include DNA accessibility for gene transcription, DNA methylation,
transcription factors that regulate gene transcription, RNA-protein interactions, and non-coding RNAs involved
in splicing, ribosome synthesis, degradation of mRNAs, and translation repression. The supplement will provide
broad sharing of our data via an NIH supported database and contribute to a reference atlas of human cell types."
10834893,"Recovery-oriented care is an imperative for the VA, particularly in mental health programming for Veterans with
serious mental illness (SMI). Collaborative decision-making (CDM) is a recovery-oriented approach to
treatment decision-making that assigns equal participation and obligation to patients and providers across all
aspects of decision-making, thereby empowering patients and facilitating better decision-making based on
patient values and preferences. CDM is associated with several important outcomes including improved
treatment engagement, treatment satisfaction, and social functioning. However, current levels of CDM among
Veterans with SMI are low, and there is not yet an evidence-based method to improve CDM. Improving
Veteran skill sets associated with engaging in CDM is a potential intervention strategy. Collaborative Decision
Skills Training (CDST) is a promising new intervention that was previously developed by the applicant for use
in adult civilians with SMI and found to improve relevant skills and improve sense of personal recovery.
The proposed study has two primary stages. First, a small, one-armed, open label trial will establish CDST's
feasibility will evaluate CDST among 12 Veterans with SMI receiving services at the VA San Diego
Psychosocial Rehabilitation and Recovery Center (PRRC) and identify and complete any needed adaptations
to CDST. Stakeholder feedback from Veterans, VA clinicians, and VA administrators will be collected to assess
Veteran needs and service context to identify any needed adaptations to the CDST manual or the delivery of
CDST to maximize its impact and feasibility. The developers of CDST (the applicant and Dr. William Spaulding,
a consultant) will review all feedback and make final decisions about adaptations to ensure that CDST retains
its essential components to protect against loss of efficacy. For example, a recommendation to adjust role-play
topics to better reflect the needs of Veterans would be accepted because it would increase CDST's relevance
without impairing its integrity, but a recommendation to remove all role-plays would not be accepted because it
would cause loss of a key component.
Second, CDST will be compared to active control (AC) using a randomized clinical trial of 72 Veterans. The
primary outcome measure will be functioning within the rehabilitation context, operationalized as frequency of
Veteran CDM behaviors during Veteran-provider interactions. Secondary outcomes are treatment attendance,
engagement, satisfaction, and motivation, along with treatment outcomes (i.e., rehabilitation goal attainment,
sense of personal recovery, symptom severity, and social functioning). Three exploratory outcomes will be
assessed: Veteran-initiated collaborative behaviors, acute service use and provider attitudes and behavior.
Veterans will be randomly assigned to CDST or AC conditions. Veterans in the both groups will attend eight
hour-long group sessions held over eight weeks. All Veterans will complete an assessment battery at baseline,
post-intervention, and at three-month post-intervention follow-up. Following the trial and adaptation phase, the
findings will be used to develop a CDST service delivery manual and design a logical subsequent study.
The results of the proposed study will inform the potential for larger trials of CDST and the utility of providing
CDST broadly to Veterans with SMI. The results of this study will expand current understanding of CDM
among Veterans with SMI by providing data that will: 1) identify adaptations needed to optimize CDST for
Veterans receiving services in PRRCs; 2) identify possible benefits of CDST; 3) inform development of
alternate interventions or methods to improve CDM; and 4) further elucidate CDM and associated treatment

cartilage prior to forming bone. Perturbations in their capacity to differentiate leads to skeletal anomalies.
Therefore, deciphering the molecular mechanisms controlling these cells is crucial for both understanding the
causes of skeletal diseases as well as developing new therapeutic approaches to restore the skeleton. While
transcription factors and signaling molecules have been linked to cartilage development, less is known about
the upstream mechanisms that initiate the process. Recent data from mice and humans implicate epigenetic
regulatory factors as critical modulators of MPC function. CXXC finger protein 1 (Cfp1) is an epigenetic
regulatory factor implicated in progenitor cell function, though the mechanism(s) of its action have not been
well defined. To address this, we deleted Cfp1 specifically from limb bud mesenchyme. Preliminary data show
that loss of Cfp1 results in the complete absence of forelimbs at birth. Subsequent analysis of embryonic
forelimbs revealed that, in the absence of Cfp1, MPCs failed to undergo condensation, the initial step in
chondrogenesis. Whole transcriptome analysis revealed a dramatic reduction in chondrogenic gene markers,
including the master transcriptional regulator, Sox9, which is required for condensation, further implicating Cfp1
as a crucial factor in the early stages of cartilage formation. Preliminary data indicate that Cfp1 may regulate
this key developmental step through activation of BMP signaling. Further, while mutant hindlimbs form they are
severely stunted, consistent with our observation that deletion of Cfp1 in chondrocytes results in shorter bones.
Together, these data suggest that Cfp1 also regulates chondrocyte differentiation and maturation during
growth plate development. We hypothesize that Cfp1 regulates multiple stages of cartilage development
through modulation of essential transcriptional regulators and key signaling pathways. Further study of Cfp1
will provide fundamental insight into how epigenetic regulation of cellular and molecular mechanisms impacts
chondrogenesis and growth plate development. We propose: 1) to identify Cfp1's actions during chondrocyte
differentiation in the developing long bone, 2) to determine the effect of Cfp1 loss on growth plate development
and 3) to identify the Cfp1 regulatory network during cartilage development."

 Despite significant clinical breakthroughs in anticancer immunotherapy, the efficacy of current
immunotherapies in breast cancer is modest. Only a small fraction of breast cancer patients have a clinical
response; complete responses to these agents are exceedingly rare. The underlying mechanisms of tissue-
specific immune regulation in breast cancer remains to be elucidated. Furthermore, how comorbidities such as
obesity influence antitumor immunity in breast cancer is even less understood.
 Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is a collagen receptor with an intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. High
DDR1 expression in breast cancer is associated with poor patient outcomes and attenuated antitumor
immunity. We found complex tumor-promoting actions for both tumor and adipose DDR1 in the breast tumor
microenvironment. Tumor DDR1 suppresses antitumor immunity, whereas adipose DDR1 is required for diet-
induced obesity, tumor-promoting cytokine production, and immune modulation. Our preliminary data further
indicate that the shed extracellular domain of DDR1 alone is sufficient for its functions in tumor and adipose
cells, which has not previously been reported. We therefore hypothesize that DDR1 in the breast tumor
microenvironment promotes tumor progression by dampening antitumor immunity, enabling adiposity, and
abetting immune-adipose cell-tumor crosstalk. We predict that blocking kinase-independent DDR1 signals can
boost antitumor immunity and response to anticancer immunotherapies, especially in patients with obesity. To
test this hypothesis, in this R01 application, we will determine how tumor DDR1 suppresses antitumor
immunity (Aim 1), how adipose DDR1 contributes to obesity-associated cancer progression (Aim 2), and how
DDR1 carries out its immune-suppressive functions independent of its kinase activity (Aim 3). With combined
expertise in cancer biology, tumor immunology, and clinical oncology, our multidisciplinary team is well
positioned to validate our novel hypothesis.
 The fact that DDR1 has distinct functions in different cell compartments of the breast tumor
microenvironment underscores the complexity of tumor-stromal interactions. By investigating tumor and
adipose DDR1 in an integrative and comprehensive manner as proposed here, we will fill major gaps of
knowledge about tumor-initiated immune suppression and obesity-associated comorbid effects. Given the
adipocyte-rich tumor microenvironment in breast cancer and the growing numbers of patients with obesity and
breast cancer, our proposed studies address an unmet clinical need and promise to inform the development of
new strategies to enhance antitumor immunity for breast cancer patients, especially for those with obesity.

Medulloblastoma is the most common pediatric brain tumor. Although some forms of medulloblastoma are
treatable by surgery and chemotherapy, others are resistant to the standard of care. In addition, behavioral
and cognitive deficits plague many medulloblastoma patients. Therefore, new therapeutic options are needed
for treating medulloblastoma. Inhibitors of the epigenetic reader protein Brd4 are currently being tried in
medulloblastoma patients due to their potential ability to reduce drivers of medulloblastoma growth including
MYC. However, the underlying biology of Brd4 in the developing brain is not understood. We have recently
shown that Brd4 knockout during development leads to cerebellar ataxia. We also demonstrated that Brd4
regulation via phosphorylation occurs during cell cycle exit of cerebellar granule cell progenitors. However,
the functional importance of this regulation is unclear. In the proposed studies we will determine whether Brd4
phosphorylation is part of a switch-like mechanism controlling cell proliferation and cell cycle exit in GCPs and
whether dysregulation of this process contributes to medulloblastoma. In Aim 1, we will determine the Brd4
signaling pathways important for GCP cell cycle exit. In Aim 2 we will determine the role of two upstream
kinases CK1d and CK2a in controlling Brd4 activity and cell cycle exit. In Aim 3, we will determine the
consequence of modulating Brd4 levels and phosphorylation status on progression of mouse medulloblastoma.
Collectively, these studies will reveal the importance of the epigenetic reader protein Brd4 in the decision to
proliferate or exit the cell cycle, which is critical for regulated development."

Annually, one million children die of TB and 25% of the global TB cases occur in children, adolescents and
young adults. Tibetan refugees in India have extraordinarily high TB rates. In 2017-18, we observed a TB case
and infection prevalence of 916/100,000 and ~20%, respectively, for schoolchildren residing in Tibetan
boarding schools in India. More than 60% of the total Tibetan TB cases occur in the schools and monasteries.
Despite this burden, understanding is limited of the epidemiology of TB in the Tibetan population and strategies
for its prevention.
 Zero TB in Tibetan Kids (ZTBK) is a fully funded and established public health program of the Johns
Hopkins University, Tibetan Delek Hospital, and the Department of Health of the Central Tibetan Administration
that aims to eliminate TB for Tibetan children and adolescents through a multipronged approach of screening,
treatment and preventive therapy. With ongoing support, the ZTBK is now scaled up to cover ~40,000 people
in schools and monasteries across 3 states through 2022. In this mobile program, the entire institution is
screened for TB using symptom, tuberculin skin test, chest X-ray, and Xpert. All Xpert positive and suspected
specimens are sent to the Hinduja Lab, Mumbai, for culture and drug susceptibility testing. Culture positive
isolates are stored at the Hinduja for whole genome sequencing (WGS). I will use data from this ZTBK initiative
to study TB epidemiology, transmission, and preventive therapy outcomes for children, adolescents, and young
adults in the Tibetan schools, monasteries, and nunneries in Himachal Pradesh state of India.
 For Aim 1, I will characterize TB infection and disease and study the epidemiologic risk factors.
For Aim 2, I postulate that most TB transmission in the congregate settings happen through recent
transmission. I will study TB transmission by analyzing single nucleotide polymorphisms in the WGS data and
relate the genomic clusters with epidemiological links. Using geospatial analysis, I will relate the transmission
data with spatial coordinates for a complete understanding of the transmission dynamics. For Aim 3, I will test
the postulate that receiving preventive therapy in the congregate settings will lead to a sustained lower risk of
disease over five-years of follow-up period. Through the aims, I will study the characteristics of subclinical TB
disease and its transmissibility. The results will inform TB preventive therapy strategies and targeted
interventions to interrupt transmission at the facility/community levels and have broad applicability to children
and young adults in schools and other settings, globally.
 The training goals I have identified that include spatial analysis and analysis of WGS data will enable
me to accomplish the aims of the study. The opportunity for mentorship, training, and research through this
award will give me the knowledge, experience, and expertise to develop an R01 proposal for a multicenter
study on TB transmission and preventive therapy that will allow me to become an independent investigator."
10843858,"ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY 
Chronic stress is thought to play a role in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. Standard pharmacological treatments for stress-related disorders can take up to several months to elicit a therapeutic response and can produce long-term undesirable off-target effects. A single dose of the psychedelic drug psilocybin has been shown to rapidly promote long-lasting therapeutic effects in humans and in chronically stressed rodents. However, the neural circuit mechanisms underlying the lasting changes induced by psilocybin in healthy and chronically stressed brains remain unknown.
The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a key structure impacted by chronic stress. Decreased volume, hypoactivity, and impaired functional connectivity of the PFC has been observed in humans with stress-related disorders. Similarly, PFC pyramidal cells in chronically stressed rodents exhibit dendritic atrophy and excitatory synapse loss. Psilocybin enhances expression of neuroplasticity-related genes through a cascade involving the activation of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR). While the 5-HT2AR is expressed postsynaptically in many cell-types, including PFC pyramidal cells, presynaptic 5-HT2ARs are also known to regulate synaptic input to PFC pyramidal neurons. Psilocybin induces dendritic growth and increases dendritic spine density in PFC pyramidal cells after a single dose. However, no studies to date have examined the rules governing which synapses (and which corresponding dendritic spines) are restored: does psilocybin non-specifically increase spine and synapse number, or does it preferentially enhance spines and synapses corresponding to specific inputs with higher 5-HT2AR expression? Answering this question is a critical step towards a mechanistic understanding of how psilocybin exerts therapeutic effects. 
To address this gap in knowledge, we will conduct a multiscale investigation of the effects of psilocybin on multiple brain regions. Our central hypothesis is that the synaptic inputs to PFC that are impaired following chronic stress are restored in an input-specific manner by psilocybin. In Aim 1, we will characterize the effects of psilocybin in vivo on input-specific changes in PFC connectivity and dynamics in chronically stressed rodents. In Aim 2, we will use both in vivo and ex vivo optogenetics to determine the effects of chronic stress and subsequent psilocybin treatment on input-specific synaptic physiology and dendritic morphology. The completion of these Aims will identify input-specific rules governing psilocybin-induced normalization of impaired prefrontal circuits, with important implications for the design of even more precise and efficacious neuropsychiatric therapies with minimal off-target effects."

The goals of this project are two-fold: 1) to evaluate the role of lysosomal dysfunction in lipotoxic cardiomyopathy
and 2) to provide mentorship and training to allow the PI’s transition to independence. The prevalence of diabetes
and obesity are increasing in the population, and both conditions are independent risk factors for the
development of heart failure. Cardiac lipotoxicity has been identified as a potential pathway through which
diabetes causes cardiomyopathy, but the understanding of how lipid overload disrupts cardiac function remains
limited. Preliminary data acquired by the PI demonstrate that lipid overload-induced cardiac dysfunction is
rescued by intermittent fasting. Intermittent fasting does not reduce cardiac triglyceride levels, but protein
aggregate pathology is attenuated. Also, the levels of specific cardiac ceramide species are altered, suggesting
that the effect of intermittent fasting is medicated by changing the level of individual lipid species, rather than
overall reduction in lipids. Based on this data, this project hypothesizes that myocardial lipid overload impairs
lysosome function via ceramide accumulation to induce cardiomyopathy and that stimulation of lysosomal
biogenesis program by TFEB activation is sufficient to rescue this outcome. This hypothesis will be tested by
assessing autophagic flux and lysosomal function in mice models of cardiac lipid overload and in cultured
cardiomyocytes under lipid stress (Aim 1), examining cardiac lysosomal ceramide accumulation under lipid
stress and the requirement for ceramide synthesis in cardiac lipotoxicity (Aim 2), and evaluating the role of TFEB
in stimulating lysosomal biogenesis to improve lipotoxic cardiomyopathy (Aim 3). Completion of these aims will
address knowledge gaps in the field of cardiac lipotoxicity and also provide training to facilitate the career
development of the PI. The PI has previously obtained PhD training in molecular and cellular biology and has
undertaken postdoctoral training in the lab of Dr. Abhinav Diwan, following completion of clinical training in
medicine and cardiology. The PI seeks additional scientific training in a mentored setting to address the
knowledge gaps described. Specifically, the proposed career development plan will provide additional training
in 4 areas: 1) autophagy and lysosomal biology, 2) lipid biology and lipidomics, with a focus on sphingolipid
biology, 3) echocardiographic analysis of animal models of cardiac disease, and 4) training in grant writing,
presentation skills, and leadership. This plan will be guided by mentorship and research support from Dr. Abhinav
Diwan and Dr. Douglas Mann, experts in lysosomal biology and myocardial biology, respectively, as well as by
additional mentorship from the advisory committee with renowned expertise in lysosomal biology (Dr. Stuart
Kornfeld), lipid biology (Dr. Brian Finck and Dr. Clay Semenkovich), and sphingolipid biology and lipidomics (Dr.
Ashley Cowart). This training and mentorship in a highly supportive institutional training environment will enable
the PI to develop into an independent cardiovascular investigator and physician-scientist focused on studying
the role of lysosomes in cardiovascular development and in the myocardial response to injury."
10836364,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Approximately 50% of young adults who drink alcohol experience alcohol-induced “blackouts,” defined as
permanent (en bloc) or temporary (fragmentary) memory loss for events that occurred while they are drinking.
This experience of alcohol-induced blackout is associated prospectively with alcohol-related harm, including
emergency room visits and sexual coercion, with medical care costs exceeding $469,000 per year. While
young adults who have recently experienced a blackout report less favorable evaluations of drinking events
and increased motivation to decrease their drinking, they do not actually change their drinking behavior as a
result of the blackout alone. Collectively, these data suggest that blackouts may serve as an opportunity for
intervention, after which young adults are more likely to respond to alcohol feedback. This R34 aims to develop
an intervention tailored to individuals who experience blackouts. The research team developed a dynamic
personalized feedback intervention for young adults with a history of blackout. In the first phase of this
research (Aim 1 user testing), 15-20 young adults with a history of blackout will provide their perspectives on
the proposed content, layout, and language of the intervention. In the second phase of the project (Aim 1 pilot
testing), 15 young adults with a history of blackout will pilot the intervention and then provide feedback on their
experience with and reactions to delivery. In the final phase (Aim 2 preliminary efficacy testing), 162 young
adults (50% female, ≥50% non-college) who report a history of blackout will be randomly assigned to receive
the intervention (n=81) or assessment only (n=81). Outcomes will be assessed immediately post-intervention
and at 3-month follow-up. Primary outcomes include feasibility (recruitment/retention) and acceptability of the
intervention, frequency of high-intensity drinking, peak blood alcohol concentration (BAC), frequency of
blackouts, and alcohol-related consequences. Secondary outcomes include incidence of sexual coercion or
emergency room visits, perceived likelihood and aversiveness of blackouts, cost/benefits of alcohol use, and
self-efficacy of avoid blackouts. Results will inform an R01 randomized trial examining the efficacy and
mediators/moderators of the intervention in a larger sample of heavy-drinking young adults. This study will
provide initial evidence that blackouts are a feasible and motivating target for brief alcohol interventions."
10836369,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
HIV-1 associated neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity lead to cognitive impairments (HIV-1-associated
neurocognitive disorders or HAND) even in those under suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART). As people
living with HIV-1 age, a compounding effect is occurring, with age associated dementia added to HAND,
leading to a complex web of neurocognitive deficit. This will have tremendous implications for health care
systems not only in the USA but also in the developing world. How HAND develops, and how it could be
modified remain mysterious, largely because It has been very difficult to study HIV-1 infection and HAND in the
human brain. Over the past few years new developments in stem cell technologies have permitted the
differentiation of “cerebral organoids” from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and these cultures can be
grown in vitro in conditions that promote three-dimensional expansion of neuroectoderm, in cerebral organoid
or “miniature brain” forms. Cerebral organoids are heterogeneous and form a variety of brain regions, including
ventral forebrain, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and mid- and hindbrain boundary. They exhibit neurons that
are functional and capable of electrical excitation, and develop microglia. These brain organoids also resemble
human cortical development at the gene expression level, and allow in depth analysis of neural networks, cell
behavior, drug screening, disease modeling, and variations in brain development. While brain-region
composition varies in organoids from different iPSC lines, regional gene-expression patterns remain largely
reproducible across individuals. These create unparalleled new opportunities to study HIV-1 infection of the
brain. We propose to develop our iPSC derived organoid model which incorporates microglia, into one that
better represents an adult mature brain that can support robust HIV-1 infection. With this model, we can test
whether different viruses lead to differential neurotoxicity and if cells other than microglia can be latently
infected with virus. We will test how individual proteins from the virus, including HIV-1 Tat causes neurological
damage, and how ART or drugs such as Didehydro-Cortistatin A (dCA), which cross-neutralizes Tat activity,
affects the process. Interestingly, exposure to Tat also potentiates cocaine-mediated reward mechanisms,
which further promotes HAND, revealing a complex web of interactions between HIV-1 infection and drugs of
substance abuse. We will determine how Tat and cocaine collaborate in neurological damage and determine if
dCA can reverse it. As cerebral organoids provide a model for HIV-1 latency in the brain we can test whether
administration of dCA, can “block-and-lock” any residual virus, and finally whether HIV-1 specific cytotoxic T
cells (CTL) can eliminate virus in the organoid. Together, these studies promise to provide novel insights into
the pathogenesis of HAND, Tat mediated neurotoxicity, effects of cocaine, and the potential link between these
processes. Finally, the model promises to add exciting findings on HIV-1 latency in the brain, and if it can be
silenced or eliminated."
10837388,"PROGRAM SUMMARY
Despite concerted efforts, the global incidence of malaria has been on the rise since 2015, with a 7.4% increase
reported in 2021. This increase is largely driven by a subset of high-burden countries, primarily located in sub-
Saharan Africa, where approximately 95% of cases and deaths occur. To reverse this trend, it is imperative to
gain insights into the underlying mechanisms responsible for the persistent transmission of malaria in spite of
the deployment of proven control interventions. Our International Center of Excellence for Malaria Research
program called “REDIAL” will be based in Cameroon, a Central African country that epitomizes the malaria
challenge faced by high-burden countries. Cameroon, one of the top 11 malaria high-burden countries, has
experienced a malaria resurgence, with the disease incidence increased by 24% since 2012. The reasons for
this rising malaria trend are unknown but indicate that the current control measures do not adequately target the
critical transmission reservoirs to disrupt malaria transmission. Cameroon, renowned as ""Africa in miniature"" due
to its diverse ecology, exhibits highly heterogeneous malaria transmission patterns across its five distinct eco-
climatic zones, where various vectors play remarkably different roles in transmitting the disease. The routine
malaria surveillance systems in Cameroon are inadequate and do not offer the spatial granularity and longitudinal
views that are needed to assess the malaria trend and monitor the impact of control interventions. In addition,
the malaria situation is compounded by the emergence and spread of insecticide-resistant vectors and multidrug-
resistant malaria parasites, further aggravating the problem. Therefore, the central goal of this program is to
improve our understanding of how the evolving parasite and vector populations evade contemporary malaria
control measures to sustain high-level malaria transmission in divergent ecological zones in Cameroon so that
innovative integrated strategies can be developed to control and ultimately eliminate malaria. To achieve this
overarching objective, we have selected study sites in Cameroon with drastically different malaria epidemiology
to conduct comprehensive research on humans, vectors, and parasites in two interrelated projects. Project 1 will
conduct longitudinal cohort studies and mosquito-feeding experiments to elucidate the critical transmission
reservoirs and determine how the malaria control interventions affect the reservoirs, vectorial capacity, and
evolution of parasite populations. Project 2 will comprehensively investigate the evolution of insecticide
resistance in major vector species and antimalarial drug resistance in malaria parasites in response to control
interventions and how these affect the effectiveness of current interventions. By dissecting the complex
interactions between the human host, diverse mosquito vectors, and drug-resistant parasites, this study will
unravel the mechanisms underlying the high-level malaria transmission and provide the critical evidence needed
by the national malaria control program to optimize strategies to effectively control malaria in Cameroon."

10907839,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant childhood brain tumor. Even with aggressive therapy,
many patients still die of their disease. Moreover, survivors suffer severe long-term side effects as a result of
treatment, which are thought to result in large part from radiation-induced damage to the developing nervous
system. Unlike other brain tumors, which infiltrate through the brain parenchyma, MB commonly spreads
through the meninges that surround the brain and spinal cord, a phenomenon termed leptomeningeal
metastasis (LM). We recently performed a high throughput drug screen to identify the polypeptide antibiotic
actinomycin as a compound of interest for the treatment of MB. We developed methods to encapsulate
actinomycin within biodegradable and biocompatible polymeric nanoparticles. We have also identified a
peptide ligand capable of targeting receptors that are upregulated on both spinal cord vasculature and patient
derived MB. Our preliminary data demonstrate that actinomycin delivered from nanoparticles is significantly
more effective at treating intracranial MB than free drug when administered intravenously. Further, we
demonstrate that nanoparticles administered directly to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) localize with malignant
cells to slow the growth of LM. In this work, we will evaluate delivery strategies (presence of targeting ligand,
route of administration) to optimize these new approaches in MB. Nanoparticles will be ""barcoded"" to fluoresce
in distinct wavelengths, such that the cellular level distribution of both control and targeted nanoparticle
formulations can be evaluated within a single subject to directly assess nanoparticle fate and drug action at the
cellular level. We will test test these systems in patient derived and genetically engineered models of MB
exhibiting LM. We hypothesize that improved, targeted nanoparticle delivery will enhance exposure of
metastatic cells to drug, to improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce the radiation dose needed to achieve
complete tumor therapy. To test this hypothesis, we will (1) track delivery of targeted nanoparticles to
malignant cells in the brain and spinal cord; (2) evaluate delivery, activity, and toxicity of actinomycin; and (3)
test efficacy of targeted therapies in combination with radiation. Our experimental approach has been designed
to sequentially refine the design of drug-loaded nanoparticles to yield a better treatment for MB by directly
addressing LM as a unique disease burden. We expect that the outcome of these studies will also yield new
strategies for spinal cord targeted drug delivery that will be relevant to other disseminated cancers or
neurological diseases affecting the spinal cord."
10838211,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Infections with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) remain a major global public health concern. The HIV
reservoirs are a leading reason for which HIV infection remains without a cure. HIV integrates its viral DNA into
the host cell DNA. Cell activation leads to transcription of archived viral information, which can refuel viral
replication even in the presence of antiretroviral therapy (ART). This may be problematic when cellular reservoirs
of HIV involve cell types that are in continuous functional activation. Research conducted by others and us have
shown that pvSMC are susceptible to HIV infection. In addition, people living with HIV (PLWH) are more prone
to comorbidities that involve chronic vascular constriction. Our preliminary studies suggest that pulmonary
arterial smooth muscle cells are susceptible to HIV infection, sustain the infection during ART-induced viral
suppression, and are capable to release infectious viruses that can infect bystander T cells. Our preliminary
findings have significant importance because identifying and eliminating HIV reservoirs such as pvSMC is critical
to the success of global efforts to cure HIV. The fact that PLWH are more prone to pulmonary vasoconstrictive
diseases implies that the persistent cell activation and vasoconstriction of pvSMC are likely to provide
transcriptionally active HIV leading to reseeding of reservoirs. The pulmonary vasculature is heavily overlooked
as an important source of HIV, leading to a significant gap in the literature about non-immune cell sources such
as pvSMC as HIV reservoirs. Herein, we propose to determine the ability of pvSMC to support chronic HIV
infection and their ability to spread HIV to bystander immune cells in the presence of ART. We also propose to
investigate the cellular mechanisms for the resiliency of pvSMC to the cytopathic effects of HIV. This work should
provide new insights into the potential of pulmonary vascular as SMC as reservoirs in the era of advanced ART.
Knowing the characteristics of pvSMC as HIV reservoirs is imperative to further strategize for the effective
eradication of a previously unappreciated HIV reservoir."

 During the past funding period, we discovered that the cohesin-mediated loop extrusion process
involved in genome-wide modulation of chromosome architecture plays fundamental roles in V(D)J
recombination and the generation of antibody diversity. In developing progenitor B cells, we found that
cohesin-mediated loop extrusion linearly presents Ig heavy chain locus (Igh) VH, D, and JH gene segments to
the RAG endonuclease for V(D)J recombination. Our preliminary data indicate that long-range V(D)J
recombination in the Igk light chain locus may occur, at least in part, by a mechanistically distinct process from
that of Igh. We propose 2 specific aims to elucidate the potentially differential mechanisms of Igh versus Igk
long-range V(D)J recombination. A major hypothesis guiding Aim 1 and Aim2 studies is that Igh achieves long
range V(D)J recombination via linear RAG chromatin scanning that leads to predominantly deletional
recombination events. A major hypothesis to be tested for Aim 2 is that Igk is structurally-optimized to employ
a related loop extrusion-based mechanism that accommodates both robust deletional and inverted Vk-to-
Jk joining. These hypotheses are supported by a wealth of published and preliminary data derived in large part
from powerful new technologies that we developed during the current funding period. In particular we
developed LAM-HTGTS-V(D)J-Seq to assay V(D)J recombination with unprecedented sensitivity and LAM-3C-
HTGTS to map sequence interactions across chromatin domains at far higher resolution than prior assays. We
further developed G1-arrested, RAG inducible v-Abl transformed pro-B cell cell (""v-Abl cell"") approaches to test
roles specific cis elements or trans-acting factors in long-range RAG chromatin-scanning through introduced
Igh or Igk locus modifications and/or targeted protein depletion. Aims 1 and 2 experiments together will
compare and contrast, in depth, the long-range mechanisms used by Igh and Igk to incorporate Vs into the
V(D)J recombination reaction. While most initial Aim 1 and 2 studies will employ v-Abl cells; all key results will
be confirmed/extended by studies of normal progenitor and precursor B cell populations These studies may
reveal new paradigms for understanding V(D)J recombination in vivo and illuminate the range of mechanisms
employed for long-range V(D)J recombination in antigen receptor loci. Addressing Aim 1 and 2 goals should
greatly impact the immunology field by providing major new insights into fundamental mechanisms that
establish highly diverse primary antibody repertoires. The studies proposed in Aim 1 and 2 will also further
elucidate how impediments in the scanning path focus cryptic RSS targets within impeded areas of chromatin
for incorporation into the RAG complex and subsequent rearrangement. Thus, these studies should provide
critical information for understanding how RAG targets cryptic RSSs in other genes and promotes common
translocations or interstitial deletions frequently found in B and T lymphocyte cancers of developing
lymphocytes in humans."

More than 1.1 million people in the United States (US) are living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
infection, and an estimated 30% of people living with HIV (PLWH) have evidence of chronic kidney disease
(CKD). Compared to the general population, the rate of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) among PLWH is
tenfold greater and mortality on dialysis is 19-fold higher. Contributors to CKD in PLWH include comorbidities
shared with the uninfected population, HIV-specific factors, and genetic variants; however, the interplay of
these various determinants remains incompletely understood. Existing CKD risk prediction tools for PLWH
have low sensitivity and insufficient positive predictive value for clinical decision-making. The ability to risk-
stratify PLWH and distinguish those at highest risk for future development of CKD from those at low risk is
critical to optimize care and patient outcomes. PLWH at high risk can be targeted for interventions to slow CKD
progression and improve survival, including earlier establishment of nephrology care and referral for
transplantation; while identification of those at low risk allows for the development of a living donor selection
framework specific to PLWH, effectively expanding HIV+ to HIV+ transplantation to include living donors. We
hypothesize that the impact of HIV on CKD risk varies by the interplay between comorbid conditions, HIV-
related factors, and genetic variants, and distinct phenotypes of PLWH with high and low CKD risk exist. To
better understand this relationship, we will leverage the Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated
Clinical Systems (CNICS), a unique prospective clinical cohort with > 34,000 participants, and will address the
following unique aims: (1) to explore the association of unique HIV-related processes and clinical
characteristics with risk for CKD; (2) to explore the association of genetic variants with risk for CKD and
correlate histologic findings with genetic risk; and (3) develop a tool for predicting CKD risk among PLWH.
Stratification by risk for future development of CKD is critical for identifying those PLWH at highest risk that
would benefit from early nephrology care and referral for transplantation and those at lowest risk that could be
eligible for living kidney donation. Using an existing cohort of PLWH representative of the US HIV population,
with time varying data and DNA for genotyping, to inform CKD risk prediction is necessary, practical, and
novel. Our findings will contribute new insights into the relationship between HIV and risk for kidney disease."
10844366,"Background: The Veterans Choice Program and MISSION Act have transformed how VA delivers care by
expanding Veterans’ eligibility to receive VA-funded care from community providers. The effects of this change
on the quality and equity of care are unknown. Understanding these effects is critical, given the importance of
these programs to VA and the complexity of managing care for Veterans across different health systems. To
address this evidence gap, we will use a quasi-experimental regression discontinuity (RD) design and examine
outcomes in medically and socially vulnerable subgroups to determine the impact of Choice and MISSION on
quality and equity of Veterans’ health care. To further examine impacts on vulnerable groups, we will analyze
disparities in ratings of community care from VA’s Survey of Healthcare Experiences of Patients (SHEP).
Significance: This proposal addresses cross-cutting HSR&D research priorities, including evaluating the
quality and equity of care for Veterans in the context of a key legislative priority for VA: the MISSION Act. We
will examine how the effects of receiving community care, and patient experiences with community care, differ
in vulnerable populations, addressing VA priorities related to equity. The project constitutes an advancement in
the rigor of research while directly informing ongoing and high priority clinical initiatives within VA.
Innovation and Impact: Our project is innovative because it uses an RD design to provide causal evidence
about the effects of community care on the quality and equity of outpatient care and prescribing. The project is
also innovative and impactful in its attention to subpopulations of socially and medically vulnerable Veterans,
including analyses of disparities in community care patient experiences from national survey data. By working
closely with operational partners and a Veterans Advisory Board, we will impact VA policy by translating
findings into actionable recommendations to improve community care, particularly for vulnerable groups.
Specific Aims: (1) Identify the effects of receiving outpatient community care through Choice and MISSION on
quality and equity. (2) Identify the effects of community care on the quality and equity of prescribing. (3)
Compare Veterans’ experiences with community care in vulnerable and other Veteran populations.
Methodology: We will use an RD design and analyses of both administrative and VA survey data to assess
the effects of Choice (all program years) and MISSION (2019-2022) on the quality and equity of Veterans’
health care. Aims 1-2 will use a quasi-experimental RD design that compares Veterans just above vs. below
distance and travel time eligibility thresholds for VA community care in Choice and MISSION. We will study
effects of community care use on quality overall and, to evaluate implications for equity, in vulnerable
subpopulations defined by the presence of serious mental illness or substance use disorders, complex chronic
conditions, low income, and racial/ethnic minority status. Outcome variables in Aim 1 focus on outpatient
processes of care (e.g., continuity of care) and outcomes linked to care coordination (e.g., admissions for
ambulatory care-sensitive conditions). Outcome variables in Aim 2 focus on prescribing safety and quality
(e.g., drug-drug interactions), therapeutic duplication, and refill non-adherence. These analyses use VA
Corporate Data Warehouse, Planning Systems Support Group, Medicare, and Program Integrity Tool data. In
Aim 3, we will analyze national data from the VA SHEP Community Care survey (conducted among
community care recipients) to compare patient-reported experiences with community care among Veterans in
vulnerable populations vs. other Veterans. Outcome variables in Aim 3 include 5 domains of Veterans’
experiences with care coordination, provider communication, and timely access in VA community care.
Next Steps/Implementation: Through close partnerships with the Office of Community Care, Pharmacy
Benefits Management, Office of Health Equity, and a Veterans Advisory Board, we will rapidly disseminate our
findings and translate them into actionable recommendations to improve quality and equity in community care."
10844367,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: The goal of this research is to prevent HIV among women who inject
drugs (WWID) through organization-level change in the way pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is delivered to
this population. Dr. Starbird is proposing a research and career development plan which will prepare her to
independently evaluate system-level interventions to improve care delivery to WWID with high capacity for
implementation. WWID are among the most vulnerable to acquiring HIV due to the dual effects of both unsafe
injecting and sexual practices. PrEP is effective and recommended to prevent HIV infection among high-risk
groups, including WWID. However, PrEP uptake among WWID is lagging – 92% of people who receive PrEP
in New York State are men. Interventions at the organizational level present an opportunity to improve PrEP
delivery and decrease gender disparities among people who inject drugs, particularly in primary and
reproductive healthcare settings which can engage WWID in ongoing PrEP use when they present for
comorbidity management, psychosocial services, or pregnancy support. Including PrEP for WWID in often
under-resourced and stretched primary and reproductive healthcare settings poses organizational challenges
that may be eliminated with Practice Facilitation. Practice Facilitation is an evidence-based strategy to support
clinics' abilities to implement an intervention such as PrEP through technical assistance, logistical support, and
external partnership building. This study will leverage NIDA's investment in the HEALing Communities Study in
New York State (UM1 DA049415, PI: El-Bassel, primary mentor) to achieve the following specific aims: 1)
explore the opinions of WWID about how PrEP is delivered to them, 2) examine the provider- and organization-
level barriers and facilitators to delivering PrEP to WWID, and 3) adapt and pilot test the feasibility and
acceptability of Practice Facilitation to improve PrEP delivery to WWID in primary and reproductive healthcare
settings. We hypothesize that PrEP Practice Facilitation will be feasible and acceptable to primary and
reproductive healthcare organizations and demonstrate potential to increase the proportion of WWID who
receive a prescription for PrEP. Dr. Starbird has contributed to understanding the efficacy, effectiveness, and
economic implications of interventions for individuals with substance use disorder, HIV, and hepatitis C. This
Mentored Research Scientist Development Award builds on this experience and extends it with training in four
key skills: 1) advanced qualitative analysis, 2) organizational behavior change, 3) implementation science, and
4) ethical conduct of research with vulnerable women. The proposed K01 will provide training, mentorship, and
research experience that will serve as the foundation for Dr. Starbird's career as an independent investigator
dedicated to improving healthcare delivery for marginalized populations. This project is well-aligned with the
strategic objectives of NIDA and also directly in line with the Office of AIDS Research cross-cutting areas of
Health Disparities and Implementation Science Research to reduce the incidence of HIV."

10844491,"PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Nuclear power plant accidents, terrorism, and geopolitical instability present the
risk of massive radiation exposure. As neutrophils markedly decline post-radiation exposure, macrophages
assume the important role of removing most translocated or invading bacteria. However, very few studies
have evaluated the effects of radiation on the phagocytic function of differentiated, non-dividing tissue resident
macrophages. We have discovered that extracellular cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (eCIRP) is a novel
mediator which can cause innate immune dysfunction. In our preliminary studies, we have shown an
increased release of eCIRP after radiation exposure in vivo and in vitro. Deficiency in CIRP improved the
survival of mice subjected to total body irradiation (TBI). Sepsis significantly worsened the survival post-TBI,
but CIRP-/- mice had lower bacterial loads and improved survival after sepsis, suggesting that eCIRP’s
detrimental effect may be due to the impaired bacterial clearance. Indeed, eCIRP significantly reduced
macrophage phagocytosis of E. coli via cytoskeletal paralysis. eCIRP also induced the formation of macro-
phage extracellular traps, and extracellular traps reduced macrophage phagocytosis of dying cells. We have
identified that triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) is the eCIRP receptor, and that
TREM-1 activation plays a critical role in the eCIRP-mediated macrophage phagocytic dysfunction. Moreover,
the 30-day survival after TBI was significantly improved in TREM-1-/- mice. Based on these novel findings, we
hypothesize that eCIRP released after ionizing radiation activates TREM-1, resulting in macrophage
phagocytic dysfunction and ultimately leading to sepsis and death. We have also shown that the new inhibitor
M3 reduced eCIRP’s binding to TREM-1 and improved survival after sepsis. As such, we further hypothesize
that inhibition of eCIRP/TREM-1 interaction with M3 restores macrophage phagocytic function, thereby
improving the survival of mice subjected to radiation injury alone or complicated by sepsis. In this project, we
plan to further establish the critical role of eCIRP on radiation-induced macrophage phagocytic dysfunction,
determine the mechanisms by which eCIRP causes macrophage phagocytic dysfunction, and develop M3 as a
novel radiation medical countermeasure targeting eCIRP-induced macrophage phagocytic dysfunction. These
studies shall provide novel mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of radiation-induced innate immune
dysfunction, as well as a new medical countermeasure for victims of major radiation exposure with or without
sepsis."
10844511,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive blood cancer with a high mortality rate and poor
survival outcomes. The majority of AML patients die from complications arising from bone marrow
failure which causes decreased production of blood forming cells. However, we lack fundamental
knowledge regarding the mechanism driving this phenomenon.
Building upon recent data which shows near complete depletion of hematopoietic stem and progenitors
during AML expansion in human AML xenografts which occurred even with low level of disease burden,
the proposed work will define whether AML cell expansion displaces normal stem and progenitors from
the bone marrow environment into peripheral circulation (Aim 1) whereby they become entrapped in the
splenic endothelial and perivascular niche. This project also aims to characterize the splenic endothelial
and perivascular niche which remains poorly defined with respect to its cellular taxonomy and ability to
provide critical niche factors (Aim 2). These studies will be complemented by investigating the unique
oxysterol, 27-hydroxycholesterol, produced by AML cells in the dysregulation of normal hematopoiesis
in a paracrine manner (Aim 3).
This work will be performed under the primary mentorship of Dr. Ravi Majeti, an expert in the genetic
characterization and therapeutic targeting of AML cells using primary human AML xenografts. My co-
mentors, Dr. Irving Weissman and Dr. Hiro Nakauchi, are both renowned for their knowledge and
expertise in the characterization of hematopoietic stem and progenitors cells in the bone marrow and
spleen. This work will be conducted at Stanford University School of Medicine, a world-class research
institution. The results of the proposed work have the potential to translate existing, non-toxic and FDA
approved drugs into early phase clinical trials in a disease population that is very difficult to treat. If
funded, this award will allow me to pursue a rigorous training plan in normal and malignant
hematopoiesis, enabling me to expand my research across disciplines, learn new techniques, and acquire
the knowledge and skills to establish an independent laboratory focused on the reversal of bone marrow
failure in AML."
10844513,"Project Summary PD/PI: Laura B. Duvall PhD
Mosquitoes are obligate blood-feeders that pose increasing threats to global public health by
spreading diseases, including Zika and malaria, among humans. Innate behaviors, including
blood-feeding and mating, play key roles in vector biology and undergo dramatic changes
influenced by environmental factors and internal state but we know little about the physiological
changes underlying the behavioral readout. Our work focuses on understanding how
neuropeptides regulate organismal physiology in mosquitoes. Specifically, how these peptides
influence blood-feeding and utilization and post-mating responses.
After a full meal of blood, female mosquitoes suppress their drive to bite humans for several
days until they have matured and laid eggs. Behavioral suppression consists of several phases
that are influenced by fluid regulation, nutrient sensing and satiety, and egg development.
Although it is clear that these pathways influence each other, exactly how these individual
components combine to produce the full expression of behavioral suppression remains
unknown. We will use a combination of pharmacological and genetic techniques to ask how
these pathways interact with each other on a signaling level as well as an anatomical level.
Female mating responses are strongly regulated by peptide signals transferred from males to
females. These signals prevent the female from accepting subsequent mates, ensuring the first
male fathers all of her offspring, and allow her to allocate nutritional resources for reproduction.
Using high-throughput cell-based screening techniques to pair ligands with receptors we will
identify key receptors in the female that mediate post-mating responses and find small molecule
drugs that act on them. We will map the anatomy that underlies post-mating responses using
cutting-edge genetic techniques that enable us to label and manipulate the cells that express
these receptors.
These findings will increase our mechanistic understanding of how neuropeptide signaling acts
on anatomical circuits to modulate chemosensory perception and motivated behavior.
Additionally, these results will provide the basis for innovative approaches to mosquito control
since receptors that affect mating and biting could be “weaponized” against mosquitoes to
disrupt these behaviors. Directly targeting behaviors that contribute to the spread of diseases
offers an effective vector control solution by preventing transmission of all of the pathogens
carried by these animals."
10844515,"The broad objective guiding our research is to provide critical insights to clinicians and decision makers
regarding the value of interventions to diagnose, prevent and reduce progression of physical frailty (PF) in
people with HIV (PWH).
More than a million persons in the United States live with HIV, a previously fatal infection that has become a
highly treatable chronic condition with the use of antiretroviral therapy. The life expectancy of PWH now
approaches that of the general population, revealing an earlier than expected and growing prevalence of PF. PF
carries substantial individual and societal burden. If unmanaged, it may lead to loss of independence, recurrent
falls, fractures, disability, and death. Routine screening and management of PF has not been part of the
treatment guidelines, which instead focused on opportunistic infections early in the HIV epidemic, and more
recently on HCV co-infection, CVD, and tobacco and other substance use disorder.
The challenges in diagnosing and managing PF and its associated conditions in PWH are further exacerbated
by the gap between ‘what we know’ and ‘what we do.’ Evidence indicates that pre-frailty and early stages of PF
are reversible with timely diagnosis and effective interventions. However, this evidence has not been translated
to routine HIV care. Regular frailty assessment is essential to prevent falls, fractures and other consequences,
yet most PWH have not been assessed for PF. Evidence also suggests that multimodal interventions including
cardiovascular and strength exercise in conjunction with fall prevention, treatment of osteoporosis, and careful
medication de-escalation are effective in reducing musculoskeletal manifestations of PF. There are similar
benefits for PWH, however this evidence has not been translated into routine HIV care. Guidance on choosing
among effective interventions to maximize health benefits for PWH with constrained budgets is lacking.
Knowledge of the cost-effectiveness (value) and budgetary impact of these programs would help facilitate
translation of research findings into clinical management of PWH.
Cost-effectiveness analysis is an important methodology that helps to inform choice among multiple efficacious
programs when resources including data, time, and money are limited. We propose to develop a computer
simulation model that portrays the natural history and treatment of PF in PWH to narrow the gap between
evidence and practice by assessing the value of three major strategies to prevent and attenuate progression of
PF in PWH: 1) timely diagnosis of PF; 2) implementation of structured strengthening and cardiovascular
fitness improvement exercise programs to reduce falls and fractures and prevent PF incidence and slow its
progression; and 3) use of fall prevention programs, including polypharmacy de-escalation, osteoporosis
screening and diagnosis and management to reduce falls and fractures."

10844638,"Background: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a deadly disease dependent on several vascular cell
types. But, key systems of molecular cross-talk remain enigmatic. In the prior award, we defined a key regulatory
axis between the transcriptional coactivators YAP/TAZ with the enzyme glutaminase (GLS1), establishing a new
paradigm of how glutamine metabolism is related to vascular stiffness in PAH. Yet, crucial questions remain.
What are the triggers that activate YAP/TAZ to initiate PAH and do they originate from separate cell types?
Downstream of those triggers, does metabolism of other amino acids control vascular stiffening and PAH?
Recently, endothelial cell (EC) senescence–stable cell cycle arrest resulting in inflammatory signaling via
senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors–was reported in PAH, but the consequences of
senescence in PAH are unexplored. We postulate that EC senescence induces inflammatory SASP signaling to
PA fibroblasts, reprogramming serine along with glutamine metabolism to control collagen deposition, vascular
stiffness, and PAH. Aim 1) Define the role of EC senescence in controlling fibroblast glutamine and serine
metabolism, vascular stiffening, and PAH. We plan to study PAH mice carrying EC-specific deficiency of the
senescence driver p16 and the effects on fibroblast YAP and downstream metabolic reprogramming. Via EC-
specific secretome-tracking mice with PAH, we will define the entire profile of SASP protein factors derived from
PAH-relevant senescent ECs. By single cell RNA sequencing of human PAH lung after labeled glutamine/serine
ingestion and spectral (MIMS) imaging, we will determine if EC senescence correlates with fibroblast
glutamine/serine uptake. Aim 2) Determine if alterations of GLS1 and the serine catabolism enzyme SHMT1
are essential for vascular stiffening and PAH. Here, we will determine if fibroblast-specific knockout of GLS1
or SHMT1 reverses vascular stiffening in PAH mice and if AAV-specific delivery of SHMT1 and GLS1 drives
vascular stiffening and PAH. Using small molecules to inhibit YAP/GLS1/SHMT1 encapsulated in PLGA
nanoparticles for inhaled therapy, we will define the efficacy of such therapy to reverse vascular stiffening and
PAH. Aim 3) Utilize 18F-fluoroglutamine PET imaging to measure glutamine uptake in SSc-PAH vs.
controls. We will test 18F-FGln PET imaging in systemic sclerosis-dependent PAH (SSc-PAH) and in SSc
patients with an early-stage form of the PAH, exercise PH. This study will define the relevance of glutamine
metabolism in the development (not merely end-stage) of human PAH and the potential of 18F-FGln to serve as
a novel diagnostic tracer for SSc-PAH. Significance: Our multi-disciplinary team is uniquely positioned to define
an EC senescence-to-fibroblast metabolism pathway critical for inducing vascular stiffening and PAH. We will
test a novel inhaled combinatorial metabolic therapy, and we will embark on a first-in-human diagnostic study of
18F-FGln PET/CT. Thus, we aim to establish the broad intercellular axes that converge upon fibroblast amino
acid metabolism as a crucial regulator of PAH, thereby offering novel targeted therapeutics and diagnostics."
10844643,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Hearing loss (HL) results in reduced access to acoustic speech, which is often only partially restored by
hearing aids. When HL occurs early in life, infants and children must learn speech and language from degraded
acoustic signals, which contributes to large variability in communication, social, and functional outcomes.
Fortunately, seeing a talker’s face while hearing speech provides visual information about what sounds are being
produced. This has been shown to be particularly helpful when access to acoustic speech is reduced by HL.
Thus, visual speech could be one of the most important cues available for children to compensate for HL.
Emerging data show that school-age children with HL benefit far more from visual speech than their peers with
normal hearing. Yet, there is large variability among current speech and language intervention programs for
children with HL, with some auditory-verbal methods artificially limiting visual speech access. Currently, we do
not know whether limiting visual cues is detrimental or encourages development of auditory cues, because there
are critical gaps in our understanding of the effects of early-onset HL on the ability to benefit from visual speech
The source of hearing-related differences in AV benefit is unknown and cannot be explained by disparities in
lipreading ability or cognitive-linguistic skills. The objective of the current proposal is to determine the factors
influencing AV speech benefit among school-age children with and without HL. Our central hypothesis is that AV
benefit is governed by acoustic-phonetic access, as determined by frequency-specific audibility. We expect that
visual speech is more helpful for listeners with reduced high-frequency audibility than those with normal hearing
or normal high-frequency audibility. This study also will evaluate whether children with HL are better
than children with normal hearing at taking advantage of visual cues. Children will complete auditory, visual, and
AV tests of consonant articulation in noise and across conditions differing in acoustic frequency content to test
the hypothesis that reduced high-frequency audibility decreases redundancy between auditory and visual
phonetic cues and relative weighting of high-frequency acoustics, resulting in greater AV benefit. We will apply
computational modeling to determine whether children with HL have closer to optimal integration efficiency.
Results will inform data-driven clinical recommendations regarding the best type of spoken language intervention
for children with HL based on frequency-specific audibility. Results will feed directly into an R01 examining how
individual differences in development of AV speech benefit and intervention decisions regarding visual speech
access affect communication outcomes among children with HL."

Postprandial plasma triacylglyceride levels are independently associated with risk of cardiovascular
disease. The intestine plays a key role in the regulation of dietary triacylglyceride absorption by
packaging and secreting lipids in chylomicron particles. The intracellular steps of chylomicron
biogenesis and transport have been fairly well described, however, there is a significant gap in our
understanding of the mechanism for the final steps of chylomicron secretion by enterocytes, specifically
post-Golgi transport and secretion. We recently identified a protein that plays a critical role in this
pathway, DENND5B. Our newly generated Dennd5b-/- mouse demonstrates an essential role for this
gene in Golgi to plasma membrane transport of chylomicron secretory vesicles. Dennd5b-deficient mice
are resistant to diet-induced: obesity, changes in plasma lipids, and atherosclerosis. In humans, exome
sequencing studies reveal that a common DENND5B variant is correlated with body mass index. These
studies establish an important role for DENND5B in post-Golgi chylomicron secretion and a subsequent
influence on body composition and peripheral lipoprotein metabolism. The overall objective of this
proposal is to gain fundamental knowledge about the process of dietary lipid absorption by the intestine
and to examine the impact of this process on systemic metabolic health. This objective aligns well with
the NIH mission to seek fundamental knowledge about living systems and to apply this knowledge to
enhance health. The Specific Aims of this proposal use our novel mouse model and in vitro
experiments to examine the mechanistic role of DENND5B in the intestine and its systemic metabolic
effects. Aim 1 will quantify the impact of Dennd5b on dietary lipid absorption and generate a
comprehensive spatial single-cell RNAsequencing data set for examination of gene networks that
participate in regulation of dietary lipid absorption. Aim 2 will examine the mechanism underlying
Dennd5b action in CM transport. Furthermore, this aim will use mass spectrometry and interactomics
analysis to expand our understanding of this process by identifying other interacting proteins which may
form a complex to facilitate chylomicron secretion by the intestine. Aim 3 will determine the impact of
Dennd5b on enterocyte metabolic function and peripheral lipid metabolism. Successful completion of
this proposal will fill a significant knowledge gap in the process of dietary lipid absorption. This work will
advance the field by providing mechanistic details for a key step in chylomicron secretion that can affect
systemic lipid homeostasis and metabolic health."
10844648,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Our long-term goal is to understand how the brain processes information in a flexible, context-dependent
manner to support effective decision-making. Many previous studies of decision-making focused on how the
brain accumulates evidence used to select a particular action, which was shown to involve modulations of
persistent activity of individual sensory-motor neurons that prepare the appropriate action. However, the brain
must also often accumulate evidence in a flexible manner across actions, about which little is known. We
propose that decisions requiring the flexible accumulation of feedback-related evidence across actions
depends on interactions between the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC), a cortical structure on the medial
surface of each cerebral hemisphere that has widespread connectivity with other parts of the brain, and the
brainstem nucleus locus coeruleus (LC), which is the primary source of the neuromodulator norepinephrine
(NE) to the rest of the brain. The ACC and LC have strong, reciprocal connections and are thought to interact
in ways that support key features of cognition, including adaptive information processing, but the details of
these interactions are not well understood. Our primary hypothesis is that these interactions modulate activity
patterns of populations of ACC neurons that implement a process of across-trial evidence accumulation that
uses reward and error feedback to govern decisions to switch behavioral choices. We are particularly
interested in understanding how these modulations relate to changes in coordinated variability in ACC that can
have major effects on how neural populations process information. To test this hypothesis, we use
simultaneous, complementary measurements of neuronal activity from single and populations of neurons from
the two brain areasin the context of two tasks that require different forms of across-trial accumulation of
feedback information to guide saccadic decisions. We have three Specific Aims. Aim 1 is to understand how
activity patterns of individual neurons in the LC relate to performance on these tasks. Aim 2 is to understand
how relationships between neuronal activity patterns in the LC and ACC relate to performance on these tasks.
Aim 3 is to use a combination of manipulations to identify causal contributions of temporally precise, pathway
specific activity patterns from LC to ACC on task performance. Together these Aims will provide new
mechanistic and computational insights into how LC-related modulations of ACC population activity support
ACC's role in flexibly linking performance monitoring and control across multiple trials. Our findings will have
direct relevance to numerous constructs in the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework and thus have
broad significance to fields that aim to understand the neural substrates of complex behaviors and their
dysfunction in certain mental disorders."
10845043,"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease generated by abnormal
B cell function that induces pathogenic autoantibodies. Our lab has previously defined multiple B
cell abnormalities in SLE including the recent definition of an extrafollicular (EF) pathway
responsible for the generation of pathogenic DN2 effector B cells and the characterization of their
epigenetic programs. During the initial 4 years of this ACE cycle, we demonstrated that EF
reactions are enhanced in severe black SLE patients by hyper-responsiveness to TLR7
stimulation. Notably, we also showed that naïve-derived EF pathogenic autoimmune responses
are also strongly induced in patients with severe COVID-19 infections. Other studies from our
ACE center have identified additional complexity in the diversity of human effector and memory
B cells and their contribution to different immune responses and SLE pathogenesis and
suggested the contributions of B cell endotypes to distinct autoreactive and protective B cell
responses in SLE. However, the diversity of effector and memory B cell populations; their
segregation into disease endotypes; their molecular regulation; and their contributions to disease
pathogenesis remain to be understood. In this Principal Project, we will address these knowledge
gaps through two specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will characterize the diversity and molecular
regulatory programs of effector B cells in SLE using multi-spectral flow cytometry (MSFCM) and
single cell multi-omics (SCMO). Studies will be performed with total B cells as well as antigen-
specific B cells in blood, lymph nodes and Lupus kidneys. In Aim 2, we will study the diversity of
memory B cells in SLE and their derivation through germinal center dependent and independent
pathways and their regulatory programs using blood and lymph nodes. Combined with the
Collaborative and Pilot Project, our studies will contribute original insight into the diversity and
regulation of B cells in SLE, shed light into critical pathogenic processes, and identify cellular and
molecular diagnostic candidates and new targets for precision therapies. In sum, this Project will
enhance our ability to recognize SLE clusters with separate pathogenic mechanisms and
responses to therapy in SLE in general, and more particularly in the underserved Black SLE

10845045,"Project Summary/Abstract
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a debilitating systemic autoimmune disease that results from the
breakdown in B cell tolerance and ultimately the generation of pathogenic autoreactive antibodies. Multiple
factors contribute to SLE including genetic predisposition and environmental influences. Our Emory
Autoimmunity Center of Excellence has characterized a pathogenic lineage of extrafollicular (EF) B cells in Black
SLE subjects in the US South and demonstrated that these EF B cells harbor a unique epigenetic and
transcriptional profile. Importantly, EF B cells are predisposed to differentiate into antibody secreting plasma
cells (ASC), are highly expanded in SLE disease flares, and harbor autoreactive B cell receptors. Despite these
studies, we still do not know which genes underpin EF B cells in SLE and contribute to the secretion of
autoreactive antibodies. This Pilot Project will use sophisticated CRISPR/Cas9 gain and loss-of-function screens
in primary SLE and healthy B cells to unravel the gene networks and interactions that promote the differentiation
of naïve and EF B cells in SLE. Importantly, we will assay two distinct stages of B cell differentiation to answer
the following questions. Do antigen inexperienced SLE naive B cells have distinct differentiation requirements
from healthy? How do EF B cells differ from classical memory cells in their requirements to form ASC? Can
over expression of EF genes in naive B cells drive more rapid ASC differentiation? Do driver genes in SLE also
promote ASC formation in healthy B cells or do they require other SLE specific changes, such as cofactors or
epigenetic remodeling? To answer these questions, we propose two aims. In Aim 1, we will define the genes
required for SLE B cells to form ASC using loss-of-function screens. Importantly we will also test which genes
require or synergize with TLR7 signaling to promote ASC formation. In Aim 2, we will identify driver genes of
SLE B cell differentiation to ASC using gain-of-function screens. Here, genes upregulated in different EF SLE B
cell compartments will be over expressed in antigen-inexperienced naïve B cells to determine if they are sufficient
to enhanced ASC formation. Finally, we will perform the screen while simultaneously overexpressing TBET to
identify genes that collaborate with this known driver of EF B cell fate and autoimmunity. The outcomes of this
Pilot Project will derive the genes required for SLE B cells to form ASC and establish a genome engineering
platform that can be leveraged for future mechanistic studies of human autoimmunity."

The Autoimmunity Center of Excellence based at Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) in New York, NY aims at 1)
advancing the knowledge of pathways and mechanisms that contribute to the development and amplification of
Human Systemic Autoimmune Disease (SAD), and 2) developing tools and identifying biomarkers to monitor
these dysfunctional pathways. Ultimately, we aim to be able to stratify patients towards personalized approaches
to treatment.
The Center will apply state-of-the-art technologies in immune profiling, cell biology and the field of nanoparticles
to gain insight into disease contribution of two major and complementary compartments contributing to systemic
disease: Immune Cells and Extra-Cellular Nanoparticles. The appropriate infrastructure is in place to support
patient-based studies. In particular, we emphasize the following key conceptual and technological innovations
adding to our strengths, that include access to an established pediatric SLE cohort followed by experienced
clinical collaborators with an exceptional record of participation in translational research
While the initial focus will be the study of children with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), extrapolation of
the Center findings to adult SLE as well as other SAD scenarios will be pursued, particularly in the context of the
ACE Collaborative efforts.
The Drukier Institute for Children’s Health Research at Weill Cornell Medicine has gathered a multidisciplinary
team of pediatric basic and patient-oriented investigators with expertise in immunology, autoimmunity, cancer
biology, molecular biology, and bioinformatics. This team works alongside clinical experts in autoimmunity,
cancer, allergy and infectious diseases—bench-to-bedside and back—to understand and treat these diseases.
The Institute and current WCM ACE investigators have also established strong local, national and international
collaborations, many of whom are part of the larger ACE community. Dr. Pascual’s team has a long history of
productive research in the fields of human autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Dr. Lyden’s group has
pioneered the study of exosomes and exomeres and how these particles horizontally transfer their cargo to
recipient cells, thereby acting as vehicles of intercellular communication in both physiological and pathological
conditions. The proposed Center is a natural result of the very complementary expertise of these groups and is
well-poised to work collaboratively to advance clinical and basic discoveries in the field of human autoimmunity.

10845211,"PROJECT SUMMARY (COLLABORATIVE PROJECT)
 Immune-related adverse events (IRAEs) are an emerging group of endocrine autoimmune diseases that
occur in many patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor cancer therapy. IRAEs are an accelerated
version of autoimmune endocrinopathy, and can affect the thyroid, pancreas, and pituitary glands, as well as
numerous other tissues in the body. Understanding the drivers of rapid autoimmune progression in IRAEs can
provide insight into mechanisms of human autoimmunity more broadly and identify potential therapeutic targets
to slow or halt autoimmune responses. We recently reported increased effector conversion and clonal expansion
of Tcf1+ progenitor T cells in patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor-thyroiditis and a mouse model of IRAEs.
Furthermore, we showed that this effector conversion was driven by soluble factors from T follicular and T
peripheral helper T cells, key components of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS). Tcf1+ stem-like progenitor T
cells play a key role in mediating effective immune responses in chronic viral infections and tumor immunity and
colocalize to TLS. Thus, we hypothesize that increased conversion of Tcf1+ stem-like progenitor T cells,
promoted by checkpoint inhibition and TLS factors, drive accelerated autoimmune responses in endocrine
tissues in IRAEs. In Specific Aim 1, Dr. Lechner will investigate the changes in stem-like progenitor T cells over
time in patients who develop IRAEs during checkpoint inhibitor compared to individuals with no autoimmunity,
as well as controls with gradually progressing spontaneous autoimmune endocrinopathies. By simultaneously
evaluating antigen-specific T cell function and expansion over time, Lechner will test the hypothesis that
increased clonal expansion and conversion to effector function drive the development of rapid autoimmunity in
IRAEs. In addition, spatial localization of immune cells within tissues impacts autoimmune disease progression.
Co-localization of stem-like progenitor T cells within TLS and TLS-associated soluble factors provide potential
targets to slow autoimmune responses. Thus, in Specific Aim 2, Dr. Lechner will delineate the spatial immune
landscape within endocrine tissues from individuals with IRAEs, spontaneous autoimmunity, or no autoimmunity
leveraging new techniques in spatial transcriptomics. These studies will test how cellular interactions and soluble
factors within TLS contribute to clonal expansion and effector function of stem-like progenitor T cells during
checkpoint inhibitor therapy and spontaneous autoimmune endocrinopathies. As a collaborative project amongst
ACEs, these Aims and approaches can be extended to the evaluation of specimens from individuals with IRAEs
and spontaneous autoimmunity in other organs, with the overarching goal of delineating temporal and spatial
dynamics of stem-like progenitor T cells in human autoimmune disease. Furthermore, these studies can identify
factors associated with accelerated immune responses in IRAEs, and in doing so, new targets to halt the
progression of autoimmune diseases."
10927408,"Anticipated Impacts on Veteran's Healthcare VA has established strategic goals related to “Access” and
""Timely and Integrated Care"". The proposed pragmatic trial targets these goals by addressing a significant gap
in VA mental health care - namely the treatment of anxiety in the primary care setting using innovative delivery
options. Using a partnership approach, the project will examine the effectiveness and implementation potential
of a brief psychotherapy program for Veterans with anxiety in primary care. Psychotherapy services will be
delivered either in-person or through VA Video Connect-Home (VVC-H). Clinical and implementation outcomes
will inform future dissemination efforts to improve access and delivery of high quality anxiety care in VA
primary care settings.
Background Anxiety disorders are common in VA primary care settings and are associated with substantial
functional impairment, poor health-related quality of life, suicide, and high rates of comorbid psychiatric and
medical disorders. No brief psychotherapy interventions for anxiety currently exist for VA primary care settings
- where many Veterans seek care. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a first line treatment for anxiety but
Primary Care Mental Health Integration (PCMHI) providers need an intervention approach for anxiety disorders
that is brief, problem-focused, and fits into their system of care.
Objectives The proposed 4-year, multisite trial will use a pragmatic randomized trial design to examine the
effectiveness and implementation potential of a brief CBT intervention for anxiety delivered either in-person or
via VVC-H, according to patient preference. CBT will be delivered by existing PCMHI providers at three large
VAMCs. Aim 1 will examine the clinical effectiveness of the bCBT intervention vs. EUC for anxiety and quality
of life at 4-, 8-, and 12-month follow-ups. Aim 2 will determine factors associated with bCBT response and
explore Veteran demographic and clinical factors associated with VVC-H engagement. An exploratory aim will
use mixed, qualitative and quantitative methods to better understand implementation successes and
challenges related to delivery and impact of bCBT anxiety and VVC-H use in the PCMHI setting.
Methods The proposed project seeks to embed bCBT into PCMHI programs using existing VHA providers. A
total of 225 Veterans diagnosed with an anxiety disorder will be recruited from three VAMCs. Eligible Veteran
participants will be randomized to a bCBT or to an Enhanced Usual Care (EUC) condition. A professionally
diverse set of PCMHI providers will be invited to deliver bCBT. Providers will receive bCBT training and
support to embed treatment into their existing practice setting. Veterans randomized to bCBT will receive 4 – 9
sessions based upon treatment response (50% reduction in GAD-7) by session 4. Veterans will also be offered
the choice of receiving bCBT in-person or through VVC-H. EUC participants will receive 4 brief monthly check-
in calls from study staff and a note placed in their medical record alerting their provider to the presence of
significant anxiety symptoms. BCBT treatment and EUC check-in calls will end at 4 months.
Next Steps The proposed project leverages VA stakeholders at all levels to improve alignment of the work with
VA and Veteran initiatives. Clinical outcomes will provide justifications or cautions to inform future evidence-
based psychotherapy (EBP) programs. If positive, data will be used to assist VA leadership in the expansion of
EBPs and VVC-H in PCMHI. For example, should the project produce robust clinical outcomes - next steps
would involve a non-research / demonstration project in one or two VISNs where the project team will train and
support a wider group of providers in the delivery of brief CBT for anxiety. The project team will use the web-
based training program and clinical intervention materials as well as lessons learned from the proposed
HSR&D IIR to support and enhance brief CBT delivery in a non-research context."

Computer-integrated diagnostic and interventional data science encompasses the processing, analysis, and
visualization of images and signals, with the goal to better diagnose disease, better plan, deliver and monitor
therapy, and advance training and simulation for medical education. The emergence of multi-modality medical
imaging and its ability to “see” inside the human body has transformed disease diagnosis and enables less
invasive therapies.
Moreover, artificial intelligence (AI) has led to significant improvements in biomedical
image computing and modeling. However, the adoption of
large-scale data science techniques into diagnostic
and especially interventional workflows has been hampered by the limited availability of tools that can robustly
handle the size, diversity, and dimensionality of the that must be manipulated, often in real time. To mitigate
these barriers, my vision has been to establish and grow a multi-disciplinary research program that integrates
image computing, modeling, visualization, and validation to help elucidate biological complexity by developing
intelligent imaging informatics tools to interact with biomedical data. The program’s long-term goal has been
guided by the premise that effective utilization of biomedical informatics to develop versatile computing and
visualization tools will lead to solutions that enable more accurate and timely disease diagnosis and less
invasive therapies. Projects to date have focused on the development and validation of image computing,
modeling, and visualization techniques that 1) quantify and track imaging biomarkers to diagnose and monitor
disease progression, 2) identify and plan optimal therapeutic routes, and 3) guide, monitor, and deliver therapy
under less invasive conditions. These tools have been developed and demonstrated in the context of cardiac,
orthopedic, lung, brain, and spine applications, in collaborations with clinicians and industry partners. The
work heretofore builds on a decade of research in computer-assisted diagnosis and therapy and will help
answer the key questions in biomedical computing and visualization. We will research novel AI-based image
computing algorithms that robustly handle label noise, out of distribution detection, and class imbalance while
yielding high performance on limited training data; build and validate hybrid AI/physics-based computational
models for interactive biomedical simulation; research uncertainty modeling, propagation, and visualization
techniques; objectively validate the developed tools; and evaluate different display paradigms for information
presentation. This research will yield innovative imaging informatics tools that have the potential to advance
computer-integrated diagnosis and interventional data science by catering to a broad range of diseases, organ
systems, and minimally invasive therapy applications. We will make the developed techniques available to the
biomedical research community and to clinician scientists to promote their clinical translation to impact a
larger patient population. Lastly, this research program will continue to foster opportunities to train and
mentor skilled workforce for biomedical research from diverse backgrounds and education streams.

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection results in 887,000 deaths annually. The central challenge in curing
HBV is eradication of the stable covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) form of the viral genome, which

components of lagging strand synthesis –PCNA, the replication factor C (RFC) complex, DNA polymerase δ

Currently the biomedical workforce does not reflect the general US population, as several groups are
underrepresented, including American Indians, Alaska Natives (AI/AN), and those from rural backgrounds.
Based on the student body in Alaska, in our U-RISE Alaska program we will focus on engaging
underrepresented students by providing meaningful research experiences through the One Health paradigm.
One Health postulates that human, animal, and environmental health are inextricably linked – the health of
each is dependent upon the others. This approach combined with holistic mentoring will support high achieving
students from diverse backgrounds, especially Indigenous and rural students on their paths to doctoral level
biomedical research careers. Building on experiences in our Biomedical Learning and Student Training
(BLaST) program we will collaborate with the UAF Honors College to identify high achieving students,
especially those from underrepresented backgrounds. The One Health approach resonates with students from
rural areas where a subsistence lifestyle is common and links humans closely to the environment through
nutrition, economy, lifestyle, and culture. The One Health approach also aligns with a wider, more holistic,
definition of health prevalent in many Indigenous communities, within and outside Alaska. Holistic advising
beyond research and academics addresses many concerns our students express about family obligations and
other non-academic challenges to adjust to college life. We will also develop these approaches through
building a culturally relevant community that will support students in clearing hurdles that often challenge their
progress throughout their academic careers. Through this approach we will train students in rigorous research
through mentored research experiences, provide summer research experiences at research intensive
institutions through a collaboration with Colorado State University, and provide information and support for
career development in biomedical research careers. This approach will increase competitiveness of our
students and increase the participation of Alaska Native and rural students in the biomedical research
workforce. This outcome will be measurable through increased entrance of our U-RISE Scholars into doctoral
level biomedical research graduate programs. Ten students per year will be recruited as rising sophomores
and supported for three years. They will conduct research under the One Health paradigm which encompasses
a wide field of disciplines from cell biology and molecular biology to landscape level environmental health
issues and epidemiology."
10828816,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Liver disease affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Liver transplantation remains the only treatment
for end stage liver disease (ESLD); however, transplantation faces a major burden due to a shortage of liver
donors. The liver is known for a remarkable regenerative ability through hepatocyte-driven regeneration, the
proliferation of the main functional liver cell type, the hepatocyte. However, in ESLD, hepatocyte proliferation
becomes exhausted. An alternative strategy to treat ESLD would be to promote liver regeneration through biliary
epithelial cell (BEC)-driven regeneration as a novel mechanism that could be exploited as a therapeutic target.
BEC-driven liver regeneration is a process by which BECs proliferate, transition to a liver progenitor cell (LPC)
stage, a process defined as ductular reaction (DR), and differentiate into functional hepatocytes and restore liver
function. BEC-driven regeneration has been experimentally demonstrated in mouse models in which hepatocyte
proliferation was compromised and in our zebrafish models after near complete ablation of hepatocytes.
Observation of DR in virtually all chronic and acute human liver diseases and of budding hepatocytes from BECs
in human cirrhotic livers suggests that BEC-driven repair occurs in human, yet differentiation into hepatocytes is
insufficient to alleviate the liver disease. Our goal is therefore to identify and test a druggable pathway that
triggers BEC-to-hepatocyte conversion for the efficient therapeutic use of BECs to treat liver diseases. We
propose that VEGFA promotes BEC-to-hepatocyte conversion and rescues liver function in complementary
mouse and zebrafish liver injury models. Our preliminary data demonstrate that delivery of VEGFA in injured
mouse livers via the non-integrative and safe nucleoside-modified mRNA complexed with lipid nanoparticles
(mRNA-LNP) induces robust BEC-to-hepatocyte conversion and reversion of steatosis and fibrosis. Moreover,
blocking VEGFR2, the main receptor for VEGFA, or downstream mediators PI3K/AKT abrogates BEC-driven
liver regeneration in zebrafish, suggesting the key contribution of the VEGFR2/PI3K/AKT axis. Previous studies
showed that VEGFA promotes liver repair in rodents by stimulating VEGFR2 on endothelial cells (ECs) that
induce the secretion of hepatocyte mitogens and thus drives hepatocyte-driven repair. However, it has not been
reported that VEGFA directly affects BECs for BEC-driven repair, which is suggested by our preliminary data
showing VEGFR2 induction in a subset of BECs in injured mouse livers, an observation also reported by others
in injured rats. Therefore, our findings combined with studies from others lead us to test 2 hypotheses using the
complementary mouse and zebrafish liver injury models: (Aim 1) VEGFA delivery in vivo triggers BEC-to-
hepatocyte conversion to replenish the lost cell mass and restore liver functions, and that (Aim 2) VEGFA acts
directly on BECs and/or indirectly on ECs that express VEGFR2. This study may have key clinical significance
by establishing a treatment to prevent progression of the liver disease, by exploiting the alternative intrinsic
regenerative ability of the liver via BEC-driven liver regeneration using clinically safe mRNA-LNPs."

In humans, genetic variation is distributed geographically, reflecting the history of human movements across
the continents. Understanding these spatial patterns is crucial for many fields in human population genomics,
including the study of human evolutionary history and linking genotypes and phenotypes. Historically, limi-
tations in the size and scope of empirical datasets have allowed researchers to employ models that ignore
geography, but modern genomic datasets demand population genetic methods that incorporate geographic
space. The proposed research will generate novel statistical methods that incorporate geography into the
study of population genetic structure, admixture, demography, and natural selection. These methods will be
developed and implemented as open-source software, validated using state-of-the-art forward-time simula-
tions, and applied to publicly available human genomic datasets.
We will develop tests for population admixture that explicitly account for geographic patterns due to isolation
by distance. These tests will be used to analyze densely sampled Eurasian human genomic datasets to
identify admixed samples, and will also be applied in sliding windows along the genome to highlight genomic
regions that may have been transferred between populations via adaptive introgression. We will also develop
a spatiotemporal population clustering method that can jointly analyze ancient and modern samples. Neutral
genetic processes are expected to generate population differentiation between samples separated in space or
time, so this clustering method will account for both when determining whether two samples share ancestry in
the same discrete population. This method will be extended to detect selection on polygenic traits by testing for
an aggregate increase in the frequency of alleles involved in a particular trait relative to the neutral expectation.
We will apply this method to test for selection through time on human height across Eurasia. Finally, we will
model the lengths of shared genomic segments between individuals, which are informative about genealogical
overlap at different points in the past, to learn about how population density and dispersal patterns have
changed across geographic space through time.
The proposed work represents advances in a number of fields in statistical population genetics, including the
detection of population admixture, adaptive introgression, population replacement and the joint analysis of
DNA from ancient and modern samples, detecting selection on polygenic traits, and modeling heterogeneity
in demographic processes through time. Taken together, this work will offer empirical researchers a valuable
toolkit for the analysis of modern genomic datasets, which require spatially explicit methods, and will shed light
on both human evolutionary history and the mechanisms by which humans have adapted to their environment
across space and time."

The rapid evolution of influenza virus allows the virus to escape from protective humoral or cellular immune
responses generated. Therefore, the induction of concerted immune responses including both strong B and
T cell immunity against conserved influenza viral epitopes, are believed to be the key to provide broad and
long-lasting immunity. However, the current understanding of the mechanisms and/or pathways that can
simultaneously stimulate robust B and T cell immunity, particularly at the mucosal sites, are largely elusive.
This likely represent a key “bottleneck” for the development of “universal vaccines” that can provide long-
lasting and cross-protective immunity against different strains of influenza virus.
We have recently identified that a population of lung CD4 helper T (TH) cells developed after influenza viral
clearance, co-exhibiting follicular helper (TFH) and tissue-resident memory (TRM) cell features. Based on their
gene expression, migration features and functional properties, we termed these cells as tissue-resident T
helper cells (TRH). Importantly, TRH cells provide local help for the generation of strong germinal center B
(BGC) and resident memory B (BRM) cell responses, as well as a CD8 TRM population that was shown to
mediate protection against heterologous influenza infection. These results raise an intriguing idea that the
promotion of strong TRH responses will augment protective mucosal immunity against both homologous and
heterologous viral re-challenge. We will test the “proof of principle” of this idea following primary influenza
infection and after mucosal immunization of a promising “universal” vaccine candidate (Nanovax). Three
specific aims are proposed. Aim 1: To unravel the mechanisms shaping TRH cell identity and regulome. Aim
2: To identify lung environmental cues modulating TRH cell development and/or maintenance. Aim 3: To
determine the function of TRH cells in the protective immunity against IAV re-challenge.
Our long-term goal is to unravel the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which long-term humoral and
cellular memory responses are properly programmed and/or long-term maintained in the respiratory
mucosal sites. Such studies, we believe, will significantly aid the design of future influenza therapeutics
and/or promising mucosal vaccines that can provide long-lasting protection against broad spectrum
influenza strains (i.e. “universal” vaccines)."

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common cancer in the U.S. and the number one

NSCLC, both in the curative and palliative settings. While advances in tumor imaging and
radiation delivery techniques over the past several decades have significantly improved RT,
advances in genomic and molecular understanding of tumors have largely failed to impact
management of patients treated with RT. Therefore, development of “precision radiation
oncology” approaches, defined as the use of molecular biomarkers to personalize RT, remains a
major unmet need. Additionally, predicting which patients will develop RT-induced toxicity remains
a challenge and prevents early intervention prior to onset of symptoms.

approaches for NSCLC patients treated with RT. Our central hypothesis is that novel biomarkers
of recurrence risk, such as analysis of ctDNA and genetic profiling, can be used for early prediction
of treatment outcomes while a patient is still on therapy. We will test our hypothesis via three
specific aims: (1) To establish the ability of mid-treatment ctDNA changes to predict ultimate
outcomes in locally advanced NSCLC patients treated with RT, (2) To develop novel,
personalized risk models that integrate molecular and clinical factors and can accurately predict
the risk of recurrence, and (3) To test the hypothesis that a novel liquid biopsy approach we have
recently developed can predict which patients will develop symptomatic radiation pneumonitis.
If successful, our project will lead to novel ways to personalize therapy for locally advanced
NSCLC patients treated with RT. Our innovative approach, in which we will employ blood-based
methods for tumor genotyping, disease monitoring, and toxicity prediction that were developed
by our group, will lay the foundation for studies aimed at reducing risk of treatment failure and
toxicity in NSCLC patients treated with RT. We envision that our approach will enable future trial
designs that implement molecularly-driven precision radiation oncology and will facilitate
treatment escalation for patients at highest risk of recurrence and de-escalation for those at lowest
risk. Additionally, our work will serve as proof-of-principle for an approach that could also be
applied to other areas of radiation oncology."
10829882,"Abstract
The overall goal of this proposal is to understand and target cancer cell addictions to stress- tolerance
pathways. We have discovered that cancer cells maintain proliferation by engaging in a pathway known as
translesion synthesis (TLS). By employing TLS, cancer cells are able to replicate in a continuous manner
and subvert the replication stress response. Here, we propose to implement state-of-the-art assays to
analyze how cancer cells alter DNA replication fork dynamics and replisome components to promote TLS.
By defining the core TLS machinery, we will seek to identify biomarkers and novel targets of TLS.
Importantly, we have developed a small molecule inhibitor of TLS that selectively halts DNA replication in
several cancer cell lines that are dependent on TLS. Moreover, we found that the colony forming potential of
TLS-dependent cancer cells is dramatically reduced upon inhibition of TLS. Thus, we propose to identify the
scope of TLS dependent cancers using cell screening and data base analysis. In addition, to fully further
develop the therapeutic potential of TLS inhibition, we propose to measure and improve the anti- cancer
potential of our lead small molecules. Collectively, these proposed studies will identify how cancer cells
engage TLS and how best to block TLS to selectively target cancer."
10829814,"Grape seed procyanidin extract (GSE), and milk thistle silymarin extract (MTE) are widely used health food
supplements to promote cardiovascular (CV) and hepatobiliary health, respectively. Both GSE and MTE
contain high levels of polyphenols that are structurally distinct with strong antioxidant properties, and each
agent has been shown to exert antineoplastic effects against lung cancer. Preliminary data using combinations
of GSE and MTE shows exciting, unequivocal synergistic anticancer effects against lung pre- and cancer cells
in vitro. We therefore hypothesize that oral administration of combinations of leucoselect phytosome (LP), a
standardized GSE, and siliphos, a standardized MTE, both complexed with soy phospholipids into phytosomes
to enhance bioavailability, will synergistically inhibit lung cancer growth, invasion, and induce apoptosis in
various human lung cancer xenograft models, via favorable modulations of mechanisms associated with lung
tumorigenesis/promotion. To test these hypotheses, we will determine their pharmacokinetics (PK) and
pharmacodynamics (PD). We will also determine the utility of biospecimens, such as snap, fresh frozen lung
tissue homogenates, as surrogate model systems to monitor the bioavailability and bioactivity of oral
administration of these agents to the target organ. Furthermore, the mechanistic effects of the combinations
will be assessed systematically with cancer relevant, pathway specific gene expressions and microRNA
(miRNA) real time PCR arrays, and correlated to functional significance. Three specific aims are proposed:
Aim 1: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), PK/PD, and anti-cancer effects of LP with siliphos
in murine models. A dose range finding study will be conducted in nude mice given varying dose combinations
via oral gavage to establish MTD. Blood and lung samples will be obtained to determine PK of GSE, MTE and
metabolites as surrogate markers of bioavailability of GSE and MTE. Aim 1.1. To determine the bioactivity of
oral LP and siliphos using a novel co-culture system of frozen mouse lung homogenates with human lung
neoplastic cells. Bioactivity in the lungs will be assessed by co-culturing lung tissue homogenates from control
(water) vs. drug treated mice with human lung cancer and precancerous cell lines. The effects of varying dose
combinations on proliferation and apoptosis in co-cultured cells will be correlated to GSE, MTE and metabolites
levels. Aim 2: To determine the anti-cancer effects of combinations of LP and siliphos on various types of
human lung cancer xenograft mouse models. Based on MTD findings, varying dose combinations will be given
via oral gavage to mice bearing a variety of human lung tumor xenografts for up to 8 weeks with serial
collections of plasma, lung tissues and tumor xenografts from each treatment group. The anticancer effects
will be determined by tumor growth delay or time to reach maximum tumor volume, as well as proliferation (Ki-
67) and apoptotic (cleaved caspase 3) indices, and correlated to GSE & MTE levels in various biospecimens,
to define physiologically relevant levels in reference to bioactivity. Aim 3: To identify, characterize and correlate
the molecular mechanisms of GSE with MTE against lung cancer. The mechanistic effects will be assessed
and correlated systematically and comprehensively, by comparing the bioactivity pre- or post treatment, in
various sample types, as measured by modulations of: 1) eicosanoid signaling pathways; 2) additional markers
of inflammations and anti-tumor immunity, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-12; 3) mir-19a, -19b and 106b levels; 4)
cancer relevant, pathway specific gene expression profiles; 5) epigenetic profiles assessed by miRNA
expression array, and 6) common biomarkers of cancerization such as PTEN, IGF2R, P53, p27, p21, p16,
FHIT, and BIRC5. IMPACT: Findings from the study will provide important insights into the feasibility and
mechanistic effects of combinations of GSE and MTE against lung cancer, and pave the way for clinical trials
in the near future, with enormous potential in advancing the treatment and prevention of lung cancer."
10834288,"ABSTRACT
The Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) Initiative boldly aims to reduce HIV incidence in high burden areas by 90%
by 2030, yet challenges remain in measuring incidence to identify priority populations and knowing how to best
allocate local resources. To date, HIV molecular surveillance-based interventions have not been linked to a
reduction in HIV incidence. That is (with rare exception), public health efforts directed to individuals associated
with rapidly growing HIV transmission clusters have not been shown to reduce the number of new HIV infections
or the proportion of people virally suppressed in the regions or groups where these services were delivered.
There are no existing resource allocation models that are informed by local molecular and HIV program data to
determine how to best allocate resources relevant to EHE targets. The “Los Angeles County ASsessment of
Phylodynamics to Improve Resource Equity (LAC ASPIRE)” team will use i) advanced phylodynamic
approaches and prospective measures of incidence to identify populations with the highest transmission rates
in Los Angeles County (LAC) and ii) economic modeling to optimize allocation of public health program resources
to achieve EHE and other stakeholder targets. The ASPIRE team is a partnership between investigators at
several academic universities and the LAC Division of HIV and STD Programs (DHSP). Analyses will use coded
and de-identified HIV surveillance data and program data provided by the LAC DHSP. The proposed study will
identify LAC populations with the highest transmission rates and denote as priority populations. We will use
economic modeling to develop strategies that optimize the allocation of prevention resources to i) reduce HIV
incidence, ii) improve HIV-related health outcomes, and iii) improve equity across populations. We will engage
stakeholders—defined as 1) LAC DHSP personnel, 2) those directly or indirectly involved in administering HIV
Programs in LAC, and 3) persons with HIV (PWH) and other key affected populations—to provide guidance on
population and resource prioritization strategies that are both regionally acceptable and most likely to achieve
EHE targets.
The overall study objective is to develop a process to guide decision-making related to allocation of HIV program
resources by public health departments informed by regional program and transmission data. Project specific
aims include: Aim 1 (IDENTIFY). Identify populations that are the highest priority for HIV prevention efforts (these
data will inform the epidemic model used in Aim 2); Aim 2 (ALLOCATE). Develop a user-friendly dynamic
transmission model that will project the impact of alternative strategies for the optimal allocation of resources to
LAC HIV prevention programs (these data will project health outcomes and cost-effectiveness); and Aim 3
(ENGAGE). Engage key stakeholders to develop a process to guide project outcomes and build capacity at the
LAC Health Department for data analysis that incorporates Aim 1 and 2 methods."
10834290,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of this K23 Career Development proposal is to provide me with the essential mentorship and
career development necessary to become an independent investigator with expertise in women’s
cardiovascular health and kidney disease. Ischemic and non-ischemic cardiovascular disease remains the
leading cause of death among patients initiating dialysis, and the burden of cardiovascular events increases
with the progression of kidney disease. The central hypothesis is that among patients with end-stage kidney
disease (ESKD), women as compared to men, have a higher frequency of cardiovascular events and receive
suboptimal revascularization treatment strategies, which results in higher cardiovascular mortality. The goals
for the proposed study are to examine the sex differences in ischemic and non-ischemic cardiovascular events,
coronary revascularization strategies, and clinical outcomes in dialysis patients. I will develop a decision model
to determine the optimal coronary revascularization strategy for dialysis patients with coronary artery disease
and perform a focus group study to explore patients’ attitudes and barriers to coronary revascularization. My
preliminary data show a higher frequency of cardiovascular events in women versus men among the ESKD
population. The proposed cohort study leverages the infrastructure of the largest prospectively maintained
cohort of dialysis patients in the United States, with over 6 million enrollees. My study is significant because it
will fill the current knowledge gap in the interplay between sex, kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease in
patients undergoing dialysis. The proposal is innovative since it will be the first study to examine differences in
women as compared to men in cardiovascular events and revascularization strategies among dialysis patients.
I will develop a novel sex-specific decision tool to determine the optimal revascularization strategy in patients
with ESKD. This study aims to improve our knowledge so that clinicians can better counsel their patients and
modify their risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. New knowledge from this proposal will lead to future
studies with targeted interventions directed at reducing health disparities in patients with kidney disease to
improve cardiovascular care, especially in women. I anticipate that my findings will lead to new policy decisions
and actionable initiatives to reduce health disparities and foster more sex-inclusive cardiovascular health
planning. I propose a career development plan that combines advanced biostatistical coursework, and didactic
training in translational research methods and health equity related to understanding sex differences in
cardiovascular health among patients with ESKD. I will receive mentorship by a team of expert investigators
from disciplines in clinical epidemiology, mixed-methods research, and decision analysis research. Through
the K23 Career Development Award Program, I will generate data, and enhance knowledge and skills in
patient-oriented clinical research to submit an R01 application, and then transition to become an independent
investigator."
10934584,"SUMMARY – RESEARCH CAPACITY BUILDING CORE
The Research Capacity Building Core (RCBC) is an integral component of the Drexel Center on Climate
Change and Urban Health and will support its central theme: “the creation and dissemination/translation of
evidence that will support urban policies to address the health and equity impacts of climate change in cities.”
In support of this theme, the overarching objective of the RCBC is to increase capacity to conduct policy-
relevant research on the health and equity impacts of climate change in cities, among researchers with
extensive expertise in urban health research. The RCBC is designed to increase such research capacity by
building on existing strengths at the Drexel Urban Health Collaborative and our partner sites, including: (a)
extensive experience in urban health, inter- and intra-urban health inequities, racial/ethnic disparities
inequities, social determinants of health and environmental health broadly defined; (b) demonstrated
engagement in transdisciplinary research; (c) capacity to translate research findings to policy audiences; and
(d) a long history of cultivating a diverse research workforce. Capacity strengthening activities will include
structured workshops, webinars, journal clubs, and working groups. The RCBC will also conduct
transdisciplinary research that combines methods used in climate-and-health science with methods used in
urban health research, and catalog and support the use of research methods (both study designs and
analytical approaches) available to urban health researchers that can be used to address novel questions
about the impact of climate change on urban health and health equity. In addition, it will collaborate with the
Administrative Core and Community Engagement Core to solicit, award and support pilot projects. The RCBC
will provide integrated biostatistics and study design support for the use of pilot study findings as preliminary
data in new grants and will provide methodological support for grants development more generally. The
Specific Aims of the RCBC are: (1) To increase urban health researchers’ capacity to conduct transdisciplinary
research on climate change and urban health by strengthening content area knowledge on climate change,
strengthening and leveraging their research design and analytical skills; and expand their skills to engage in
transdisciplinary research and integrate policy needs into the development of solutions-oriented research
questions about climate change. (2) To develop, translate and support the use of research methods and
designs to examine inter- and intra-urban variation in health impacts of climate change; and (3) To strengthen
systems and structures to develop new transdisciplinary projects on the impacts of climate change on health
by awarding and supporting pilot/feasibility studies that engage multiple disciplines, and supporting
methodological aspects of new grant development. Ultimately, the RCBC will strengthen capacity to conduct
impactful, policy-relevant transdisciplinary research on climate change and health and health equity in cities."
10934585,"PROJECT SUMMARY: COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CORE (CEC)
The Drexel Climate Change and Urban Health Research Center (Drexel CCUH) seeks to build institutional
capacity at Drexel University and at our partner sites to support action-oriented research on the impacts of
climate change on population health and health inequities in cities across the Americas. The Center seeks to
design and implement research and evidence translation to support the urban policies needed to address the
health and equity impacts of climate change in cities. The guiding principle of the Drexel CCUH Community
Engagement Core (CEC) is that local communities, organizations, and policymakers in urban areas worldwide
play a key role in protecting and promoting health, health equity, and sustainability in the context of climate
change. Within the context of ever-increasing data volume, these actors need access to specific, actionable
evidence and the capacity to apply this evidence to urban adaptation and mitigation planning. The Drexel
CCUH-CEC will lay the foundation for engagement across a network of community and policy actors who will
inform timely and relevant research, engagement, and dissemination strategies that effectively respond to local
needs. The Drexel CCUH-CEC will leverage existing strengths at Drexel University and partner institutions in
urban health, health equity, policy-translation and community-engaged research, including an extensive
research network in Latin America and US cities, and external institutional partnerships. The CEC will be led
by Dr. Mariana Lazo (Drexel University) and supported by co-lead Dr. Monica Mazariegos (Institute for
Nutrition in Central America and Panama [INCAP] in Guatemala), as well as additional faculty and policy- and
community-engagement specialists. The CEC will work closely with the other center cores and research
project leadership, and with the Community and Policy Advisory Board. The Core-specific aims include: Aim 1:
To ensure our research and engagement activities are guided by local needs and priorities, Aim 2: To create
opportunities for transdisciplinary and multi-sector exchange and capacity building Aim 3: To develop,
implement, and define dissemination strategies and best practices for reaching various audiences, driving
advocacy, and supporting policymaking. Aim 4: To evaluate the impact of our activities on agenda-setting, and
outline plans for future engagement. Our multi-country team has an established track record of projects,
partnerships, and engagement activities that will enable us to scale-up these efforts quickly and achieve our
objectives within the three-year timeline. Importantly the CEC will support foundational work needed to ensure
that meaningful community and policy engagement are core and integral elements to the future development of
the Drexel CCUH in ways that support solutions-oriented evidence generation and actions."
10834957,"The motor dysfunction resulting from spinal cord injury (SCI) is precipitated by the neural insult and is
exacerbated by other factors that hinder motoneuron survival and muscle recovery, including disuse and low
testosterone (T). The success of bodyweight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT) diminishes as the SCI
severity worsens. We have developed a novel strategy involving BWSTT with adjuvant T-enanthate (TE) drug
treatment that promotes use-dependent neuroplasticity, in-part, by preserving white matter at the spinal lesion
and by supporting motoneuron survival, which stimulates neuromuscular recovery. However, the
supraphysiologic TE dose we used produced prostate enlargement in our rodent severe contusion SCI model,
which limits translation. The purpose of this proposal is to improve the translational applicability of BWSTT+TE
by identifying the lowest TE dose that enhances BWSTT-mediated neuromotor improvement, in an effort to
limit prostate growth and other androgenic side-effects. Secondly, we will determine the influence of estradiol
(E2) on BWSTT-mediated locomotor recovery and neuromuscular plasticity. The latter remains important from
translational and mechanistic perspectives because (1) T is converted to E2, via aromatase, within the central
nervous system and (2) E2 treatment produces potent neuroprotection in rats after SCI. To provide
comprehensive evidence of neuroplasticity, we will evaluate functional adaptations in our rodent SCI model in
response to the proposed treatments and assess anatomical changes that occur at the spinal cord lesion and
distal to the lesion, and in spinal motoneurons and muscle. To support this proposal, we have established a
male rodent severe mid-thoracic contusion SCI model that exhibits persistent hindlimb paralysis and
progressive muscle decline and 50% lower circulating T than non-SCI animals, similar to the T deficiency
present in nearly all men after SCI. Our data indicate that BWSTT+TE restored hindlimb overground walking
after severe SCI more so than BWSTT (alone) or TE (alone). Moreover, BWSTT+TE improved recovery of
muscle fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA), muscle force output, and prevented the deleterious slow (oxidative)
to fast (glycolytic) fiber-type transition in muscle. In Aim 1, we will perform a dose-optimization experiment to
identify the lowest effective TE dose and we will build upon our original data by comprehensively evaluating
locomotor recovery and neuromuscular plasticity in response to BWSTT+TE. The primary outcomes are open-
field locomotor recovery, soleus muscle function, soleus fCSA and fiber type distribution. In Experiment 1a,
SCI animals will remain untreated (vehicle) or will receive BWSTT with low, moderate, or high-dose TE, with
the lowest effective dose advancing. In Experiment 1b, SCI animals will receive vehicle, BWSTT, TE, or
BWSTT+TE. Aim 2 will then determine the influence of estradiol (E2) on BWSTT-mediated locomotor recovery
and neuromuscular plasticity. In Experiment 2a, SCI rats will receive vehicle, BWSTT, BWSTT+AN (aromatase
inhibitor that blocks conversion of T to E2), BWSTT+TE, or BWSTT+TE+AN. Experiment 2b will be a dose-
optimization study to identify the lowest E2 dose that enhances BWSTT-mediated neuromotor improvement.
SCI animals will receive vehicle or BWSTT with low-, moderate-, or high-dose E2. Experiment 2c will be a
comparative efficacy study in which SCI animals will receive vehicle, BWSTT or E2 (alone and in combination),
or BWSTT+TE. We hypothesize that the functional and anatomical measures of neuromuscular plasticity will
be most evident in SCI animals receiving BWSTT+TE, that E2 partially mediates neuromuscular plasticity
resulting from BWSTT+TE, and that more robust neuromotor improvement will occur in response to
BWSTT+TE versus BSWTT+E2. We anticipate that these experiments will provide the necessary data to
establish preclinical proof-of-principle for our multimodal therapy. If successful, this will set the stage for
translation of our preclinical findings to future clinical trials intended to hasten locomotor recovery and improve
neuromuscular function in Veterans with SCI."
10834970,"Diversifying neuroscience through predoctoral training at an HBCU
 Delaware State University (DSU), a Historically-Black university with an emerging strength in
neuroscience research proposes a G-RISE program focused on predoctoral training in neuroscience. Our
interdisciplinary program will support a diverse group of students in our Neuroscience PhD program. Our
young PhD program has produced 10 graduates, six from underrepresented groups and half of them
African-American. With our G-RISE project we will build on our record of graduating diverse
neuroscience doctorates, while addressing weaknesses identified by our program self-assessment – a small
pool of qualified applicants and a low rate of publications among program students.
 Our G-RISE support program will link students in Neuroscience PhD program into a supportive,
research-rich community that will provide extensive professional and skills development including: 1) A
two-semester, 3-credit Professional Development course with a focus on responsible conduct of research,
ensuring rigor in research, diverse career pathways, and writing both NSF and NIH fellowship grant
proposals; 2) A weekly RISE seminar that will build cohort cohesiveness and strengthen students’
professional skills and their understanding of how to do rigorous science; 3) Quantitative skills and
Scientific Writing courses to provide more support to students in two areas where they are challenged; and
3) a formal program induction/orientation and enhanced mentoring by culturally-competent mentors. The
professional development course grant writing and extensive mentoring will help the students to develop
their identities as professional scientist, while the scientific writing course will provide the support to get
them published. Grounded in the literature, these strategies will both provide the G-RISE students with
strong academic support, and all of the project components are sustainable and transferrable to other schools
and programs. The Evaluation Plan includes focus groups for summative assessment and validated, baseline
and follow-up surveys to assess the development of participants' self-efficacy (research and academic) and
identities as scientists and researchers.
 The number of PhD graduates in neuroscience has grown rapidly since the beginning of the century,
and currently over 700 neuroscience doctorates are awarded annually, but only about 20 each year awarded
to African-Americans. Currently, DSU is the only HBCU that awards the PhD in neuroscience, so
supporting and strengthening its program to produce 3 – 4 neuroscience PhD graduates each year will have
a significant impact on the diversity of the doctoral workforce."
10835102,"ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY
Mutations in actin associated motor protein nonmuscle myosin II isoform A (NM2A), encoded by MYH9, have
been associated with kidney disease in at least one-third of the patients. Previous work focused on the role of
Myh9 in podocyte actin cytoskeleton. Our recent work has established a critical role for Myh9 and Myh10 genes
in the adult mouse renal epithelium. Inducible, conditional knockout (cKO) of Myh9&10 in adult mouse renal
epithelial cells resulted in progressive tubular disease with transport defects in the thick ascending limb (TAL).
Loss of Myh9&10 proteins resulted in deregulated transport of GPI-anchored protein uromodulin (UMOD), along
with upregulation of ER stress and unfolded protein response pathways, promoting tubular injury and disease in
Myh9&10 cKO mice. In addition, Na+ K+ 2Cl- cotransporter (NKCC2) does not localize to the apical membrane
and we observe a progressive decline in NKCC2 protein levels in Myh9&10 cKO mouse kidneys. Single paralog
renal tubule specific Myh9-PT cKO mice also develop moderate tubular kidney disease, but podocyte-specific
Myh9-cKO in mice does not lead to kidney disease. Here, we propose to determine the cell type specific roles
for Myh9 in TAL epithelium and podocytes and their contribution to kidney disease. We have generated novel,
immortalized TAL cell culture system to enable long-term in vitro cargo transport studies. We will utilize the single
paralog Myh9 and Myh10 pan-renal tubular (PT) cKO, TAL-specific cKO and podocyte-specific Myh9-cKO
mouse models to enable dissection of the mechanistic and physiological roles for NM2 in two different kidney
cell types. Effects of high salt diet and sex-dependent variations on disease pathology will be tested. A mouse
model harboring Myh9-cKO in both podocytes and TAL epithelium will be characterized to determine the
synergistic pathological effect, that will better model a severe form of MYH9-RD with complete loss of function.
Our proposed work will uncover the critical roles for NM2 motor proteins in specialized cargo transport and will
identify novel mechanisms involved in MYH9 mutation associated kidney diseases and other TAL-associated
kidney disorders."
10835104,"Summary
(Pro)renin receptor (PRR), a new member of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), has emerged as a key regulator
of renal handling of Na+ and water, and blood pressure (BP). Renal action of PRR is at least in part mediated
through its ability to activate tissue prorenin and renin. In preliminary studies, investigation of a “non-specific”
protein band recognized by a custom-made anti-PRR antibody has led to identification of a novel 24-kDa isoform
of PRR, termed as PRR24. PRR24 was encoded by a novel cDNA with part of 5’UTR arising from retention of
intron 3 and an ATG in exon 5 as an alternative start codon so that this isoform overlaps completely with PRR
except that N-terminal 136 amino acids are missing. PRR24 expression was predominantly detected in the renal
medulla. PRR24 selectively bound and activated renin but not prorenin whereas PRR non-selectively interacted
both prorenin and renin. In cultured collecting duct (CD) cells, PRR24 translocated from the cytosol to the nucleus
in a cAMP/PKA-dependent manner following vasopressin (AVP) treatment. The trafficking event also occurred
in mouse renal medulla following water deprivation. PRR24 was not only required but also sufficient for
induction of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) transcription induced by AVP. Furthermore, ablation of PRR24 by mutagenesis
of its start codon in mice (termed PRR24mut) induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) associated with
volume contraction and hypotension as well as reduced renal medullary renin activity. Therefore, we hypothesize
that PRR24 serves as a specific renin receptor critically involved in AVP-induced signaling pathway to control
AQP2 transcription and thus urine concentrating capability and plasma volume (Fig. 1). To test this hypothesis,
we will conduct a full panel of phenotypical analysis of PRR24mut mice during perturbation of water balance. In
addition, we will define the transcriptional activity of PRR24 in regulation of AQP2 expression through analysis
of the threonine/threonine sites of PKA-dependent phosphorylation of PRR24 and fine mapping of PRR24-
responsive elements in AQP2 promoter during AVP treatment. Overall, this proposal is expected to offer novel
insight into the function of a newly described PRR24 in the kidney."
10835106,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT 
Hepatic steatosis, defined by >5% hepatocyte triglyceride content, may be potentiated in people with HIV
(PWH) through viral-mediated mechanisms or metabolic dysfunction associated with antiretroviral therapy
(ART). However, the epidemiology of hepatic steatosis remains unclear among PWH, primarily because
studies have been limited to small patient samples that ascertained steatosis via specialized radiographic
methods or liver biopsy. Since liver disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among PWH, it is
critically important to identify the determinants and consequences of hepatic steatosis in this group. Such
studies will inform interventions and management strategies to mitigate HIV-specific steatosis mechanisms and
its consequences, particularly hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Recent advances in artificial intelligence have facilitated the development of automated computer-aided liver
assessment to determine the presence and severity of hepatic steatosis within noncontrast abdominal
computed tomography (CT) scans. The Automatic Liver Attenuation Region-Of-Interest-based Measurement
(ALARM) is a deep learning tool previously developed for the identification of moderate-to-severe hepatic
steatosis. Preliminary studies conducted by the applicant demonstrate the high accuracy of ALARM compared
to manual radiologist review across multiple centers and CT scanners, including within the Veterans Health
Administration. To address the knowledge gaps of existing studies, this proposal will first establish a cohort of
over 40,000 PWH and people without HIV (PWOH) in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) who
underwent noncontrast abdominal CT imaging for any indication in the context of clinical care between 2002-
2020. The VACS, an ongoing national prospective cohort study of PWH and PWOH across the United States,
includes access to electronic health record data, including image files of CT scans. The ALARM tool will be
applied to this repository of radiographic images to objectively classify the presence or absence of moderate-to-
severe hepatic steatosis. The research plan aims to: 1) identify the HIV-specific determinants associated
with hepatic steatosis among PWH, 2) define how traditional determinants of steatosis differ by HIV status, and
3) determine the risk of liver complications associated with steatosis in PWH and how this risk differs by HIV
status. The findings from these studies will inform interventions to prevent and mitigate the development of
hepatic steatosis among persons with HIV, which will help lower the risk of liver complications and prolong
survival in this population. This project will bring together a mentoring team of nationally recognized
researchers and provide time for coursework and training in advanced epidemiology, biostatistics, informatics,
artificial intelligence, hepatology, and HIV medicine that are needed to establish the applicant as an
independent investigator in the field of HIV-related liver diseases."
10836393,"Abstract
The epidermis forms an essential barrier to the outside world. To accomplish this, it contains
proliferative stem cells that replenish the tissue, giving rise to differentiated cells that form a
functional barrier. We have found that the differentiated cells of the epidermis play an important
role in regulating the behavior of their parental stem cells, making them not only descents of the
stem cells but part of their regulatory niche. Moreover, the mechanical status of differentiated
cells, namely their contractility, is a strong input into multiple aspects of epidermal stem cell
behavior, including proliferation, migration, and cell fate decisions. Here we seek to define the
pathways, both mechanical and chemical, by which differentiated epidermal cells control both
stem cell behavior and skin physiology. Defining the niche components and the mechanisms by
which they influence epidermal stem cell behavior is essential to allow manipulation of stem cells
for regenerative therapies and/or treatment of diseases that result from stem cell dysregulation."
10836542,"Project Summary/Abstract
In order to control specific behavioral responses, transcriptionally distinct cell types assembled
into dynamic brain circuits integrate environmental information with internal states and generate
purposeful motor actions. While tools have been developed to independently measure the activity
dynamics, connectivity and transcriptional profiles of individual neurons, it remains challenging to
integrate this diverse information into a coherent model of behavior. To address this challenge,
we aim to uncover the sensorimotor transformations leading to a complex naturalistic behavior,
male and female parenting, by developing innovative molecular, imaging and systems-level
approaches and by integrating multimodal information obtained from single neurons in behaving
animals. In aim 1, we will develop new tools to uncover the activity and the transcriptional identity
of neuronal cell types involved in infant-mediated behavior. In aim 2, we will explore in molecular,
functional, and behavioral terms how olfactory and other sensory modalities underlie parenting
behavior in males and females and in virgin versus mated states. In aim 3, we will investigate how
specific hypothalamic cell types process information reflecting behavioral outcomes using a
combination of spatial transcriptomic, functional imaging, circuit tracing and behavioral methods.
In aim 4, we will combine cell-type based neuronal architecture with activity patterns across key
brain regions to formulate predictive models underlying the neural control of parenting."

Opioid use can induce aspiration, which greatly increases the risk of pneumonia. Mortality rates of aspiration
pneumonia can approach 40%. The larynx plays a pivotal role in protection of the airways by preventing
ingested materials from entering the trachea. This organ participates in different airway protective behaviors,
but the initial protective response to intrusion of material is the laryngeal adductor reflex (LAR). The LAR
consists of rapid adduction of the vocal folds following stimulation of laryngeal sensory afferents. No
information exists on the sensitivity of central pathways responsible for the LAR and their contribution to
maladaptive laryngeal responses to opioids. Based on preliminary data and model simulations, we have
developed the following hypothesis: opioid-sensitive circuits in the nucleus of the solitary tract and
nearby reticular formation (NTS/RF) include a network of neurons with tonic expiratory (t-E) and non-
breathing modulated (NBM) activity patterns that regulate reflexive laryngeal adduction through their
functional interactions with cells in the ventrolateral respiratory network (VL). This project has two
Specific Aims: 1) Identify the network between NTS/RF and VL neurons that regulates the LAR. 2) Determine
the central effects of opioids on ipsilateral and crossed pathways in the NTS/RF that regulate coordination of
motor drive, mechanics, and vocal fold movements during LAR. We anticipate this project will lead to: a)
identification of critical elements of the central reflex pathway for the LAR that are sensitive to opioids, b)
identification of the functional relationships for the production and regulation of the LAR: those within NTS
inter-neuronal networks, and those between t-E, NBM, NTS/RF, and VL neurons, and c) a new clinically-useful
neuromechanical model of vocal fold coordination that will enable prediction of the effects of depressant drugs
on the airway protective actions of the larynx. This model will feature functionalities not currently available to
clinicians, such as estimation of the impact of unilateral vocal fold hypotonia on laryngeal function. This new
knowledge will provide a critical step in understanding the neurogenesis and neuropharmacology of the LAR
and how opioids compromise airway protection."
10839408,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Tissue and Neurobehavioral Phenotyping Core, designated as Core C, is a centralized facility that will
provide investigators with a well-established and reproducible model of influenza A–induced pneumonia.
Quantitative tools such as Flexivent measurements of lung mechanics, magnetic resonance imaging to
evaluate lung repair and remodeling, and multiplex measures of pro-inflammatory cytokines will be conducted
by Core C according to the research plan outlined in Projects 1, 2, and 3. Core C will use advanced flow
cytometry capabilities to quantify, phenotype, and sort specific inflammatory and parenchymal cell populations
from the murine lung, brain, and muscle. The sorting and isolation capabilities of the Core will allow cell-type-
specific assessment of proteostasis networks via mass spectroscopy (as outlined by Core B). Core C will
breed mice to generate the cell-type- or tissue-specific Cre recombinase lines to induce tissue-specific
knockout mice. Core C will perform the genotyping of all the murine strains proposed by Project Leaders. Core
C will maintain a uniform environment in which wild-type and genetically engineered mice will be aged.
Importantly, Core C will assess the impact of influenza A–induced pneumonia on age-related changes in
neurobehavioral phenotypes. Briefly, Core C will examine motor coordination and balance by means of an
accelerating rotarod test. Response latency on a hot plate will be tested to assess nociceptive functions.
Exploratory behaviors and locomotor activity will be examined in an open field assay and by continuous
monitoring with running wheels. Learning and memory will be examined in novel object recognition and Barnes
maze tests. Collectively, these tools provide a unique resource for Project Investigators, which would be
difficult to reproduce without the support of this PPG."
10839410,"Abstract
One of the most important clinical manifestations of age-related immune dysfunction is an enhanced
susceptibility to and mortality from pneumonia, the most common cause of death from an infectious disease
worldwide. In the year after hospital discharge older pneumonia survivors have an increased risk of developing
age-related disorders including persistent lung injury, skeletal muscle dysfunction leading to immobility,
myocardial infarction, chronic kidney disease, dementia and cognitive impairment. As such, pneumonia is a
gateway for the compounding morbidity that limits healthspan at the end of life. Alveolar macrophages are the
most abundant resident immune population in the alveolar space, where they serve as sentinel and effector cells
that respond to inhaled particles, toxins and pathogens in the ambient air. We used a combination of causal
genetic experiments targeting macrophages and unbiased transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of flow-sorted
cell populations from the lungs of influenza A infected mice to suggest that the reparative function of alveolar
macrophages is reduced during aging. These findings converge with the concept of mitochondrial hormesis that
emerged from Dr. Morimoto and Dr. Chandel's work (Project 2). They found that low level inhibition of
mitochondrial electron transport in C. elegans induced a proteostasis-protective response that enhanced the
resilience of aging animals, while more dramatic inhibition of electron transport was toxic. In mice, we found
that metformin inhibits mitochondrial electron transport at complex I in alveolar macrophages to induce the
expression of proteostasis protective genes in response to environmental stress. Mitochondrial electron
transport is linked with proteostasis through the integrated stress response and activation of the transcription
factor ATF4. Consistently, we found a small molecule inhibitor of the integrated stress response, ISRIB,
accelerated lung repair after influenza A infection in aged mice. These data support our hypothesis that age-
related impairments in the reparative function of alveolar macrophages can be reversed by transient low level
inhibition of electron transport with complex I inhibitors via the ISR and ATF4, while smoldering activation of
these pathways during aging precludes normal repair. We will test this hypothesis in three interrelated Specific
Aims:
Aim 1. To determine whether deficiency of the scavenger receptor Mertk in aged alveolar macrophages
impairs lung repair after influenza A-induced injury.
Aim 2. To determine whether metformin can restore the reparative function of alveolar macrophages via
inhibition of complex I of mitochondrial electron transport during aging.
Aim 3. To determine whether mitochondrial activation of proteostasis through eIF2?-mediated
translational inhibition and/or ATF4 improves lung repair after injury during aging."
10839411,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Individuals aged 65 years or older account for 80-90% of deaths from influenza A virus each year. The
overarching goal of this project is to systematically test the hypothesis that modulating mitochondrial function
can alter lung repair after influenza A infection. In the first cycle, we generated data in the C. elegans model to
suggest that the mild reduction in mitochondrial electron transport capacity during aging promotes proteostasis.
To test this hypothesis in a mammalian system, we began to age Ndufs2 heterozygous (Ndufs2+/-) mice. Ndufs2
is a catalytic subunit of complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Ndufs2 heterozygous mice have
a 50% reduction in maximal mitochondrial complex I capacity, but appear normal up to one year of age. In
contrast, our preliminary data indicate that complete loss of Ndufs2 in alveolar epithelial cells causes the death
of mice at a young age. Interestingly, loss of an accessory subunit of mitochondrial complex I, Ndufs4, which
results in ~80% loss of mitochondrial complex I function (hypomorph), does not cause lung pathology at baseline.
This has led us to hypothesize that mild reductions in mitochondrial complex I function will improve recovery
after influenza A infection, while more severe reductions will induce high levels of ATF4 that will impair lung
repair. Our preliminary data also indicate that regulatory T cells (Tregs) are essential for alveolar epithelial cell
repair after influenza A virus infection. Tregs from aged mice have increased DNA hypermethylation and are
unable to repair influenza A virus-induced lung injury. Thus, we will determine whether partial or complete loss
of mitochondrial complex I function in Tregs prevents lung repair after influenza A virus infection. Collectively
these hypotheses will be tested in three interrelated Specific Aims: (1) Does a decline in maximal mitochondrial
complex I function (Ndufs2+/- mice) over a lifespan improve recovery from influenza A-induced pneumonia during
aging? (2) Is ATF4 activation required for the increase in influenza A-induced lung injury induced by the complete
loss or hypomorph of mitochondrial complex I function in alveolar epithelial cells? (3) Is the complete loss or
hypomorph of mitochondrial complex I function in regulatory T cells (Tregs) sufficient to dampen their ability to
promote tissue repair after lung injury?"
10840973,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Dolutegravir (DTG)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended by the World Health Organization for
all people living with HIV, including pregnant women. Surveillance data from Botswana reported a 3-fold
increased incidence of neural tube defects (NTDs) in women taking DTG from conception. Other studies have
not detected this association although none were sufficiently powered. Concern over the clinical significance of
the association between DTG and NTDs has created uncertainty in the treatment of women with HIV globally.
Data from animal DTG fetotoxicity studies in our lab support the Botswana findings and suggest that DTG at a
dose yielding clinically relevant plasma levels (1x-DTG) is associated with a modest but significantly increased
risk of a variety of congenital defects including NTDs. Unexpectedly, we observe fewer fetal anomalies (similar
to control) in mice treated with a 5x-DTG dose. Maternal folate deficiency, pre-gestational diabetes, and pre-
pregnancy obesity are established NTD risk factors. Excessive weight gain is reported in persons initiating or
switching to DTG. Excess weight gain and the underlying metabolic alterations could be a mechanism by which
DTG increases NTD rates. We will use well-controlled animal studies and clinical samples from Botswana to
perform an unbiased omics approach to identify potential pathways through which DTG may induce fetal
defects. In addition, we will take a targeted approach, involving murine in vivo and embryo culture models, to
investigate the impact of DTG on folate, glucose, and oxidative stress as potential pathways leading to DTG-
associated fetal defects. In Aim 1 we will identify and validate maternal and fetal metabolic factors modified by
DTG exposure that increase or reduce the risk for NTDs and other fetal anomalies by: (1) performing a
metabolomics screen of pregnant mice and their fetuses treated with DTG-based ART (1x-DTG and 5x-DTG) or
control for indicators of fetal anomaly risk or protection; (2) screening for metabolic differences in pregnant
women with HIV on DTG-based ART from conception, compared with those on efavirenz-based ART from
conception, and with HIV-negative pregnant women; (3) validating candidate metabolites using murine in vivo
and embryo culture systems. In Aim 2 we will perform experimental studies to determine the mechanism(s) by
which DTG increased the risk of fetal anomalies. We will examine the impact of DTG on: (1) folate metabolism;
(2) glucose homeostasis; (3) oxidative stress and mitochondrial function, using murine in vivo and embryo
culture systems. We will leverage resources of an existing prospective pregnancy study in Botswana
(NIH/NICHD K23 HD088230-01A1 – PI: Dr. Zash), and take advantage of Dr. Serghides' robust mouse
pregnancy model of ART safety, Drs. Copp and Greene's renowned expertise in models of NTDs, and the omics
expertise of Metabolon, Dr. Jao, and Dr. Coburn to successfully complete this project. Our study will be the
first to examine associations between DTG and metabolic alterations as a mechanism underlying DTG-
associated congenital defects."

 (WV PRAMS)
Abstract
West Virginia PRAMS is a joint research project between the West Virginia Office of Maternal,
Child and Family Health (WV OMCFH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC). The project is an on-going, population-based surveillance system designed to identify
maternal attitudes and experiences before, during and after pregnancy. Research indicates that
maternal behaviors during pregnancy influence infant birthweight, gestation and mortality rates.
PRAMS was developed in 1987 by the CDC because (1) infant mortality rates were not declining
as rapidly as they had in previous years, (2) the prevalence of low birthweight was showing little
change and (3) maternal behaviors such as alcohol and tobacco use and limited use of prenatal care
were contributing to the slow rate of decline in both infant mortality rates and low birthweight
prevalence. Seeing a need to supplement vital records data in order to help establish and maintain
an epidemiologic surveillance system of selected maternal behaviors and experiences, West
Virginia was one of the first states to participate in the project. PRAMS provides data not available
from other sources relating to pregnancy and the first few months after birth. The goal of WV
PRAMS is to identify maternal risk behaviors that may affect both maternal and infant health.
Findings from WV PRAMS are used to enhance the understanding of maternal behaviors and their
relationship with adverse pregnancy outcomes. WV OMCFH uses PRAMS surveillance data for
program planning and evaluation and influencing public health practice and policy for maternal
and child health programs."
10842285,"Modified Project Summary/Abstract 
The primary goal of this project is to validate a novel therapeutic lead targeting the ROBO/SLIT signaling pathway in pre-clinical animal models and human kidney biopsy samples of proteinuric kidney disease. ROBO (including ROBO1/2) are receptors for SLIT ligands (including SLIT2/3). ROBO/SLIT pathway has been shown to play an essential role during early kidney development. Mutations in either ROBO1, ROBO2, or SLIT2 cause congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in humans and mice. We also discovered a novel, unexpected function of the ROBO/SLIT pathway in mature kidney podocytes, which acts as a negative regulator on nephrin to inhibit nephrin-induced actin polymerization and destabilizes podocyte adhesion and attachment to the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) by inhibiting nonmuscle myosin IIA (NM-IIA) activity. In addition, we found that inhibiting the ROBO/SLIT pathway genetically in animal models of podocyte injury and podocytopathies reduced albuminuria by enhanced podocyte adhesion, which maintained the podocyte foot process, slit-diaphragm ultrastructure, and the podocyte buttress force. These data suggest that the ROBO/SLIT pathway is a novel drug target for podocyte injury and podocyte protection. Blocking the ROBO/SLIT pathway may lead to potentially novel therapies for patients with podocyte injury and albuminuria. Indeed, in collaboration with Pfizer, we generated several novel therapeutic leads inhibiting the ROBO/SLIT pathway. One of the novel therapeutic leads, PF-06730512, significantly reduced albuminuria in pre-clinical proteinuric animal models. This PF-06730512 is currently in a phase 2 clinical trial for patients with FSGS. The latest interim analysis of this phase 2 trial showed a significant proteinuria reduction in steroid/treatment-resistant FSGS patients after 12 weeks of PF-06730512 treatment. In this special NIDDK early-stage preclinical therapeutic leads validation project, we plan to test the efficacy and safety of one additional novel therapeutic lead inhibiting ROBO1 and ROBO2 receptors that we generated in collaboration with Pfizer in pre-clinical animal models of proteinuric kidney disease and CAKUT (Aim 1 and Aim 2). In addition, we plan to validate ROBO/SLIT pathway gene/protein expressions in kidney biopsy samples that have been collected from patients with proteinuric kidney disease (Aim 3). This project will support the indication expansion of the ROBO/SLIT inhibitors with different mechanisms of action to further increase the overall likelihood of a successful drug development project targeting the ROBO/SLIT pathway for proteinuric kidney disease."

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental psychiatric condition that
substantially impairs educational and work performance. However, the current studies seeking to evaluate
the clinical and biological relationships between ADHD and educational attainment (EA) were conducted
in European samples from high-income countries. The lack of diversity in these studies halts the possibility
of generalization for different individuals and contexts. Therefore, there is a demand within the science
community to better investigate mental disorders in heterogeneous societies and impacted minorities. In
this sense, countries with high social inequalities, such as Brazil, present a ""potential context"" for assessing
the impact of social and ethnic disparity-related factors (exposome) on mental health and its relationship
with EA and success at work. The general aim of this proposal is to investigate the biological (polygenic)
links between ADHD, EA, and EA-related outcomes (grade failure, college completion, and functional
illiteracy) in adult individuals from contrasting Brazilian social contexts. To achieve this, we propose a
cross-sectional study that will combine genome-wide and epigenome-wide data in a large sample (n =
5,000) of individuals from two Brazilian regions, São Paulo and Porto Alegre. Cutting-edge bioinformatic
and statistical approaches will be applied to integrate the collected data and a) evaluate if the European
derived polygenic scores for ADHD and EA predict the targeted phenotypes and replicate their biological
relationship in the Brazilian population; b) test if their effects are modulated by contrasting exposomes and
the continuous degree of admixture seen in the Brazilian population; and c) explore if epigenetic markers
play a role in the links between ADHD and EA in this diverse population. This study intends to reveal
potential pathophysiological mechanisms involved in high social impacting phenotypes (ADHD and EA).
The Eurocentric bias observed in genomic, epigenomic, and exposomic studies might be highly detrimental,
as it prevents specific populations of low- or middle-income countries from the benefits of future advances
in genomics. The literature has reinforced the need to study heterogeneous populations, such as Latin
America's, and establish multiethnic biobanks or biorepositories containing individuals from different
environmental backgrounds. Therefore, the present study fits into a highly relevant scientific scenario, and
the raised questions are of worldwide interest."
10842415,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are an essential component of the innate immune system responsible for
detecting invading pathogens and activating appropriate immunological responses. A significant proportion of
PRRs are specialized in detecting viral DNA or RNA. Since DNA and RNA are the basic building blocks of life
across all species, an intriguing and widely unexplored question emerges: Can PRRs detect endogenous (self)
DNA or RNA, and what is the biological significance of self-nucleic acid detection? My laboratory at Columbia
University seeks to understand the biological significance of self-RNA sensing by PRRs during both homeostasis
and disease, and to further elucidate how self-RNA sensing is regulated to prevent autoimmune disorders.
Research on Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) uncovered the causal role of self-nucleic acid mediated PRR
activation in autoimmunity. AGS symptoms `mimic' viral infection, as patients exhibit elevated levels of type I
interferon (IFN), a potent antiviral cytokine produced when PRRs detect viral nucleic acids. Mutations in the RNA
editing enzyme ADAR1 can cause AGS. ADAR1 introduces A-to-I edits in cellular double-stranded RNAs
(dsRNAs), and prior studies demonstrated that ADAR1 deficiency leads to aberrant activation of PKR and MDA5,
two PRRs widely known to sense viral dsRNAs and trigger potent antiviral immune responses. These findings
gave rise to the idea that during ADAR1 deficiency, self-RNAs become mistaken as viral RNAs, triggering PRR
activation and downstream antiviral and inflammatory responses. Intriguingly, AGS mainly affects the brain,
where elevated type I IFN production is observed, and most patients are left with mental and physical disabilities
due to damage to the brain. ADAR1 and many PRRs are ubiquitously expressed in all cells, but it is puzzling
why the neural compartment is particularly vulnerable to dysregulated inflammation. Currently the underlying
molecular mechanisms that predispose the brain to inflammation are poorly defined. Our long-term goal is to
define the role of self-RNAs in triggering neuroinflammation. We will determine if dsRNA sensing PRRs
contribute to constitutive type I IFN expression in human neural cells, including neurons (Aim 1). Then, we will
determine the abundance and subcellular localization of dsRNAs in neurons: during homeostasis and RNA
dysregulation (Aim 2). We will also elucidate the molecular mechanism by which ADAR1 restricts self-RNAs from
activating PRRs in neural cells (Aim 3). In this application our rich experience in immunology and RNA biology
will be applied to neurobiology. We will utilize cutting edge human stem cell technology, neural cell differentiation
techniques, and high-throughput genomics in collaboration with leading experts in their field. These studies can
help identify early molecular events that trigger inflammation in the brain, which may lead to discovery of new
therapeutic targets to treat AGS. More broadly, these studies may provide insight into how inflammation arises
in other neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) or frontotemporal dementia
(FTD), where perturbation of RNA-binding protein dosage or expanded RNA repeat elements can cause disease."

Regulatory Science in Environmental Health and Toxicology
This proposal is to continue the T32 program in “Regulatory Science in Environmental Health and Toxicology”
at Texas A&M University. Funds are requested to support eight pre-doctoral (Ph.D. candidates) and two post-
doctoral trainees in the existing highly integrated degree-granting Interdisciplinary Faculty of Toxicology
program. Our goal remains to prepare trainees to function as independent researchers and/or practitioners in a
multidisciplinary setting, by providing training in mechanistic research and risk assessment with a focus on
scientifically sound, risk-based regulatory evaluations of the effects of drugs and other chemicals on human
health and the environment. To achieve this goal, didactic and research experiences are offered by a team of
20 outstanding investigators who specialize in mechanistic toxicology, community engagement, exposure
assessment/environmental chemistry, public policy, epidemiology, biomedical engineering, and data science
and modeling. Recruitment is conducted through traditional external advertisement and professional societies,
as well as from a number of existing Texas A&M programs that offer research experience for undergraduates,
and public health and toxicology masters-level traineeship. Pre-doctoral trainees undertake two laboratory
rotations in their first year in the program and follow a structured core academic curriculum that includes basic
and advanced toxicology, histopathology, pharmacology, biostatistics and research ethics, combined with
courses in risk assessment and exposure assessment. In the second year, additional specialized training is
offered through elective courses that further prepare trainees for careers in research and/or public health
practice. Distinctive features of the program are (i) a strongly encouraged hands-on summer externship through
a broad and diverse network of state and federal governmental regulatory agencies, companis and non-
governmental organizations; and (ii) a series of special programs in the form of boot camps and special
workshops on a wide range of trainee-selected topics (scientific writing, presentation, interview skills, disaster
research and data science). Following the first two years, trainee support for both pre- and post-doctoral fellows
shifts to their mentor’s or independent funding. All mentors have strong records of competitive support from
Federal, State and other sources and this group of mentors is exceptionally well balanced with respect to relevant
scientific expertise, sex and academic career level. Graduates from the program are highly successful in
academia, and sought-after by employers in the industry, governmental agencies and other professional settings.
Our trainees improve public health protection through innovative and rigorous mechanistic research and risk
assessment practice in support of rigorous scientific evidence-based regulatory decision-making."

A critical barrier to realizing the promise of the Academic Learning Health System (aLHS) is the insufficient
number of investigators with the skills to cross the research-practice chasm and create health systems in which
new knowledge is integrated into clinical practice. The realization of the aLHS requires a new translational
workforce phenotype – the aLHS Translational Scientist – who is grounded in several rapidly evolving, but
infrequently integrated knowledge domains, including: 1) system science and organizational change
management; 2) research questions and standards of scientific evidence; 3) health systems research methods;
4) biomedical informatics; 5) ethics of research and implementation in health systems; 6) improvement and
implementation science; 7) stakeholder engagement, leadership, and research management; and 8) health
equity and health disparities. This T32 application proposes an innovative two-year Academic Learning Health
System Scholars Program (aLHSSP) to provide the next generation of translational scientists with the
methodologic and professional skills to conduct rigorous research in the complex environments of health systems
and to disseminate and implement findings from such research into practice through: (1) building competency in
the above domains, (2) building skills in team science and leading effective interdisciplinary, diverse research
teams of engaged stakeholders; (3) preparing scholars for productive research careers in LHS science; and (4)
further developing scientific communication skills. The aLHSSP will target outstanding candidates with doctoral-
level clinical training in medicine and other health professions, or PhD-prepared scientists who wish to conduct
aLHS research. We will have a cohort of four trainees, two of which will be NCATS-supported. All trainees will
participate in a two-year program, pursuing an established Master of Science degree in LHS Science with a
curriculum designed around the knowledge domains listed above to prepare them to conduct research in an
aLHS and to lead teams. Scholars will conduct a mentored research project that addresses a pressing health
system issue guided by diverse mentoring teams consisting of experienced and committed subject-matter
experts, health system leaders, and near peer faculty, all of whom are well-grounded in the principles of effective
mentoring. Mentors will complete a 20-hr training via the Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI)
Mentor Academy that addresses core mentoring competencies, and participate in multi-CTSA hub Mentorship
Symposia. The aLHSSP will be part of an integrated educational infrastructure at Wake Forest (WF) that includes
the Workforce Development Program; trainees will utilize CTSI resources, attend professional development
seminars, build networks with other WF T32 trainees and nationally with other CTSA hubs; they will have access
to extensive support services. This unique training experience will prepare scholars for future careers as learning
health system scientists who lead evidence-based integration of knowledge into clinical practice."
10843196,"Opioid overdose deaths remain a major public health problem in the US. It is now recognized that surgery and
post-operative pain are major contributors to persistent opioid use and dependence. Inadequate management
of intraoperative nociception can lead to increased post-operative pain, which can lead to increased opioid
utilization, chronic pain, opioid dependence, and opioid abuse. In this perioperative setting a major challenge
is that patients are either unconscious (in the operating room) or heavily sedated (in the post-anesthesia care
unit) and cannot report their pain levels. In these scenarios, anesthesiologists and nurses can only guess the
opioid requirements for their patients, as they have no means to measure opioid drug effects in real-time. A
real-time measurement of opioid drug effects, if it existed, would allow anesthesiologists and nurses to
precisely titrate opioids and could significantly improve post-operative pain management and subsequent rates
of opioid utilization, dependence, and overdose. Over the past two years my laboratory has developed a real-
time biomarker for opioid drugs that could be used to provide more precise titration of opioid drugs and for drug
discovery applications. In this project we propose to investigate the mechanisms underlying this biomarker
and develop further translational science to support clinical application of this biomarker."
10843269,"Project Summary: Autoimmune conditions, allergies and immunogenicity against therapeutic proteins are
caused by unwanted immune responses against proteins. Our long-term goal is to rationally develop an
immunotherapy platform using protein delivery strategies to treat these clinical conditions. We observed that an
oral pre-administration of antigens loaded in lyso-phosphatidylserine (lysoPS), but not in double chain PS, based
nanoparticles effectively reduced unwanted immune response against several protein antigens, forming the
basis for an innovative immunotherapy. The overall objective of this application is to elucidate the cellular and
molecular mechanisms of oral delivery and tolerance mediated by lysoPS based nanoparticles. The rationale for
the proposed research is that once we gain a mechanistic understanding of the tolerogenic property of lysoPS,
it would result in an innovative immunotherapy approach and clinical strategies to prevent and reverse
immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins and to treat/cure autoimmune conditions and allergies. We also found
that there are differences in biophysical characteristics such as PS exposure of the nanoparticles comprised of
lyso and double chain PS. Based on these observations, our working hypothesis is that lysoPS mediated
tolerance is due to its distinct structural/biophysical characteristics that influences its access to gut associated
lymphoid tissue, receptor mediated cellular uptake/signaling and underlying molecular and cellular mechanism
of oral tolerance. Three specific aims (SA) are proposed to test our hypothesis and accomplish our objective
using a multidisciplinary approach. In SA 1, we will investigate the impact of biophysical properties of lysoPS
based lipidic particles and its impact on M-cell mediated particulate uptake. Biophysical characteristics such as
PS exposure, clustering, and lamellar properties will be investigated using orthogonal techniques. We will adopt
in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo studies using M-cell deficient mice to investigate the impact of M-cell engagement of
PS based particles containing model antigen Ovalbumin OVA. In SA 2, we will investigate the impact of PS
exposure on receptor binding and intracellular signaling. Based on our observation that functional blocking
antibody against Tim-4 receptor reversed PS mediated tolerance, we will investigate the role of this receptor
binding in tolerance using advanced cell-biological and imaging techniques and also using knock-out mice
models. In SA 3, we will investigate the mechanism of lysoPS mediated oral tolerance towards OVA, in particular,
the effects on gut resident dendritic cells, generation of regulatory T-cells and B-cell response. The generation
of Tregs will be investigated using OT-II transgenic mice and by adoptive transfer approaches. We will investigate
the impact of Tregs on B-cells by investigating the impact of lysoPS on the expression of IL-10, TGFb and
neuritin. Overall, our combined approach investigating the biophysical, cell biological, innate and adaptive
mechanisms of lysoPS tolerance will lay the foundation for a comprehensive clinical approach to reduce
immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins as well as prevent and reverse autoimmunity and allergies."

10932991,"MoTrPAC Project Summary
The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is designed to discover and
characterize the range of molecular transducers underlying the effects of exercise in humans. MoTrPAC
was launched in 2016 with six adult clinical centers and a pediatric center that have collaborated to
generate extensive Manual of Operations to guide research protocols involving all aspects of the clinical
operations (Phase I). Phase II began in the fall of 2019 with all human clinical centers showing excellent
progress towards initial recruitment goals and implementation of the protocol. The initial goal set forth by
NIH was to recruit 270 children (10-17 years of age) and 1980 sedentary adults (age 18 years or greater)
randomized to endurance training (170 youth, 840 adults), resistance training (840 adults), or non-exercise
controls (50 youth, 300 adults). An additional group of highly active endurance (50 youth, 150 adults) and
resistance (150 adults) trained individuals serve as comparators, not participating in the MoTrPAC exercise
training programs. The recruitment and enrollment approach are sex-balanced, with participants across a
wide range of ages (10-17, 18-39, 40-59 and >60-year age groups) and of different races. Due to the
COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in March 2020, MoTrPAC activities were suspended for over a year with
continued constraints through 2022. Despite the numerous challenges encountered as a result of the
pandemic, the human clinical centers have successfully enrolled ~80% (adult) and 95% (pediatric) of the
highly active cohort, ~93% of cross-sectional (pediatric), and ~60% (adult) and ~50% (pediatric) of the
current target enrollment numbers in the randomized control trial portion of the study. This led to the NIH
Common Fund to release the current NOFO (RFA-RM-23-010) to provide MoTrPAC with funding to
complete recruitment and follow-up for the clinical studies, including finishing mechanistic randomized
controlled trials of sedentary adults and children, and observational studies of highly active adults and
children. This will enrich the participant cohorts that are critical to the understanding of exercise adaptations
and heterogeneity across age, gender, and minority groups. Altogether, this extension will allow MoTrPAC
to complete the intended goals as originally envisioned, will provide a more complete public database of
the health benefits of exercise, and will provide insight into how physical activity mitigates disease risk."
10843749,"ABSTRACT
Abnormalities in B cell subsets play a key role in SLE, a disease that, in addition to AutoAb production and
multi-organ involvement, often includes upregulation of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). One of the
hallmarks of SLE is that it preferentially affects women. Both sex hormones and the X chromosome (where
TLR7 is located) have been implicated in the heightened susceptibility of women to SLE and to other
autoimmune disorders. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie the sex-bias that
accompanies SLE pathogenesis will thus provide critical information into the development of autoimmunity
and help uncover novel therapeutic targets. While expansion of germinal center (GC) B cells and
plasmablasts/plasma cells (PB/PC) has long been associated with SLE, recent studies have implicated a
novel B cell subset, termed Age/Autoimmune-associated B cells (ABCs), in lupus pathogenesis. In addition
to classical B cell markers, ABCs also express CD11c and the transcription factor T-bet. Formation of ABCs
is promoted by a combination of signals that includes TLR7 or TLR9 engagement and cytokines like IFN-g
and IL-21. Aberrant accumulation of ABCs is observed both in murine lupus and in SLE patients where
they are major producers of autoAbs and correlate with disease activity and clinical manifestations. Our lab
has had a long-standing interest in dissecting the regulation and function of IRF family members, which
have emerged as key controllers of B cell responses. While identifying IRF-interacting proteins, we isolated
a protein termed Def6. Def6 and its only other homologue, SWAP-70, play an important immunoregulatory
role in humans and mice. Def6 is a genetic risk factor for human SLE and biallelic mutations in Def6 result
in early-onset systemic autoimmunity. Furthermore, in C57BL/6 mice, the concomitant lack of Def6 and
SWAP-70 (Double-knockout mice=DKOs) leads to the spontaneous development of SLE, which, similarly
to humans, preferentially affects female mice. Lupus development in DKO mice is accompanied by a
marked accumulation of ABCs, which is controlled by IRF5. We have recently found that, as compared to
ABCs from DKO males, ABCs from DKO females expand to a greater extent, express an ISG signature,
and readily produce autoAbs upon TLR7 stimulation. Furthermore, in comparison with DKO males, DKO
females accumulate greater numbers of GC B cells and PB/PCs that contain CD11c+ subsets.
Dysregulating TLR7 expression in DKO males results in a marked expansion of ABCs and other B cell
effector lineages including CD11c-expressing B cell subsets and promotes autoAb production and disease
development in DKO males. Taken together these data suggest that sexual dimorphism underlies several
aspects of ABC biology in autoimmune settings. In this proposal we will investigate the hypothesis that sex-

 Eukaryotic cells have developed sophisticated defenses aimed at limiting viral replication and thereby
preventing infection from escalating to other cells. This R35 MIRA application will support studies to understand
how at the biochemical level various cellular metabolic pathways are regulated as part of the innate immune
response to viral infection to disrupt virus replication. Such studies are essential for developing more effective
anti-viral therapeutics. Our studies will center around a key enzyme in the antiviral response: viperin (Virus
Inhibitory Protein; Endoplasmic Reticulum-associated, INterferon-inducible), which is strongly up-regulated in
viral infections and has been shown to restrict the infectivity of a number of important human viruses including
influenza A, HIV and hepatitis C.
 Viperin catalyzes the synthesis of the antiviral nucleotide 3’-deoxy-3’,4’-didehydro-CTP (ddhCTP) from CTP
by a radical SAM-dependent mechanism. ddhCTP has been shown to have antiviral properties against some
RNA viruses, e.g. flaviviruses, where it acts as a chain-terminating inhibitor of the viral RNA polymerase.
However, this observation does not explain the much broader antiviral properties of viperin that are associated
with its network of protein-protein interactions with viral proteins, cellular proteins important for viral replication,
and components of innate immune signaling pathways.
 Building on the results of our previous NIH-supported research, we will investigate how viperin acts to
regulate various cellular metabolic and signaling pathways that are important for establishing the antiviral state.
Our strategy is to focus on examples of viperin’s interactions with other enzymes for which there is both a well-
validated biological response and a clear biochemical rational underpinning the response. Our experimental
approach will combine detailed mechanistic and structural studies on purified enzymes with functional studies of
enzymes transfected in mammalian cell lines.
 As part of these studies, we will investigate how viperin engages with ubiquitin ligases to activate innate
immune signaling pathways and proteasomal degradation of enzymes necessary for viral replication. We will
investigate how viperin down-regulates fatty acid b-oxidation through its interactions with the mitochondrial
trifunctional enzyme (protein) complex. We will also investigate how viperin interacts with enzymes in the
cholesterol biosynthetic pathway to decrease cellular cholesterol, which is necessary for enveloped viruses to
bud from the cell membrane.
 The anticipated outcome of this project is a unified understanding of the biochemical mechanisms
underpinning viperin’s diverse antiviral functions."

The proper folding of proteins is essential for all life, making aberrant protein folding severely problematic. The
protein homeostasis (proteostasis) network is a tightly regulated system that ensures that proteins are folded
and degraded as necessary. However, misfolded proteins can overwhelm proteostasis. Misfolding is associated
with numerous devastating neurodegenerative, heart, and kidney disorders, as well as forms of cancer. Protein
disaggregases can engage misfolded substrates and dissolve them, promoting their return to proper fold and
function. Disaggregases may serve as the final defense against collapse of proteostasis. Our central hypothesis
is that disaggregases play key roles in maintaining cellular health, but are vulnerable when the proteostasis
network becomes overwhelmed in disease. Therefore, technologies that enhance disaggregase activity may be
therapeutically useful. However, disaggregases are the least characterized branch of the proteostasis network.
My research program focuses on advancing our understanding of how disaggregases counter misfolding, both
in health and under stress. We seek to elucidate how cells maintain proteostasis, how proteostasis fails, and
how protein disaggregases might ultimately be applied to prevent or reverse collapse of proteostasis. During the
first period of this award, we focused on engineering tailored Hsp104 variants, better understanding mechanisms
of misfolding, and have begun characterizing human disaggregases. During the next phase, we will continue
and expand our efforts to better understand the roles disaggregases play in safeguarding against misfolding. We
will focus on two primary themes: (1) we will develop finely-tuned Hsp104 variants and use these variants as
probes to test the effects of disaggregation in different systems. These studies will also reveal insights into the
mechanism of Hsp104, and we aim to better understand how Hsp104 recognizes and distinguishes among
substrates. Further, because Hsp104 is a member of the AAA+ family of proteins, which serve crucial roles
across biology, our findings can be broadly applied. (2) We will characterize and develop approaches to modulate
human disaggregases. Here, we will focus on understanding the structure, mechanism, and substrate repertoire
of human disaggregases. We also aim to develop approaches to modulate the activity of human disaggregases.
Beyond their possible therapeutic utility, finely-tuned disaggregases can be used as probes to test the hypothesis
that misfolded species are toxic, and that restoration of proteins to their native folds and functions can reverse
disease phenotypes. Ultimately we aim to apply the findings from these studies to develop new strategies to
treat protein-misfolding diseases. This is especially important because, despite intense efforts, there are no
effective therapeutics available to treat numerous protein-misfolding disorders."
10830384,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Research on the intergenerational transmission of substance use seeks to identify the various mechanisms or
mediators which connect parental substance use, an established risk factor, to adolescent substance use.
Parent-related mediators are measured using multiple informant data, which allows for a comprehensive
assessment of behaviors and reduces bias from any single reporter. However, current methods for analyzing
multiple informant data in mediation models do not separate the different sources of variance present in
multiple informant ratings, meaning that the variance that is unique to each parent is confounded with the
variance that is common across both parents. As a result, the estimates for mediated effects become biased,
and effects that are caused by one source of variance (e.g., the common behaviors between parents) may be
misattributed to a different source of variance (e.g., maternal-specific behaviors). As a consequence, our
understanding of intergenerational processes and ability to design effective preventive interventions is limited.
To address these limitations, a recently developed psychometric model, the trifactor model (TFM) can be used
to disentangle the sources of variance present in multiple informant data, allowing for more accurate estimates
of mediated effects, and more valid and specific substantive conclusions about the intergenerational processes
therein. The TFM separates the sources of variance in multiple informant data into three independent levels: a
common factor representing the shared variability across reporters, the perspective factors representing the
variability unique to each reporter, and the specific factors representing variance arising from the use of the
same items. Despite the great potential of the TFM, this model has not yet been evaluated within a mediation
model, nor compared to current methods. Moreover, this model is complex and most applications would
require latent variable scores in order to reduce the number of parameters, but there are a number of
challenges to obtaining scores for this model that would need to be addressed. In order to expand the
applicability of the TFM, the proposed research will (1) derive a single mediator model with the TFM and
compare performance to traditional multiple-informant methods, (2) extend the TFM to parallel mediation
model and develop factor scoring approaches, and (3) Apply novel TFM methods to empirical data to examine
parental monitoring as a mediator for the intergenerational transmission of substance use. The current NRSA
proposal presents a novel expansion of the TFM so that it may be used to uncover specific mechanisms that
lead to adolescent substance use. Further, this fellowship will provide the crucial training needed to establish
this applicant's independent research program in developing quantitative methods for the study of adolescent
substance use and prevention through training in statistical mediation, family-based models of substance use,
prevention science, and research dissemination."

Neuroprotective actions of cystathionine γ-lyase through gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide
signaling.
 Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gaseous signaling molecule or gasotransmitter which serves key roles in the
central nervous system. However, specific targets and mechanisms of H2S action in the brain are obscure.
Herein, we propose to elucidate the signaling pathways modulated by H2S in the brain that are
neuroprotective to arrive at therapeutics targeting Alzheimer's disease (AD). H2S is generated from the amino
acid cysteine which, in turn, is synthesized by cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) via the transsulfuration pathway
in the brain. H2S is also synthesized by two other enzymes, cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) and 3-
mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST), in the brain. We have demonstrated previously, that H2S and
cysteine metabolism are dysregulated in AD. One of the modes by which H2S signals is via a posttranslational
modification termed sulfhydration or persulfidation, wherein the reactive –SH group of cysteine residues on
target proteins is converted to an –SSH group in a fashion analogous to nitrosylation by nitric oxide (NO),
where the –SH groups are converted to –SNO groups. Although sulfhydration and nitrosylation modulate
diverse physiological processes ranging from response to inflammation to neuroprotection, the molecular
mechanisms by which cysteine and H2S/NO axes of gasotransmitter signaling affect neuronal function are
yet to be deciphered. In Aim 1 of this project, we will monitor expression and activity of the three H2S
biosynthetic enzymes, CSE, CBS and 3-MST in the mouse brain at various ages. Sulfhydration status in
normal as well as mice lacking CSE will be assessed. The specific proteins modified by sulfhydration will be
identified, and sites of sulfhydration mapped on them. The interplay of sulfhydration with nitrosylation in
neuronal function will be monitored. In Aim 2, we will analyze the involvement of H2S in stress responses
and behavior. In Aim 3, we will identify differentially sulfhydrated proteins in the 3xTg-AD mouse model of
AD.
 By studying the function of CSE and H2S in the brain, we set a goal to better understand signaling
mediated by cysteine, H2S and protein sulfhydration in the context of neuronal signaling in AD. Understanding
the regulation of H2S signaling in the brain helps to determine the basic physiological pathways involved in
neuroprotection and pins down the nodes for precision therapeutics and development of biomarkers for AD
and other age-related neurodegenerative diseases involving dysregulated H2S signaling.

Vascular surgery is expected to see a workforce shortfall in the future. This T35 program will expose
medical students to vascular surgery and the research that informs it. The aim is to meet the needs of
our aging population, satisfying the strategic vision of NHLBI including understanding human biology,
reducing human disease, developing workforce and resources, and advancing translational research.
Students will be selected from within the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. Recruits will
work on defined research projects that emphasize vascular biology and ways that research can
modify disease. They will also be exposed to clinical educational experiences that can help them
identify mentors for the future. Evidence suggests that mentorship is one of the most important
factors that influence students career choices in medicine. The goal is to have a representative
workforce that can take on the clinical and research challenges of vascular disease in an aging
population. In addition to laboratory or outcome research, students will attend clinical conferences,
research seminars and didactic lectures. They will be encouraged to submit abstracts and be part of
manuscript development. They will also have access to tuition benefits and travel expenses related to
their research. The researchers chosen as faculty as a whole have research priorities that are inline
with the eight objectives of NHLBI, including 1 - understanding normal biological function and
resilience 2 - investigating newly discovered pathobiological mechanisms important to the onset and
progression of heart, lung, blood and sleep related (HLBS) diseases 3 - investigating factors that
account for differences in health among populations 4 - identifying factors that account for individual
differences in pathobiology and in responses to treatments 5 - developing and optimizing novel
diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to prevent, treat, and cure HLBS diseases 6 - optimizing clinical
and implementation research to improve health and reduce disease 7 - leveraging emerging
opportunities in data science to open new frontiers in HLBS research and 8- developing, diversifying,
and sustaining a scientific workforce capable of accomplishing the NHLBI’s mission. The faculty
preceptors are from the Departments of Surgery, Division of Vascular Surgery, Vascular Medicine
Institute, Department of Cardiology and Department of Bioengineering. All are well funded with strong
mentoring histories in pre and post graduate experiences."

 Vision is key to spatial navigation, because visual landmarks guide us through our everyday lives.
However, some landmarks become unreliable because they shift their location over time. Recent research
suggests an area of the brain known as the retrosplenial cortex processes landmarks and evaluates their
stability1. The retrosplenial cortex lies at a nexus between the hippocampal formation—a structure critical for
navigation, learning, and memory—and the visual cortex. The anatomical and functional connections have
suggested retrosplenial cortex is a site of visuospatial processing for some time2. And in fact, patients with
damage to RSC have difficulty utilizing landmarks to navigate through familiar environments, learning new
routes, and performing visual memory tasks3. But only recently have “place” cells been discovered in mouse
retrosplenial cortex, which encode the animal’s position in the world4. Our preliminary data suggest place cells
can be seen while an animal runs through a visual, virtual-reality track. We hypothesized that these place
representations may be strongly influenced by the movement of local landmarks, thus encoding both space
and landmark stability. This proposal lays out a strategy for testing this hypothesis using in vivo two-photon
calcium imaging and immersive virtual reality environments. First the proposal aims to fully characterize the
visual properties of retrosplenial “place” cells. Second, the proposal aims to test whether areas of high
landmark instability are encoded by fewer place fields. Finally, the proposal focuses on the moment a landmark
begins moving to see if the neural circuits show signs of becoming plastic. Scientists have long been interested
in how the brain enables spatial navigation. Not only is spatial navigation essential to daily life, but the neural
circuits involved overlap significantly with brain regions that process learning and memory. If successful, this
study will generate insight into the neural circuits of navigation and the essential contribution of visual landmark
processing. These results will add basic knowledge into how these circuits function in health and why they are
vulnerable to diseases such as neurodegeneration and stroke. The project will also inform the scientific and
medical communities on the proper design of immersive sensory interfaces for behavioral assessment in
animals and potentially rehabilitative therapies in humans."

CRISPR/Cas-based gene editing has ushered in a hopeful era that dreams of new therapies for currently
untreatable genetic diseases. Because mutated proteins are produced in specific cells, there is a critical need to
develop organ- and cell-specific delivery strategies to realize the full potential of genomic medicines. We recently
overcame this challenge through development of the first class of non-viral nanoparticles for tissue-specific
genome editing. Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT) lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) enable targeted intravenous
delivery of nucleic acids and proteins to the lungs, liver, and spleen, plus local delivery to the muscle, brain, and
skin. Tropism is driven by inclusion of SORT molecules, which create tissue-selective 5-component SORT LNPs
that are compatible with multiple gene editing techniques, including mRNA, Cas9 mRNA / sgRNA, and Cas9
ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. In this grant proposal, we Aim to (1) determine the mechanism of SORT,
(2) improve the efficacy and tolerability of liver-, lung-, and spleen-targeting SORT LNPs, and (3) determine the
cell-specific gene editing capabilities of SORT LNPs with the potential for expanded tropism. Results will
determine the fundamental mechanisms and structure-activity relationships (SAR) for non-viral nanoparticle
liver, lung, and spleen tropism. This will ultimately allow targeted and safer CRISPR/Cas gene editing in vivo.
We will determine these factors by adapting a unique class of LNPs, called SORT LNPs, that we developed. We
will employ human cells and genetically engineered mouse models that allow quantification of precise, cell
specific gene editing events. Completion of the proposed studies will (1) Elucidate the fundamental mechanisms
how and why SORT LNPs target extrahepatic tissues, (2) Determine how SORT molecules control efficacy and
tolerability for improved gene editing outcomes, and (3) Determine and control cell-type gene editing specificity
to expand targeted gene editing. Cumulatively, this will open new avenues for CRISPR/Cas-based correction of
genetic diseases by developing efficacious, safe, and clinically translatable nanoparticle carriers."

opportunity, advertising the availability of pilot grants, providing guidance to potential applicants, and
coordinating the submission and review of applications, b) awarding 3-7 new pilot grants each year of the
funding cycle, with each award for $60,000 over a 1.5-year period, c) monitoring pilot projects during the pre-
award, award-time, and post-award phases, and d) tracking success of the PPP by recording all efforts to
secure extramural funding, all publications and presentations of research findings resulting from the pilot
project, successful career advancement of pilot project recipients, and evidence of scientific impact of the
projects, as well as their impact on the community and on research translation. 2) In collaboration with the
Career Enhancement Program, use the PPP as a mechanism to support the career enhancement of early-
stage and new investigators. 3) In collaboration with the Community Engagement Core (CEC) and its
Community Advisory Board (CAB), provide a mechanism for community engagement by a) seeking input from
CAB members about their environmental health concerns before developing annual requests for applications,
b) providing our CAB with a say in determining which pilot projects are funded by having CAB members review
LOIs to assess how well prospective projects address environmental health issues of concern to the
community, c) increasing our CAB’s capacity to review, as well as their knowledge about the EHS research
that is conducted by CURES, by including new “shadow reviewers” in each year’s LOI review process and
providing tutorials on how to review research proposals, and d) requiring pilot project recipients to present their
research at CEC-sponsored events, such as CAB meetings and environmental health forums (EH Chats)."

10830702,"Overall ABSTRACT
The vision for the Texas A&M Center for Environmental Health Research (TiCER) is to nucleate
environmental health research and translational activities of investigators around the overarching theme
“Innovative solutions for addressing exposure-stressor interactions” with a focus on underserved populations in
urban and urbanizing areas in the state of Texas. This vision will be achieved by building on Texas A&M
University’s ongoing investments in people and facilities and a history of state-wide outreach to community
stakeholders, which synergizes the Center’s overall goals of reducing and preventing environmental health
disparities through basic, applied and community-engaged research. Existing investments through the Center
provide infrastructure and an outstanding base of scientific expertise ready to catalyze innovative studies into
environmental health concerns of affected communities, build multi-disciplinary collaborations among Center
members to elucidate mechanistic links between environmental exposures and adverse health outcomes and
ultimately translate data to action. The Center will continue recent successes in mentoring junior faculty,
advancing career development and leadership opportunities, recruitment of additional established investigators
into environmental health research, and fostering a multi-disciplinary, team-oriented intellectual environment
among Center members representing 11 colleges at Texas A&M. The Center’s vision is guided by four research
themes spanning fundamental and applied research to inform policy and public health: 1) Climate Change and
Health; 2) Environmental Justice and Policy; 3) Stressors to Responses; 4) Environment and Metabolism , which
will be coordinated through a highly integrated set of Facility Cores. The Translational Research Support Core
(TRSC) will support bi-directional translational workspaces including in vitro and in vivo model development and
toxicology and exposure science resources to ensure Center member access to unparalleled instrumentation
and cores. Together with the Data Science Core, these resources will enhance the capacity, breadth,
collaborative nature, and impact of environmental health research. The Administrative Core and Pilot Project
Program will facilitate TiCER’s function by ensuring continuation of the highest levels of institutional support,
fostering career development, and promoting multi-disciplinary team science that generates knowledge to action
in areas of community concern. The Community Engagement Core will be a critical vehicle for implementation
of a multi-prong strategy of the Center by serving as a bi-directional portal to connect Center members, affected
communities and key stakeholders. These efforts build on the strong tradition and engagement of Texas A&M
in public and community service statewide, emphasizing TiCER’s focus on environmental health disparities of
underserved populations. Overall, the Center will expand the established investigator base and expertise in
cross-cutting environmental health science that can be deployed to increase the impact of environmental health
research change in Texas and beyond."

10908728,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a life-threatening autoimmune disease affecting over 1 million patients
in the United States that occurs when the immune system attacks and destroys insulin-
producing beta islet cells in the pancreas. Treatment of T1D requires a lifetime of constant
maintenance to avoid life-threatening complications. There is an urgent need for a therapy that
can engineer the immune system to prevent disease progression at early stages, prevent
damage to islet cells, and have a long-lasting and transformative effect on patients. One
method of achieving T1D-specific tolerance is to genetically engineer antigen-presenting cells
(APCs) to present disease-relevant antigen(s). Antigen presentation in the presence of
tolerogenic signals can lead to the maturation of disease-specific protective regulatory T cells
(Tregs). In particular, liver-resident APCs express low levels of activating co-stimulatory
molecules, and surrounding cells secrete immunosuppressive signals, making the liver a
tolerogenic environment. We hypothesize that non-viral transfection of APCs in the liver with
genes encoding T1D-specific autoantigens will promote safe and specific protective tolerance as
a tolerogenic vaccine for the prevention and treatment of autoimmune T1D. We will develop
biodegradable nanoparticles to safely and effectively program immune cells in vivo, including
APCs. We will first create and well-characterize the new nanobiotechnology and validate it in in
vitro models (Aim 1). We will then evaluate the nanobiotechnology in vivo in mouse models of
T1D (Aim 2). Finally, we will evaluate these NPs with human immune cells in vitro and in vivo,
bringing this technology closer to translation (Aim 3). This nanoparticle-based biotechnology is
designed to enable a safe and effective method of immune cell engineering to treat T1D."

We aim to “engage and support the next generation of HIV structural biology researchers” by creating effective and diverse
training opportunities. Our Developmental Core will accomplish this by implementing a series of training and development
programs that will include four Components: 1) a Collaborative Development Awards Program designed to support talented
young independent researchers who will benefit from and contribute to CHEETAH Center research projects and capabilities,
2) a summer, journal club-style Seminar Series that will expose Center trainees to the current HIV-1 literature and help hone
their scientific presentation skills, 3) a Visiting Scholar Program for Center trainees that will include online training in the
theoretical underpinnings and practical aspects of different biophysical and structural methods, followed by a 1-2 month
“hands on” experience in which trainees will visit a Center lab or other training site to apply one of these methods to a
problem of interest, and 4) Other Training Activities that will include virtual visual communication workshops for Center
trainees that will provide them with practical guidance on creating outreach videos, animations, figures, and
posters/presentations."
10835989,"CORE SUMMARY
This Core is designed to provide CHEETAH Center members with access to novel approaches for making, manipulating,
and identifying new biomolecules relevant to studies of different HIV-host systems under investigation in our Center.
Specifically, our Tools for Biopolymer Synthesis and Screening Core (Core 1) will develop new methodology and provide
Center members with access to state-of-the-art instrumentation and expertise in Peptide Synthesis, Protein Design, and
CRISPR Screening Methodology.
Component 1 (Peptide Synthesis) will provide synthetic peptide and protein reagents that are not readily accessible using
traditional recombinant expression systems. Since chemical synthesis provides complete atomic control over the
composition of peptides/proteins, this method is ideal for producing custom reagents containing labels (fluorophores,
isotopes), modifications (methylation, phosphorylation), and non-canonical components (mirror-image or other unusual
amino acids, cyclic or crosslinked peptides/proteins). Additionally, this Core will continue to develop novel chemical
peptide synthesis tools to expand the reach of chemical protein synthesis to larger and more challenging targets.
Component 2 (Protein Design) will collaborate with CHEETAH Center laboratories to use and extend cutting-edge
computational protein design methodologies to generate novel protein tools, reagents, and platforms in support of HIV-1
research. Specific advances will include incorporating deep learning methods into protein design pipelines and applying the
enhanced design approaches to optimize target protein expression, stability, and homogeneity.
Component 3 (CRISPR Screening Methodology) will perform CRISPR validation experiments and HIV-CRISPR screens
with existing CRISPR libraries, and also develop novel libraries to identify candidate host genes implicated in phenotypes
of interest to CHEETAH Center laboratories. The overall goals are to: 1) uncover and highlight functionally relevant host
protein targets for further study, and 2) provide expertise for functional validation studies."
10840255,"SUMMARY
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects more than 12% of the US population and is the fourth leading preventable
cause of death in the US. AUD is associated with compulsive drinking and emergence of a negative emotional
state during abstinence, resulting in two-thirds of afflicted people relapsing within months of completing alcohol
cessation treatment. Repeated cycles of intoxication and abstinence are linked to persistent alterations in the
brain that remain long after detoxification, which drive relapse of drinking, often at levels higher than before
abstinence. Identifying the molecular mechanisms that lead to hazardous alcohol use and contribute to the high
rates of relapse is imperative for the effective design of better treatments to curb alcohol abuse. Our previous
studies illustrate the power of integrating epigenetic, transcriptomic, circuitry, pharmacology and behavioral tools
to elucidate the molecular underpinnings contributing to hazardous alcohol use. Those studies, using genome-
wide DNA methylation (DNAm) analysis of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) to compare macaque alcohol-naive
and alcohol-drinkers, identified differential DNAm (D-DNAm) signals, mapping to genes not previously linked to
alcohol use, but with high relevance to synaptic plasticity modulation. Experimental manipulation of two of these
DNAm-linked genes resulted in altered glutamate and GABA neurotransmission and changes in ethanol intake.
The the next critical step is to understand how repeated abstinence/relapse cycles alters DNAm signals and how
these changes contribute to adaptations in neurocircuitry. We hypothesize that some D-DNAm signals
associated with chronic alcohol use may persist during abstinence, contributing to risk of relapse. In addition, de
novo D-DNAm signals generated during repeated cycles of abstinence/relapse, may further heighten relapse
risk. To identify abstinence-associated DNAm, we will use the highly translational macaque alcohol self-
administration model and our proven genome-wide approach to identify D-DNAm in the NAc of macaques
following > 12 months of chronic alcohol self-administration and then 3 cycles of forced abstinence (each cycle:
1 month abstinence and 3 months of open-access). After integrating gene and transcript variant expression and
D-DNAm data generated from the same subjects and tissues, a subset of compelling, novel targets will be
selected for functional study using pharmacological and genetic manipulation approaches in a mouse chronic
intermittent ethanol (CIE) model. This rodent CIE model has been extensively used to model cycles of alcohol
exposure and withdrawal leading to an escalation of drinking during relapse. In addition to recording ethanol
intake, the effects of target manipulation on neurotransmission will be evaluated using patch-clamp
electrophysiological analysis. Overall, these studies will aid in our understanding of the molecular mechanism(s)
establishing risk for relapse. This information will be critical to advancing the development of effective therapies
for alcohol abuse and to prevent relapse."
10843860,"PROJECT SUMMARY The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) makes essential contributions to learning, mood,
and decision making, including evaluating and responding to threats. Compared to other circuits, mPFC circuits
undergo prolonged maturation that is likely necessary in order to support complex behaviors. Yet how the
development of prefrontal circuits enables the maturation of adaptive behaviors is poorly understood. Moreover,
its extended development renders mPFC circuits highly vulnerable to disruption by environmental insults such
as early life adversity (ELA). Even after adverse environmental conditions improve, ELA can produce lasting
alterations in cognitive and emotional processing that put individuals at risk for many psychiatric disorders
including anxiety disorders and depression. Although mPFC circuits are clear therapeutic targets for
psychiatric disorders, substantial gaps in our understanding of typical mPFC circuit development and how this
maturation enables emergence of complex cognitive and emotional behaviors prevent us from designing
effective interventions. Our research will fill this knowledge gap by combining threat avoidance behavioral assays
with projection-specific optogenetic manipulations, activity monitoring, and a model of ELA to test the hypothesis
that precisely timed maturation of PL-BLA and PL-NAc circuits determines age-specific avoidance behaviors,
and by altering the trajectory of circuit development, ELA leads to age-specific alterations in learned avoidance.
In Aim 1, we will use optogenetics to test the hypothesis that the behavioral contribtions of specific mPFC circuits
change over development. In Aim 2, we will use fiber photometry to expose circuit and region-specific activity
patterns during learned avoidance across development. Finally, in Aim 3, we will apply the aforementioned
approaches to a model of early life adversity to understand how chronic early stress impacts the trajectory of
threat avoidance circuit development. This proposal directly addresses a pressing need to understand the
complex relationships between early adversity, mPFC circuit development, and adaptive threat resposnes. Our
research can inform individualized mental health treatments that exploit a variety of developmental opportunities,
depending on the stage at which symptoms emerge."
10843865,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal details a five-year translational research training program for mentored career development in
molecular profiling, exercise physiology and trial conduct. The candidate is a recently appointed Cardiology
faculty member at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and the outlined proposal builds on the candidate’s
background in cardiovascular prevention and exercise physiology to provide three new domains of expertise –
metabolomics, genetics, and exercise clinical trials. The applicant’s development will occur through a blend of
laboratory training, didactic courses, and scientific conferences. The candidate’s mentor is a recognized leader
in molecular profiling, exercise science, and cardiometabolic disease. The additional mentorship team has a
distinguished mentoring record and vast expertise in metabolomics, genetics and exercise science.
We recently identified a novel plasma metabolite, Dimethylguanidino valeric acid (DMGV) that is a very early
marker of cardiometabolic disease and participant in a biochemical pathway (AGXT2) relevant to exercise
responsiveness and cardiovascular disease. In recently published human data, we found that DMGV levels
decreased after 20 weeks of aerobic exercise training (ET), however individuals with higher baseline levels of
DMGV demonstrated attenuated improvements in lipid traits and insulin sensitivity after completing ET. The
applicant now seeks to extend these studies by relating DMGV levels, and additional AGXT2 pathway
intermediates (e.g. BAIBA, ADMA, glycine) to exercise-induced cardiovascular (e.g. maximal oxygen uptake
[VO2max] and blood pressure) adaptations (Aim 1). Further, the applicant will apply unbiased metabolomics
techniques to identify novel biochemical pathways related to exercise responsiveness (Aim 2). Finally, the
applicant will identify genetic determinants of relevant metabolites identified in Aim 2 by interrogating large,
population-based cohorts with existing genetics and metabolomics data, and integrate findings with long-term
health outcomes to identify novel biochemical pathways involved in exercise and cardiometabolic health (Aim
3). In parallel, the applicant will integrate the same metabolomics techniques with cardiac MRI data in subjects
with metabolic syndrome in order to characterize subclinical cardiac dysfunction, and design an exercise
clinical trial in this population (Aim 4) as part of an R01-level award and transition to independence.
Regular exercise leads to improvements in cardiometabolic health, however significant inter-individual
differences exist and, further, the molecular underpinnings of regular exercise’s salutary effects remain poorly
defined. This proposal will provide the applicant with the required training and expertise in molecular profiling,
exercise physiology, and clinical trials in order to study chronic exercise adaptation in healthy subjects.
Ultimately, this work will lay the foundation for future investigation into the clinical and molecular responses to
regular exercise in patients with overt cardiometabolic disease (e.g. metabolic syndrome) at high risk for heart
failure as part of applicant’s transition to research independence."
10843964,"SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRDs) are typically the result of neurodegenerative processes
that begin 15-20 years before clinical diagnosis. Despite this lengthy subclinical phase and advances in early
diagnostic technologies including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, brain MRIs, and positron emission
tomography (PET) measures there are no scalable biomarkers to identify individuals with preclinical disease,
which may offer the best time window for intervention. Specifically, because brain MRI and PET tests are
resource-intensive and CSF sampling is invasive, there is urgent need for biomarkers based on blood samples,
which can be non-invasively collected even in centers lacking highly specialized technology.
The mitochondrial genome (mtDNA), unlike the stable nuclear genome, is dynamic and accumulates somatic
mutations over the lifespan. Mutations in the mtDNA can be induced by oxidative stress and lead to declining
mitochondrial function as we age; in turn, less functional mitochondria generate higher levels of oxidative stress,
which induces chronic inflammation and tissue injury in specific organs including the brain. Yet, no study has
investigated mtDNA mutations as early predictors of ADRD. We hypothesize that individuals with higher levels
and faster accumulation of blood mtDNA mutations have greater cognitive decline and preclinical ADRD brain
imaging changes during midlife, and that these mtDNA biomarkers will predict ADRD diagnosis in older adults.
We will test our hypotheses by leveraging the NHLBI-funded Coronary Artery Risk Development In young
Adults (CARDIA) study. CARDIA is a multicenter, community-based, longitudinal cohort that recruited 5,115
black and white young adults (mean age 25 years), followed them up at least every five years, and is preparing
to conduct its examination Year 35 (Y35) visit in 2020/21 (mean age 60 years) when over 3,000 participants
are expected to return. We will use state-of-the-art deep sequencing technology to measure mtDNA mutations
in CARDIA blood samples collected at Y15, Y25, and Y35. In Aim 1, we will determine whether higher levels of
mtDNA mutations and their accumulation over time are associated with greater cognitive decline in midlife. In
Aim 2, we will determine whether mtDNA mutations are associated with structural, physiological, and functional
MRI phenotypes of preclinical ADRD as well as with sensitive MRI-based markers of accelerated brain aging
and preclinical ADRD constructed by our team using contemporary machine learning techniques. Finally, in
Aim 3, we will test the clinical utility of these mtDNA mutation biomarkers in identifying individuals at risk of
future ADRD in four older cohorts that have large numbers of longitudinally identified, clinically-diagnosed
ADRD. Our focus on longitudinal measures of blood mtDNA, cognitive function, and MRI changes over a 10-
year period during midlife, combined with characterization of their clinical utility in older populations, is highly
innovative. If successful, our study may help initiate possible future interventions in early midlife and reduce the
public health and medical burden of AD and dementia."
10843967,"The proposed T35 program will provide annual financial support to sixteen medical students to spend nine weeks during the first summer of medical school, working on aging-related research. For this renewal application, the T35 program's objectives remain: (1) to provide students excellent research mentors and aging related research projects to stimulate their interest in aging research; (2) to get medical students engaged and interested in principles of clinical care for older adults and in geriatric medicine; (3) to run a high-quality program that identifies highly qualified students, assures strong mentorship, and optimizes the probability that research will lead to presentations and publications and future careers in aging research and geriatric medicine; and (4) to acquire data to judge the success of the program and to modify the program to make it more successful. The Summer Research Training in Aging for Medical Students program will coordinate with the American Federation for Aging Research (AFAR) so that students from other medical schools, as well as NYUSoM students, can participate. An experienced geriatrician and researcher will be the Program Director (PD) assisted by an Associate Program Director (APD) familiar with career mentoring for medical students, geriatric curriculum development, and the NYUSoM's new curriculum that emphasizes research. An Internal Advisory Board (IAB) will advise the PD on selection of mentors and projects, review evaluation metrics, and suggest program improvements. Each year the PD and the IAB will select experienced researchers who are also successful mentors and solicit from them aging research projects for students. These researchers will work closely with students during their summer experience to ensure the successful implementation of a research project suitable for abstract, presentation and publication. Throughout the nine weeks, students will participate in weekly interactive didactic session related both to research and four to geriatrics/aging. Students will also have the opportunity for clinical experiences appropriate for rising M2's. At the end of their experience, students will formally present their research projects to other students and mentors. They will also be required to submit an abstract for the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) annual meeting, and/or another professional society. Students will be strongly encouraged to attend these meetings to present their research. To track the success of the program, students and mentors will be surveyed at the end of the program regarding their experience, and how the program can be improved. Students will also be surveyed in the middle and end of medical school and at the end of residency, to assess their career achievements and goals related to aging and research."
10835877,"The burden of colorectal cancer (CRC) has been persistently unequal across racial/ethnic groups with mortality
30% higher among non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) compared to non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). Moreover, the disparity
remains after adjustment for important risk factors of CRC survival including tumor subsite, grade, stage at
diagnosis, health insurance, and treatment utilization. The persistence of racial/ethnic CRC disparities despite
attempts to account for variation in healthcare and prognostic indicators has increased focus on the role of
residential environmental factors. The residential social (e.g., residential racial/ethnic segregation, socioeconomic
deprivation) and built environments (e.g., residential walkability, physical disorder) are conceptualized as main
drivers of cancer disparities by race. Several limitations, however, currently prevent robust and translatable results,
including: overreliance on neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation as a marker of exposure; lack of individual
residential histories to estimate time-varying covariates, residential mobility patterns, and ‘health selection’ into
neighborhoods; and underutilization of emerging technologies and cancer registry linkages that could lead to larger
statistical power and novel translational targets. The purpose of this study is to utilize emerging methodologies –
residential history calculation and virtual neighborhood auditing – to investigate longitudinal relationships between
modifiable, residential built environment factors and CRC disparities by race and geography. Residential built
environment exposure histories will be assessed through the combination of separately developed methodologies:
residential history calculation of cancer cases within the New Jersey State Cancer Registry (NJCSR), and large-
scale virtual neighborhood audits of >23,000 Google Street View (GSV) scenes across NJ. CRC case-specific built
environment exposure histories will be constructed based on CRC cases’ residential histories and spatio-temporal
models of built environment assessments repeated at multiple dates between 2009-2023 per a GSV location.
Specific aims are: 1) to construct built environment exposure histories (2009-2023) of residential walkability and
physical disorder for those diagnosed with CRC between 2014-2019 and test relationships between built
environment factors and CRC prognostic factors (microsatellite instability testing, subsite, grade, stage at
diagnosis); 2) to test relationships between time-varying built environment factors and CRC survival; and 3) to test
whether relationships between race/ethnicity and CRC outcomes are mediated by time-varying built environment
exposure factors of walkability and physical disorder. An opportunity exists to build a more complete
characterization of CRC disparities by race and geography through integration of built environment exposure
histories into cancer surveillance. Findings from these novel and rigorous methods will motivate additional registry
linkages and more comprehensive epidemiologic studies, in turn, informing cancer surveillance systems, and public
health interventions."
10835878,"ABSTRACT
Females comprise 41% of annual cases of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Further, when the rate of injury is
compared, female TBI is either the same or higher than males, indicating a unique vulnerability of females. In
addition, rates of both incidence and hospitalization have significantly increased over the past decade in
females and growing numbers are likely attributed to increased participation in combat and collision sports
and military enrollment. Despite the high number of injuries, little has been done to study factors that may
make females more susceptible to injury and the specific constellation of symptoms they experience. This may
be due in part to the prevailing opinion that female reproductive hormones are neuroprotective against TBI.
Pre-clinical work has strongly demonstrated that females have better outcomes following injury, although
when care is taken to properly normalize data, females commonly have the same or worse outcomes than
males. Clinically, studies have shown contradictory results and differences may be due to choice of timepoints
and outcome measures used that do not consider biopsychosocial aspects and gender-based expectations.
While pre-injury levels of reproductive hormones have been of interest, few studies have looked at the role of
sex-hormones post-injury in females. Hormonal dysfunction following TBI is a well-established phenomenon
and likely has a large role in recovery and outcome. Less established is how changes in regulation of these
hormones may influence sex-specific symptomatology including pain and affective disorders. Neuroplasticity,
mood and learning are associated with menstrual-cycle stage and disruptions in hormonal patterns negatively
affect these domains. Pre-clinical work has shown that both stress and sex-hormones are disrupted acutely and
chronically following TBI. Our work shows evidence of perturbed cerebral metabolism and abnormal changes
in affective and nociceptive behaviors. The central premise of this proposal is that female sex-
hormones (1) modulate cerebral metabolism at the time injury, contributing to initial injury
severity and (2) changes in the regulation and production of female sex-hormones are
responsible for sex-specific difference in symptomology post-injury. The current proposed aims will
identify pre- and post-injury variables and mechanisms that make females more susceptible to 1) TBI and 2)
prolonged recovery and differential outcomes compared to males. The research findings from these aims are
critical to understanding sex-based differences to develop sex-specific therapeutic interventions."
10835880,"ABSTRACT
Recent preclinical studies have shown that different subsets of both helper CD4+ T helper (Th) cells and CD8+
T cytotoxic (Tc) cells hold promise for clinical use in adoptive cell therapy (ACT) protocols. Importantly, T
helper cell subsets with the ability to secrete IL-17 (Th17) have been shown to possess stem cell like
phenotype that attributes to their long-term persistence and leads to improved tumor control tumors as
compared to the Th1 subsets (that secrete IFNγ, IL2, TNFα). However, contrary to these observations there
are reports that Tc1 cells exhibit improved tumor control as compared to Tc17 cells. These differences in T cell
subsets response to control tumors is compounded by the fact that in the suppressive tumor microenvironment
a large fraction of tumor reactive T cells acquire FoxP3+ regulatory phenotype, become dysfunctional or
undergo cell death leading to tumor reversion. Thus, ex vivo programming conditions that can render T cells a
stable phenotype, which not only controls primary tumors but also results in the formation of anti-tumor
memory will be of immense importance for ACT. We have recently established that programming conditions
that bring together ‘anti-tumor effector function’ of Th1 cells and ‘stemness’ of Th17 cells lead to a superior
hybrid Th1/17 cells exhibiting long-term tumor control. Importantly, these ex vivo programming conditions also
generate highly effective hybrid Tc1/Tc17 cells and render human tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) with
increased cytokine secreting ability. Importantly, the hybrid T cells exhibited higher levels of nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a cofactor that serves as substrate for Sirtuins and regulates multiple metabolic
and epigenetic molecules. We hypothesize that the robust long-term tumor control was observed with hybrid
Th1/17 cells was mediated by an overall rejuvenated T cell phenotype due to high NAD+ that influenced a
combination of events including post-translational modifications, and epigenetic stability that led to
metabolically fit phenotype. Given the crucial role of NAD+ in a variety of biological processes including energy
metabolism, aging, calcium homeostasis, and epigenome, we propose the following aims to test the above
hypothesis: Aim 1) To determine if metabolic signature and anti-tumor phenotype of the cytokine subsets in
hybrid T1/17 cells could be translated to program tumor infiltrating lymphocytes; Aim 2) To determine if
antibody mediated combinatorial inhibition of CD38 with PD1 antibody leads to robust anti-tumor response in
different preclinical in vivo and xenograft models; and Aim 3) To determine how NAD+ level contributes to
metabolo-epigenetic programming that preserves robust anti-tumor response in T1/17 hybrid and CD38-KO T
cells. We believe that this proposal to determine the central mechanism that results in superior anti-tumor
response by hybrid T1/17 cells will be important to adapt these ex vivo programming conditions for immediate
translational use in adoptive T-cell immunotherapy."

independent interdisciplinary scientists in women’s health and sex differences research and thereby improve
the health of women."
10835906,"Non-coding RNA forms the cell’s machineries for protein synthesis and splicing, and acts during
all stages of gene expression. All RNAs must begin to fold and interact with their protein partners
as they are being synthesized. Improper expression, assembly and localization of non-coding
RNA has been linked to cancer, neurodegeneration and developmental abnormalities. Although
thousands of new non-coding RNAs have been discovered, we know little about how they
physically carry out their functions. The goal of this research program is to define principles of
RNA-protein assembly and dynamics that can predict how large RNA-protein complexes are
formed and how small non-coding RNAs rapidly search out their regulatory targets. These
concepts will be addressed using two model systems: ribosome biosynthesis and post-
transcriptional regulation by bacterial small RNA and Hfq. Ribosomes are an important example
of co-transcriptional assembly because ribosomes are continually synthesized in growing cells
and tightly regulated by growth rate and by stress response pathways. New single molecule
fluorescence and in-cell RNA structure probing approaches will be used to visualize how RNA
folding and protein binding is coupled to transcription. Small non-coding RNAs base pair with
mRNA to control mRNA expression, and are a ubiquitous form of RNA-based regulation. Single
molecule fluorescence, native mass spectrometry and bacterial reporter assays will reveal how
the Hfq RNA chaperone recycles small non-coding RNA in bacteria, and increases the rate at
which these RNAs find their proper targets. The results of this research will lead to new concepts
related to how RNA-protein complexes assemble faithfully during normal growth and why certain
RNAs are vulnerable to mutation, stress, or competition from foreign RNA."
10835907,"This proposal requests continued support for the Research Training Program for Pediatric
Subspecialty Fellows at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and UPMC Children's Hospital of
Pittsburgh (CHP). The major goal of the Research Training Program is to identify, mentor, and foster the
careers of future leaders in pediatric research who are dedicated to improving child health through discovery.
The program offers an intensive research experience for pediatric fellows committed to training in either
laboratory-based or patient-oriented research relevant to child health. The training experience is designed to
prepare fellows for careers as independent, NIH-funded pediatric physician-scientists in the field of their
choice. The Research Training Program facilitates the training of fellows in subspecialties within the
Department of Pediatrics that do not have specialty-dedicated T32 grants (e.g., Cardiology, Gastroenterology,
Genetics, Health Informatics, Hematology and Oncology, Infectious Diseases, Neurology, Newborn Medicine,
and Rheumatology) as well as those in subspecialties that have such programs (e.g., Adolescent Medicine,
Endocrinology, General Academic Pediatrics, Nephrology, and Pulmonology) but are more limited in scope.
Thus, the program maximizes extramural support by targeting the most talented fellows in our large
department and matching them with outstanding mentors in a variety of disciplines. The mentoring faculty
includes 26 outstanding basic, translational, and clinical investigators who have distinguished records of
research contributions and mentoring as well as four junior faculty mentors-in-training. The emphasis of the
mentoring experience is on the fundamentals of scientific inquiry combined with the highest standards of
excellence for rigor and integrity. Each fellow is expected to conduct an innovative research project with the
research team of one of the faculty mentors, leading to publications and applications for individual career
development awards. The Department of Pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine has one
of the fastest growing pediatric research programs in the country and is housed on the CHP campus along with
the new 300,000-square-foot CHP Rangos Research Center. We have appointed 14 fellows to the Research
Training Program at the University of Pittsburgh since its establishment in 2013; 13 will complete training this
year, and one remains in training. The outcomes of the Research Training Program are encouraging for a
program in existence for only five years. Of the 13 program graduates, all are (or will be) employed in full-time
academic positions (nine assistant professors and four instructors). These graduates are supported by
foundation grants and NIH funding, and several are applying for additional NIH awards. These outcomes
provide confidence that the Research Training Program selects talented trainees, provides a superb team of
mentors, and offers an intellectually stimulating environment that inspires fellows in pediatric subspecialties
and provides them with the experience and training to become leaders in child health research."

 This is an application by Mortimer Poncz, MD, for an NHLBI-supported R35 Outstanding Investigator Award
(OIA). Dr. Poncz has made pioneering contributions to the field of platelet (Plt) biology. He isolated and charac-
terized the first cDNAs and genes for the Plt proteins (integrin chains, aIIb and b3, and the chemokines,
platelet factor 4 (PF4) and b-thromboglobulin). He characterized the first molecular defects in an inherited Plt
disorder, Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT). For over 30 years, Dr. Poncz has made insightful contributions to
move the Plt field forward. He helped advance our understanding of megakaryopoiesis, defining many of
the transcriptional factors (TFs) fundamental to that process and their role in inherited Plt disorders. He
pioneered the use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to study megakaryocyte (Meg) biology and
demonstrated the first strategy for genetically correcting the defect in GT and in Paris-Trousseau syndrome.
Dr. Poncz proposes to pursue new insights into the molecular basis of the thrombocytopenia observed in
RUNX1 haploinsufficiency, and how this intervention might decrease the risk of leukemic transformation in
affected patients. This interest in megakaryopoiesis also lead to Dr. Poncz’s contribution to understanding
where Plts are released, showing that infused Megs release Plts in the lungs. The resulting Plts are much
more physiologic than any ex vivo-generated Plts released from in vitro-grown Megs to date. These studies
supported a potential pulmonary site for a portion of thrombopoiesis with subsequent studies by others
providing in situ-support for this model. Dr. Poncz now shows that the lung microcapillary bed is unique in
being able to release Plts. Proposed studies will further our understanding of what makes the pulmonary bed
unique for thrombopoiesis, and such insights may have clinical application in Plt transfusions. Dr. Poncz also
proposed that Plts could store ectopic proteins in a granules, releasing them in a targeted, potent fashion at
sites of vascular injury. He proposes advancing the use of Plt-targeted therapeutics by a novel new
mechanism for loading such proteins into Plts to treat hemophilia A patients with inhibitors with Factor VIII
variants and for use as a thromboprophylaxis agent with urokinase variants. Dr. Poncz has also advanced our
understanding of the molecular basis of prothrombotic heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). His
HIT-like antibody KKO and murine model for HIT are widely used in the field and both were used in his recent
advances in understanding the role of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in HIT. He now proposes that
polyanions like NETs underlie the prothrombotic nature of HIT, and will test this in this R35. Moreover, he
believes that these new insights have implications in the care of other thromboinflammatory diseases where
NETs have an important role, and proposes use of PF4 and Fc-modified KKO in the treatment of sepsis
and sickle cell disease. Support from this R35 OIA mechanism will also provide Dr. Poncz with the time to
pursue his other passion of advancing the career of mentees in areas related to benign hematology."

Molecular basis and function of alternative nuclear architectures in mouse neurons
Every eukaryotic cell must fold its genome within its nucleus. Microscopy and genomic methods have revealed
regular features of how the genome is packaged and organized that are widely shared by mammalian cells. Our
lab seeks to understand cases where cells bend these rules to instead form unusual structures that achieve a
cell-type specific purpose. Our prior work in mouse olfactory sensory neurons exemplifies such a case. Olfactory
sensory neurons reorganize the DNA in their nucleus to that genes that are off are located in the middle of the
nucleus instead of at the periphery. At the same time, these cells bring together olfactory receptor genes from
different chromosomes in 3D space to form specialized gene hubs. These hubs are unique to olfactory sensory
neurons and govern a critical gene regulatory mechanism that defines the identity of these neurons and is central
to our sense of smell. We seek to determine whether such alternative nuclear architectures are rare outliers or
whether they are more widespread than currently known. We hypothesize that alternative architectures may be
particularly common in the nervous system, where long-lived post-mitotic neurons have a long time to rearrange
their DNA, and that they may be critical to understanding how neurons change in response to stimuli. We will
develop new ways of identifying alternative nuclear architectures that will allow us to identify when and where
they form, and we will use primary mouse neurons from the olfactory system and the spinal cord to explore the
function and regulation of these fascinating structures."

Project Summary. Feelings of loneliness in later life are associated with poor health outcomes including loss
of cognitive ability, greater dementia risk, and higher mortality rates. Yet surprisingly little is known about how
loneliness impacts the brain in older adulthood. Feelings of loneliness may arise in response to brain
changes, providing an early signal of insipient brain disease. Loneliness may also be an antecedent or
accelerant, promoting the advance of neuropathological changes and increasing dementia risk. Previous
work from MPIs Spreng and Bzdok has demonstrated that the default network, an assembly of regions
closely overlapping the `social brain', is selectively vulnerable to both loneliness and Alzheimer's disease
(AD). This suggests that loneliness and neuropathological changes may interact to shape the course of brain
aging and progression to AD. However, the specific nature and direction of these interactions is poorly
understood. The goal of the proposal is to investigate the relationship between loneliness and brain
structure and function in typical aging and in individuals at risk for AD. There are two research aims.
Studies in Aim 1 will examine associations between loneliness and normal brain aging in a large population
data sample (UK Biobank). Anticipated outcomes include population-level normative trajectories of brain
aging and estimates of `non-normative' change attributable to the experience of loneliness. Studies in Aim 2
will examine associations between loneliness and brain aging in pre-symptomatic AD in a local longitudinal
cohort of older adults at elevated risk for AD. The anticipated outcome for this Aim is a better understanding
of how longitudinal changes in loneliness interact with longitudinal changes in brain structure and function to
influence pre-symptomatic AD progression. Studies in Aim 1 will use cross-sectional, population
neuroscience methods (probabilistic hierarchical modeling) to derive normative trajectories of brain aging.
These analyses will focus on the default network, drawing upon a high resolution cortical and subcortical
parcellation scheme developed by MPI Bzdok. These normative trajectories will allow measurement of non-
normative deviations attributable to the experience of loneliness in a population of older adults. Studies in
Aim 2 will use longitudinal probabilistic hierarchical analyses to investigate interactions between loneliness
and brain aging in the context of elevated AD risk. Participants will be from a local longitudinal cohort of older
adults at elevated risk for AD. This work will leverage recent efforts by MPI Spreng, to collect cutting edge
neuroimaging and behavioral data that will serve as a baseline for the next wave of data collection proposed
here. This research will advance understanding of how loneliness interacts with brain structure and function
in normal aging and pre-symptomatic AD. Loneliness is a tractable social condition, modifiable through
individual or policy-level interventions. Greater understanding of the relationships between loneliness, brain
aging, and disease may ultimately pave the way for better detection, monitoring, and interventions.

Anti-tumor immunity varies due to interactions between innate and adaptive immune cells, microbial
community diversity, host and microbially derived metabolites, and other local factors that shape tumoricidal
responses. While most of the recent microbiome research focuses on the gut microbiome and cancer
outcomes, extra-intestinal microbial communities are detected in the tumor microenvironment (TME). We
recently reported that specific microbes identified in patient breast tumors compared to pathologically normal
breast samples associated with tumor stage, tumor subtype, and for the first time, race. Triple Negative Breast
Cancer (TNBC), an aggressive subtype that has generally eluded personalized medicine approaches,
contained unique microbes that may mediate immunosuppression and impact standard chemotherapy or
immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) efficacies. Yet to date, mechanisms underpinning these observations are
unresolved as to how the gut and/or extra-intestinal microbiome influence BC onset, progression, and
response to therapies, which is a major knowledge gap in this field. One cogent mechanism that may link
microbes to anti-tumor immunity are microbially modified metabolites, namely bile acids. Certain microbes rich
in 7-alpha-hydroxylase convert primary to secondary bile acids which regulate bile acid composition. Bile acids
have been shown to limit progression and metastasis in other cancers through reversing immunosuppression,
but minimal work has explored the role of bile acids in BC. Bile acids signal through several bile acid receptors
including farnesoid X receptor (FXR). We posit that specific gut or local resident microbes that impact bile acid
pools and composition will interact with cells expressing FXR to regulate the TME immune milieu. We report for
the first time that patients with high FXR expression have greater relapse-free survival uniquely in TNBC
subtype, but not in less aggressive luminal BC subtype, suggesting potential for targeted approaches. The
overall objective of this proposal is to test mechanisms linking MicrobesBile AcidsTNBC which poses an
opportunity to generate novel therapeutics and precision medicine informed by microbial compositions. Our
innovative approach interrogates targetable microbial pathways that we demonstrate change the microbiome,
bile acids, and tumor progression. Our central hypothesis is microbial composition and microbially-modified
metabolic products, such as bile acids, increase immunotherapeutic efficacy through reprogramming the TME
leading to enhanced anti-tumor immunity. We will test our hypothesis by performing the following aims: 1)
Determine if commensal microbes play a physiological role in TNBC anti-tumor immunity; 2) Determine if the
microbiome alters immunosurveillance of early tumor onset and progression; 3) Determine if pharmacologic
bile acid receptor agonism improves TNBC immunotherapy. Findings generated will have high impact because
the lack of targeted therapies for TNBC presents a great unmet clinical need and could be transformative to
improve patient outcomes."

 Hypertensive vascular disease is a leading global risk factor for morbidity and mortality, affecting over 116
million people. It is characterized by alterations to extracellular matrix (ECM) composition, biomechanical
properties, and aberrant molecular signaling leading to increased blood pressure and vessel stiffening. Extensive
work has focused on developing improved pharmacological treatments, tissue engineered blood vessels, and
vascularizing engineered volumetric tissue, but often overlook the interdependence between cellular signaling
and biomechanical forces leading to disease. Understanding the relationship between ECM biomechanics and
receptor signaling, and developing tools to manipulate it, are essential for creating a healthy, mature vascular
tissue while avoiding pathological changes. Here I propose that incorporation of spatially defined ECM
composition and cellular alignment into a vascular-inspired 3D bioprinted tissue scaffold will produce an
engineered small artery that physiologically controls vascular tone and facilitates investigation into how ECM
composition and altered receptor trafficking impair vascular reactivity and promote a hypertensive phenotype. I
will utilize two novel platforms: FRESH 3D bioprinting to directly fabricate perfusable vasculature from ECM
proteins, and a fluorescence-based nanomechanical biosensor (NMBS) for mapping in vivo tissue strain and
vascular smooth muscle contractility to Aim 1: Develop a collagen-based 3D bioprinted vascular microfluidic
platform integrating controlled fluid flow and endothelialization to replicate vascular ECM biomechanics and
endothelial barrier function; Aim 2: Directly pattern ECM structure and cellular organization using FRESH
printing in a layer-by-layer manner to recapitulate resistance artery vascular smooth muscle cell and endothelial
cell function; and Aim 3:Investigate how pathologic changes in the ECM alters receptor trafficking and impairs
vascular reactivity using novel bioinks to replicate a healthy and hypertensive vessel ECM composition and
material properties. This proposal seeks to enhance our knowledge of the interplay between biomechanical
forces biochemical signaling during vascular development and hypertensive disease progression. The
microfluidics (K99) and engineered vascular tissues (R00) created will have wide utility for drug screening and
disease modeling. The career development plan, under the guidance of co-mentors Drs. Feinberg and Kleyman,
and my advisory committee, will provide advanced training in microfluidics, biomechanical analysis, and vascular
biology/disease modeling. The mentored phase capitalizes on an inter-disciplinary mentoring team and
substantial research and professional development resources at Carnegie Mellon University, the University of
Pittsburgh, and the Vascular Medicine Institute. This K99/R00, combined with my prior expertise in 3D
bioprinting, advanced fluorescence microscopy, quantitative image analysis, and cellular/molecular biology, will
facilitate my transition to an independent career focused on how ECM composition and structure alter receptor
signaling to drive tissue maturation and disease progression."

Columbia University, Clene, and Synapticure are partnering and taking an innovative approach to
provide persons living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS (pALS) across all 50 states—
including those in remote/rural areas—access to CNM-Au8®, a well-tolerated neuroprotective
drug being investigated for treatment of ALS. ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease
affecting motor neurons of the brain and spinal cord. Investigations of the mechanism of this
disease have revealed that motor neurons are energetically impaired in ALS. Signs of energetic
impairment in motor neurons precede clinical manifestations, and energetic impairment is key to
the events affecting mitochondrial function, glutamatergic signaling, calcium homeostasis, RNA
processing/function, and proteostasis, leading to neuronal death. CNM-Au8 is an orally
administered suspension of blood-brain barrier penetrant, catalytically active gold nanocrystals
shown to protect neurons from death by raising intracellular levels of energy metabolites,
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and adenosine triphosphate. Preclinical studies using several
independent genetic or chemically induced models of neurodegenerative disease have
demonstrated robust neuroprotective properties across multiple neuronal subtypes. Two Phase 2
randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter trials investigated the safety and
efficacy of CNM-Au8 in ALS. Open label extension (OLE) associated with each of these trials are
ongoing. While both trials failed to meet primary and secondary outcomes, results from both
studies consistently demonstrated benefit on prespecified exploratory endpoints of disease
progression and survival. CNM-Au8 also consistently showed favorable safety and tolerability
profile across all studies, with no serious adverse events related to CNM-Au8 to date. Columbia,
Clene, and Synapticure propose a multicenter, intermediate-size Expanded Access Program for
the continued investigation of CNM-Au8 in 100 pALS. An innovative approach will use up to 10
experienced ALS trial centers across the country that have established relationship with Clene. It
will also enroll via virtual clinic by Synapticure to enable inclusion of patients in all 50 states. The
primary aim of this study is to evaluate safety in a cohort of pALS that are not clinical trial eligible.
Potential effects on survival and on clinical measures of disease progression will be pre-specified
and assessed using multiple independent, validated statistical models that are trained on large
clinical trial and real-world ALS datasets. Biomarkers of disease progression, such as plasma
Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL), UCHL1, and serum creatinine levels will be analyzed to enhance
and corroborate the interpretation of clinical results."

Societal and structural inequities have resulted in longstanding health care disparities among Black, Hispanic,
and low-income preschool-age children with developmental delays and disabilities (PCw/DD) depriving them of
educational and therapeutic services which foster development and improve later academic, economic, and
health outcomes. Studies also indicate when children receive these needed services, their parents benefit with
improvements in mental health, stress, and quality of life. The scientific objectives of this proposal are to 1) test
effective strategies to increase access to ECSE services among PCw/DD from historically marginalized
communities; and 2) characterize potential mechanisms by which such strategies may lead to improved
multilevel health outcomes. Preschool and Me (PreM) is a novel community clinical linkage (CCL) designed for
clinical settings serving historically marginalized communities. Combining key components of CCLs with a
personalized medical-education care plan and remote navigator support, PreM targets different levels of
influence impacting therapeutic access identified in our prior research. In pilot testing, PreM was feasible to
deliver, acceptable to parents, and demonstrated preliminary efficacy on completed ECSE evaluations among
families attending a pediatric clinic serving largely Black and Hispanic families from low-income communities.
Thus, this R01 application proposes to utilize a hybrid effectiveness-implementation approach to test PreM in
two models of real-world service delivery conditions. Participants (n=320) will be randomized to either: 1) 6
months of PreM (intervention group) or 2) a waitlist control arm beginning the intervention after a 6-month
delay. We will follow all participants for 12 months with data collection occurring at 4 timepoints (baseline, 3-,
6- and 12-months). Our specific aims are to test effectiveness of PreM on indicators of ECSE access (primary)
and child-, parent-, family- and health service outcomes (secondary); examine theoretically derived mediators
of intervention effects using a mixed methods approach; and explore social determinants of health as potential
moderators. We will also simultaneously conduct a mixed methods implementation evaluation focusing on
implementation outcomes to serve as indicators for implementation success; measures of implementation
quality; and intermediate outcomes to understand and address successes and failures in relation to clinical
outcomes. The results of this project have the potential to: 1) advance scientific knowledge about how gaps
and delays in educational and therapeutic services impact health outcomes among PCw/DD and their families;
2) identify mechanisms to increase access to ECSE services and address longstanding health care disparities;
and 3) support effective implementation of educational-clinical linkage models within pediatric clinical settings
serving historically marginalized communities which can be utilized to improve health outcomes for families
and their children with a range of health conditions."

Diabetic foot ulcers that lead to amputations are a major health problem affecting ~20% of the 30
million diabetic patients in the US. The current regimen has limited success, and the amputation
rates remain high. Therefore, understanding molecular mechanisms for compounds with
translational potential is a crucial step toward making a breakthrough in wound care protocols.
Endothelial cells (ECs) are indispensable cellular components for wound angiogenesis. However,
EC functions are impaired in patients with diabetes. The coformulation of two dietary compounds
- Trans-resveratrol (tRES) and hesperetin (HESP) - improves glucose metabolic profile and
arterial function in overweight and obese subjects through inducing the gene expression of
glyoxalase 1 (GLO1), an enzyme that detoxifies reactive metabolites during glycolysis and
protects cells against glycation stress. Our pilot data indicated that tRES+HESP improved wound
healing in diabetic animals with an increase in GLO1 expression. However, its effects are likely
far beyond inducing GLO1 expression because tRES+HESP treated ECs produced many pro-
angiogenic factors, including angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT1) that plays an essential role in
angiogenesis. Therefore, it is critical to determine proteins that are regulated by tRES+HESP in
angiogenesis and tissue repair. The objective of this project is to fill the knowledge gap of the role
of tRES+HESP in rescuing the disrupted angiogenesis in diabetes, and our long-term goal is to
develop therapeutic strategies for diabetic wound repair. We hypothesize that tRES+HESP
augments angiogenesis and improves diabetic wound healing through enhancing the expression
of GLO1 and a potent pro-angiogenic factor, ANGPT1, and through novel changes in additional
proteins in pathways critical to diabetic wound repair. We will test this hypothesis by completing
two aims. Aim 1: Identification of molecular pathways and protein changes induced by
tRES+HESP in human dermal microvascular ECs in vitro. Aim 2: Determine the therapeutic
potential of tRES+HESP and its underlying molecular mechanisms in chronic diabetic wounds in
vivo. The outcome of the proposed research will determine the efficacy of topical application of
this formula, tRES+HESP, in diabetic wound healing, and will unveil underlying molecular
mechanisms for its beneficial effect. Since tRES+HESP has not been approved by the FDA to
treat diabetic wound healing yet, these results may facilitate the FDA approval of this
coformulation in diabetic wound treatment."

As one of the most abundant anions in the human body, chloride plays a crucial role in human health. Chloride
homeostasis is maintained inside the cell while the chloride level is varied based on the function of organelles.
Dysregulation of chloride homeostasis caused by the mutation of chloride channels results in various human
diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CFTR, >70,000 people worldwide), proteinuria and kidney stones (ClC-5, 39
million people in US), Osteoporosis (ClC-7, 10 million people in US, 43 million people in the risk group). Although
five FDA-approved chloride channel modulators have been reported, they only target plasma membrane chloride
channels due to the technical barrier. There is no FDA-approved or clinical trial drug that targets organellar
chloride channel. The field of chloride channel-targeted therapy is still under-studied (5 FDA-approved drugs, 2
clinical trial) compared to other channels such as calcium, potassium, and sodium.
 The lack of understanding of the physiological role of organellar chloride and the well-characterized
chloride channel are the biggest roadblocks for the development of chloride channel-targeted therapy.
Therefore, suitable research tools with a high resolving ability to examine the organelle chloride in live
cells is a highly urgent need, which is essential to elucidate the physiological role of organellar chloride
and characterize the chloride channel. However, the current chloride measurement with one-dimensional
analysis only shows the average ion level. It cannot observe the chloride level change in a minor subset of
organelles triggered by the cellular pathway such as STING and autophagy. Furthermore, the typical
fluorescence measurement can only tell the variation of the average chloride level (increase, decrease, and no
significant change) in certain conditions. The current methods significantly hinder the identification of deactivated
cell pathways or protein based on the chloride level measurement.
 The proposed research integrate organelle selective dual reporters, single organelle measurement, sub-
cellular imaging, and the three-dimensional analysis, to fingerprint the chemotype of organelles along with STING
pathway, autophagy, and mitochondrial respiration. Completion of the proposed study will find out the
physiological role of organellar chloride which shed light on the chloride channel-targeted therapy. The
development of the organelle chemotype fingerprinting technique will also provide tools to characterize chloride
channels, evaluate chloride channel modulators and identify the deactivated cell pathways or proteins."

facilitate communications both for internal program key personnel and external advisors. The Administrative
Core will coordinate scientific workshops including the Scientific Advisory Group, hosting research
dissemination meetings with local policy makers and key stakeholders, and one ICEMR workshop as required.
The Administrative Core will have both a US and Uganda component to meet the needs and services for both
cores and three research projects in this program. In the US, UCSF will act as the recipient organization,
overseeing the fiscal management for the multiple institutions' subcontract awards, oversight of the regulatory
compliance for all collaborating institutions, and ensure appropriate communication between the collaborating
institutions, the sponsor, and the regulatory agencies. In Uganda, where a majority of the work will be
performed, program administration will be managed by the Infectious Diseases Research Collaboration (IDRC)
and will oversee the progress and operations of the Center's endemic country operations including fiscal,
human, and resource management, organize and facilitate the scientific meetings and communications, and
support local research activities. The administrative staff in the U.S. and Uganda has a track record of working
together to administer complex projects, including 13 years on the PRISM program to date, and to adapting to
the ever changing fiscal and regulatory requirements of international research. Key accomplishments of this
PRISM Administrative Core since 2010 include: administering subcontracts to multiple US and international
collaborating institutions; hired and maintained over 250 staff in Uganda involving more than 70 field sites;
maintaining Material Transfer Agreements for more than 20 specimen shipments; IRB submissions for
approximately 10 human subjects projects and 2 training projects; organized monthly PRISM all-project calls,
at least annual PRISM team retreats in Kampala, annual in-person or virtual SAG meetings, 4 Ministry of

data collection and management (both within this project and between ICEMRs) to build a Clinical (meta) Data
Integration Platform allowing investigators to rapidly interrogate across clinical parameters, laboratory results,
socioeconomic factors, and entomological findings to generate new hypotheses and identify key samples for
further analysis. The overall goal of this system will be to maximize the scientific potential of data (and
metadata) being collected through the ICEMR network, providing freely and publicly accessible databases to
the larger malaria research community. Data and statistical services will be provided by a well-established and
NIH/OPCRO approved data management center located in Kampala and expert program faculty specializing in
epidemiology and biostatistics. The specific aims of the Data Management and Biostatistics Core will be 1) To
provide sophisticated data acquisition systems and data quality management services to ensure the timeliness,
completeness, accuracy, uniformity, and security of collected clinical and research data. 2) To provide expert
statistical and methodological support for the design, monitoring, and evaluation of research projects. 3) To
implement a comprehensive system for tracking biological samples, for current and future use. 4) To integrate
the diverse datatypes generated by this project, both internally, and with data emerging from other ICEMRs,
ensuring maximal long-term utility for the broader scientific community."

Despite augmented control efforts, the burden of malaria remains high in many African countries, including
Uganda. There is a great need to better target existing and new control interventions in an ever-changing
landscape, but to do so improved surveillance is needed. Indeed, malaria surveillance, which encompasses
monitoring and evaluation of malaria control efforts, is not only critical for the planning, implementation, and
evaluation of control activities, but is considered a core intervention itself. This application is for continued
funding of our PRISM program which has been collecting high quality malaria surveillance data from selected
government-run health facilities around Uganda and from cross-sectional surveys in target areas surrounding
these health facilities in collaboration with the National Malaria Control Division. We hypothesize that, in
contrast to “routine” malaria surveillance that relies largely on aggregate health facility-based data and
infrequent national malaria indicator surveys, our targeted and comprehensive approach will allow for more
timely and accurate estimates of impact to better inform policy decision making. Our specific aims will be as
follows: Aim 1. To conduct enhanced malaria surveillance at selected health facilities across Uganda.
Leveraging an existing health facility-based network, high quality individual level data will be collected
electronically from all outpatients who present to 42 facilities on a continuous basis. These data will be used to
monitor trends in malaria morbidity, assess malaria case management practices, and provide data and
samples for the resistance and molecular epidemiology projects of this program. Aim 2. To perform cross-
sectional household surveys in target areas around each selected health facility. Repeated cross-
sectional surveys will be conducted in randomly selected households from enumerated target areas to collect
data on demographics, coverage levels of malaria control interventions, health seeking behavior, laboratory
assessments, and entomological indicators, and samples from representative community members. These
data and samples will be used to monitor community level trends in coverage and utilization of malaria control
interventions and measures of endemicity, enabling studies of the resistance and molecular epidemiology
projects. Aim 3. To assess the impact of population level malaria control interventions. Working with the
Uganda NMCD and other implementing partners, we will design a series of studies to quantify the impact of
existing and new malaria control interventions including LLINs, IRS, SMC and RTS,S. Study designs will be
pragmatic and include the completion of an on-going cluster randomized trial studying LLINs, and quasi-
experimental and “before and after” studies. These studies will utilize data from the health facility and
community-based surveillance network described above to provide an efficient means of generating outcome
data on key malaria indicators, including disease incidence, infection prevalence, and vector density."
10836946,"Summary
 Among our best tools for the control of malaria are effective drugs and insecticides used for treatment and
prevention of the disease. However, the value of these tools is limited by drug resistance in malaria parasites
and insecticide resistance in anopheline mosquitoes. Alarmingly, partial resistance to artemisinins (ART-R), the
backbone of treatment regimens, has emerged in Uganda, as demonstrated by our group. Susceptibility to key
artemisinin partner drugs is also in jeopardy, threatening efficacy of artemisinin-based combination therapies to
treat malaria. ART-R also decreases activity against early gametocytes and is associated with increased
production of transmissible gametocytes. Resistance to multiple classes of insecticides similarly puts vector
control strategies at risk, and suboptimal performance of vector control interventions has been demonstrated in
Uganda. We already have an understanding of mediators of antimalarial and insecticide resistance. For
antimalarials, polymorphisms in drug transporters and folate enzymes are associated with resistance to key
components of treatment and chemoprevention regimens, and specific mutations in PfK13 are primary
mediators of ART-R. For insecticides, point mutations in insecticide target-sites and altered activity of
detoxification enzymes are associated with resistance to pyrethroid, carbamate, organophosphate, and
neonicotinoid insecticides. Markers for these polymorphisms are valuable tools for the longitudinal surveillance
of drug and insecticide resistance in Uganda. This project will leverage the large PRISM surveillance network
and utilize deep sequencing strategies to conduct broad surveys of the prevalence of known resistance
markers across Uganda. In addition, we will search for associations between resistance markers and both
utilization of specific control interventions and longitudinal measures of malaria metrics. Lastly, we will
characterize impacts of resistance on malaria transmission. We hypothesize that malaria treatment and control
in Uganda will be challenged by increasing resistance in malaria parasites and anopheline vectors, that the
rate of resistance development will vary depending on the extent of implementation of control measures and
level of malaria transmission, and that resistance will impact on both human malaria and ongoing transmission.
We will test these hypotheses with serial surveys for parasite and mosquito resistance mediators at sites with
varied malaria control interventions and transmission intensity and with specific studies of transmission to
mosquitoes. Our specific aims will be 1) to characterize antimalarial drug resistance by serial surveillance at
diverse sites with varied implementation of control measures across Uganda, 2) to characterize anopheline
insecticide resistance by serial surveillance at diverse sites with varied implementation of control measures
across Uganda, and 3) to characterize impacts of antimalarial drug resistance on malaria transmission. The
results of this study will add important insights regarding drivers of drug and insecticide resistance and be of
value to policy-makers working to best control malaria in Uganda."
10836947,"Abstract
Accurately targeting and measuring the impact of malaria control interventions is challenging. It is difficult and
expensive to measure impact accurately with traditional surveillance metrics such as parasite prevalence.
More complex assessments, such as the impact of importation on local transmission, can be even more
difficult to estimate. Finally, additional information that may be relevant to guide policy is not routinely collected,
such as whether the parasite population shows signs of immune evasion in the setting of widespread vaccine
rollout or whether commonly used rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) continue to be appropriate to diagnose
malaria. These gaps may be mitigated effectively with the integration of molecular tools into routine
surveillance. Malaria molecular surveillance can evaluate parasite DNA and/or human antibodies present in
easily collected biological samples. However, these molecular data are underutilized because there is limited
evidence systematically linking molecular metrics to disease burden. We will generate molecular data in
conjunction with high-quality incidence data from 42 sites across Uganda and yearly prevalence data from
cross-sectional surveys. We will use these data to identify a parsimonious set of metrics to estimate disease
burden and characterize transmission. We will also generate data on the presence of HRP2/3 deletions in P.
falciparum and prevalence of non-falciparum malaria species, which impact whether currently used HRP2-
based diagnostics are appropriate. Leveraging samples and data generated in the other components of this
ICEMR project, we will simultaneously generate molecular metrics for multiple aims using a multiplex amplicon
panel to genotype parasite infections, and use a multiplexed serologic assay to evaluate IgG responses to
multiple P. falciparum antigens. We will analyze these data to achieve the following aims in the setting of
ongoing, varied malaria control interventions: 1) to characterize changes in the host antibody response and
parasite genetics in response to varied malaria control interventions. We hypothesize that molecular metrics
will provide more accurate estimates of changes in disease burden than changes in parasite prevalence and
that the selective pressure of the RTS,S vaccine and other immunologic interventions will result in an increase
in the proportion of P. falciparum with vaccine-unmatched CSP haplotypes; 2) to evaluate whether the current
diagnostic strategy in Uganda is appropriate by surveilling for HRP2/3 deletion and non-falciparum malaria
parasite infections. We hypothesize that the emergence of HRP2/3 deletions will increase over time and first
occur in northern Uganda, due to spread of parasites from the Horn of Africa, and that the proportion of malaria
infections that contain non-falciparum species will be higher in areas of low or declining transmission compared
to areas of high or stable transmission; and 3) to evaluate the contribution of importation to local transmission
in areas of Uganda approaching elimination using parasite genomic and epidemiological data. We hypothesize
that transmission in these areas is sustained by importation of parasites from higher transmission areas."

This proposal details proposed activities by the Midwest Center of Excellence for Vector-Borne Diseases
(MCE-VBD) in response to the CDC Funding Opportunity RFA-CK-22-005. The MCE-VBD includes
accomplished and enthusiastic partners from academic, public health, and vector control institutions in
Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, and Iowa. Across the region, climate change impacts on
vector-borne disease are expected as a result of 1) increased temperatures that can promote vector population
growth and affect phenological activity patterns, 2) changes in annual snow cover depth and occurrence which
impacts overwintering success of ticks and introduced mosquito species, and 3) extreme weather, with more
frequent heavy rainfall and periods of drought affecting mosquito and arbovirus outbreaks, especially in large
urban areas. The broad and long-term goal of the Center is to incentivize new and expanded interactions
between experts in the region so that responses to endemic and epidemic vector borne disease are improved
and accelerated. To achieve this goal, the project is focused on three major objectives: 1) Research to improve
prevention of human exposure to vector bites. For this aim, we will evaluate current methods of control for
mosquitoes and ticks and will develop new tools to reduce human risks of exposure. Data from research
projects will feed back into outreach and education products for use with PH, tax-funded mosquito control
districts, private pest control operators, and citizens as partners. 2) Increase the opportunities for training in
public health entomology (PHE) for students. This objective will be achieved through graduate student training
in PHE and through administration of a Certificate of PHE, with a curriculum including instruction on vector
identification, surveillance and control methods, and pesticide application licensure. We will also offer a
fellowship program which will provide paid internships in PHE and have established partnerships to enhance
recruitment of students from underrepresented backgrounds. 3) Build a community of practice including public
health and mosquito control experts at the county and district/municipal level, state public health experts,
professional pest control companies, and academic scientists at research institutions. This goal will be
achieved by evaluating region-specific public health educational efforts and interacting to establish best
practices for VBD management. Successful completion of these objectives will dramatically expand the
ability of public health authorities in the Midwest to detect and respond to threats as well as provide a
strongly supported evidence-based practice for management of vector-borne disease."
10837081,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Psychopathology is a very serious public health burden that not only affects adults, but also many children and
adolescents. To better understand this devastating problem, the scientific community has focused its efforts on
pinpointing the earliest developmental origins of psychopathology. A considerable literature now implicates
prenatal stress as a critical determinant of poor psychological functioning in childhood and beyond. However,
knowledge about whether the timing of prenatal stress differentially influences the development of child
psychopathology is virtually unknown. Gaining such knowledge is the long-term goal of our research. This
proposed project “piggybacks” on our current RO1-funded project (NICHD grant # R01HD085990) that is
following a cohort of 335 women oversampled for life stress, with data collection starting at pregnancy week 15
until 6 months postpartum. We are conducting a granular assessment of pregnancy stress (measured weekly
by maternal report) with the goal of understanding critical periods during fetal life when stress derails later
infant behavioral and physiological stress responsivity. The overall objective of this new RO1 project is
to follow this cohort into the child's preschool years. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will determine how the differential
timing of prenatal stress influences behavior problems and psychopathology measured at age 4, how
differences in self-regulation (an important precursor of mental health functioning) mediates the relationship
between prenatal stress and psychopathology at age 4, and how these relationships differ between boys and
girls. Aim 2 will test a host of postnatal risk factors (e.g., poor maternal mental health, poverty, intimate partner
violence) and resilience factors (e.g., sensitive parenting, coping skills) as moderators of the effects of timing of
prenatal stress on behavior problems and psychopathology at age 4. Importantly and uniquely, postnatal stress
(mother and child) is assessed also in a fine-grained manner by every 3 month assessments from age 6 mos
to 4 years. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use an exploratory statistical approach, machine learning, to detect which
relatively small epochs of stress in postnatal life (measured every 3 months) interact with small epochs of
prenatal stress to maximally influence child behavior problems and psychopathology. This project is
innovative in its highly multimethod approach (e.g., behavioral observation, salivary analytes, laboratory
tasks), its granular assessment of chronic and episodic prenatal and postnatal stressors, and the novel
statistical approaches used to determine which epochs of stress are most relevant for psychopathology. This
highly significant research will be the first longitudinal, prospective, multi-method study of how differential
timing of prenatal stress influences the development of psychopathology, as mediated by child self-regulation
and moderated by postnatal environmental factors. Thus, this study is critical for understanding how early child
development sets the stage for psychopathology and will lead to increased understanding of the
developmental epochs to be targeted for preventative interventions."

Coinfection with HBV and HIV-1 is common, and HIV coinfection can exacerbate progression of viral hepatitis and
accelerate liver disease progression. In fact, endstage liver diseases, including fiboris/cirrhosis and hepatocellular
carcinoma, have become the most common causes of death in people living with HIV (PWH) worldwide. HIV
infection cannot be cured currently but can be efficiently suppressed with highly active or combination anti-retroviral
therapy (HAART or cART). Currently available HBV drugs can suppress viral replication, but only a small subset of
patients are cured by these treatments. Although a prophylactic vaccine is available for HBV, it has no therapeutic
benefit. Consequently, new therapeutic approaches are urgently needed to combat chronic HBV infection,
particularly in the context of HIV coinfection. Here, we will capitalize on several technical and conceptual
breakthroughs from our lab to establish proof-of-concept for interfering with persistent HBV infection virologically.
We have recently made important discoveries that provide a strong foundation for the major direction of this
proposal. The Ploss lab identified key components of the DNA lagging strand synthesis machinery that are
necessary and sufficient for formation of HBV cccDNA, the replication intermediate crucial for viral persistence.
Clinical data from HBV patients indicate that cccDNA turnover occurs relatively rapidly (several months), offering a
possibility of curing HBV with finite therapy by completely blocking cccDNA replenishment. Thus, we aim to
determine whether liver-specific transient genetic disruption of polymerases and other co-factors in vivo can
abrogate HBV infection (Aim 1). Since we recently demonstrated that HBV cccDNA formation is supported in mouse
hepatocytes, we can take advantage of the power of mouse genetics to rigorously test our hypothesis that genetic
distruption of host factors involved in cccDNA formation can abrogate HBV infection. Furthermore, we will extend
our analysis to blocking HBV chronicity in the context of an underlying HIV coinfection (Aim 2). To achieve this
goal, we will take advantage of a novel humanized mouse model co-engrafted with HLA-matched human
hepatocytes and components of a human hematolymphoid system. Our preliminary data demonstrate that such
dually engrafted mice support chronic infections with both HBV and HIV and can mount antigen-specific T cell
responses. This humanized mouse model provides unprecedented opportunities for studying the complex interplay
of HBV/HIV co-infections and will be deployed here to test rigorously whether blocking HBV cccDNA formation can
abrogate HBV persistence.
We will capitalize on our extensive complementary expertises in virology and immunology of HIV-1/HBV (Su),
hepatitis viruses (Ploss) and humanized mouse technology to achieve these exciting aims. Our work will advance
the field of HBV and HIV-1 research by showing that a novel small animal model can be successfully used to
understand HIV/HBV coinfection and immune responses and to model treatments for the associated liver disease."

Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLC) is a rare and often lethal form of liver cancer that primarily affects
children and young adults without cirrhosis. There are no approved systemic therapies for FLC, and it is usually
refractory to treatment approaches developed for other forms of liver cancer. A chimeric transcript between
DNAJB1 and PRKACA was identified as a signature genomic event in FLC and leads to constitutive activation
of PKAc, but pharmacological inhibition of PKAc for FLC with traditional small molecule inhibitors has been
infeasible due to on-target toxicity. Prior work from our group and others has demonstrated that neoantigens
derived from gene fusions, including the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion in FLC, can stimulate strong T cell responses.
Furthermore, all patients with FLC share an identical amino acid sequence at the fusion junction, allowing a
single “off the shelf” neoantigen-specific vaccine to be utilized nearly universally for this cancer. Neoantigen-
specific vaccines are most effective in combination with other immunomodulatory agents including ICIs to
prevent T cell exhaustion. Our overall hypothesis is that a neoantigen-specific vaccine targeting the DNAJB1-
PRKACA chimera will synergize with ICIs to elicit a specific antitumor immune response in FLC. We will conduct
a clinical trial of a vaccine targeting the DNAJB1-PRKACA chimera (FLC-Vac), in combination with nivolumab
and ipilimumab, in patients with unresectable FLC. We will further determine if FLC-Vac combined with ICIs
increases the number of neoepitope-specific T cells with specificity for the DNAJB1-PRKACA chimera in the
peripheral blood that traffic to the tumor. Multiplex immunohistochemistry (IHC) on paired pretreatment and on-
treatment biopsies will further define the mechanisms of immune response and resistance to immunotherapy in
FLC. We will use these samples to identify T cell receptors (TCRs) specific for the FLC fusion protein in the
context of the patient's HLA. Using TCRs from our trial and from endogenous responses identified in untreated
specimens, we will use humanized mouse orthotopic models to determine the relative efficiency of processing
and presenting specific epitopes from the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion in diverse MHC contexts. These models will
involve the endogenous presentation of the FLC fusion within tumor lines that we will treat with primary cells
transduced with our identified TCRs, allowing us to compare the targeting efficiency of TCRs specific for the
corresponding fusion epitopes. This work may advance a novel treatment paradigm for FLC, a tumor for which
there is no standard or effective systemic therapy, and will have important implications for targeting recurrent
”undruggable” driver genes in other immune-resistant tumor types. Identifying optimal peptide-HLA-TCR
combinations for targeting the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion will also lay the groundwork for the next generation
clinical trials for FLC, including adoptive cell therapies with specificity for the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion."

impairment is increasingly important for the timely implementation of interventions and safety initiatives. This
may be particularly important in individuals found to have high brain amyloid burden, putting them at particular
risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) of the brain. Performance changes in challenging,
complex, high-stakes daily activities, such as driving, and accompanying physiological responses may together
provide an inexpensive avenue for early detection. This may serve the dual purpose of alerting individuals or
health care providers to early cognitive impairment, as well as to potential safety issues. Sophisticated in-car
technology that is increasingly becoming standard in new vehicles may provide the means to unobtrusively
capture sensitive information about naturalistic driving behaviors and potentially assist with early detection of
cognitive impairment. The proposed study will apply a novel approach to unobtrusively monitor older drivers in
(a) naturalistic, (b) fixed course, and (c) simulator driving situations. Machine learning approaches will be used
to select key features of driving behaviors and physiological measures of arousal in all driving scenarios and
eye tracking measures from fixed and simulator drives to predict drivers’ clinical diagnosis: young adult drivers,
healthy older drivers with and without high amyloid burden, and drivers with mild cognitive impairment with
evident amyloid burden. The participants will be followed longitudinally in the Michigan Alzheimer’s Disease
Research Center (MADRC) with annual cognitive and neurological evaluations, as well as repeat driving and
physiological testing at two years from baseline. Understanding and identifying changes in driving behaviors

Cigarette smoke is a major source of reactive oxidants, including free radicals and aldehydes, which are playing
critical roles in the development and progression of most tobacco-caused diseases including lung cancer. With
the rapidly growing popularity of electronic cigarettes (EC), there is growing concern about potential harm
associated with their use. Using state-of-the-art high resolution analytical methods to detect and measure
oxidants, we have demonstrated that EC aerosols contain significant levels of highly reactive free radicals and
aldehydes. While these oxidants were detected in all types of EC tested, their levels varied substantially by EC
product design, flavor additives, and usage behaviors. Based on these studies and the known importance of
oxidative stress/damage and inflammation in lung carcinogenesis, our proposal focuses on the potential impact
of EC-derived free radicals and aldehydes in mechanisms involved in lung cancer development. Specifically,
we hypothesize that exposure to oxidants from EC use will lead to oxidative stress/damage and inflammation in
the lung resulting in increased susceptibility to cancer. We will utilize a translational approach to test this
hypothesis by first, in the laboratory, identifying the chemical identity and potential for harm for the major free
radicals produced by EC (Aim 1), secondly conducting controlled exposure studies in a relevant mouse model
on the impact of EC-aerosols on specific lung cancer-related endpoints and lung tumor development (Aim 2),
and thirdly, conduct secondary analyses of samples generated from an NIDA-funded EC clinical trial to examine
the impact of long-term switching from conventional cigarettes to ECs on relevant oxidative stress/damage and
inflammatory biomarkers (Aim 3). In Aim 1, we utilize advanced electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
spectroscopy techniques and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methodologies to
identify major radical species in representative EC devices (including the NIDA developed standardized EC,
SREC). Aim 2 will consist of multiple short-term exposure studies in the A/J mouse, both in naïve animals and
those pre-exposed to cigarette smoke, and will also test the specific impact of flavorants, radicals and aldehydes
on systemic and tissue specific biomarkers of oxidative stress/damage, inflammation and lung-cancer related
pathways. Additionally, we will determine and compare the impact of EC aerosol and cigarette smoke exposure
on lung tumorigenesis in an NNK-induced A/J mouse model. In Aim 3, the impact of switching from conventional
cigarettes to EC on biomarkers of oxidative stress/damage and inflammation in healthy adult smokers will be
determined. Our research approach is innovative based upon its novel focus on EC-derived free radicals, use of
innovative methods and biomarkers, and its integrative translational design. With the completion of these studies,
we hope to provide much needed information regarding the potential lung-cancer related harm associated with
free radical and oxidant exposure from tobacco products which can be used for the development of regulatory
policies aimed at EC products/usage."

Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) continue to experience disproportionate burdens of HIV compared
to other MSM subgroups in the US. This disparity is exacerbated by the multilevel intersectional stigmas that
BMSM face, including those based on race, same-sex attraction/behavior, and presumed HIV-positive status,
which results in high levels of psychological distress and poor HIV prevention outcomes. Resilience is a critical
component in studies to mitigate the negative impact of multilevel intersectional stigmas on HIV prevention
uptake among BMSM. However, existing resilience measures are designed for non-marginalized populations
and are inadequate for assessing BMSM's resilience to multilevel intersectional stigmas. To address this gap,
we propose to develop a novel, BMSM-specific, multidimensional stigma-resilience scale that captures the
nuanced resiliency mechanisms countering intersectional stigmas across multiple socioecological levels. The
proposed study will be conducted in Nashville, an HIV hotspot in the Southern US, where growing HIV burdens
and intersectional stigmas among BMSM have been identified. The study has two specific aims. In Aim 1, we
will define the mechanisms of multidimensional resilience that BMSM use to counter intersectional stigmas. We
will conduct in-depth interviews with 30 HIV-negative BMSM in Nashville, guided by a conceptual framework that
integrates the Socioecological Model, Resilience Theory, and Intersectionality Framework. We will explore how
resilience is developed, manifested, and implemented to overcome intersecting forms (e.g., internalized, enacted,
experienced, and anticipated) and types (e.g., stigma against racism, homosexuality, and presumed HIV status)
of stigmas across multiple socioecological levels (e.g., individual, interpersonal, community and healthcare). Aim
2 will necessitate an iterative and systematic BMSM community engagement process to develop and validate a
new multidimensional stigma-resilience measure tailored for BMSM. Insights from Aim 1 will help inform the
adaptation of an existing scale (e.g., Multilevel Resilience Measure for Black Adults Living with HIV) to be
contextually appropriate and stigma-focused for BMSM. We will then assess face validity and cultural relevancy
through cognitive interviews with 10 BMSM, followed by conducting psychometric analyses with 250 BMSM to
test the new scale's reliability (e.g., internal consistency) and validity (e.g., convergent, divergent, and predictive
validity). The proposed study is significant in providing a robust, culturally-tailored stigma-resilience measure,
which will inform our future R34/R01 study to develop and evaluate a multilevel resilience-based intervention to
mitigate intersectional stigmas and HIV prevention uptake among BMSM. Additionally, the new BMSM
Multidimensional Stigma-Resilience Scale will provide the groundwork for future studies to refine and adapt the
scale for resilience-focused research conducted with other marginalized populations (e.g., Latino/Hispanic MSM;
transwomen of color)."

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that approximately 1.3 billion people globally are at risk for
cholera, a severe diarrheal disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae that is spread through contaminated
water sources and substantial secondary person-to-person transmission. In 2022, the world saw a surge in the
number of cholera cases and associated deaths. Over 29 countries reported outbreaks with the highest recorded
global case fatality ratio of 1.9% (2.9% in Africa) in over a decade. Of note, 13 of these countries did not report
cases in 2021 and had not seen cases between 3 and 30 years, severely disrupting the disease elimination
goals of the WHO Global Taskforce for Cholera Control. Current prevention methods, such as the oral cholera
vaccine (OCV) and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) campaigns, require significant investment of
resources and time for efficacy, but household contacts of cholera patients often present with cholera symptoms
two to three days after the initial patient becomes sick. In addition, the preventive use of antibiotics is not
recommended due to widespread resistance for cholera and other pathogens in the same environment. There
is a pressing need to develop a targeted clinical intervention to prevent the community spread of cholera using
a fast-acting prophylactic treatment. PhagePro aims to fill this gap with its product ProphaLytic-VcTM (PVC). PVC
is an orally administered bacteriophage (phage) cocktail comprised of Vibriophages ICP1, ICP2, and ICP3.
In this R34 clinical trial planning proposal, we aim to partner with cholera physicians and researchers at the
International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) to plan for the first-in-human Phase
I/II trial for PVC to demonstrate safety and efficacy in household contacts of cholera patients. Phase I will test
once or twice daily oral doses of PVC, self-administered, for 7 days. Each arm will have 10 healthy adult
volunteers. After safety has been assessed, Phase II will commence with household contacts of cholera patients
with daily doses of either a placebo or PVC for 7 days. Each arm will have ~224 volunteers. We hypothesize
there will be at least a 43% reduction in cholera incidence among household contacts. To successfully implement
this trial, we will perform the following activities during the R34 grant.
First, we will develop clinical trial documentation such as the Clinical Protocol, Manual of Procedures,
Investigator’s Brochure, site management documents, data management plans, and tracking/monitoring
documents. In addition, we will recruit needed expertise such as biostatisticians, clinical operations associates,
quality control/assurance specialists, and Clinical Research Organizations to support these activities. Second,
we will develop a regulatory plan for administration of PVC in Bangladeshi volunteers, which involves submitting
materials to the icddr,b Institutional Review Board, Ethics Review Committee, Bangladeshi Medical Research
Council, and Directorate General of Drug Administration. To ensure timely success, PhagePro will be using
project management strategies for successful completion of deliverables.
At the successful conclusion of the R34 grant, we will have established all the necessary documentation and
submitted the relevant materials to Bangladeshi regulatory authorities for successful approval of the Phase I/II
clinical trial for PVC."

As a field, Environmental Health Science (EHS) spans a diverse set of disciplines and subdomains that
evaluate environmental fate and transport, human exposures, dosimetry, biochemical interactions, biological
effects, and adverse health outcomes. Although each of these research areas provides insight into the
impacts of chemicals that are in the environment, integration across these areas is needed to improve
interoperability across the source to outcome continuum (S2O). The S2O tracks chemicals from their release
into the environment to determine human exposure levels and then uses knowledge of toxicity mechanisms
to predict potential adverse outcomes resulting from these exposures. This project will build more-precise
semantic descriptions of physical and biological processes that make up the S2O to facilitate communication
among humans and computer models across EHS subdomains and support for public health decisions.
To accomplish this goal, we will engage data generators, computational modelers, public health decision
makers, and developers of data and metadata standards and terminologies (S&T). Based on the input from
these communities, we will expand S&T to better distinguish biomarker measurements from the biological
events those biomarkers represent and to better link environmental exposures to upstream chemical sources
and to downstream adverse outcomes. These efforts will be guided by a functional workflow that implements
the S&T improvements and tests their impact on human health outcome predictions. The resulting S&T
enhancements will provide long-term benefits to the EHS community by enabling analyses that span the
S2O, thereby improving our understanding of environmental impacts on human health.
In Aim 1, we will engage the EHS community to define the S&T requirements for data exchange between
neighboring subdomains. This aim will include the identification of opportunities and needs for S&T through a
series of workgroup meetings held with scientific domain experts, stakeholders, and S&T developers.
Aim 2 will focus directly on the expansion of S&T to better describe exposure and biological processes. The
Biolink Model, which currently underpins projects such as the NCATS Biomedical Data Translator, will be
used to integrate S&T across the S2O. S&T expansion in this aim will be guided by our community
engagement activities.
Aim 3 will develop a functional workflow for S2O analyses that will (1) identify gaps in existing S&T to guide
community engagement and S&T development, (2) provide a test system to evaluate the impacts of S&T
improvements, and (3) demonstrate how more precise language across EHS subdomains can enable
analyses that better inform public health decisions."

PRINCIPAL PROJECT: Molecular and cellular mechanisms of chronicity in autoimmune
endocrinopathies
Autoimmune endocrinopathies are chronic diseases, in which patients suffer permanent tissue damage and
require lifelong hormone replacement. In Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), for example, autoimmune destruction of insulin-
producing beta cells does not remit, and patients require long-term exogenous insulin administration. Exogenous
insulin regimens do not entirely mimic the exquisite control of physiologic hormone secretion, however, and often
leaves patients with sub-optimal glucose control. Unlike most other autoimmune conditions, autoimmune
endocrinopathies are not currently treated with immunotherapies first-line, despite overwhelming evidence for
their autoimmune cause. Here, we will test the hypothesis that chronicity in human autoimmune endocrinopathies
is driven by epigenetic and molecular mechanisms that promote progenitor self-renewal and conversion to
pathogenic effectors. In Aim 1, we will determine the role of the epigenetic regulator UTX in promoting progenitor
to effector conversion. Our preliminary data in mouse models identified a role for UTX in mouse CD8+ T cell
progenitor to effector conversion, and we will determine whether parallel pathways exist to regulate human CD8+
T cell progenitor to effector conversion. In Aim 2, we will identify epigenetic and molecular factors important in
stem-like progenitor self-renewal. Identifying immune mechanisms that underlie chronicity in autoimmune
endocrinopathies will lead to new therapeutic approaches for terminating the long-term autoimmune response.
In both Aims, we will test the effects of small molecule inhibitors and biologic antagonists that target pathways

10844350,"Objectives. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequently co-occur,
and having one condition worsens the course of the other. Individuals with both disorders exhibit worse
functioning across a number of domains than individuals with either disorder alone. Prolonged exposure
therapy (PE) is among the most effective treatments for PTSD. PE has been rated as a frontline treatment by
multiple guidelines and reviews including the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines for the treatment of PTSD.
However, in studies of individuals with PTSD and AUD, changes in alcohol use are only slightly better than in
control or standard care conditions, reductions in PTSD symptoms are modest relative to studies of PE in
PTSD patients without AUD, and rates of drop out from treatment are high. Combining PE with medication to
curb drinking shows promise to improve upon the effectiveness of PE for individuals with comorbid AUD and
PTSD, although thus far few studies have examined combining psychotherapy and medication. Topiramate is
the single medication that has shown effectiveness for both AUD and PTSD and shows promise for reducing
drinking among individuals with AUD and PTSD. However, the effect of adding topiramate to PE to treat
comorbid AUD/PTSD has yet to be examined. The critical next step is to test a best practice PTSD treatment,
PE, together with a promising pharmacological agent, topiramate, which has been found to be effective for
both AUD and PTSD. Innovation: This application seeks to shift current clinical practice paradigms. A
refinement to existing interventions is proposed through integration of two evidence based treatments.
 Methodology. We propose to use a randomized, controlled, double blind study design to examine the
effect of adding topiramate (TOP) to a best practice treatment for PTSD, PE. Participants will be 120 male and
female Veterans from all services with AUD and PTSD. Our primary aims are to determine the relative efficacy
of PE+topiramate, as compared to PE+placebo, in reducing problematic drinking, reducing PTSD symptoms,
and improving functioning and quality of life among Veterans with comorbid AUD/PTSD at post-treatment and
3- and 6-month post-treatment follow-up. We will explore the extent to which decreases in drinking and PTSD
symptoms lead to improvement in functioning.
 The proposed study has the potential to improve functional and psychological recovery for a highly
prevalent and highly impaired population of Veterans. This study will test a novel and innovative combination of
psychotherapy and medication with the goal of improving the care of Veterans. The successful completion of
this project will help change the practices that drive treatment for Veterans who have both AUD and PTSD.
The fundamental rationale for this study is to improve the evidence base that informs how patients with AUD
and PTSD can attain sustained recovery from both of these disorders. We will also explore whether changes
in PTSD symptoms in the PE+TOP condition are partially explained by reductions in alcohol cravings.

 Chemical genetic approaches are powerfully enabling for biological discovery and therapeutics
development. The identification of mutant alleles that enhance or suppress the activity of chemical probes may
not only validate on-target mechanism but also drive deeper understanding of a small molecule’s binding
interactions, molecular mechanism of action, and downstream biological effects. Recent breakthroughs in
genome editing technologies enable the systematic mutation of endogenous proteins at scale and directly in
cells, opening new research paradigms for chemical genetic approaches. Exploiting these new technologies, our
prior work helped pioneer the development of in situ CRISPR-mutational scanning approaches to systematically
profile protein target(s) sequence-function relationships in their native cellular environment. When leveraged with
chemical biology, these mutations in the target can be exploited as discovery tools to study small molecule
mechanism of action and target biology, allowing us to uncover mechanisms of allosteric regulation, cell
signaling, and cancer vulnerabilities. This chemical genomics platform allows us to unlock the serendipitous
discoveries that both chemical probes and cutting-edge genetic screens can afford. To push the boundaries of
chemical genomics, these approaches and their associated tools will need to be innovated, expanded, and tested
in biologically meaningful systems and contexts that address key questions in the field. Hence, this proposal
aims to significantly broaden the scope and utility of in situ CRISPR-mutational scanning in the context of
highlighting its potential to transform many facets of chemical biology: to (1) interrogate drug-target structure-
function in primary cells, (2) integrate massively parallel single-cell multi-omic readouts of mutant phenotypes,
and (3) illuminate the function, mechanisms, and biology of protein disordered regions as well as (4) multi-subunit
protein complexes. We focus our future studies on (1) androgen receptor, a critical cancer gene, where
integrating high-throughput, direct readouts of transcription factor function will be transformative, and (2)
components involved in targeted protein degradation, where holistically interrogating the ubiquitin-proteasome
system at scale is essential for understanding the whole pathway. Across these aims, the biology and
mechanisms of various protein complexes will be deeply explored by leveraging mutant alleles with cell,
molecular, computational, and structural biology. Altogether, accomplishment of these objectives will advance
research paradigms for chemical genomics and will further illuminate fundamental mechanisms of small
molecule action and protein complex function."
10842709,"Abstract
Interactions of proteins with other biomolecules regulate fundamental cellular events and misregulation of these
interactions leads to disease states. Proteins often utilize small folded domains for recognition of other
biomolecules. The basic hypothesis guiding our research is that by mimicking these folded domains we can
specifically inhibit chosen protein complex formation with rationally designed synthetic molecules. Based on this
hypothesis, we have developed a suite of Protein Domain Mimics (PDMs) that faithfully reproduce binding
epitopes on protein surfaces. This work has created a foundation for the development of a new class of
structure–based therapeutics. Equipped with our platform of PDMs, we will focus on a currently intractable
class of targets in IDPs or Intrinsically Disordered Proteins. Therapeutic targeting of intrinsically disordered
proteins is attractive because they interact with a multitude of partners and influence numerous signaling
pathways. However, targeting of IDPs remains underexplored. We hypothesize that we can engage cellular IDPs
with biomolecular receptors and scavenge them away from their natural binding partners. This strategy would
constitute a distinct mechanism for targeting of IDP-mediated protein-protein interactions. In a new direction for
the group, we will develop encodable ligands to sequence-specifically target double-stranded RNA, the most
abundant class of cellular RNA. dsRNA has proven to be recalcitrant to therapeutic intervention; although, it is
central to many biological events. In preliminary results, we have discovered a new class of molecular scaffold
that can be engineered to provide sequence-specific recognition of dsRNA. Studies in each Aim will advance
general approaches to inhibit protein-protein and protein-RNA complexes, and establish PDMs as distinct
constructs spanning the molecular size space between small molecules and proteins."
10842760,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term mission of my lab is to accurately model the effects of DNA sequence differences between indi-
viduals on phenotypes relevant to disease and human evolution. Genetic variants that modify gene regulation
are major contributors to both evolutionary divergence between species and differences in risk for disease
among humans. However, due to the complexity of gene regulatory programs and the evolutionary histories
that shaped patterns of genetic variation, interpreting the implications of an individual’s genome sequence re-
mains challenging. This is a major roadblock to understanding the functional evolution of human-specific biolo-
gy and mapping the genetic causes of disease.
We integrate machine learning, large-scale functional genomics data, and ancient DNA to address this chal-
lenge. The previous R35 funding enabled us with the flexibility to seize opportunities to make significant dis-
coveries including: DNA sequence-based machine learning methods for predicting gene regulatory activity
within and between species; demonstrating that selection against introgressed Neanderthal variation was the
dominant trend across >400 traits, discovering the Neanderthal introgression introduced functional alleles lost
in the out-of-Africa bottleneck; and developing a model for the functional evolution of gene regulatory elements.
The previous R35 was the core source of support for work that led to 32 manuscripts, 26 of which my group led
or co-led.
Given our success in the previous grant period, my lab is uniquely well positioned with this renewal to build on
our previous work to address fundamental questions in the following areas:
 1. Developing powerful new machine learning methods that enable accurate prediction of individual-level
 molecular phenotypes, like gene expression, from DNA sequence.
 2. Reconstructing molecular phenotypes of ancient humans and archaic hominins from their genomes to
 test hypotheses evolutionary transitions.
 3. Leveraging new experimental technologies to dissect the functional drivers of cis vs. trans gene regula-
 tory divergence between species.
 4. Interpreting non-protein-coding mutations identified in patient genomes to inform treatment and preven-
 tative care.
Our work will produce much-needed methods for understanding the effects of genetic variant in gene regulato-
ry regions and identifying mutations responsible for differences in disease risk between human populations.
The renewal of our R35 will enable us to continue making significant contributions to these essential basic sci-
ence and clinical challenges."

Discovery of selective and potent ligands for novel targets, as well as ligands with new functionalities remains a
slow and expensive process, hampering pharmacological validation of targets and discovery of new treatments
for many conditions like pain, substance abuse, Alzheimer's disease and cancer. Our research aims at
developing a scalable computational platform for ligand discovery, synergistically combining the advantages of
structure-based and data-driven approaches. We will pursue three synergistic technological directions,
combined with their experimental validation and application to clinically relevant targets. The first one builds
upon our recently introduced highly scalable synthon-based approach, V-SYNTHES, which performs hierarchical
structure-based virtual screening of giga- and tera-scale on-demand chemical spaces. We will further improve
the performance of the method by employing complementary Machine Learning approaches to ligand selection,
and optimize V-SYNTHES parameters to expand it to Tera-scale REAL libraries. The second research direction
combines V-SYNTHES screening with synergistic experimental hit identification approaches like fragment-
based, covalent screening and DNA-Encoded Library. Such hybrid methods build on complementary strengths
of these tools, enabling ligand discovery for the most challenging targets like cryptic and allosteric pockets.
Finally, building upon our extensive experience with the rational design of functionalized ligands, we will explore
structure-based approaches to designing photoswitchable, irreversible, bitopic and bivalent ligands, based on
both derivatives of known ligands and newly discovered chemotypes. Our broad network of experimental
collaborators will allow rapid synthesis of predicted compounds, and their comprehensive experimental validating
in biochemical, cellular and in vivo assays. Successful completion of this project will establish robust
computational and hybrid platforms for structure-based ligand discovery in most classes of therapeutic targets,
scaleable for rapidly growing REAL chemical spaces. The platform will be also thoroughly validated on a diverse
set of clinical targets, yielding new chemical probes and potential leads for drug discovery."
10842901,"Project Summary/Abstract
Our laboratory is primarily focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms integral to transmembrane
receptor function and modulation of their signaling output. We employ cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) in
conjunction with advanced classification methodologies such as manifold embedding, modeling, and molecular
dynamics to investigate how ligand binding influences conformational equilibria and signaling bias. Our
research encompasses various systems, enabling us to examine the impact of different ligand types on ion
channel gating and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation.
Our longstanding research interest lies in receptors vital to heart and skeletal muscle function. We are
investigating the mechanisms and modulation of ryanodine receptors (RyR) and beta-adrenergic receptors,
which play a crucial role in cardiac and skeletal muscle functionality. Our objective is to elucidate how small
molecules, protein regulators, and ions shape the conformational energy landscape of these receptors. This
knowledge is critical for understanding calcium signaling regulation and for designing innovative therapeutics to
address cardiac and muscle disorders.
Another research interest is exploring lipid-triggered gating of mechanosensitive channels from the MscS
family, a model system for membrane tension-sensing. This research can provide valuable insights into the
fundamental principles governing ion channel gating and the role of lipid-protein interactions in this process.
Our research approach combines cryo-EM, advanced image classification techniques, residue network
analysis, and molecular dynamics simulations to mechanistically delineate allosteric pathways. We
subsequently validate proposed models using biophysical techniques such as single-channel measurements,
hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), and mutagenesis.
Our long-term goal is to significantly enhance our molecular understanding of receptor activation and allosteric
modulation. Advancement in this field could potentially pave the way for the design of small molecule allosteric
modulators with precise control over their effects on their targets, thus aiding in the development of drugs with
minimized side effects.

10842902,"Lipids in drug delivery systems and food can have a tremendous impact on the systemic absorption of orally
delivered compounds, including drugs, nutrients, and toxins. However, this impact cannot be quantitatively
predicted a priori, and underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The ability to quantitatively predict the
impact of lipids in drug delivery systems and food on oral compound absorption could revolutionize the oral
formulation development process, significantly streamlining resource intensive drug development, enabling
design of effective nutritive supplements, and increasing our understanding of how food composition and
structure impact health in an era of rapidly evolving food availability. The Carrier lab is focused on applying
engineering analysis to intestinal systems for enabling effective oral delivery, as well as understanding the
impact of ingested materials on human health. To date, the lab has developed a mechanism-based modeling
framework to predict the impact of lipids on oral compound absorption. Major goals of this project include: 1.
Determining whether systems-based modeling approaches, capturing kinetics of key processes occurring in
the gastrointestinal tract, can be used to describe and predict the impact of lipids in actual oral delivery
systems and food with complex composition and structure on absorption of orally delivered compounds. 2.
Revealing mechanisms by which lipids impact co-transport of orally delivered compounds across the intestinal
mucosa into lymph or portal circulation, together with appropriate mathematical expressions to describe these
processes. In addition to the laboratory`s track record of developing and translating mechanistic, predictive
models of oral delivery and existing preliminary modeling framework, the lab is extremely well-positioned to
markedly advance our understanding of oral absorption processes, given its expertise and experience in
design of advanced engineered experimental intestinal models and mechanisms for exploring the impact of the

10842759,"Our research team explores genetic, molecular, and cellular interactions between germ
cells and somatic (non-germline) cells of the gonad. We focus on the mechanisms
regulating reproductive system formation and function. Key questions are: 1) how are
germline stem cells (GSCs) established and why are they absent in women? and 2)
what establishes and maintains the sex-specific identity of germ cells, gonadal and
extragonadal somatic cells, all of which are required for reproductive success and
species perpetuation. Our goal in pursuing this research program is to define the
developmental mechanisms regulating gonadogenesis to prevent infertility and to
extend reproductive opportunities and choices for women and their partners. Extending
reproductive potential is not only central to population preservation and fulfilling dreams
of parenthood, it will also mitigate or eliminate health risks that accompany premature
ovarian failure, perimenopause, and menopause in many women. From a
developmental perspective, disorders of sexual development (DSDs) are common, and
include gonadal dysgenesis, dysregulated puberty, gender dysphoria, and sterility,
thereby posing challenging sex-specific treatment decisions. DSDs are idiopathic or
result from genetic or hormonal anomalies during sexual development. With humans
living longer and delaying parenthood, declining reproductive potential and increased
germline mutation burden affect all sexes. We will leverage powerful genetic tools, cell
imaging, and genome-wide multi-omics approaches to unravel the cellular and
molecular underpinnings of reproductive development, health, and fertility, largely
neglected areas of biomedical research."
10842819,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Signaling lipids, such as steroids, terpenoids, and eicosanoids, regulate diverse physiological processes in
animals, including development, reproduction, and immune responses. Understanding modes of action of such
lipid-derived signaling molecules, therefore, is critical for ensuring and promoting healthy development and
well-being in humans. However, in contrast to proteinaceous signaling molecules such as peptide hormones
and cytokines, the power of modern molecular genetics has not been fully utilized for signaling lipid research,
as they are not directly encoded by genes. In the past several years, it has been demonstrated that the insect
steroid hormone ecdysone requires membrane transporters for its entry into target cells, challenging the
prevailing dogma in endocrinology that lipophilic hormones can simply diffuse across the plasma membrane.
As exemplified by this study, there are huge knowledge gaps regarding how signaling lipids function in vivo,
particularly concerning their transmembrane transport machineries. This project will utilize fruit fly genetics to
reveal uncharacterized aspects of signaling pathways mediated by lipid-derived molecules. The project will
focus on three major signaling lipids in insects, namely ecdysone, juvenile hormone, and eicosanoids, to better
understand their modes of action. Successful completion of this project is expected not just to broaden our
understanding of the functions of signaling lipids in this important model insect species, but also to provide an
unprecedented example of a novel type of signaling lipid research and may inspire many researchers in the
relevant field."
10842900,"Project Summary
In the last thirteen years, analysis of ancient genomes suggests that population
admixtures are a dominant feature of human history. Admixture between populations
leads to genetic exchange between populations, and this provides an opportunity to
introduce new genetic variation much more rapidly than waiting for mutations to occur
naturally. Analysis of Neanderthal, Denisovan and ancient modern human genomes
suggests that admixture has occurred at different time scales in the past. We are only
beginning to understand how genetic variation that is introduced during an admixture
event has been evolving in the recipient populations. Evolutionary forces like
demographic history and natural selection will also affect the frequency distributions of
these mutations in recipient populations.
The goal of this research project is to develop statistical methods and computational
approaches that can be applied to admixed genomes to investigate how admixture
shapes patterns of genetic variation and how it facilitates adaptations. As admixed
genomes are mosaics of different ancestries, we can study genetic variation in these
genomes to gain insights into the histories of both recipient and donor populations. For
example, we can identify genetic variation that help recipient populations adapt to new
environments. We will also leverage genetic patterns of admixed genomes to
characterize how natural selection acted on genetic variation after very recent admixture
events. Finally, with our methods, we can also gain insight into the structure present in
the donor populations even if only a handful of genomes exists for these populations. In
summary, the methods and the empirical approaches proposed here will be useful to
elucidate how different contributions from a complex web of population interactions has
affected the evolution of our species."

Drs. Heinrich Jasper and Emmanuelle Passegué. The conference will be held in Santa Fe, New Mexico from
January 22–25, 2024.
Regenerative medicine relies on a deep mechanistic understanding of tissue stem cell biology and innovative
approaches to reprogram cells and tissues. This Keystone Symposia conference brings together leading
researchers who study the biology of tissue stem cells and tissue regeneration and who have employed this
knowledge to develop therapeutic applications in regenerative medicine. The program of the meeting explores
these processes across diverse tissue types, and thus encompasses stem cell populations and regenerative
pathways across biological systems, ranging from hematopoietic stem cells to vascular systems to the retina. A
particular focus will be on promoting tissue regeneration even in the absence of endogenous stem cells (as in
the retina) as well as on rejuvenation approaches based on in vivo partial reprogramming. This conference will
run in parallel with our recurring Keystone Symposia meeting on Emerging Cellular Therapies and will feature
two joint scientific sessions that explore cellular approaches in regenerative medicine and gene therapy

10829342,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 This proposal presents a five-year research and career development plan for Andrew Stern, MD, PhD,
in the molecular basis of Alzheimer disease (AD), the leading cause of age-related cognitive failure worldwide.
Dr. Stern is an Instructor in cognitive and behavioral neurology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH).
 The “amyloid cascade hypothesis” is the most studied theory of AD pathogenesis, positing that
abnormalities in the metabolism of the Aβ peptide lead to the two defining pathologic lesions of AD (amyloid
plaques of aggregated Aβ and neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau), followed by loss of neurons.
There are two central problems with this hypothesis: some patients have abundant amyloid plaques but little
neuronal and cognitive loss; and clinical trials of antibodies that removed amyloid plaques have largely failed to
slow decline. This proposal addresses these problems by beginning two answer two questions: 1) What
biochemical and structural characteristics of the most toxic form of Aβ, soluble oligomers (oAβ), confer its
toxicity? Novel monoclonal antibodies will be used to test if calcium-associated and low molecular weight oAβ
subsets are correlated with tau abnormalities and dementia. CryoEM will allow structural characterization of
immunoaffinity purified calcium-associated oAβ. 2) Do genetic differences cause some patients’ neurons to be
more susceptible to toxic oAβ, and is oAβ from patients with high tau burden and dementia more toxic than
oAβ from patients without? Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons (iNs) and post mortem brain tissue,
from patients with high amyloid pathology but varying tau and cognitive impairment will be compared using live
cell imaging. An important innovation is to use naturally-occurring, human brain-derived oAβ, which may be
more disease-relevant than synthetic oAβ. These experiments will help explain inconsistencies in our models
of AD pathogenesis. In the long term, the results may assist clinical trial and drug design.
 The training goals of this proposal are for Dr. Stern to develop the necessary expertise to establish an
independent laboratory researching the molecular pathogenesis of AD under R01 funding. Over the five years,
Dr. Stern will acquire specific skills each with the one-on-one mentorship of an expert advisor: Aβ biochemistry
(Dr. Selkoe), iN models (Dr. Young-Pearse), protein conformational chemistry and structural biology (Dr. Vos),
neuropathology of neurodegeneration (Dr. Feany), and knowledge of AD clinical therapeutic development (Dr.
Sperling). Dr. Stern has developed a training plan consisting of one-on-one meetings, in-person courses, and
conferences. All mentors and advisors are renowned experts in their fields. Dr. Selkoe (primary mentor) is a
leading AD researcher with decades of mentorship experience, including successful K08 awardees. Dr. Young-
Pearse (co-mentor) is also a leading AD researcher, particularly in iN models of disease, and an accomplished
mentor. The BWH Department of Neurology is committed to supporting Dr. Stern through protected research
time (85%) and state-of-the-art facilities and equipment."

The primary objective of the Training Program in Hematology, in its 35th year of funding, is to train MD, MD/PhD,
and PhD postdoctoral fellows interested in adult hematology for careers in academic medicine and biomedical
research. Johns Hopkins Hematology is among the largest free-standing adult hematology programs. We are
requesting support for four postdoctoral trainees per year, which is unchanged from the previous grant cycle.
The Johns Hopkins Hematology Fellowship Program, which supports 2 single-board hematology fellows per
year, is the major substrate for this T32. This fellowship program is one of only 2 programs in the United States
that recruits for single-board hematology fellows, and provides dedicated training in benign and malignant
hematology without training in solid tumors. Thus, the purpose of the proposed training program is to prepare
qualified individuals with an MD and/or PhD degree for a research career in the field of adult hematology. The
training program consists of well-funded and highly experienced investigators, most of whom are internationally
recognized for their research pertaining to hematopoiesis and stem cell biology, anemias, hemoglobinopathies,
thrombotic microangiopathies, bone marrow failure states and myeloproliferative diseases. Training is enhanced
by an outstanding research environment with state-of-the-art research facilities and cores, outstanding faculty
mentors, and an existing program project grant on bone marrow transplantation. Despite a national trend away
from single board hematology fellowship programs, Johns Hopkins continues to attract outstanding MD and
MD/PhD candidates for single board hematology training and prepares them for careers in biomedical research1.
There is also an exceptional pool of PhD postdoctoral fellows from the labs of our basic science mentors who
are well-integrated in the hematology multidisciplinary conferences and even the clinical training program.
Specific aims are of this training program are:
1) to provide research training opportunities in a variety of areas pertaining to hematology including benign and
 malignant hematopoiesis, bone marrow failure disorders, bone marrow transplantation, stem cell biology,
 immunology, genetics, thrombotic microangiopathies, myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic syndromes and
hemoglobinopathies
2) to provide the opportunity for structured coursework and seminars pertaining to clinical, translational and basic
 research pertaining to hematology, and to provide opportunities for instruction in grant writing, manuscript
 writing, public speaking and biostatistics
3) to allow for group mentoring, and careful monitoring of the trainees’ progress and the overall success of the
 training program
4) to address the critical shortage of adult hematologists pursuing careers in academic hematology"
10829344,"SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
This project addresses what is perhaps the biggest challenge in the clinical care of Type 1 diabetes (T1D): the
incredible rise in HbA1c levels seen during the adolescent age span of 11-15 years. This rise appears to be
driven by physiologic changes (an increase in insulin resistance) that are not adequately addressed, in part
because of psychosocial challenges (including family conflict, peer influence, and diabetes distress). We
propose to follow adolescents longitudinally for two years, with assessment of these physiologic factors and
exploratory aim following psychosocial factors, as well as testing a promising intervention in the artificial
pancreas (AP). This study is titled A.P. APPLE for Artificial Pancreas Adolescent Physiology and Psychosocial
Longitudinal Evaluation.
We hypothesize that long-term use of an AP system (Tandem's Control-IQ, compared to Usual Care+CGM)
will in part blunt the rise in HbA1c that is typically seen. However, even apart from testing this intervention, this
project offers valuable observational data on the natural history of changes seen in participants in the control
group. We will follow changes in insulin resistance by body compartment (liver vs. muscle/adipose tissue)
during pubertal progression using stable-isotope triple-tracer mixed meal tests, revealing novel information
about how puberty-related insulin resistance evolves over time by body compartment—as well as how the AP
might respond to these changes. We will also follow key psychosocial processes of family conflict, peer
influence, diabetes distress, depression and quality of life to evaluate their temporal relationships to sub-
optimal control. Following these processes may help in the application of pharmacologic or psychologic
approaches to improve adolescent control—either with or without AP use. Finally, we will follow modern
markers of T1D control, including time-in-range and glycemic variability to document for providers how these
factors change during pubertal progression and how they are related to physiologic and psychosocial changes.
This study takes advantage of the University of Virginia Center for Diabetes Technology as an environment
with expertise in each of the domains of glycemia, physiology and psychosocial factors—as well as
development of an AP system that is effective in short-term trials at reducing HbA1c.
The sub-optimal control during adolescence has gotten more pronounced in recent studies and contributes to
long-term complications. This project will provide valuable clues about the durability of AP use among
adolescents as well the contribution of rising insulin resistance and psychosocial barriers—with a long-term
goal of improving control and long-term health of adolescents with T1D."
10829453,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Histotripsy is a non-invasive, ultrasound based tissue ablation therapy which relies on the targeted generation
of cavitation events to mechanically fractionate and liquefy tissues. Quantifiable metrics by which the outcomes
of histotripsy therapy can be predicted as a function of therapy inputs are essential for ensuring reliable and
repeatable treatments, but do not currently exist. Although histotripsy-generated cavitation and liquefied tissue
can be detected in ultrasound imaging, there is no established metric to quantify induced tissue damage
versus cavitation exposure, which is known to vary with tissue properties, as well as among patients. With
clinical translation of histotripsy ongoing, it is critical to establish a dose metric by which cavitation energy
deposited to tissue during histotripsy can be monitored in situ to accurately predict therapy-generated damage.
In this project we propose to develop metrics for monitoring histotripsy-induced tissue fractionation by
monitoring the acoustic cavitation emission (ACE) signals generated by the cavitation events responsible for
therapy during histotripsy. The ACE signals encode information about the dynamics and energetics of the
cavitation events from which they are emitted, which depend on the mechanical properties/integrity of the
media in which the cavitation events were generated. As a result of exposure to cavitation during histotripsy,
targeted materials are mechanically disrupted which alters their mechanical properties, which can thus affect
the dynamics of the cavitation events. By developing methods to monitor features of the ACE signals the
mechanical state of the material in which the cavitation events were generated can be assessed in situ.
We will carry out experiments in which histotripsy will be used to generate cavitation in a range of tissue-
mimicking gel phantoms and tissues with a wide range of mechanical properties to ablate them. During
treatment, the ACE signals will be recorded. Following treatment, generated damage will be assessed optically
and histologically and the recorded ACE signals will be analyzed to identify the features in them that can be
correlated with the induced damage observed in images or histology. Establishing such correlations will allow
the ACE signals to be used as a metric for monitoring induced material fractionation during histotripsy
treatment. To enable robust monitoring, the ACE signals can be monitored using the transmitting elements of
the array as receivers in addition to hydrophones. This will ensure that an acoustically accessible path to the
generated cavitation events will always be available to provide accurate monitoring of the ACE signals, but will
require the development of sophisticated real-time algorithms to process owing to the large amount of data that
will be generated. Once correlations between features of the ACE signals and induced damage in gel
phantoms and ex vivo tissues have been identified, and real-time algorithms for monitoring them developed,
they will be validated in vivo in a swine model. The results of this work will be essential for establishing a
histotripsy dose metric and for histotripsy to obtain FDA approval for clinical use."
10829398,"The neuromodulator dopamine is important for many brain functions: loss of dopamine neurons causes
movement disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease; dopamine signaling is targeted by drugs of abuse and
integral to the neurobiology of reward and addiction; and dopamine signaling is a therapeutic target for the
treatment of many neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite its importance in the brain, relatively little is known
about mechanisms that regulate synaptic dopamine release in vivo. And although the effects of dopamine on
individual cells have been extensively studied, how dopamine signals are processed to change the dynamics
of post synaptic neurons to execute changes of behavior is not well understood. The microscopic roundworm
C. elegans offers the opportunity to study these aspects of dopamine signaling using powerful tools of
molecular genetics and in vivo circuit analysis. Using behavioral genetics and newly developed methods for
analysis of neural circuits in behaving animals we will (1) determine mechanisms that regulate dopamine
release in response to appetitive stimuli and postsynaptic and (2) determine circuit mechanisms that transform
dopamine signaling events into lasting changes in behavior. Because of the ancient and conserved functions of
dopamine signaling in the animal nervous system, we propose that our studies will also advance
understanding of pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms in dopamine systems of the human brain and accelerate
discovery of new approaches to understanding and treating diseases linked to dysfunction of dopaminergic
systems."

All animals rely on sensory systems to detect and respond to environmental and behavioral cues. In most
animals, this sensory information is perceived and processed by different sensory neurons, allowing animals to
respond appropriately to maximize health- and lifespan. However, a detailed understanding of the underlying
cues and mechanisms by which the sensory nervous system regulates health- and lifespan remains largely
unknown. Addressing these gaps in knowledge is imperative to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the
impact of sensory perception on overall health. My preliminary work in Caenorhabditis elegans shows that
exposure to dead conspecifics result in 1) aversive behavior and 2) impaired lifespan. My studies also suggest
that dead conspecifics release “death cues” that are detected by the olfactory neurons. Given my findings, the
long-term objective of this research is to understand how death perception regulates animal’s physiology,
health- and lifespan. In preliminary work, I have identified the sensory neurons and neurotransmitters required
for death perception in C. elegans (Aim 1). My central hypothesis is that detection of intracellular metabolites
released by dead conspecifics are recognized by amphid olfactory neurons AWB and/or ASH, promoting a
cGMP-dependent signaling cascade leading to the observed aversive behavior and lifespan shortening. The
objective of this project is to identify the neuronal circuitry and neuronal activity status involved in death
perception in C. elegans (Aim 2). As a postdoctoral fellow, in Aim 3 I plan to expand on my previous training in
sensory perception and stress to investigate how early-life stress may alter neuronal circuits involved in
sensory perception, stress resilience, and mood-related disorders. The proposed research will provide new
fundamental knowledge into the role of sensory perception in the regulation of both health-and lifespan."

2) assessing the heterogeneity of response in different patient subgroups; and 3) advanced modelling skills.
This grant proposes to refine the process of screening of coronary artery disease in patients with chronic
kidney disease on the wait-list awaiting kidney transplantation. Currently, patients undergo repeat cardiac
screening tests at frequent intervals, few of which result in interventions. These tests impose a high treatment
burden on patients and potentially delay time to transplant, while bringing unclear benefit to the patient. This
grant proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g.
elderly patients with diabetes mellitus). It will examine strategies that vary the frequency of cardiac testing and
risk stratification for cardiac testing based on a simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive test that can be
performed in routine clinical settings, a 6-minute walk test (6MWT). This project will achieve this broad aim by
three specific aims: 1) to characterize the 6MWT in identifying low-risk patients who do not additional cardiac
testing; 2) to model strategies varying the frequency of cardiac testing and use of 6MWT; 3) to design
strategies personalized for specific patient subgroups and model them in the entire kidney transplant candidate
population of the United States (US). The first two aims will arise from a well-characterized cohort of patients at
Dr. Cheng’s institution. Machine-learning systems will be used to identify which patient subgroups are best
served by which strategies (i.e. the heterogeneity of response). The third aim will leverage the US Renal Data
System, which Dr. Cheng’s mentors and institution has a track record of leveraging for innovative research.
The proposed work has high potential to make a significant clinical impact. Its completion will enable the
identification and characterization of rational strategies for pre-transplant screening of coronary artery disease
that may be incorporated into clinical practice or pave the way for a future multi-center comparative
effectiveness trial. The proposed work is realistic and feasible within the award period, and will allow Dr. Cheng
to build research skills, advance and disseminate scientific knowledge, create additional collaborative
networks, and compete for R01 or equivalent funding. In summary, the K23 award will provide the support to
enable Dr. Cheng to become a successful independent clinical investigator."
10836502,"This T32 application, the Center for Drug Discovery “Training Program on Medications Development for
Substance Use Disorder (SUD)”, is to provide broad training to PhD students and postdoctoral scientists on drug
development for SUD. The Training Program rationale is driven by the socioeconomic burden and medical need
associated with the lack of safe and effective medicines to treat SUD in the US and globally. The Training
Program blends mentorship, coursework, and research activities in a setting with state-of-the-art facilities. The
goal of training is to equip trainees to develop as productive biomedical research scientists, with consummate
expertise in SUD pharmacotherapies research. The main locus of this training program is the Center for Drug
Discovery (CDD) at Northeastern University that has unique technologies housed in one cohesive unit, including,
high-throughput synthetic chemistry and pharmacological activity screening; mass spectrometry-based
genomics, proteomics and metabolomics, as well as, bioanalytical analysis; high-resolution NMR technologies;
and in vivo MRI imaging. Notably, CDD Training Program faculty includes SUD researchers at Harvard Medical
School and McLean Psychiatric Hospital, as well as, at Tufts University and Medical Center. Moreover, CDD
Training Program consultants include drug development scientists from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology
industrial community in Boston. All participating institutions are within an 8-mile radius of each other in the
metropolitan Boston area. The Training Program presents a premiere discovery and translational node to
address the appalling morbidity and mortality associated with apparent lack of effective medications for opioid
use disorder and complete absence of approved medications for SUD associated with cannabinoids and
psychostimulants—it appears that repurposing of old drugs has not worked and the lack of novel medicines from
pharmaceutical industry and federal laboratories provides strong rationale for our academic-based training
program on novel medication development for SUD, with its unique multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional
approach. A unique feature of the Training Program is engagement of junior faculty, including, from the
Medications Development Branch of the NIDA Intramural Program, to provide for the next generation of SUD
medication development scientists. Training Program faculty assist pre- and postdoctoral trainees to develop
scientific integrity, collaboration, grantsmanship, and presentation skills, as well as, expertise in methodologies,
including, synthetic chemistry, molecular and behavioral pharmacology, drug pharmacokinetics and metabolism,
“omics” (pharmacogenomics, proteomics, metabolomics), and neuroimaging. In addition to core research ethics
training, there will be ethics roundtable discussions. Some other features of the Training Program include
postdoctoral–predoctoral trainee collaboration, a trainees’ seminar series, and trainee engagement with SUD
scientists at the annual CDD/NIDA-sponsored symposium, Chemistry and Pharmacology of Drug Abuse."
10875490,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 While recent efforts have focused on better understanding the germline mutation rate of different
types of DNA variants, the dynamics of somatic mutations in the human genome are poorly understood.
Somatic mutations are a well-known cause of cancer and may play a causative role in other diseases and
aging. Analyses of somatic mutations have generally been limited to single-cell or low-coverage studies.
To accurately assess the rate of somatic mutations over time would require a longitudinal, high coverage
dataset. For ~450 individuals in the Utah CEPH (Centre d'Etude du Polymorphism Humain) pedigrees,
blood was drawn at two timepoints approximately 15 years apart. This proposal describes experiments to
determine the rate of somatic mutations throughout the human genome by utilizing high-coverage (720x)
whole-genome sequencing data at both of these timepoints in a subset of CEPH individuals. The genomes
included in this study will be used to determine the rate of somatic mutations and improve our
understanding of differences in this rate between individuals. Building on previous work performed at the
University of Utah, we will determine the relationship between the germline and somatic mutation rate.
Further, using detailed phenotypic data collected for these individuals, experiments will be performed to
determine how this rate is correlated with disease outcomes such as cancer and cardiovascular disease.
From this work, a series of filtering algorithms will be produced to allow for comprehensive analysis of
somatic mutations occurring between two timepoints in the same individual. This dataset provides me with
a unique opportunity to study somatic mutations over time using high-quality data.
This proposal builds upon my experience in analyzing mobile element-mediated somatic mutations
in longitudinal whole-genome data of cancer patients, and my recent work analyzing germline short
tandem repeat mutations in the CEPH pedigrees. The K99 portion of this project will focus on determining
the rate of somatic mutations in longitudinal, high-coverage whole-genome sequencing data while creating
filtering algorithms to improve our detection capabilities. The additional training I will receive during this
period will lay the foundation of an independent research program that will determine the significance of
somatic mutations in the human genome and how these relate to disease outcomes."

10839490,"Summary – Project 2
Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, with atherosclerosis being a major
contributor. The unremitting rise in obesity and its co-morbidities, including diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver
diseases, further increase the risk of atherosclerosis. While such cardiometabolic diseases were once attributed
primarily to dysregulations of lipid metabolism, it is now appreciated that the immune response to excess lipid in
tissues (artery, adipose tissue, liver) shapes cardiometabolic disease progression and its complications.
Determining the mechanisms underlying this damaging metabolic inflammation, and identifying therapeutic
approaches to quench it, are major focuses of our Program Project Grant (PPG). In its first cycle, our PPG
unveiled key pathways through which alterations in macrophage (Mø) metabolism, trafficking, and tissue-specific
molecular reprogramming drive the chronic inflammation that fuels atherosclerosis, and the metabolic disorders
that accelerate it (e.g., obesity and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis; NASH). Through examination of mouse models
and human tissues from patients with these disorders, Project 2 studies point to pathogenic roles for the
neuroimmune guidance molecule netrin-1 in directing non-resolving inflammation and lipid accumulation in
metabolic tissues. We hypothesize that netrin-1 contributes to dysregulation of Mø metabolism and trafficking,
and molecular re-programming of inflammation, and that these processes are driven by tissue- and environment-
specific stimuli that contribute to cardiometabolic disease. Key Project 2 discoveries in cycle 1 of the PPG
include: (1) Deletion of netrin-1 in myeloid cells protects mice from high fat diet-induced obesity and hepatic
steatosis, and regresses advanced atherosclerosis; (2) Netrin-1 expression alters the functional trajectory of Mø
in obese adipose tissue and atherosclerotic plaques; and (3) Distinct isoforms of netrin-1 accumulate in Mø
during metabolic inflammation that can provoke both receptor-dependent and -independent signaling. In this
proposal, we will investigate how Mø-derived netrin-1 promotes atherosclerosis, obesity and NASH through both
Mø-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms, including cross-talk with other immune cells and parenchymal cells, and
how interventions targeting netrin-1 can be leveraged toward our goal of mitigating cardiometabolic disease.
Together with Projects 1 and 3, we will probe how netrin-1 contributes to intra- and inter-organ communications
through shared tools, strategies and bioinformatics approaches, and test therapeutically relevant approaches to
block its detrimental actions.
Fortified by complementary examinations in human tissues and transcriptome
databases, we will employ state-of-the-art RNA sequencing, coupled with spatial transcriptomics, to generate
and “visualize” a comprehensive map of the putative interactome and upstream transcriptional regulators that
regulate intra- and interorgan cross-talk in cardiometabolic disorders. This work and the Program Project hold
great promise to identify targeted and prudent therapies in atherosclerosis, obesity and NASH through the lens
of dysregulated macrophage-evoked communications in metabolic organ networks."
10839491,"Summary: Project 3
Our Program Project has unveiled key roles for macrophage metabolism, depot-, cue-, and time-dependent
molecular re-programming and intraorgan trafficking in the pathogenesis of cardiometabolic dysfunction. In each
metabolic setting, including the atherosclerotic plaque, obese adipose tissue and liver, the composition of the
tissue-specific niche, such as excess lipid content, and recruitment and trafficking of infiltrating bone marrow-
derived immune cells, which deliver signals to activate endogenous signaling pathways in resident immune cells
(e.g., adipose tissue macrophages or liver Kupffer cells), defines the breadth of possible consequences. Project
3 studies reveal novel, complex roles for the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE; gene name
Ager) and its cytoplasmic domain binding partner, DIAPH1, in parenchymal vs. immune cell dysfunctions. Project
3 key discoveries during Cycle 1 of the Program Project include: (1) deletion of Ager or Diaph1 in myeloid cells
significantly increases insulin resistance without further increasing body mass in high fat diet-fed mice; (2)
RAGE/DIAPH1 contributes to regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism; (3) macrophage RAGE contributes to
regulation of Interferon Regulatory Factor 7 (IRF7); IRF7 bridges lipid metabolism and inflammation in
macrophages; and (4) in mice fed a non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-inducing diet, myeloid deletion of Ager
or novel small molecule antagonists of RAGE/DIAPH1 imparts complex consequences on steatosis and fibrosis.
These considerations lead us to hypothesize that RAGE/DIAPH1 contributes to regulation of macrophage
metabolism; molecular re-programming in response to tissue- and cue-specific stimuli; and macrophage intra-
and interorgan communications in cardiometabolic dysfunction. We will pursue three specific aims: Aim 1 will
test the hypothesis that DIAPH1 contributes to atherosclerosis through intra- and interorgan regulation of lipid
metabolism and inflammation; AIM 2 test the hypothesis that RAGE/DIAPH1/IRF7 uncouples liver steatosis and
fibrosis in NASH through regulation of lipid metabolism and dynamic reprogramming of infiltrating Mɸs and
resident Kupffer cells; and AIM 3 will test the hypothesis that RAGE/DIAPH1 contributes to cardiometabolic
disease through interorgan communications. Project 3, with Projects 1-2, will identify the depot-, cue- and
temporal-mediating mechanisms of cardiometabolic dysfunction, driven by macrophages and, critically, their
interactions with parenchymal and non-parenchymal niche-specific cells. Fortified by complementary
examinations in human tissues and transcriptome databases, we will employ state-of-the-art RNA sequencing,
coupled with strategically-utilized spatial transcriptomics, to generate and “visualize” a comprehensive map of
the putative interactome and the upstream transcriptional regulators that regulate intra- and interorgan cross-
talk in cardiometabolic disorders. This work and the Program Project hold great promise to identify targeted and
prudent therapies in atherosclerosis, obesity and NASH through the lens of dysregulated macrophage-evoked
communications in metabolic organ networks."
10840779,"Bone loss is a hallmark of severe spinal cord injury (SCI) that increases risk of fracture and contributes to the
development of medical comorbidities that worsen mortality risk. The bone deficits occurring after SCI are
precipitated by the central nervous system (CNS) insult and the subsequent musculoskeletal unloading, which
has resulted in an emphasis on activity-based physical therapy (ABPT) modalities that reload the impaired
limbs to restore bone integrity. Strategies that couple ABPT with electrical stimulation [e.g., functional electrical
stimulation (FES) cycling] are intriguing because they improve muscle recovery in the impaired limbs by
stimulating muscles to perform task-specific exercise and may promote sensorimotor recovery in the presence
of some spared spinal tracts. However, the ability of FES cycling to restore bone mineral density (BMD) in the
paralyzed limbs remains contentious after SCI, especially at the distal femur and proximal tibia sites that are
most prone to fracture. These data indicate need to optimize FES parameters for bone restoration. The goal of
this proposal is to develop and operationalize the first-ever ‘humanized’ FES bicycle system for rats. We will
then use our system in future proposals to optimize FES parameters for bone recovery in a ‘high-throughput’
manner, using our rat severe SCI model that exhibits similar musculoskeletal pathophysiology to persons with
severe traumatic SCI. To achieve our goal, we propose a novel high-risk / high-reward approach that will
reverse-translate the design of a human FES bicycle to develop a FES system for rats consisting of 1) a rat
bicycle that allows both FES directed and motorized pedaling on a crank shaft with modifiable resistance
levels, 2) sensors that record pedal locations, torque, velocity and that provide real-time feedback on these
pedaling parameters to a FES control system and a camera that records limb motions, and 3) a closed-loop
switched control system that accurately regulates pedaling between FES, in positions where muscles
contribute to pedaling, and an electrical motor coupled to the bicycle crank shaft that initiates in FES “dead
zones” where muscle activity provides little pedaling contribution. Our approach is innovative because, if
successful, it will provide a cost-effective and time-efficient means to optimize preclinical FES parameters for
bone restoration, which can then be fast-tracked to clinical trials that will assist in developing personalized
rehabilitation strategies for Veterans with SCI. To ensure our success, we have taken key steps, including: 1)
constructing a motorized (passive) rat bicycle that serves as the platform for our hybrid FES directed /
motorized cycle, 2) developing a closed-loop switched control system for human FES cycles that serves as a
model for our control system, and 3) characterizing the locomotor, bone, and muscle deficits in our rat severe
contusion SCI model, which we will use to test and validate the FES bicycle. Moreover, we have demonstrated
that motorized (passive / isokinetic) cycling normalized reflex excitability and promoted locomotor and bone
recovery (Preliminary Data) in SCI rats, providing rationale for cycling as the base ABPT modality in our
proposal. While these components are in-place, our proposal remains high-risk / high-gain because success
requires that we modify our existing rat bicycle, as described above; that we design, fabricate, model, and
optimize a closed-loop switched control system that accurately regulates pedaling cadence in rats; and that we
explore initial tolerability to repeated FES cycling bouts in our rat SCI model. Based on our findings, system
refinement and re-testing may also be required. To address these steps, we have two Aims:
Aim 1: Design and fabricate a rat bicycle and a closed-loop switched control system that alternates
FES directed and motorized control of the crank shaft to produce continuous pedaling.
Aim 2: Operationalize, validate, and test our FES bicycle system in rats with severe SCI."
10841657,"Project 3, Abstract
Transcript processing and degradation are key processes by which the cell regulates its functional capacity and
physiological state, yet little is known about how these pathways function in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb).
Mutations in components of the RNA processing and degradation machinery are associated with drug resistance
in clinical strains and with drug tolerance in mice and in vitro, highlighting the relevance of these pathways for
clinically important phenotypes. The lack of knowledge about the fundamental biology of mycobacterial RNA
metabolism, including pathway structure and functional consequences of these pathways, represent a barrier to
understanding clinically important routes to drug resistance. The proposed project addresses this gap by
elucidating the targets and functional relationships between the critical RNA processing and degradation
proteins, focusing on how these processes modify drug efficacy. The specific aims are to:
 1. Determine the physical and genetic interactions that define and organize RNA processing and
 degradation pathways.
 2. Define the targets of RNA degradation proteins that are associated with drug resistance.
 3. Determine the phenotypic consequences of perturbations to RNA processing pathways.
The project seeks to move from piecemeal efforts to a pathways-directed approach capable of elucidating the
consequences of complex processes important to adaptation to the host and to drug pressure. To achieve this,
the project leverages high-throughput methodologies and extensive collaboration with other projects and cores.
Biochemical approaches will be used to define the physical associations between degradation pathway
components and their target specificities; TnSeq to map pathway structure and its phenotypic consequences;
transcriptomics approaches to determine how RNA metabolism pathways shape the transcriptome; murine
models to interrogate the relationship between RNA processing mutants and drug efficacy in vivo; and metabo-
lipidomics approaches to determine the impact of RNA processing mutants on metabolic status and permeability.
Combining a variety of approaches and expertise in an intentional and systematic fashion will allow the project
to define the mechanisms and consequences of RNA processing and degradation in mycobacteria in a way that
has not previously been feasible. In the long term, the knowledge obtained will inform efforts to design more
effective diagnostics, drugs and regimens."
10841658,"Project 4, Abstract
Like all bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) must coordinate major cellular processes, such as DNA
replication, with the synthesis and segregation of structural components in order to grow and divide. While the
processes governing cell division are reasonably well-described in model organisms, the mechanisms used by
mycobacteria are clearly different and less well understood. Defining the mechanisms governing the essential
process of cell division in Mtb will reveal new antimicrobial targets and provide the basis to understand how this
process is regulated during the slow-growing states that contribute to bacterial persistence during infection. This
project supports the program’s overall goal to understand pathways important to Mtb’s adaptation to
disease-relevant stress. It will synergize with other projects and leverage each of the cores.
Coordinating the cytokinesis with the cell cycle and the distribution of cellular material must be both temporally
and spatially regulated. Work in the project labs has shown that this coordination requires at least three distinct
regulatory paradigms. (1) The ordered assembly of the cell division complex, or “divisome” requires spatial and
temporal cues that may be provided by Ser/Thr protein kinases (STPK). (2) Extracytoplasmic enzymes
responsible for cell wall metabolism represent a distinct regulatory challenge, and are often controlled by protein-
protein interactions in the periplasmic space. (3) The coordination of processes necessary for cell division are
not restricted to the septum; fundamental metabolic changes are also likely necessary to provide the precursors
required for this major cellular event.
The goal of this project is to understand the regulatory paradigms that control mycobacterial cell division.
Specifically, the project will:
Aim 1. Characterize the role of protein phosphorylation in divisome dynamics. Synchronized Mtb cultures,
quantitative imaging, and biochemical approaches will be used to mechanistically characterize the role of
phosphorylation in the temporal and spatial regulation of divisome function.
Aim 2. Define and characterize extracytoplasmic complexes necessary for cell division. A combination of
genetic and physical approaches will be used to find interactions that are important for regulating enzymatic
activity and localization during cell division.
Aim 3. Characterize the links between cell division and metabolism. A combination of metabolomics and
genetics will be used to investigate the primary metabolic pathways necessary for cell division."
10841546,"The singular goal of most spinal cord injury (SCI) research programs is to repair the injured spinal cord and restore locomotor
function. Unfortunately, restoration of walking is a low priority for most SCI individuals 1. In addition to impaired mobility, SCI
causes slow and steady pathological changes in organ systems throughout the body. Failure to recognize and treat multi-
organ system pathology as a standard of care may explain why survival rates have not improved for SCI patients (relative to
able-bodied individuals) over the past 30 years 2. Emerging data indicate that after SCI, the loss of sympathetic tone and the
development of aberrant spinal autonomic reflexes that control immune organs (e.g., spleen) and the major organs that control
metabolism (e.g., liver, adrenal gland, muscle, adipose tissue and gut) cause immune dysfunction and multi-organ pathology.
Thus, mitigating the onset and downstream consequences of post-injury dysautonomia could improve immune and metabolic
homeostasis. Since immune and metabolic processes are normally tightly coupled and are essential for life 3,4, it is likely that
most, if not all, co-morbidities that affect SCI individuals (e.g., spontaneous infections in lung or skin, impaired wound healing,
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), chronic depression, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, fatigue and anxiety), can be
explained by impaired immunometabolism. Experiments in this proposal are designed to study SCI as a disease of the entire
body and will test the overall hypothesis that post-injury dysautonomia breaks neuro-immune homeostasis creating a state of
“neurogenic meta-inflammation”. This proposal is an integration of currently funded NINDS R01 grants and new ideas. All
experiments and concepts will build on my lab's past successes using both “macroscopic” (systems and networks) and
“microscopic” (cells to molecules) tools to study the pathophysiological significance of neuro-immune interactions. Just as
recent NIH initiatives have emphasized that cures for human brain disease are likely to arise from better understanding of
brain networks or circuits, rather than defects in a single brain region, a cure for SCI is unlikely to originate from a focus only
on repairing the injured spinal cord."

No study has been performed to prospectively record the presenting complaints, signs, symptoms and
comorbidities of children who raised the suspicion of pulmonary embolism (PE) in children. Clinicians must
extrapolate what is known about PE in adults to children. This process puts children in harm’s way: most
children with PE go undiagnosed after their first contact with a healthcare provider, meaning diagnosis is often
delayed. Perhaps as a result, the mortality rate of PE is the same in children as it is in adults. On the other
hand, tens of thousands of low risk children and adolescents are unnecessarily exposed to increased lifetime
cancer risk from ionizing radiation from CT scans done to search for PE they do not have. No clinical criteria
have been developed to either estimate the probability of PE in children, or to exclude PE based upon
information available at the bedside. In adults, the Pulmonary Embolism Rule out Criteria, or PERC rule, has
been validated as a method to exclude PE. In this work, we will test a modification of the PERC rule, PERC-
Peds, which uses an age adjustment to heart rate, one of the 8 objective criteria in the PERC rule. This project
will prospectively test if PERC-Peds, can safely exclude PE in 4,030 children aged 5-17 who raise a suspicion
of PE in the emergency department setting. The criterion standard outcome is diagnosis of PE or DVT within
45 days. To reach the study-defined threshold of safety, the top limit of the 95% confidence interval for the
false negative rate of the exclusionary criteria (PERC-Peds) must be lower than 1.5%. Additionally, we will test
the diagnostic accuracy of the D-dimer, in the subset of patients with the test ordered as part of usual care, and
data will be collected for multiple other ancillary aims. This project will also identify which factors truly increase
or decrease the probability of PE outcome in children who raise a suspicion of PE, and may provide a much
needed evidence basis for physicians to have a rational basis to launch a workup for PE, and also provide
clinical criteria to exclude PE without the need for ionizing radiation."
10841550,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Anopheles gambiae females are the most important vectors of human malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. During
their lives, these females feed on blood several times to undergo multiple gonotrophic cycles of egg
development and egg laying. These reproductive cycles, largely orchestrated by the steroid hormone 20-
hydroxyecdysone (20E), are exploited by Plasmodium falciparum parasites for transmission between human
hosts. The time required for parasite development—from ingestion of male and female gametocytes to
sporozoite invasion of salivary glands—is called the Extrinsic Incubation Period (EIP) and is a key factor in
malaria transmission dynamics, especially when considering the limited lifespan of mosquitoes. Despite its
relevance for parasite transmission, the link between parasite development and oogenesis has not been fully
explored, and important questions such as whether Plasmodium survival and growth depends on pathways
that promote egg development are still largely understudied.
In a recent study, we revealed substantial physiological links between P. falciparum development and
An. gambiae reproductive processes that shape oogenesis. We have unveiled an unexpected positive
correlation between egg and oocyst numbers and have shown that, in instances where 20E function is
impaired, reduced oogenesis induces a decrease in parasite intensities. Manipulating egg development by
these and other 20E-independent means, however, accelerates Plasmodium growth rates, shortening the
EIP and allowing sporozoites to become infectious sooner. Faster growth depends on the accumulation of
blood meal-derived midgut lipids trafficked to the ovaries by the lipid transporter Lipophorin (Lp). Our
outstanding questions concern the mechanisms by which 20E-regulated oogenetic processes affect parasite
numbers, and how the EIP is affected by egg development and Lp-transported lipids in the natural context of
multiple gonotrophic cycles. Preliminary evidence suggests that the mis-regulation of 20E signaling may
cause parasite death via oxidative stress and/or apoptosis. Moreover, we show that an additional blood meal
significantly accelerates parasite growth, while our initial field infections in Burkina Faso suggest the EIP is
regulated by parasite genetic determinants. Here we will perform lab and field studies to determine how
oogenesis impacts the biology of P. falciparum in the An. gambiae female, from establishment of
infection to sporozoite transmission and across multiple reproductive cycles. Specifically, we will: Aim
1) determine the fundamental mechanism by which parasite numbers are reduced when egg development is
impaired; Aim 2) analyze how a second gonotrophic cycle affects the EIP and sporozoite infectivity to human
hepatocytes; and Aim 3) determine in field infections whether the EIP is regulated by parasite genetic factors.
This project will not only fill critical knowledge gaps in mosquito-parasite interactions but will also provide
crucial information for control strategies that aim to reduce the reproductive output of mosquito populations."

 The University of Washington (UW) Center for Translational Muscle Research (CTMR) will continue to provide
critical resources and programs to enhance productivity of investigators to address multi-scale and
multidisciplinary research of muscle disease and treatment strategies. Our research and clinical faculty at the
UW, Seattle Childrens and the Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center have expertise in muscle disease and aging,
exercise, and neuromuscular plasticity. The overall goal of the CTMR is to provide a unifying force to this Seattle
area research community and beyond that accelerates innovative research by providing research tools, facilities,
and expertise in a combination available only at the UW. This will facilitate novel insights into muscle pathologies
and move new therapeutics towards the clinic and the marketplace.
 The CTMR offers 4 cores, one administrative and three research resource cores. The Administrative Core (A)
provides program management and enrichment through symposia and workshops, seminar series, training and
educational opportunities for new investigators and more experienced investigators moving into muscle
research. It also administers a very successful Pilot Awards program that provides funding resources to test
ideas, develop approaches and collect data that can be used for follow-on extramural research applications or
ongoing projects. The Resource Cores feature multi-scale (physical and temporal) measurement and analytical
tools. The Mechanics and Devices Core (B) provides state of the art measurements of muscle biomechanics at
multiple levels of integration and develops new assays for maturation and assessment of early-stage muscle.
The Metabolism and Energetics Core (C) provides tools for in depth measures and analysis of metabolomics,
energetics, cell respiration and mitochondrial function. The Quantitative Analysis Core (D) provides
computational and statistical tools for understanding mechanisms of function and dysfunction with disease and
suggesting new therapeutic targets. The ability to gain information at multiple scales - from protein to organelles,
cells, tissue, and organ - across energetic, metabolic, structure and functional domains using experimental and
quantitative analytic tools with integrative capacity is a powerful approach that is not easily available to an
individual investigator or research group. Such an interdisciplinary approach offers the capacity to accelerate
research to better understand skeletal muscle aging, injury and diseases and speed therapeutics development.
 In the first 4 years, the CTMR has been significantly impactful on training and establishing new investigators
in muscle research and facilitating movement of more established investigators into new research areas. The
Resource Cores have developed or purchased new instrumentation and assays to meet the changing needs of
CTMR faculty. In this renewal proposal we summarize forward looking efforts to remain at the forefront of
research and development, so that - with essential support from the P30 – the CTMR will continue to meet the
needs and be an indispensable resource for our growing muscle community."

Alcohol and other drug use inequities have devastating impacts on American Indian (AI) communities. Ojibwe
ceremonial leaders assert that drug use continues to take the most lives and cause the most grief within AI
families and communities. These leaders attend community ceremonial events to offer their tobacco, food, and
prayers to take care of their community members. It is cultural events and activities that bring the most healing
to AI communities who are gravely affected by the sequelae of unjust historical and contemporary policies by
the United States government.
This project seeks to engage AI adults with community and spiritual worldviews via ceremony (Gii’igoshimong).
In doing so, we will attempt to buffer the effects of historical trauma, personal trauma, and lifelong risk factors
for substance use, thereby improving substance use behaviors, related outcomes, and overall health. The
Community-Based Participatory Research will enroll Elders and ceremonial practitioners (Aim 1), and AI adults
who have not completed Gii’igoshimong in the past (Aims 2 & 3) to implement a randomized controlled trial (N

relationship between ceremony and adult substance use and identify multilevel factors (i.e., psychosocial,
neurocognitive) through which traditional practices convey protection against substance use. We will assess
and develop a menu of implementation strategies (Sub-aim 2) to support community priority of long-term

10843271,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, uniformly fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by the
loss of upper and lower motor neurons. Despite multiple advanced clinical trials, there are currently no
therapies that can stabilize or reverse the motor deficits of ALS. My goal in pursuing a K08 Mentored Clinical
Scientist Research Career Development Award is to acquire the knowledge and practical training to make
major advances in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying neuronal loss in ALS. With my career, I
seek to develop novel therapies that will prevent motor neuron death and preserve function.
In 2006 Neumann and colleagues discovered that TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) accumulated
abnormally within diseased neurons and represented a unifying, end-stage neuropathologic hallmark of ALS.
With this observation, the field then converged on the cellular process of autophagy — the method by which
cells use lysosomes to purge proteins aggregates and maintain homeostasis — as a critical pathway involved
in ALS’ pathogenesis. Lysosomes, however, are tremendously intricate and not well understood compartments
within neurons. Lysosomes house many complex, hydrolytic enzymes; they assist in adaptive stress
responses; and they promote cell survival broadly. While it has been shown that TDP43 can be directed to the
lysosome for clearance, past efforts have stopped their investigations at the lysosomal membrane, presuming
that presuming that TDP43 degradation happens efficiently by an array of unspecified enzymes thereafter.
My preliminary data demonstrates that only a subset of lysosomal enzymes (cathepsins B, D, E, G, L, K, S,
and V) can degrade TDP43 in a pH-dependent manner and that ALS-causing TDP43 mutations have the
potential to disrupt the functions of these enzymes. Therefore, I hypothesize that cathepsins B, D, E, G, L, K,
S, and V are responsible for TDP43 degradation, pathogenic TDP43 mutations are capable of conferring
resistance to these cathepsins, and that impaired cathepsin activity (whether due to TDP43 mutations or age-
related changes in pH) contributes to TDP43 buildup, TDP43 aggregation, and neurodegeneration over time.
This proposal builds upon my solid foundation in neurobiology and neurology that I have cultivated working as

10841096,"Project Summary / Abstract. The PI is Professor at the University of Maryland College Park since 1998 where
he runs a lab focusing on the design and synthesis of new cucurbit[n]uril-type molecular container compounds,
determination and understanding of the fundamental molecular recognition properties toward cationic guest
compounds including drugs and toxic substances in water, and demonstration of the use of these compounds in
important biomedical applications via key collaborations. The pioneering and impactful research contributions
of Dr. Isaacs and his group have been documented in 189 articles in peer reviewed journals which have received
over 15500 citations and garnered Dr. Isaacs election as fellow of AAAS and the 2018 ACS Chemical Society of
Washington Hillebrand Prize. Dr. Isaacs’s lab is/has trained 19 PhD, 21 postdocs, 12 MS, 41 undergrad, and 2
high school students. The vast majority pursued scientific research careers including 7 University faculty who
have launched successful independent academic research groups. The PI’s service record confirms a
commitment to graduate education (Director of chemistry graduate program and UMD GAANN fellowship
program), community building via leadership positions in the international supramolecular and CB[n] conference
series, scientific review for numerous journals and NSF and NIH panels, and junior faculty mentoring.
 The vision of the research program is based on the realization that the lingering effects / presence of
biologically active substances (e.g. prescription and illicit drugs, (environmental) toxins) can lead to adverse
biological events, disease, and death. Common mitigation strategies include the pharmacodynamic medicinal
chemistry approach based on small molecule inhibitors and pharmacokinetic decoy protein / antibody based
sequestration approaches. CB[n]-type receptors exhibit tight aq. binding toward a variety of biologically active
compounds which renders them the prime supramolecular platform for systematic development as in vivo
sequestrants. Over the next five years we will master the synthesis of complex (acyclic) CB[n] receptors and
delineate their structure–binding affinity/selectivity relationships toward chemically and biologically active
compounds to advance supramolecular design principles for high affinity hosts suitable as in vivo sequestrants,
(targeted) delivery agents, and components of sensing ensembles. Structural variables to be probed include the
nature of glycoluril oligomer / building blocks, aromatic walls, and solubility determining groups. A key aspect of
meeting this goal is the implementation of an experimental-computational feedback loop via close interactions
with our collaborators. In addition, our participation in the SAMPL computational chemistry challenges by
supplying blinded (acyclic) CB[n] binding constant datasets will synergistically advance methods for aqueous
binding free energies calculations."
10842183,"Machine Learning-Assisted Integrated Optofluidic Nanoplasmonic Biosensing for Precision
 Immune Profiling and Monitoring
Abstract: The intricate and dynamic nature of the immune system demands a comprehensive understanding
of its functional behavior for effective prediction and treatment of immune-related diseases. Cytokines, vital for
intercellular signaling, offer invaluable insights into a range of diseases, including infections, cancer, autoimmune
disorders, and allergy transplantation. Prompt and precise multiparametric cytokine detection at the point of care
is essential for comprehending patients' dynamic immune responses. In our previous MIRA project, we
developed integrated optofluidic nanoplasmonic biosensing platforms for high-throughput, sensitive, and
multiplex cytokine detection from whole blood to single-cell levels. Building on our past accomplishments, we
propose to develop high performance integrated optofluidic nanoplasmonic biosensing technologies for immune
analysis and incorporate machine learning techniques to enable precision Immune profiling and monitoring for
better patient care. The primary objectives of this renewal application are to: 1) advance the next generation of
serum immunoassays by integrating the power of machine learning (ML) to engineer state-of-art plasmonic
nanomaterials and capture probes with significantly enhanced sensing performance for rapid, reliable and
effective diagnosis at point-of-care; 2) Develop ML-enhanced micropillar-based in situ immunoassays for real-
time immune monitoring of on-chip in vitro models for high-resolution, high-throughput immune profiling towards
personalized immunomodulatory therapies; 3) Establish an innovative integrated method by embedding
nanoplasmon rulers within a hydrogel matrix to map the 3D spatiotemporal cytokine secretion profiles of
individual immune cells encapsulated in the hydrogel, providing new insights into immune cell behavior and
communication in a 3D physiologically relevant context. Our vision is to bridge the gap in our fundamental
understanding of the immune system and enhance the diagnostic and predictive power for immune system
diseases. The advanced integrated optofluidic nanoplasmonic biosensing platforms, empowered by machine
learning, will gear the biologists and clinicians with the ability to rapidly and precisely determine patients' immune
statuses. This transformative achievement holds enormous potential for both fundamental research and clinical
applications, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes and more effective therapies for immune-related
diseases."
10842198,"All eukaryotes relies on calcium ion (Ca2+) as a second messenger to respond to internal and external signals.
Defects in Ca2+-based signaling cause numerous human diseases. Despite the importance and broad medical
implications, Ca2+ signaling mechanisms remain unclear. The challenging question concerns how Ca2+ encodes
specific information coming from different primary signals and translate them into distinct responses at cellular,
organ, and organismal levels. Encoding and decoding the specificity of Ca2+ signals have thus remain a long-
standing puzzle in the signal transduction field. The PI’s laboratory studies Ca2+ signaling mechanisms using a
model plant (Arabidopsis). Discoveries in Arabidopsis have established new conceptual framework applicable to
Ca2+ signaling mechanisms in all eukaryotes and set the stage for this application. The breakthrough in Ca2+-
encoding mechanism in plant innate immunity has demonstrated that plants and animals both recognize bacterial
pathogens by cell surface receptors, followed by Ca2+ second messenger that activates the immune responses,
providing a unified paradigm in Ca2+-mediated defense signaling in eukaryotes. The guided pollen tube
elongation resembles axon guidance and fungal hyphae growth in that all these polarized cell growth processes
involve specific Ca2+ oscillations orchestrated by multiple Ca2+ channels and transporters. The discovery of a
new family of Ca2+ channels in male-female recognition prior to fertilization reinforces a general paradigm that
Ca2+ signaling is a common language in cell-cell communication during reproduction. In the next five years, PI’s
research will expand beyond the current project to include several new directions. In addition to continuing the
studies on cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs) in the contexts of pollen tube growth and innate immunity
in the current project, the new program will include research on the newly discovered Ca2+ channels in
reproductive cell death of male and female cells, root mechano-sensing, and plant-fungal interactions. The
overall goals are to identify the influx Ca2+ channels and efflux transporters that control the dynamic changes in
cytosolic Ca2+ levels, uncover regulatory mechanisms how these Ca2+-transporting proteins are regulated by
external cues, and piece together signaling pathways that couple signals to responses in specific physiological
contexts. The general approach is to utilize genetic tools to identify genes responsible for each signaling pathway,
followed by electrophysiology and cell biology procedures to reconstitute the pathway in a cellular context,
completed with biochemical and structural methods to evaluate structure-function relationship of gene products
and deduce mechanistic processes. Such combination of tools has been proved to be highly effective and
successful in dissecting the molecular mechanisms for Ca2+-encoding in PI’s ongoing research. Completion of
the project will reveal new Ca2+ encoding mechanisms, contributing to the conceptual framework of Ca2+
signaling, which is highly relevant to human health."
10841878,"Planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling controls the polarization of cells within the plane of an epithelium, orienting
asymmetric cellular structures, cell divisions and cell migration. Numerous medically important developmental
defects and physiological processes in vertebrates are under control of PCP signaling, motivating considerable
interest in understanding the fundamental logic and underlying mechanisms controlling PCP. Major advances
toward achieving this understanding have come from leveraging of genetic approaches only possible in
Drosophila, and the evident conservation of mechanism reinforces the utility of flies as a model system. I
propose that the next major leaps in understanding will emerge from continued innovation in genetic
approaches and from expanding the reach of these approaches by employing them in cross-disciplinary
studies with technologies such as single molecule imaging and advanced biochemistry.
In flies, PCP signaling controls the orientation of hairs on the adult cuticle, chirality and orientation of
ommatidia in the eye, orientation of cell divisions and related processes in other tissues. Several distinct
molecular modules contribute to PCP signaling. The core module acts both to generate molecular asymmetry
within cells and to coordinate the direction of polarization between neighboring cells. One or more global
directional modules orient core polarization with respect to tissue axes, and distinct effector modules interpret
core polarity to direct morphogenetic responses.
A key goal has been to understand the fundamental workings of the core PCP module. Proteins in the core
module segregate within cells to form distinct complexes on opposite sides of the cell, and form intercellular
bridges that signal polarity between cells. The observed behavior of this module, combined with mathematical
modeling, indicates that the system likely acts as a bistable switch, breaking symmetry to produce a stable,
polarized array. Positive and negative feedback necessarily underlie the function of this module, but the
molecular mechanisms generating feedback are as yet unknown. Furthermore, molecular-scale asymmetry in
PCP is coupled to the formation of clustering of polarity components into discrete puncta, yet the precise role
of clustering in polarization is not known. Our major focus going forward will be the dissection of core PCP
mechanisms by developing and employing novel genetic tools and by combining these tools with single
molecule imaging and advanced biochemistry to unlock an understanding of PCP signaling that previously
applied experimental approaches have so far been unable to achieve. The proposed work will deliver an
unprecedented view of both the fundamental logic and the precise molecular mechanisms underlying PCP
signaling as well as lay the groundwork for potential therapeutic interventions for PCP related pathologies."
10843756,"Project Summary
Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are critical sensors of extracellular pH that contribute to excitability in cells
in both the central and peripheral nervous system. ASICs couple the binding of extracellular protons to the
opening of a sodium selective pore. Preliminary research has suggested that ASICs may be viable targets in
the treatment of pain as well as ischemic events such as stroke. There are 5 ASIC isoforms that give rise to at
least 7 different channel subunits. ASICs form both homo- and heterotrimers and their precise properties are
governed by the channel composition. Research in my lab focuses on the molecular mechanisms underlying
ASIC function and how these channels are fine tuned in neurons. Our first focus is on using cutting-edge
techniques to measure conformational changes in ASICs. Using a FRET approach that replaces the donor
fluorophore with a transition metal ion, we can measure channel dynamics in full-length ASICs in real cells.
With these data, we can build mechanistic models for how ASICs open, close, and desensitize. Despite the
prevalence of heteromeric ASIC complexes in neurons, little is known about the stoichiometry of ASIC
heteromers or the mechanism of heteromer formation. Using a new fluorescence approach called spatial
intensity distribution analysis (SpIDA), we will be able to look at how different ASIC isoforms heteromerize.
Previous work has looked at the stoichiometry of ASIC1a/ASIC2a heteromers, but no other combination has
been studied. Our work will provide the first look at heteromerization between these other ASIC combinations.
In principle, this approach is also compatible with looking at stoichiometry of endogenous receptors in neurons.
We will begin to build our system in that direction. Lastly, we are interested in the macromolecular complexes
that ion channels form. ASICs are known to associate with the Stomatin (STOM) family of proteins. We have
demonstrated that STOM binds to ASIC3 and reduces the current by almost 200-fold. In addition, we have
localized the binding site for STOM on ASIC3 to two critical regions. The first is the distal C-terminus and the
second in the first transmembrane domain (TM1). Extending this work, we plan to use patch clamp
electrophysiology to determine the mechanism of STOM-dependent regulation of ASIC3. In addition, we hope
to extend this work to include other members of the STOM family including Stomatin-like protein 3 (STOML3).
Overall, these studies will provide new insights in two how ASICs function both at the structural and cellular
levels."
10827659,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The laboratory mouse, the best genetically defined experimental vertebrate model organism for humans,
continues to be the primary animal research model of human disease and is a key tool for the translational
hands-on training required to engage in modern scientific research, veterinary science, and clinical settings.
However, while many institutions provide access to online training modules, few if any have coordinated,
intensive, hands-on training in the laboratory mouse. Moreover, there are unmet needs to lower the barriers to
participation in advantageous training by diverse and disadvantaged learner groups, to provide equitable access
and, in alignment with stated NIH priorities, to train and diversify the biomedical workforce. To help address this,
The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) proposes to provide a traveling workshop, entitled Foundational Training in the
Use of the Laboratory Mouse as a Model of Human Disease, to be held at partner minority-serving institutions
(MSI). This workshop will provide learning and skills development focused on fundamental techniques that are
employed across a wide variety of animal research and animal models of human disease. The proposed Aims
of the workshop are: (1) To deliver foundational, experiential, training in the use of the laboratory mouse that
participants can apply to their research and that will facilitate their career development; and (2) To facilitate
engagement, active learning, and skills development by diverse and disadvantaged learners by partnering with
MSI to bring hands-on workshops and experiential learning to their institutions. Participants completing this
workshop will obtain valuable exposure, perspective, and skills in the use of laboratory mice for biomedical
research and as models of human disease and they will learn techniques that they can apply to their research
and that will facilitate their career development. JAX is uniquely positioned to execute these traveling workshops:
the program will be facilitated by certified and experienced lead instructors from JAX and mobile lab equipment
has already been acquired in order to be able to hold this workshop at any partner institution that has basic lab
space and a vivarium. Indeed, we have successfully piloted this program at a partner MSI, with highly positive
participant feedback. We will offer the proposed program at no cost to the host institutions or to the program
participants, making the workshop incredibly accessible and inclusive."

Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Hematopoiesis, organized by Drs. Trista
North, Michael Kharas and Nina Cabezas-Wallscheid. The conference will be held in Copper, Colorado from
February 25-28, 2024.
Beyond the field’s primary focus on blood and bone marrow-related biology and disease, expanding research in
hematology has contributed to fundamental shifts in areas such as our understanding of stem cell biology and
the workings of the non-coding transcriptome and the epigenome, which have provided insights into the origins
and treatment of diseases. Further, hematological cells have served as a testing ground for technological
advancements such as therapeutic genome engineering and next-generation sequencing efforts for cancer
diagnosis. Importantly, the development of targeted small molecule therapeutics and the introduction of immune-
based cellular therapies have shown direct clinical benefits. This conference was developed to bring together
biochemists, geneticists, molecular biologists and clinicians to bridge new insights into the biological
mechanisms that control developmental hematopoiesis, hematopoietic stem cell biology and cell fate control with
the diagnosis, progression and treatment of aging, inflammatory conditions and hematologic disorders and
malignancies. This conference will highlight emerging technologies, including single cell multi-omics and imaging
approaches, which are poised to fundamentally change our understanding of blood development and
homeostasis and cellular engineering methods that have substantial potential for clinical applications. The
conference will also feature emerging discoveries, such as insights into the role of clonal hematopoiesis that
predisposes individuals to hematopoietic disease and leukemic transformation. Finally, the event will provide a
platform for investigators from across disciplines and around the globe to establish productive collaborations and
stimulate new ideas to enable substantial progress and address ongoing challenges in the hematology field."

Partial support is requested for graduate students and post-doctoral fellows, and junior and midcareer faculty
to participate in the Gordon Research Seminar and Conference (GRS/GRC) entitled “Plasminogen Activation
and Extracellular proteolysis”, which will be held in Ventura, CA on February 17-18 and 18-23, 2024,
respectively. This will be the 19th GRC, as the conference has been held continuously every two years since
1990. The theme of the 2024 GRC will be Cutting-Edge Research, Emerging Therapeutics, and Clinical
Outcomes with major focus on mechanisms and therapeutic targets of extracellular proteolytic enzymes,
including plasmin(ogen), plasminogen activators, coagulation proteases, matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs),
their precursors and effectors. Recent data suggest that the expression of proteases with circulation and the
extravascular compartments of tissues is tied to numerous pathological processes. Our invited speakers and
discussion leaders will present their recent and emerging work across a spectrum of basic science and clinical
topics, including cardiovascular disease, aging, cerebrovascular function, metabolic diseases, musculoskeletal
and neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, infection and immunity, tissue remodeling and regeneration, as well
as trauma. Priority will be placed on highlighting both the role these proteins play as disease modifiers as well
the utility of employing or targeting these factors for therapy. One of the major goals for the 2024 GRC meeting
is translating basic research into clinical outcomes. Attendees will be selected by invitation and from
applications submitted online. They will be chosen to represent not only a diverse spectrum of research, but a
strong emphasis will be on diversity of participants, equity of opportunity, and inclusion of individuals across all
demographic metrics. There will be participation of women, scientists from underrepresented groups, and
people with disability as session leaders and speakers. An intended strength of this meeting will be the
interaction and networking of the young scientists in the field, with the discussion leaders and the speakers.
The associated GRS, which is a much younger feature of the conference, will provide a unique opportunity for
trainees and scientists to share in the GRC experience. This two-day seminar will be organized by Graduate
Students and Postdoctoral Fellows with the support of leading researchers and the GRC Chairs and will allow
junior researchers within the field of plasminogen activation, MMP, and extracellular proteolysis to come
together to discuss their current research, while building informal networks with their peers that may lead to a
lifetime of collaboration and scientific achievement."

Food allergy affects up to 8% of the US population, but research in food allergy has lagged behind that of other
atopic diseases. There has been a marked uptick in research in food allergy in the past 10 years, contributing to
FDA approval of the first therapy for peanut allergy in 2020. There is more interest in food allergy from a variety
of disciplines, and there is a need to capitalize on this increased interest to accelerate growth in the field. We
(the Chairs of these events) are proposing the 2024 Gordon Research Conference & Seminar in Food Allergy
as a means to increase the breadth, diversity, and inclusion of our food allergy research community by bringing
together the global community of basic science and clinical investigators, invested organizations, and
stakeholders to discuss recent advances in our understanding of immune mechanisms involved in the induction
of tolerance versus allergic responses to food and the application of these principles to emerging treatment
approaches for food allergy. By bringing together leading scientists in and related to the field of food allergy, and
the promotion of young scientists and scientists from groups underrepresented in the field, our objective is to
spark collaborations and new paradigms that will accelerate the growth of the food allergy research field and to
nurture and develop the next generation of emerging clinical food allergy investigators. Further, we hope to
significantly increase participation of early and mid-career investigators over more established thought leaders
and take full advantage of the GRC format to encourage robust scientific interaction and discussion among
participants from a wide range of institutions. We propose to employ best practices in conference planning
including representation of across gender identities, underrepresented groups, diverse racial backgrounds and
geographic regions, and adhere to GRC Code of conduct which includes zero tolerance policy for discriminatory
behavior on the basis of identity, and zero tolerance for physical, verbal or sexual harassment. The 2024 Food
Allergy Gordon Conference & Seminar will focus on emerging science in food allergy obtained from human
immunology, mouse models, and clinical trials. This conference will highlight advances in our understanding of
basic immune mechanisms of allergy and tolerance to foods by focusing on emerging science obtained from
mouse models, human immunology, and clinical trials. Novel areas of concentration include key systems that
interact with and shape immunity, including microbiome, the nervous system, and the skin-gut axis. We will also
highlight science supporting emerging treatment approaches for food allergy. This conference and preceding
seminar aims to stimulate discussion among investigators from multiple disciplines and disease areas, with the
goal of developing a universal language for all stakeholders to improve clinical care practices, facilitate research
to better understand the disease processes, and improve current and novel therapeutics."

For an eligible patient with end stage kidney disease (ESRD), a living donor (LD) kidney transplant is the best
option. But the LD has to have a major operation with surgical risks and the potential long-term risks of living
with a single kidney. A number of studies comparing LDs with age, gender and race/ethnicity-matched
general population controls have found no differences in long-term outcomes between the LDs and controls.
However, recent studies comparing LDs to healthy matched controls have reported that the LDs are at
increased risk for ESRD and death. There have been concerns about the matching of LDs and controls in these
studies, including the matched controls were not contemporaneous [born in the same year]; were not from the
same geographic area; were not known to be healthy on the date that matched the date of donation; and were
not matched for family history of ESRD. Each of these factors can impact the risk of developing kidney disease
and consequences of kidney disease. There have been concerns about the limited follow-up and the statistical
analyses in these studies. In fact, some commentaries have suggested that the LD risk was under-estimated;
others, overestimated. Having a complete and accurate understanding of true long-term LD risks is important
to provide data to inform future LD candidates (informed consent), as well as to inform the design of long-term
health maintenance/surveillance of donors. Government agencies, other stakeholders and LDs themselves are
asking for better quality long-term data on LD outcomes. The University of Minnesota (U of Mn) and the Mayo
Clinic have longstanding LD transplant programs (1st transplant in 1963) with data collection beginning at the
time of the first transplant. In addition, the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) in the early 1960s
established a linked medical records system that has followed the medical history of residents of Olmsted
County and surrounding area (same geographic are as U of Mn and Mayo Clinic). Data from the REP has been
used to provide long-term data on healthy populations, and methods are in place to identify healthy matched
controls from the REP. We will match LDs with contemporaneous REP controls on age, gender, race/ethnicity
and other important characteristics known to affect risk of kidney disease (e.g., BMI, smoking history, blood
pressure). We will also match LDs and controls for being healthy (with normal renal function) on the date of
donation and on family history of kidney disease. Because of the detailed, long-term (>50 year follow-up)
quality data in the LD and REP datasets, we will be able to study and provide the best data to date on: LD risk
of ESRD and death; LD risk of the much more common intermediate events that precede ESRD or death (e.g.,
deterioration of kidney function, cardiovascular disease); impact of known risk factors such as BMI or smoking
on the risk of donation; the impact of new onset disease after donation (e.g., diabetes, hypertension) on LD
outcomes; and the impact of donation on subsequent pregnancies. We will provide most comprehensive data,
to date, to inform prospective LDs about long-term risk, and to inform the follow-up and care of current LDs."

The primary objective of the Translational Research Support Core (TRSC) is to promote research translation
and accelerate basic, applied, and community-focused studies to support the overall goal of the Texas A&M
Center for Environmental Health Research to “advance innovative solutions for addressing exposure-stressor
interactions in underserved populations in urban and urbanizing areas in the state of Texas”. This Core builds
from the prior success of the Integrated Health Science Facility Core that enabled innovative translational
research across three domains: (1) human community-focused studies; (2) animal models of human disease;
and (3) novel alternative toxicology models through competitive $10,000 use vouchers to support diverse
translational studies. Rigor, transparency and accountability of this operational model, that distributed over
$310,000 in vouchers in the first 4 years of the Center, allowed for realization of tangible and substantial scholarly
impact through publications and new awards from NIEHS, EPA and other sources exceeding $7,000,000. To
further enhance member access to facilities and resources that stimulate translational science, the TRSC will
lead activities accelerating investigator-driven, translationally focused studies across three updated workspaces:
(1) molecular phenotyping (-omics and imaging), (2) experimental models (animal and cell-based new approach
methods), and (3) exposomics (both targeted and untargeted analytical approaches). This approach aligns with
the Center’s community and mechanistic themes to bolster translation across the NIEHS research framework.
Accordingly, the TRSC will administer $15,000 vouchers for use across the three workspaces through quarterly
solicitations. The molecular phenotyping workspace provides members priority access, training and support for
diverse imaging technologies and -omics tools, from whole genome, to targeted high-throughput and single cell.
The experimental models workspace offers members services and support for creating and characterizing new
models, including in vitro (human and mouse organoids, iPSCs, and tissue chips) and in vivo (population-wide
mouse and transgenic/knockout models) coupled with easy access to exposure (i.e., inhalation chambers) and
response resources (i.e., physiological phenotyping). The exposomics workspace provides members efficient
access to state-of-the-art analytical instrumentation and methodologies for experimental- and field-based
applications. Overall, the TRSC will promote interdisciplinary collaborations, a hallmark of translational, by
prioritizing high impact vouchers (i.e. collaborative team science) and delivering expert advice on experimental
design and research compliance. The TRSC will work closely with the other Center Cores to maximize research
translation, especially as it pertains to under-resourced communities in the urban and urbanizing areas across
the state (the Texas Triangle). Cores will integrate curriculum with a focus on the policymaking process and
communicating research to achieve actionable outcomes at changing exposures and improving public health."
10830705,"Data Science Facility Core ABSTRACT
The vision for the Texas A&M Center for Environmental Health Research (TiCER) is to nucleate research
and translational activities of faculty around the overarching theme “Innovative solutions for addressing
exposure-stressor interactions in underserved population in urban and urbanizing areas in the state of Texas.”
The Data Science Facility Core (DSFC) will provide key enabling services in data collection, storage, analysis,
and integration to assist members of the Center to fulfill this mission. Key data science challenges that the DSFC
will address include the high dimensionality of novel biological and chemical data streams, the need to translate
data into actionable knowledge for environmental health decision-making, the need to geospatially contextualize
data at the level of local communities. The DSFC will support these needs by leveraging data science expertise
and resources across Texas A&M. There is a nearly ubiquitous need for such services across the Center’s four
research themes: Stressors to Responses; Environment and Metabolism; Climate Change and Health; and
Environmental Justice and Policy. Thus, the DSFC will serve as a key facilitator of interactions across the entire
Center. The DSFC’s overarching goals are to provide novel and state-of-the-art data science services to support
and integrate the Center’s scientific and outreach activities. This goal will be accomplished by providing services
in several specialized and complex areas of data science— bioinformatics/biostatistics, risk sciences, and
geospatial sciences—as well as providing a central data repository for Center investigators. In the
bioinformatics/biostatistics area, the DSFC will focus on analysis and interpretation of complex data streams,
especially the emergence of single cell-based analyses. In the risk assessment area, the focus will be on
characterizing and predicting chemical toxicity through both mechanistic and data-driven mathematical/statistical
models that integrate multiple diverse data sets. Furthermore, geographic information systems have emerged
as an essential element of identifying and solving environmental health problems, especially climate change, as
well as communicating and tailoring policy interventions. DSFC is adding personnel with extensive experience
in geospatial analytics, data integration, and visualization, enabling it to substantially enhance the impact of
Center research in support of communities and decision-makers. Finally, integration of data will be facilitated
through a common data repository, the design and development of which will be closely coordinated with the
rest of the Center, and which be indexed for searching and data mining. The DSFC will provide these services
through direct support from Core senior personnel and as well as a flexible staff that can vary in effort depending
on needs. The DSFC will work closely with the Administrative Core to encourage investigators’ use of the DSFC
and access and track the Core’s operation and funding allocations. The leaders of the DSFC have an established
track record of collaborative, interdisciplinary, and translational research, and are well positioned to support the
data science needs across the Center to address environmental exposures in Texas and beyond.

10830706,"Community Engagement Core (CEC): ABSTRACT
The overarching mission of the Texas A&M Center for Environmental Health Research (TiCER) is “Building
on TAMU’s ongoing investments in people and facilities and a history of state-wide outreach to community
stakeholders, with a particular focus on climate change and underserved populations.” The goal is to promote
research translation and accelerate basic, applied, and community-focused studies to advance innovative
solutions for addressing exposure-stressor interactions in underserved populations in urban and urbanizing
areas in Texas. The Community Engagement Core (CEC) will be the primary conduit for bi-directional
communication between Center members and communities across and within the Texas Urban Triangle (TUT).
The mission of the CEC is to develop, test, and disseminate data-driven community engagement outcomes and
interventions which increase local resilience to existing environmental risks in lieu of climate change, particularly
in underserved communities. This mission will be accomplished by addressing three key elements of bi-
directional engagement. The problem identification element will focus on engaging communities to identify and
prioritize health concerns related to acute environmental emergency events. The development of prevention
and intervention strategies will focus on the use of citizen science, community design, and tools to help solve
community problems which can be used to scale-up successful translation activities of the CEC to communities
beyond our initial partners. The communication of findings and identification of disparities will focus on the
communication of scientific findings to residents and stakeholders, as well as the revelation of specific conditional
inequalities across communities and regions, namely related to marginalized areas. The decision- and policy-
making element will apply the research findings of Center members to the development of evidence-based
policies in coordination with community stakeholders, enabling long-term improvements in public health and
lowering risk and vulnerability levels related to environmental emergency events. The leaders of the CEC have
an established track record of collaborative, interdisciplinary, and community-engaged projects and are well
positioned to transmit community priorities to Center members and facilitate the translation of Center findings to
protect the publics’ health and achieve more informed decision-making across the continuum of stakeholders,
from individuals to communities to policy makers."

The Texas A&M Center for Translational Environmental Health Research (TiCER) is a major hub for the
development and growth of health research on campus through attracting faculty from multiple schools, colleges,
and departments. In addition, TiCER scientists play leading roles in ongoing environmental health programs
including the P42 Superfund Basic Research Program, the T32 Toxicology Training Grant in Regulatory
Sciences, and the Interdisciplinary Faculty of Toxicology (IFT). TiCER and earlier funded P30 grants at Texas
A&M University focused on impacting underserved rural areas, a focus that will be continued and expanded in
the renewal grant application. The Pilot Project Program (PPP) plays a key role in many aspects of the center
by stimulating research in areas consistent with center goals and by funding novel studies conducted by faculty
not previously committed to environmental health research. This approach is critical to the expansion of the
center and development of new thematic areas of research including “Climate Change and Health,” which grew
out of PPP funding. Thus, the PPP is a critical element in both the ongoing and future health research activities
of the center as is evidenced by the large number of applicants for PPP funding from multiple academic units. In
order to maintain and improve the PPP, four major Aims will be pursued: 1) Maintaining a well-organized Pilot
Project structure that will announce, disseminate, receive review, and fund individual and collaborative projects
in a timely fashion as outlined in the grant application; 2) Attract junior faculty and investigators new to
environmental health research in order to expand this field and develop new collaborations and themes; 3)
Enchance collaborative research not only in “individual” Pilot Projects but also through “collaborative grant”
competitions; 4) Encourage inter-Center collaborations that will involve faculty from more than one center as this
will further enhance the overall impact of proposed collaborative research."

Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Multiple Sclerosis affect millions of people
globally. Researchers have made recent advances in studying these diseases by analyzing single cells in
postmortem brain tissues. But these diseases are complex and hard to understand. We aim to create a
comprehensive atlas of cell types and states in the human brain across the spectrum of neurodegenerative
diseases. We plan to do this by harmonizing and analyzing data with BRAIN Initiative-generated reference data
using state-of-the-art methods. By creating this atlas, we hope to identify potential targets for therapy and develop
new treatments for these debilitating diseases. This project will provide a valuable resource for the neuroscience
community by allowing a more comprehensive understanding of the cellular landscape in healthy and diseased
brains, facilitating comparisons between normal and pathological conditions."

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common, chronic inflammatory disease of the skin that affects 10% of adults. AD is
associated with major health-related quality-of-life (QoL) and psychosocial impairments that exceed those of
other serious chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. Despite the major physical
and emotional burdens that accompany AD, it remains an understudied skin disease among adults because,
until recently, AD had been incorrectly considered a childhood disease that remits in adulthood. Importantly,
our preliminary data reveal racial/ethnic differences in the severity of, QoL impact of, and health care utilization
for AD that suggest the presence of disparities in AD outcomes that deserve further study. Considering the
anticipated diversification of the U.S. population, such disparities are only expected to worsen if left
unaddressed. However, a critical barrier to identifying, understanding, and ultimately eliminating racial/ethnic
disparities in AD outcomes among adults exists due to the lack of adult AD cohorts with sufficient racial/ethnic
diversity and individual-level social and environmental contextual data that are necessary to comprehensively
evaluate the causes of such disparities. In order to address this barrier, we propose to create a cohort of
racially and ethnically diverse adults with AD within the socioeconomically disadvantaged and medically
underserved, urban neighborhood of North Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. North Philadelphia adult residents
represent a population that is vulnerable to a large burden of AD. With this cohort, we aim to perform a
longitudinal cohort study to: i) confirm and further characterize existing racial/ethnic disparities in AD outcomes
and health care utilization for AD among adults, and ii) identify the individual behavioral, social, and
environmental contextual factors that simultaneously contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in AD outcomes. We
will address these aims utilizing a novel transdisciplinary approach and a sequential mixed methods study
design in order to incorporate the lived experience of adults with AD in our studies. We hypothesize that
specific and potentially modifiable behavioral, social, and environmental factors contribute to racial/ethnic
disparities in AD outcomes. The new knowledge that will be gained from the proposed work is essential to
informing future individual- and community-level interventions to reduce racial/ethnic disparities and improve
AD outcomes among similar urban adult populations."

 The proposed research will interrogate natural product scaffolds as starting points for narrow-spectrum and
antivirulence agents. Of specific interest are compounds that target specific bacteria and/or mitigate bacterial
biofilms, which play a role in the development of resistance in bacteria, the rejection of medical implants, and
many other health related diseases. The compounds which this proposal will focus on, have been chosen from
privileged areas where bacteria utilize chemical warfare to prevent colonization of invading species. Here we
present a multi-faceted approach, including organic synthesis, molecular genetics, proteomics, transcriptomics,
and microbiological assays that begins with these privileged scaffolds but has as an overarching goal of
developing next generation therapeutics and tool compounds to better understand processes within a
multispecies environment.
 We will interrogate the chemical synthesis of natural product scaffolds identified from nature that possess
species-specific activity, which is ideal for the development of “narrow-spectrum” therapeutics and tool
compounds. Proposed scaffolds are derived from plant material, fungi, and rhizosphere bacteria and have
previously demonstrated biological activity. We propose to leverage diverted total synthesis to construct both the
lead compound and hypothesis-driven analogs for biological evaluation.
 We will also characterize antivirulence compounds that inhibit biofilm formation. Starting with reported natural
products with biofilm inhibitory activity, we will explore the unique chemical features that endow each molecule
with their biological effect. Furthermore, we will utilize the chemical toolbox to design compounds with improved
chemical and physical properties to improve the likelihood of translation. Analogs will then be tested with the
goal of identifying specific processes that the natural product affects and allow for a broader evaluation of the
target in general biofilm processes.
 Finally, we will investigate both the biological target and properties of the tool compounds both in single
species and multispecies biofilms. This approach will employ a combination of genetic and MS-proteomic
techniques to develop a candidate list of proteins, from which we will identify the targets by biochemical studies.
Previous research has demonstrated that these sources have provided compounds with unprecedented
biological activity with significant implications to improving human health. Furthermore, they act on therapeutic
targets that were previously unknown providing new approaches to combat bacteria."

Opiate use, dependence and addiction represent enduring public health issues, resulting in substantial financial
and societal health burdens, as well as increasing numbers of overdoses. Drug addiction is characterized as a
chronic, relapsing disease. However, to date, there remains insufficient data examining the molecular
mechanisms underlying persistent opiate-induced neurobiological changes, which has led to a scarcity of
effective therapies and interventions to treat and prevent relapse.
 Drug addiction has long been thought of as a disorder of dopamine (DA) signaling. However, therapeutic
interventions targeting receptor mediated DA neurotransmission have not yet resulted in fully efficacious
treatments. Therefore, an overarching goal of our laboratories – and the focus of this application – has been to
investigate novel, non-canonical actions of DA involved in mediating addiction phenotypes. Our laboratory
recently identified a novel signaling moiety for DA in brain, termed dopaminylation (dop), whereby DA acts as
a donor source for the establishment of post-translational modifications (PTM) on substrate proteins (e.g.,
histone H3) via transamidation by the Transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) enzyme. In more recent efforts by our lab to
unbiasedly identify additional substrates of these PTMs (focused now on synaptic proteins in nucleus
accumbens/NAc, a key brain reward region), we developed a novel chemical tagging approach that, when
coupled to mass spectrometry, allowed for the discovery of hundreds of dopaminylated proteins in brain, both in
the context of normal neural function and in response to aberrant dopamine signaling following chronic heroin
self-administration (SA) in rats. Among them, gCaMKII: 1) was found to be robustly dopaminylated at only a
single amino acid residue located within its autoinhibitory helix [glutamine (Q)285], a site that exists only two
amino acids away from a critical threonine (T) residue (287), which when phosphorylated directs Calmodulin
(CaM) sequestration; 2) is upregulated in its dopaminylation following heroin SA, both during acute and
prolonged abstinence, but not in response to natural rewards; and 3) represents a critical substrate involved in
mediating long range signals from the synapse to nucleus in brain, ultimately promoting CREB activation and
neuronal plasticity. Thus, this dopaminylation event on gCaMKII may represent a critical convergent mechanism
linking altered dopaminergic signaling in response to heroin to CREB mediated transcriptional abnormalities. As
such, we hypothesize that gCaMKIIQ285dop may play a direct role in mediating heroin relapse via aberrant
modulation of CREB signaling in NAc. In Aim 1, we will fully characterize gCaMKIIQ285dop’s temporal effects
on drug taking vs. relapse vulnerability in the context of heroin SA. In Aim 2, we will explore gCaMKIIQ285dop’s
effects on CREB signaling/transcription following heroin SA, events that may precipitate relapse vulnerability. In
Aim 3, we will investigate roles for gCaMKIIQ285dop mediated CREB signaling/transcription in D1 vs. D2
dopamine receptor-expressing MSNs during abstinence from heroin SA in the regulation of relapse behaviors."

 Urinary stone disease (USD) affects up to 12% of individuals in developed countries, and is associated with
significant morbidity, pain, and annual US health care costs of >$10 billion. There is strong evidence of
heritability, however risk factors remain relatively obscure. Our prior work in the Rare Kidney Stone
Consortium (RKSC) developed a targeted nephrology gene capture panel (tNGS) with 144 known and
candidate USD genes and resolved ~30% of >500 patients suspected of monogenic USD due to early onset
nephrolithiasis (NL), nephrocalcinosis (NC), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and/or multiple stones, with ~15
different genes implicated. In addition to making a definitive diagnosis, in many cases the resulting information
revealed new treatment options or directed patients to specific clinical trials. Here we propose extending our
understanding of the spectrum of genes and variants associated with monogenic NL/NC in the RKSC cohort,
including functional in vitro analyses of variants of uncertain significance (VUS; Aim #1). In parallel, we will
study a cohort of >50,000 Mayo Clinic biobank patients with detailed linked medical record information
(~12.7% with stones) (Aim #2). Findings in this Biobank cohort will be validated and extended in a Prospective
Kidney Stone Cohort of more than 550 first time USD patients and 480 matched controls (Aim #3). This third
community-based cohort has detailed clinical and biochemical data, including comprehensive assessment of
symptomatic and radiographic recurrence, and will thus allow detailed study of potential mechanism(s) of
implicated genes. This proposal takes advantage of available genetic analyses in Aim #2 and Aim #3 that
includes whole exome sequence (WES) as well as genomewide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data
for association studies. Studies will determine if coding, noncoding, and expression related variants of
monogenic USD genes are associated with NL/NC risk and correlate with biochemical determinants of stones.
 Our Specific aims are: Aim #1: Genotype patients suspected of monogenic forms of USD using global
NGS approaches; Aim #2: Validate identified genetic USD risks in a Mayo Clinic Biobank cohort including first
time and recurrent calcium stone patients and controls with WES and SNP association studies; Aim #3:
Characterize genetic USD risks and pathways in a prospective chart-validated cohort of first-time symptomatic
calcium stone patients with age-sex- matched controls with WES and SNP association studies.
 Our overall hypothesis is: variants in monogenic USD genes not only explain Mendelian disease, but are
risk factors for the common (predominately calcium) USD that is found in the general community. This study will
improve understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of monogenic USD and impact patient treatments and
clinical trial recruitment. Risk factors for common US and its recurrence will also be identified."

Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a major global health problem that affects over 1 billion people globally and leads
up to 2 million deaths annually. Chronic liver injury is typically silent, but when persistent may lead to liver fibrosis,
which can progress to cirrhosis and clinically significant portal hypertension complications (such as ascites,
esophageal variceal hemorrhage, and hepatic encephalopathy). These clinical signs are the most common
cause of mortality from CLD, and for which liver transplantation is the only available curative intervention. Since
the demands for liver transplantation still far exceeds the supply of available donor organs, end-stage liver
disease represents the 11th leading cause of death worldwide. Hence, advances in the molecular understanding
of liver injury and pathobiology are critical to develop novel diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic tools, with the
goal to decrease the demand for liver transplantation in the future. For several years, my research has focused
on the study of individuals with rare liver phenotypes of unknown etiology as a roadmap to uncover novel
molecular mechanism(s) underlying liver pathology that may be relevant to the pathogenesis and treatment of
common liver diseases. As part of this ongoing effort, we recently found that recessive genotypes in a small
GTPase, named GIMAP5, cause liver sinusoidal endothelial cell capillarization and liver dysfunction. Taking
advantage of an available Gimap5 loss-of-function (LOF) mutant mouse model, which recapitulates the
sinusoidal endothelial cell capillarization phenotype seen in Gimap5-deficient humans, we demonstrate that
Gimap5 is expressed in liver endothelial cells and its selective deletion in these cells lead to liver sinusoidal
endothelial cell (LSEC) de-differentiation into capillarized endothelial cells (CECs). Furthermore, single cell RNA-
sequencing analysis of sorted liver endothelial cells isolated from Gimap5-deficient and Gimap5-sufficient mice
shows a near complete replacement of healthy LSECs by CECs. Importantly, LSEC de-differentiation into CECs
is an event described in liver fibrosis, in general, independent of the etiology of liver injury. Here, we propose to
define the key contributors in maintaining LSEC identity and preventing hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cell
capillarization through the completion of the following two aims: (1) identify the cell extrinsic cues that signal
through GIMAP5 to maintain LSEC identity; and (2) characterize the Gimap5 signal transduction pathway in liver
endothelial cells. Collectively, the knowledge generated by this proposal has the potential to identify novel
therapeutic targets to revert CECs into healthy LSECs, and this way develop new non-invasive therapies for liver
fibrosis, cirrhosis and portal hypertension, which represent a major unmet medical need."
10836336,"Project Summary
 Many types of cancer – such as recurrent glioblastoma multiform, which is invariably lethal – overexpress
bulky glycoproteins to form a thick glycocalyx layer. The glycocalyx physically separates the cell from its
surroundings, but recent work has shown that the glycocalyx can paradoxically increase adhesion to soft tissues
and therefore promote the metastasis of cancer cells. This surprising phenomenon occurs because the
glycocalyx forces adhesion molecules (called integrins) on the cell's surface into clusters. These integrin clusters
have cooperative effects that allow them to form stronger adhesions to surrounding tissues than would be
possible with equivalent numbers of un-clustered integrins. These cooperative mechanisms have been intensely
scrutinized in recent years; a more nuanced understanding of the biophysical underpinnings of glycocalyx-
mediated adhesion could uncover therapeutic targets, deepen our general understanding of cancer metastasis,
and elucidate general biophysical processes that extend far beyond the realm of cancer research.
 Here I present the hypothesis that the glycocalyx has the additional effect of increasing mechanical tension
experienced by clustered integrins. Integrins function as mechanosensors that undergo structure-switching into
“active” conformations when subjected to mechanical tension. As such, my hypothesis would, if true, suggest a
more immediate regulatory role of the glycocalyx in adhesion than previously realized. This hypothesis (which I
call the local organization hypothesis) is well-supported through indirect observation in the research literature
but has not been directly tested due to challenges associated with measuring mechanical tension on individual
biomolecules in live cells. However, I have devoted much of my career to developing DNA-based
mechanosensor tools that can be used to directly measure piconewton-scale integrin tension in live cells. Here
I propose to utilize these tools to test the local organization hypothesis and bring clarity to this rapidly-growing
research field. I plan to image integrin forces during the early stages of cellular adhesion and test for a set of
specific observations that would support or refute the local organization hypothesis. In parallel, I plan to leverage
my computational skills to test this hypothesis using a sophisticated chemomechanical simulation method.
 For my postdoctoral (K00) work, I will transition into translational work and develop tools that leverage the
principles of glycocalyx-mediated adhesion for cancer diagnostic purposes. Because glycocalyx-presenting
cancer cells adhere more readily to soft substrates, I will develop a flow-based method for detecting circulating
tumor cells (CTCs) using soft substrates and substrates of varying stiffness that facilitate mechanoselection of
glycocalyx-presenting cancer cells. This mechanoselection-based method will enable mechanical profiling of
CTCs to determine what types of tissues are most vulnerable to metastasis and will also allow for conventional
biochemical profiling in parallel. This work will deliver a substantially enhanced understanding of the mechanisms
of metastasis, as well as tools that can put this improved understanding to diagnostic use in clinical settings."
10836855,"Malaria Epidemiology and Vector Biology of Invasive
Anopheles stephensi Across Rural and Urban Landscapes in Ethiopia
PROGRAM SUMMARY
Anopheles stephensi is a major malaria vector species in South Asia. Since its first detection on the
African continent in Djibouti in 2012, the distribution of this vector species has expanded to Ethiopia,
Sudan, Somalia, Kenya, and Nigeria. The emergence and spread of An. stephensi in Africa pose
serious challenges for malaria control and elimination in fast-growing urban Africa. Knowledge gaps
related to An. stephensi ecology and behavior and the effectiveness of intervention methods in Africa
have impeded the development of effective malaria control programs. Lack of sensitive surveillance
methods for An. stephensi has also hindered efforts to effectively track An. stephensi population
spread over time. To date, only limited basic research has examined the biology of invasive An.
stephensi mosquitoes and the impact of An. stephensi invasion on malaria epidemiology in Africa.
Little translational research has been conducted to develop new surveillance and control tools for An.
stephensi. To address the major knowledge gaps and challenges in malaria control and elimination in
the face of An. stephensi invasion and rapid spread across sub-Saharan Africa, our ICEMR
established a consortium of outstanding institutions and investigators from the U.S. and Ethiopia to
study critical scientific questions regarding malaria control and elimination efforts in the Greater Horn
of Africa. The overarching goals of this ICEMR are to 1) address the knowledge gaps in
invasive An. stephensi vector biology and malaria epidemiology across the rural to urban
continuum in Ethiopia; 2) develop surveillance tools and methods needed to track vector
spread; and 3) identify cost-effective vector control methods that can be adapted to settings
of varying malaria endemicity. The ICEMR has two projects, each with multiple specific objectives.
Project 1 will assess the vector biology of An. stephensi, elucidate the extent of spread of invasive
An. stephensi, and develop serological biomarkers for An. stephensi exposure surveillance. Project 2
will examine the impact of An. stephensi invasion on malaria risk and determine the epidemiological
impact and cost-effectiveness of larviciding methods targeting areas of high malaria risk across the
rural to urban landscape. The administrative and data management cores will provide support to the
entire program. Knowledge gained through this ICEMR is important to malaria control and
elimination, not only in Ethiopia, but also in other African countries with invasive An.
stephensi."

The U.S. mining industry has advanced technological innovations to improve safety, and health.
These technologies have reduced accidents and fatalities over the years. However, the industry has
one of the most dangerous environments for workers. The 2021 fatality rate of 16.15 was four
times the average rate for all US industries. Autonomous, robotic, and intelligent (ARI) systems
are the next frontiers for achieving zero fatality. This proposal will therefore advance research
initiatives, technological innovations, and interventions in ARI systems to eliminate mine fatalities
within the next two decades. The program will be carried out under the MERIT (Mine Escape,
Research, Innovations and Technology) Center at Missouri University of Science and Technology
(S&T) in collaborations with New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology (NMT), the mining
industry and NIOSH.
The proposal will (1) develop intelligent data analytics using artificial intelligence (AI) and
machine learning (ML) algorithms for analysis, predictions, and process management to assure
ARI systems; (2) develop cyber and systems network security to secure, protect, and prevent
adversarial attacks against ARI systems; (3) develop an integrated human-centered design and
change management system within human-centered operations for the new intelligent paradigm to
ensure smooth operations; (4) develop an intelligent communication system for bulk data transfer
with embedded systems for data warehousing, processing, and usage to provide 360O vision and
prevent collisions; (5) develop intelligent robot assistance in mining for safe operations in high-
temperature areas, areas with toxic and explosive gasses, or tight spaces for equipment
maintenance; and (6) create intelligent mine rescue and post-disaster surveillance for the emerging
ARI systems.

10837060,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Socioeconomic health disparities in sleep and behavior problems are evident from early childhood. Young
children in low-income families are at high risk of sleep and behavior problems, which often co-occur and
predict long-term poor mental and physical health. These problems cause added strain in families that are
already facing multiple poverty-related stressors, and family dysfunction in turn contributes to persistence and
worsening of sleep and behavior problems. Engaging the family is essential to treating co-morbid sleep
and behavior problems and preventing entrenched health disparities. Family interventions enhance child
health outcomes; moreover, because child sleep, child behavior, and family functioning are intertwined, a
successful intervention that addresses either sleep or behavior may lead to improvements both within and
across domains. However, low-income families are often reluctant to seek or accept early intervention.
Difficulty enrolling and retaining families undermines potential health benefits. Stigma associated with treating
behavior problems also discourages families from accepting treatment. This project determines how best to
overcome barriers to treatment in low-income families of children with co-morbid sleep and behavior
problems. We compare how low-income families respond to two empirically-supported home visiting
interventions, one treating sleep and the other treating behavior. Both are designed to address cultural,
motivational, and logistical barriers to engagement. We also take the innovative approach of testing whether
giving families a choice between a sleep or behavior intervention, so that the initial frame with which they enter
the intervention relationship is one of self-determination, enhances family engagement and child outcomes.
With a randomized, controlled trial design, we test effects of intervention (sleep vs. behavior),
engagement, and family input (choice vs. assigned) on child symptoms and family functioning, and
assess which intervention families most prefer, engage with, and value. We will enroll 500 low-income
toddlers with co-morbid sleep and behavior problems, randomized to 4 home-visiting interventions: sleep,
behavior, family choice (sleep or behavior), and an active control. At baseline and at 1, 5, and 9 months post-
intervention, we will assess child sleep and behavior and family functioning. We will measure family
preference, engagement, and perceived value of each intervention. Aim 1 is to examine effects of evidence-
based sleep and behavior interventions in young low-income children with co-morbid sleep and behavior
problems on child sleep and behavior and family functioning. Aim 2 is to determine whether parents prefer,
engage with, and value a sleep or behavior intervention more. Aim 3 is to examine if giving families a choice of
intervention results in higher engagement, higher perceived value and better family and child outcomes than
assignment to intervention. By informing best practices for engaging low-income families to treat co-morbid
sleep and behavior problems, results will be critical to reducing health disparities for children living in poverty."
10837061,"The Cryptococcus genus spans a diverse group of fungal species from environmental saprophytes to
common human pathogens. In fact, the Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii species complexes
cause >220,000 life-threatening infections each year in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent
patients, leading to >180,000 deaths, >15% of all HIV/AIDS-related deaths, and >70% mortality in low-income
countries. In studies supported by this award, we defined the structure, function, and evolution of a large genomic
region in Cryptococcus species that has co-evolved with pathogenesis, the fungal mating type (MAT) locus. The
Cryptococcus MAT locus is a large, complex gene cluster that controls sexual reproduction, infectious spore
production, and pathogenicity. We elucidated how these sex- and virulence-determining genes evolved from a
nonpathogenic ancestral state. Our studies reveal bipolar/inbreeding mating systems are shared by all of the
pathogenic species, and evolved from an ancestral outbreeding/tetrapolar system. Similar transitions occurred
in other fungal pathogens of plants and animals, suggesting convergent evolution in concert with host adaptation.
 In the prior award period, we made major advances characterizing the association of fungal MAT locus
evolution with virulence: 1) we sequenced the genomes/MAT loci of 24 species spanning all Cryptococcus
pathogens and aligned nonpathogens; 2) we defined Cryptococcus centromeres and implicated inter-
centromeric recombination in mating type and genome transitions; 3) we demonstrated the MAT-encoded RPL22
genes have essential, specialized functions. In the current proposal, we hypothesize that mating-type transitions
drove pathogen emergence resulting in a gene complex linked to virulence and infectious spore production.
 Our recent studies reveal unique aspects of MAT biology allowing us to propose new aims to test this
hypothesis. Aim 1 focuses on MAT locus structure and evolution, utilizing RNA-Seq and sRNA analysis to
define mRNA, asRNA, lncRNA, and siRNA produced by MAT during asexual/sexual reproduction, engineering
translocations to model tetrapolar-bipolar transition with CRISPR, and conducting Hi-C analysis to examine
nuclear organization of MAT and centromeres. Aim 2 will elucidate MAT functions linked to virulence and
development involving 1) MAT-encoded lncRNA ASM1, 2) diverged, specialized, essential ribosomal genes we
hypothesize operate as an ancestral imprinting system ensuring sexual reproduction fidelity, and 3) modeling in
mice of the role of a newly recognized host factor controlling immune protection against cryptococcal infections:
host GM-CSF signaling. Auto-antibodies against the GM-CSF cytokine are a major risk factor for lineage-specific
Cryptococcus infections, suggesting unique host features might play a role in evolution of infections due to
human pathogenic species. These studies will advance understanding of dynamic microbial genome evolution,
associating specific gene clusters to virulence and revealing unique host susceptibility determinants, with direct
implications for infectious disease evolution, treatment, and prevention."

Defective lens development is a major cause of congenital eye diseases, because the human lens is the
culmination of elaborate cell proliferation, differentiation and morphogenesis, requiring precise regulation by
signaling pathways. A molecular understanding of lens development could potentially lead to new ways of
diagnosing and treating congenital eye diseases originating from defective lens genesis. We have previously
demonstrated that Shp2 protein tyrosine phosphatase and Crk adaptor proteins are important for transmitting
FGF signaling in lens morphogenesis. In this application, we will investigate the molecular mechanism of Shp2
and Crk functions. Using conditional mutant mice and cell culture models, we will also identify Abl kinases as
novel negative regulators of FGF signaling. Furthermore, we will test the hypothesis that FGF signaling,
mediated by Crk, regulates the separation of the lens from the surface ectoderm, which underlies the human
congenital disease, Peter’s anomaly. As a major signaling pathway, perturbation in FGF signaling can cause
not only congenital diseases, but also metabolic syndromes and cancer. Therefore, study of FGF signaling has
far reaching implications for both human health and vision research."

 Opioid use disorder (OUD) is characterized by a problematic pattern of opioid use causing
significant personal impairment or distress and may lead to overdose and death. In 2021, there
were over 2.7 million Americans living with OUD and 106,699 Americans who died from an opioid
related overdose. Unfortunately, approved medications to treat OUD carry a high risk of
dependence and have had a limited effect. Therefore, new strategies for treating people with OUD
should be developed to address the significant unmet need.
 A new drug class of psychoplastogenic compounds (PC) is being explored for therapeutics
promoting structural and functional neural plasticity to treat substance use disorders (SUD).
Evidence of anti-addictive effects and pharmacology of PCs have recently been pioneered in the
context of psychopathological disorders, including depression, anxiety, and SUD. Single doses of
a potent PC, 5-MeO-DMT, have demonstrated long-lasting effects on participants, but little is
known about the dosing strategy and potential efficacy of reducing rates and severity of symptoms
of patients living with OUD. Inhalation is the primary route of administration of 5-MeO-DMT, but
dosing remains uncertain due to means of collection, purification, and inhalation drug delivery. In
this case, it seems inhalation is the most efficient systemic delivery mechanism to improve
bioavailability and avoid first pass hepatic metabolism but reaching the periphery of the lung for
effective systemic delivery is technically challenging.
 Given the strong need, we propose to create and test in-vivo a highly effective, consistent,
and efficiently targeted inhalation treatment using our proprietary dry powder aerosol technology
for pulmonary-to-systemic delivery of 5-MeO-DMT. A successful outcome of this project will be
the creation and in-vivo efficacy testing of a new type of targeted inhalation formulation containing
5-MeO-DMT to treat OUD. Quench Medical's technology has the potential to have a ground-
breaking impact on the field of SUD by delivering 5-MeO-DMT safely, consistently, and effectively
to patients living with OUD."

Memories of salient events in our lives are part of what makes us individuals. CaMKII has been shown to be
required in both vertebrates and invertebrates for short-term (STM) and long-term memory (LTM). CaMKII
protein is enriched at synapses, and is synthesized locally in response to activity patterns that lead to LTM
formation. Both of these features require specific sequences present in the distal untranslated part of the
CaMKII mRNA. In spite of extensive work on local translation of CaMKII, several fundamental questions
remain unanswered:
Is there a requirement for somatic factors in local translation? We will disrupt the connection between
the cell body and the synapse to test whether transport of somatic material to the synapse is required for
activity-stimulated local synthesis of CaMKII.
How is the information specifying local translation encoded in mRNA? Using transgenes encoding
fluorescent reporters and real-time assays of new protein synthesis, we will determine what sequences are
required for CaMKII synaptic localization and activity-dependent translation.
What are the cellular components that read this information? We will do a bioinformatically-driven
candidate gene screen in parallel with RNA affinity purification to identify proteins that regulate basal and
plasticity-stimulated CaMKII accumulation.
How does disruption of local translation of CaMKII affect LTM? We will use conditional genome editing
to remove mRNA sequences that specify local translation or to replace them with specific mutants. We will
determine which cells in the adult learning circuit use this information during LTM formation.
This project utilizes cutting-edge genetic, cell biological and optical methods to address the molecular basis
of a phylogenetically-conserved mechanism of plasticity in a way that will further our understanding of
complex behaviors."

Although much is known about the regulation of protein kinases in specific signaling pathways, the regulation of protein phosphatases in response to environmental signals to counteract kinase functions is not well-established. Unlike kinases, serine/threonine phosphatases are promiscuously active, and their specificity is largely governed by associated proteins, which makes their analysis exceedingly difficult. Our recent efforts to address this major knowledge gap have led to significant conceptual advancements in understanding how PP2A family phosphatases respond to the extracellular environment. We have developed an innovative view of serine-threonine phosphatase complexes, proposing that these complexes are unstable and constantly regulated by disassembly and reassembly. Additionally, we found that specific regulatory subunits are induced in response to specific stimuli to determine PP2A substrate specificity and influence physiological functions. A key discovery in our lab was the identification of a regulatory subunit of PP6, SAPS3, which is essential for the dephosphorylation of AMPK in response to metabolic environmental signals. This discovery has enabled us to further study the molecular mechanisms underlying SAPS3 complex assembly and the functional implications of phosphatase complexes in cellular operations. Over the next five years, our research will continue to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which the SAPS3-containing PP6 phosphatase complex assembles in response to extracellular signals and determine its cellular and systemic functions in response to environmental stimuli using cellular systems and animal models. For the long-term pursuit of studying PP2A family phosphatases, we will also identify other novel phosphatase complexes involved in specific signaling pathways. The accomplishment of these studies will provide transformative insights into the molecular mechanisms by which cells respond to their environment and will lay an essential framework for the development of novel targeted therapies to restore cellular homeostasis."
10838490,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Congenital lung diseases, such as inherited surfactant protein syndromes, cystic fibrosis, and
alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, are a significant source of pediatric morbidity and mortality.
Treatment options for neonatal patients with lung disorders that present with respiratory failure
are limited to palliative care or pediatric lung transplant. As such, there is a clear clinical demand
for new therapies that allow for early correction of congenital lung diseases to reduce pediatric
morbidity and mortality. Recent advances in gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas9
systems, have unlocked the potential to correct pathogenic mutations and thereby treat congenital
disorders at their source. Performing gene editing in utero offers the added benefits of reversing
genetic abnormalities prior to the transition to postnatal life, when pulmonary function becomes
essential, and harnessing normal developmental properties of the fetus for more efficient
correction. Traditionally, viral vectors have been used to study in utero gene therapy in animal
models. Although these studies are encouraging, discovery of alternative, potentially safer,
delivery vehicles will advance the field toward clinical translation. Thus, this proposal aims to
investigate the potential of ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), a promising non-viral delivery
platform, for nucleic acid delivery to the mouse fetal lung. Fetal lung optimized lipid nanoparticles
(FLO-LNPs) will be generated through a multi-stage optimization scheme. In Aim 1, a diverse
library of 24 ionizable lipid structures will be screened to identify the ionizable lipid that best
delivers mRNA to the fetal lung. In Aim 2, LNP formulations will be optimized using a Design of
Experiments scheme for minimal toxicity and maximal delivery of a CRISPR-Cas9 systems in
mouse precision cut lung slices. In Aim 3, the optimized LNP formulation will be modified via
antibody conjugation and tested for cell-specific targeting in the fetal mouse lung. Ultimately, this
proposal – conducted as an interdisciplinary project between sponsors in the Department of
Bioengineering, Perelman School of Medicine, and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia at the
University of Pennsylvania – will allow for the development of a novel LNP delivery platform that
can be applied in subsequent work to deliver in utero gene therapies for congenital lung disease."
10838493,"Complications that arise secondary to an exaggerated innate immune response, such as multiple organ failure,
are a major cause of late-stage mortality in trauma patients. My overall goal is to initiate an innovative and
translational research program focused on elucidating mechanisms through which the vascular endothelium
regulates the host inflammatory response to severe trauma. In particular, my research is focused on the
immunomodulatory functions of the antithrombin (AT)-heparan sulfate system. AT elicits anti-inflammatory
signaling upon binding to specific heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) receptors on the endothelial surface that
contain a 3-0-sulfate (3-0S) modification. Our ongoing experiments demonstrate that dysregulation of the ATHSPG
system is a novel mechanism driving inflammation and organ injury following severe trauma and
hemorrhagic shock. However, the mechanisms that govern 3-0S HSPG expression and AT binding following
trauma is a major knowledge gap in the field. Understanding these mechanisms will enable us to develop novel
clinical tools to attenuate aberrant inflammation following trauma and treat or prevent subsequent organ failure.
The next 5 years of my proposed research program will focus on 3 developing programmatic areas that seek to
elucidate 1) mechanisms that mediate 3-0S HSPG degradation; 2) mechanisms that regulate 3-0S HSPG
biosynthesis; and 3) the biological role and therapeutic potential of unique AT variants capable of regulating
inflammation when 3-0S HSPG expression is reduced. Results of these investigations have broad-reaching
implications for many conditions in which inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis, such as sepsis,
transplantation, and COVID-19. Funding from this R35 award will 1) enable the establishment of my highly
innovative, long-term research program that is guided by the NIGMS mission; 2) advance our basic
understanding of the host inflammatory response to trauma; and 3) create novel therapeutics to improve longterm
survival and quality of life for the critically ill."

Rapid Response Teams (U2F) Clinical Trials Not Allowed to ensure the Pennsylvania
Rapid Response Team (PA RRT) remains robust, active, and ready to respond to
human food and animal feed emergencies in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is a large
state with a population of nearly 13 million residents. In 2021, Pennsylvania’s economic
output of agricultural sectors totaled $81.5 billion, with food manufacturing, animal
processing, crop processing, animal production, and crop production accounting for
$55.5 billion. It is of primary importance for Pennsylvania to prevent and adequately
respond to emergencies that jeopardize the safety and resiliency of food, feed, and
other agricultural industries within the Commonwealth. As the nation’s food supply is
global in nature, complex food and feed emergencies often become multistate, and
require an integrated, rapid response.
This project is intended to expand and build upon the established PA RRT framework,
increase the expertise of utilizing an ICS/NIMS framework for response, solidify our
multi-agency ownership approach, and increase the knowledge and involvement of local
and county health departments in Pennsylvania. The project will prioritize continuous
improvement of the PA RRT, continued collaboration with neighboring states and FDA
District partners, greater proficiency at traceback and environmental assessments, and
communicating investigatory outcomes and best practices with industry, other

10829455,"Project Summary
The misuse and abuse of prescription pain relievers, such as oxycodone, contributed to the unprecedented
opioid epidemic in the United States. The opioid crisis has devastating consequences on public health including
a surge in opioid misuse and related overdoses. Research is urgently needed to develop better treatments for
opiate addiction.
 Despite substantial knowledge of the pharmacokinetic and behavioral effects of oxycodone in various
animal models, only a small number of candidate genes and neuroanatomical systems affected by opioids have
been studied. Recent technological advances in the field of single cell genomics are promising avenues for the
unbiased discovery and characterization of brain cell types that respond to opioids.
 In response to this RFA, we leverage an innovative multi-omics methodology (Single Cell Multiome
ATAC + Gene Expression) to map the transcriptome and epigenome from the same cell across thousands of
cells in brain regions relevant to the effects of opioid exposure. To this aim we will use a rat model of extended
access to oxycodone intravenous self-administration that recapitulates several neuroadaptations also observed in
humans with opioid use disorders (OUD). This approach provides an exceptional opportunity to systematically
explore the cellular diversity of the opioid system and, at the same time, the causative mechanisms that regulate
cellular states based on the associations between epigenetic changes and the expression of target genes in
individual cells. We will integrate this innovative multi-omics methodology with rigorous computational
approaches to explore the cellular organization the opioid system in multiple brain regions and different stages
of OUD progression (initial exposure, escalation of use, acute withdrawal, prolonged abstinence, and cue-
induced relapse).
 We have provided strong preliminary that support the feasibility of our proposed plan for the following
aims. In Aim 1, we will collect brain tissues at different stages of the extended access to oxycodone intravenous
self-administration (ivsa) protocol and we will generate single cell genomics data from both male and female
rats that are exposed to either saline or oxycodone. In Aim 2, we will integrate these transcriptomic and
epigenomic datasets to identify changes in cellular states, genes and upstream regulators that are associated with
different stages of oxycodone use. This approach will facilitate the identification of linkages between cis-
regulatory elements and target genes. In Aim 3, we will validate key cell type-specific findings by RNA-FISH
and identify the top 3 target genes for functional validation. To this aim, we will use a viral-mediated CRISPR-
Cas9 system to modulate addictive behaviors in rat models of oxycodone self-administration. The results of this
study will enable future studies that may identify new targets for treatment and prevention of OUD."
10829456,"Project Summary
Despite widespread recognition of pervasive patient safety problems in the U.S. health care system, research
to develop feasible, scalable solutions has lagged, particularly in the ambulatory setting. The need for new
approaches to improve safety is especially pressing in the care of ambulatory patients using high-risk
immunosuppressive medications, as use of this category of medications has grown precipitously and reports of
preventable adverse events have increased. In the last AHRQ funding period, our research team generated
new epidemiological evidence of patient safety risks and adverse events and used this information to develop
electronic health record-based quality measures (eMeasures) for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services Quality Payment Program. In addition, we implemented these eMeasures nationally in the American
College of Rheumatology's RISE registry, which includes electronic health record data from over one-third of
U.S. practicing rheumatologists. In this proposal, we aim to build on this work to improve ambulatory patient
safety for individuals using high-risk immunosuppressive drugs. In Aim 1, we will use data from the RISE
registry linked to Medicare claims to identify emerging patient safety errors for newly approved
immunosuppressive drugs and analyze these errors across race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, medical
complexity, access to care and practice characteristics. In Aim 2, we will perform a comprehensive evaluation
of current national patient safety eMeasures related to immunosuppressive drugs, assessing feasibility,
reliability, and validity across diverse practice settings, electronic health record systems, and visit types
(telemedicine versus face-to-face). In Aim 3, we will use mixed-methods grounded in implementation science
theory to determine key drivers of performance on ambulatory patient safety eMeasures. Data from this
research will be used to develop and disseminate the first implementation toolkit designed to improve patient
safety for high-risk immunosuppressive drugs. The proposed research will contribute significantly to the
national infrastructure to improve ambulatory patient safety for the millions of Americans with immune-
mediated diseases."
10829707,"Polyketides are used more frequently in human medicine than any other class of secondary
metabolites, and comprise roughly 20% of top-selling small-molecule drugs. Despite their
importance: (a) All polyketides used in human medicine are derived from soil bacteria and are
prepared via fermentation or semi-synthesis (notwithstanding eribulin), (b) <5% of soil bacteria
are amenable to culture, many phyla have eluded culture, and the few bacteria amenable to
culture express <10% of their biosynthetic genes, (c) although marine polyketides possess an
astonishing array of biological activities, commercial fermentation processes involving marine
bacteria (which are often symbionts) remain exceptionally uncommon. De novo chemical
synthesis potentially offers entry to otherwise inaccessible polyketides and their congeners, yet
current synthetic methods often do not avail sufficiently concise routes for large scale production.
To overcome this challenge, our laboratory has pioneered a broad, new family of catalytic
methods for the direct stereo- and site-selective conversion of lower alcohols to higher alcohols.
As documented in numerous total syntheses, these methods streamline polyketide construction,
allowing the target compounds to be prepared in significantly fewer steps than previously
possible.
In the proposed funding period, 3 specific aims are proposed: (a) Total syntheses of the type I
polyketides neaumycin B and gladiolin will be pursued using our catalytic methods. Neaumycin B
is a femtomolar inhibitor of U87 human glioblastoma. Gladiolin displays potent, selective activity
against M. tuberculosis strains that are resistant to the frontline antibiotics isoniazid and
rifampicin. (b) The type II polyketide antibiotics formicamycins G, H and J, arenimycin A and
analogues of viridicatumtoxin will be prepared using our catalytic methods. Antibacterial
properties of these compounds will be evaluated in collaboration with Prof. Barrie Wilkinson
and Prof. Jean Chmielewski. (c) Ruthenium-catalyzed reactions relevant to polyketide
construction (allylation, crotylation, propargylation, etc.) will be developed. Optimization of these
methods will be assisted by computational studies performed by Prof. Kuo-Wei Huang. Thus,
our studies advance an integrated program in which methodological innovation informs
synthesis, and synthesis informs medicinal chemistry."
10829401,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This is a competing renewal application whose overall objective is to define the mechanisms of interferon (IFN)-
signaling in malignant cells. We have provided the first evidence for the existence of a novel pathway engaged
by the Type I IFN receptor (IFNR), involving the ULK1 kinase. This ULK1 pathway operates in an autophagy-
independent manner to regulate expression of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) and is essential for the generation
of the suppressive effects of IFNon primary malignant hematopoietic precursors from patients with
myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Remarkably, ULK1 forms complexes with unique partners that have
distinct structures and functional capabilities, suggesting that coordinated operation of such complexes is
required for optimal control of IFN-induced antineoplastic effects. Aim 1 will identify upstream IFNR-generated
signals and mechanisms that control ULK1 activation. It includes studies to map the IFN-phosphorylation sites
on ULK1 and identify direct upstream kinases that modify its function. Aim 2 will define ULK1 effector pathways
that mediate IFN-responses. It includes experiments to determine the roles of novel effectors that we have
identified, including ROCK1/2, PCM1 and CARD9. A combination of approaches will be used, including
generation of selective knockouts by the CRISPR-Cas9 methodology and mutation of putative ULK1
phosphorylation sites in the structures of target proteins, followed by assessment of its effects on IFN signaling
and antineoplastic responses. Aim 3 will define the role of ULK1 pathways in the generation of the antineoplastic
effects of IFN in MPNs. Jak2V617F-driven MPN mouse models will be established using mice with Ulk1-/-,
Pcm1-/-, or Card9-/- backgrounds, and the ability of IFN to induce antineoplastic responses in such mice will be
examined. The therapeutic effects of a ROCK1/2 pharmacological inhibitor alone and in combination with
IFNin mediating anti-MPN responses in vivo will be also determined. In other studies, the activation of IFN-
dependent ULK1 effector signals will be determined in primary malignant precursors from patients with different
MPNs participating in IFN-clinical trials and correlated with molecular characteristics and clinical responses to
IFN-treatment. Altogether, this proposal introduces highly novel concepts in the IFN-field and the mechanisms
of IFN-generated antitumor effects and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies and
approaches for the treatment of MPNs."
10829404,"Necroptosis, in which the FADD-caspase-8-FLIP complex controls RIPK3-MLKL-mediated cell death, is an
inflammatory cell death process that is engaged by TNF and related ligands, TLR signaling (involving TRIF)
and interferons. Necroptosis has been implicated in development and adult homeostasis. Through genetic
models and in vitro cell-based experiments, we have learned that RIPK1 plays contrasting roles in necroptosis,
either promoting or inhibiting the process in different settings. Our central hypothesis, based on our published
and extensive preliminary data, is that the interaction of FADD-caspase-8-FLIP with RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL is
fundamentally important in the regulation of inflammatory diseases. Based on this hypothesis, we will ask: 1.
How do FADD-caspase-8-FLIP and RIPK1 function in the regulation of RIPK3? Here we will explore the
roles of RIPK1 in positively and negatively regulating RIPK3 and necroptosis, both by recruiting FADD-
caspase-8-FLIP to the necrosome complex and the inhibitory function of its kinase-inactive form. Cell-based in
vitro studies will elucidate how RIPK1 performs these functions, and we will apply these to our paradoxical
finding that the kinase-inactive mutant of RIPK1 may not rescue the embryonic lethality of FADD- or caspase-
8-deficient mice. 2. How do the survival functions of FADD-caspase-8-FLIP and RIPK1 function in
inflammatory disease? Here we will employ novel genetic models (mice with a floxed allele of RIPK3, mice
harboring a caspase-8 mutant with the survival but not the apoptotic function of caspase-8) to explore several
inflammatory conditions in which involvement of apoptosis or necroptosis has been suggested. 3. How do
FADD-caspase-8-FLIP and RIPK3-MLKL suppress ALPS? While autoimmune lymphoproliferative
syndrome (ALPS) has been studied for decades in the context of CD95/CD95L defects, little is known about
the pathogenesis of this disease, largely due to an inability of CD95-deficient bone marrow to transfer the
syndrome. In contrast, we have found that ALPS in casp8-/-ripk3-/- animals is readily transferred to wt
recipients. We will exploit this, and our novel genetic models, in the exploration of this syndrome. The
proposed studies, throughout, are designed to provide a deeper understanding into the functions of RIPK1
interactions with FADD-caspase-8-FLIP, and RIPK3-MLKL, two interacting pathways to different forms of cell
death. Through these ongoing investigations, we will extend our fundamental insights into how the regulation
of the RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL axis by the function of FADD-caspase-8-FLIP impacts on inflammatory diseases."
10829405,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Patients with ulcerative colitis, a form of inflammatory bowel disease, face an increased risk of developing
colorectal cancer. Although advances have been made in the therapeutic management of this disease, much
less attention has been given to the development of cancer preventive strategies for this high-risk population.
Ulcerative colitis patients often develop folate deficiencies that require supplementation with folic acid (FA), a
synthetic form of folate. The effect of FA on risk for colorectal cancer remains unclear and the recent suggestion
that FA supplements may be useful in preventing colitis-associated colorectal cancer is of great concern.
 Preliminary studies from this group provide the first evidence that FA supplementation (8 mg/kg diet) causes
a dose-dependent increase in the formation of colorectal tumors in mice with AOM/DSS-induced colitis. Results
from associated RNASeq and in vitro analyses suggest that FA promotes tumorigenesis by activating ERK and
inducing NF-κB signaling in colonic epithelial cells with dysfunctional p53, the gatekeeping event in the
development of colitis-associated cancers. The hypothesis of the proposed studies is that FA supplementation
promotes UC-associated cancer in cells with dysfunctional/mutant p53, but not in cells with wild type p53, via an
inflammatory pathway mediated by ERK and NF-κB. The mechanism by which FA induces tumor formation will
be investigated in Aim 1 using CRISPR engineered isogenic human RKO colon carcinoma cells with varying p53
status (p53+/+, p53-/- and p53+/Mut). The impact of FA and dysfunctional p53 on activation of ERK, NF-κB signaling,
as well as cell cycle progression will be evaluated. In vitro findings will be validated in Aim 2, where
complimentary in vivo analyses will examine the combined effect of FA and mutant p53 on DSS-induced
colitis-associated tumorigenesis and associated biomarkers in p53+/+ and p53+/515A (mutant) mice. In addition,
the impact of high dose FA given prior to the induction of colitis will be examined. Tumor incidence and
multiplicity, as well as degree of intestinal inflammation, will serve as primary endpoints of these studies. Based
on the important contribution of intestinal microbiota to colitis and their ability to synthesize folate de novo, the
impact of FA administration on the diversity and relative abundance of fecal and adherent bacteria within the
intestine of p53+/515A mice with DSS-induced colitis will be examined in Aim 3. Mice will be treated with
5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), a common maintenance therapy for ulcerative colitis, for the duration of FA
exposure to recapitulate the clinical therapy of a patient following a diagnosis of colitis. The composition of the
fecal and colon-adherent microbiomes, determined from 16S rRNA and metagenomic sequencing data, will be
correlated with colonic inflammation, barrier function and tumor incidence/multiplicity. The results are expected
to provide significant insight into the impact of FA supplementation on colitis-associated tumorigenesis and
inform the first guidelines for the use of FA supplements by patients with ulcerative colitis."
10829421,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Coronary heart disease (CHD) affects over 18.2 million Americans and it is rising globally. Coronary artery
bypass graft (CABG) surgery is the standard of care for multi-vessel CHD and has dramatically improved life
expectancy. However, it is not known how CABG surgery impacts symptom burden or health related quality of
life (HRQOL), two outcomes that matter to patients. Furthermore, CABG surgery can use single arterial grafts
(SAG) or multiple arterial grafts (MAG). Observational research suggests that MAG prolongs survival compared
to SAG and decreases risk of surgical complications, heart attack, stroke, infection, and death; however,
differences in HRQOL between these two surgical standards of care are not known. The investigators aim to
define the impact of CABG surgery on HRQOL and symptom burden among 2,111 men and women with multi-
vessel CHD in the context of the large multinational ROMA trial that is testing the hypothesis that clinical
outcomes with MAG are superior to SAG over 5 years. The ROMA:QOL ancillary study leverages the
infrastructure of the parent trial to add HRQOL and symptom outcomes. The overall goal of this R01 is to
compare HRQOL and symptoms following SAG vs. MAG CABG surgery. In Aim 1, the investigators will quantify
changes in the well-validated Seattle Angina Questionnaire as a measure of disease-specific HRQOL and the
widely used Short Form 12-item survey as a generic measure of HRQOL. In Aim 2, the investigators will quantify
changes in physical and mental health symptoms and physical functioning using the NIH Patient Reported
Outcomes Measure Information System (PROMIS). A secondary goal is to quantify minimally important clinical
differences for the PROMIS measures post CABG surgery. Pre-specified subgroup analyses will evaluate
HRQOL and symptom burden in women compared with men, and patients with and without diabetes. Compared
to men, women are more likely to be underdiagnosed with CHD and are less likely to be referred for CABG
surgery. Diabetes is an established CHD risk factor, especially multi-vessel CHD, and diabetic patients are at
higher risk for surgical complications, poor wound healing, and worse clinical outcomes after CABG surgery. The
hypothesis is that both groups will experience improvements in HRQOL and symptoms at 12 months, but MAG
will be superior to SAG. The results will generate missing evidence about the impact of MAG vs. SAG surgery
on dimensions of health prioritized by patients. This missing evidence prevents fully informed decision-making
about the risks and benefits of CABG surgery in general, and MAG vs. SAG specifically. This study will influence
future treatment recommendations and clinical practice guidelines and lay the foundation for shared decision-
making tools to communicate risks and benefits to patients. The proposed study addresses NIH’s call to
investigate factors that account for differences in health and treatment response to novel surgical strategies,
overall and by sex."
10829423,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Local sources of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) contribute significantly to disease risk;
however, inability to differentiate local from non-local cases has precluded full characterization of local
transmission systems. The long-term goal of this research is to develop targeted public health interventions
using systems epidemiology to elucidate the pathways and mechanisms of STEC maintenance and
transmission. In pursuit of this goal, the overall objective of the current study is to identify characteristics of
pathogen, host, and environment associated with local STEC transmission. The central hypothesis is that
STEC cases infected from local sources are significantly different than those infected by strains from outside
the case’s local area. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) differentiate and
characterize locally transmitted STEC strains, both O157 and non-O157, 2) identify host characteristics
associated with acquiring local vs. non-local STEC strains, and 3) identify environmental characteristics
associated with local transmission. In aim 1, a structured coalescent phylodynamic model will be used to
generate a phylogeny of STEC strains isolated from cases reported to the Minnesota Department of Health
(MDH) since 2016 compared to strains isolated outside MN and available on NCBI. The inferred location of
tree nodes will be used to classify STEC strains as local or non-local. A generalized linear model will be used to
integrate strain characteristics into the tree and determine their influence on the local MN STEC effective
population size and migration rates. The second aim will assess the association of host characteristics,
including age, sex, and potential exposures, with local vs. non-local STEC. In aim 3, the association between
characteristics of the physical and social environment and local STEC transmission will be estimated
accounting for spatial correlation. To accomplish these aims, PI Dr. Gillian Tarr will obtain advanced
training in bioinformatics and phylodynamic modeling. Dr. Tarr will also enhance her knowledge of
food production and distribution systems and further develop her research management skills. With a long
history of food safety research and collaboration with MDH, the University of Minnesota provides the optimal
environment for this research. The mentorship team has expertise in bioinformatics and applied
phylogenetic modeling and includes STEC and food systems subject matter experts. The proposed research is
innovative, in the applicants’ opinions, because it will 1) characterize local transmission systems without
restriction to isolated outbreaks or use of proxies such as recent travel, and 2) employ a structured coalescent
model that has not been applied for this purpose in any comparable disease system. Differentiating local
transmission from imported cases and identifying the host, pathogen, and environment characteristics of local
transmission is a significant contribution, because it enables specific hypotheses to be developed and tested
for local reservoirs and transmission pathways, which can then be targeted by tailored interventions."

 Ayuda Medical has the vision that no-one should die from a treatable medical emergency. Opioid
overdoses (OODs) are treatable with basic CardioPulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), but they claimed over 250
lives each day in the US in 2020. Patients most at risk for OOD are people in treatment for Opioid Use
Disorder (OUD) or High Impact Chronic Pain (HICP). The current standard of care to OOD is bystander
response (medical or nonmedical), but the bystander needs to know that an OOD is occurring. We present a
wearable medical diagnostic device to detect OOD and bridge the gap to bystander intervention.
 Our device, Parachute ARMband, will be worn continuously, and will monitor physiologic parameters
that indicate OOD, then will use an on-device escalating tonal alarm to summon bystanders, as well as on-
device speaker to verbally identify the urgency to get medical help. No wireless connectivity is required for
these functions. The ARMband will also send a Bluetooth alert to an adjunct Mobile Medical Application
(MMA) on the User’s phone, that can reach designated contacts, previously chosen by the device user. This
function requires mobile device connectivity, and that the MMA be downloaded prior to the medical event.
 Company has completed a Phase I SBIR, sponsored by National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA), that
showed the upper arm is a viable location for wearable oximeters, main components of novel device. The
addition of Phase I Innovation Corps enabled company to validate Minimal Viable Product (MVP) key features,
including escalating alarm and wireless alert. Together our Phase I learnings allowed Principle Investigator
(PI) to submit a Breakthrough Device Designation (BDD) request to the FDA.
 This proposed Phase II application will show feasibility of our novel device components to detect gas-
induced hypoxia, compared to arterial blood gas (Aim 1); sensitivity of device to detect intravenous remifentanil
“OOD” and begin alarm algorithm (Aim 2); and ability of device communications to send a real-time wireless
alert (Aim 3). These three aims support device safety and effectiveness. In Aim 4, Human Factors and
Instructions for Use (IFU) are specifically tested in our target population, persons with a history of OUD or
OOD. Aim 5 likewise tests the device in our target population, but also adds our target use environment; it will
test device’s wearability via 48hr and and two-to-four week take home studies.
 Together all five Aims, along with non-clinical testing of device design and alarms, will support seeking
Class II marketing via a De Novo submission, with the device indicated for People Who Use Opioids (PWUOs)
including HICP, and people with a history of OUD that are at risk for OOD. To date there is no FDA approved
device to monitor for OOD. We offer a continuous monitor because stressors and triggers to opioid use can be
unexpected. The De Novo submission will include data from studies designed for our target clinical scenario
(acute opioid ingestion/ administration), and target use environment (ambulatory, at-home).
 Ayuda Medical plans to have several discussions with the United States Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), throughout device development and Phase II. BDD was submitted in Q3, 2021, and company plans to
submit a Q-sub clarifying our milestones to approval in Q4, 2021. We plan to use early gas hypoxia studies
(Aim 1A) to apply for Investigational Device Exemption (IDE), and then perform clinical studies with opioid-
specific protocols (Aims 2 and 3). This includes feasibility (Q4, 2022) and pivotal (Q4, 2023) studies
sponsored by Phase II. Continuous interactions with FDA will align company milestones with FDA objectives.
 Commercialization strategy includes seeking federal Medicaid coverage in tandem with FDA approval,
as part of a dual-panel (FDA-CMS) pre-marketing review. Company plans to market the ARMband directly
within the OUD market, and co-market the device with a strategic partner within the HICP market. We also
intend to conduct community-based pilot studies in collaboration with NIDA and the Substance Abuse and
Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), to validate device system in specific to the OUD/HICP
populations in target environment, and to support formulary inclusion by State Medicaid. State Medicaid
coverage assures that the device is affordable and accessible by Community Health Centers (CHCs), that treat
the majority of the low-income populations for both chronic and acute illnesses, including OUD and OOD.
Establishing a viable commercial path via state Medicaid and CHCs, that can then be expanded into 50 states,
is an attractive proposal to partnerships and potential exit companies in the OUD market.
 Phase I validated device need and feasibility of our development approach. Phase II will provide the
appropriate clinical and non-clinical testing to support a De Novo submission to the FDA. Company is fully
dedicated to the approval and commercialization of the Parachute ARMband OOD diagnostic device, and to
making it available to all at-risk groups, aiming to expand the protection against accidental opioid overdose."

Veterinarians, aided by their wide-ranging and comparative education in veterinary medicine, make essential
contributions to biomedical discovery and public health. Yet, there is a well established shortage in the number
of veterinarians engaged in biomedical research. The Cornell University Veterinary Investigator Program (VIP)
seeks to improve this situation by providing full-time research laboratory experiences to veterinary students for
a 10-week period during the summer after their first or second year of veterinary school. The Program
additionally provides exposure to emerging research developments and new techniques, complementary skills
in written and oral science communication, and career guidance. The Veterinary Investigator Program has five
primary objectives: i) Provide DVM students with rigorous, hypothesis-driven mentored research experiences
and broad exposure to research techniques; ii) Promote the responsible conduct of research through training in
ethics and principles such as rigor and reproducibility; iii) Advance the science communication skills of DVM
student trainees, including abstract writing, poster presentation, and oral presentation; iv) Expose students to
cutting-edge biomedical areas and recent breakthroughs via lab-based experiences and faculty-led workshops;
and v) Demonstrate how students can incorporate research into their post-DVM careers through advanced
research training and/or by integrating research into a variety career pathways such as clinical practice, public
health, and academia, among others. The Veterinary Investigator Program is entering its 14th year. NIH T35
funding for the previous 10 years has provided support for 79 participants, leading to peer-reviewed publications
and future research funding, as well as significant career impacts. The admissions process at the Cornell
University College of Veterinary Medicine gives preference to those who express an interest in research, thereby
contributing to an exceptionally competitive application pool for the Veterinary Investigator Program. The
Program consists of 44 dedicated and collaborative faculty trainers, including approximately equal numbers of
men and women, and faculty representing all Professorial ranks. The faculty trainers hail from the five academic
Departments of the College of Veterinary Medicine, and have well funded and productive laboratories that
specialize in the following areas: Cancer; Cellular & Organismal Metabolism; Developmental Biology &
Reproduction; Genome Biology; Infection Biology; and Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cells. By providing ten
interested students per year an opportunity to avail themselves of the wide range of superb faculty and resources
at Cornell University, the Veterinary Investigator Program strives to engage early stage veterinary trainees in
high impact biomedical research and to motivate them to pursue a career that includes rigorous scientific inquiry."
10829910,"Shigella species are invasive human pathogens that cause bacillary dysentery, or shigellosis, a
potentially fatal diarrheal disease. The global burden of shigellosis is estimated at more than 200 million
cases per year. There is currently no effective vaccine against Shigella, and drug resistance is
widespread and on the rise; thus, there is a critical need to identify novel Shigella targets for
immunization and new antibiotics. One promising approach is to target metabolic processes that are
important for pathogenesis, but not for survival of Shigella in the host environment. Inhibiting such
pathways would be less likely to select for resistant Shigella or to disrupt the normal gut microbiota.
Our work has shown that Shigella flexneri uses mixed acid fermentation to break down glycolysis
intermediates during growth within host cells. This process is critical for S. flexneri pathogenesis, but is
not required for growth of the bacteria, either inside or outside host cells. Mixed acid fermentation
leads to the production of formate, which is excreted by S. flexneri into the host cell cytosol. Formate
induces expression of S. flexneri virulence genes that are required for cell-to-cell spread. Our hypothesis
is that, as the bacteria multiply, formate levels reach a threshold that can be sensed by S. flexneri as a
signal to begin the process of spreading to neighboring cells, thus linking cell density with the need to
move deeper into the intestinal epithelium to find new resources. The goal of this study is to
investigate how formate is sensed by the bacteria, and how this signal leads to changes in gene
expression that promote cell-to-cell spread and evasion of host immunity. We propose to identify key
players in the formate sensing pathway in order to derive a model for how the formate signal is relayed
from the cell surface to its target genes. We will also determine the downstream effects of formate
signaling on both S. flexneri and host cell gene expression. Historically, Shigella studies have been
hampered by the lack of a physiologically relevant host-pathogen model system. We have recently
demonstrated that critical aspects of Shigella pathogenesis are faithfully reproduced in human intestinal
enteroids (HIEs), ‘mini-intestines’ derived from human intestinal biopsies. We propose to use HIEs to
determine both the Shigella and host cell transcriptomes in response to formate. This will allow
investigation of gene expression and metabolism during the course of a Shigella infection in fully
differentiated, non-transformed, native human tissue. We have assembled the necessary strains and
reagents, and we have the expertise to carry out these experiments, which we predict will lead to vital
new information in the search for novel shigellosis treatment and prevention strategies."
10829911,"ABSTRACT
Aortic aneurysm is the 13th leading cause of death in the United States, 25% of which are thoracic aortic
aneurysms (TAA). Approximately 15,000 people die every year of rupture of aortic aneurysm. Thoracic aortic
dissection (often resulting from TAA) is another devastating condition that causes 10,000 deaths each year.
Mouse models have been used to study TAA and dissection (TAAD) for years. However, there has been no
significant improvement in medical treatments to prevent or reverse human TAAD. Gene mutations in the
pathway of transforming growth factor (TGF) -β predispose patients to TAAD. Just as early research on
mutations of low density lipid receptors opened a door to the medical treatment of coronary artery disease,
studying the mechanisms of genetic alterations of the TGF-β pathway that cause TAAD, namely TGFBR1 and
SMAD3 mutations which result in Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) type 1 and 3, could open a door for the medical
treatment for all TAAD in general. It is very interesting that patients with TGFBR1 or SMAD3 mutations
frequently develop aortic root aneurysms first, initially sparing the rest of the aorta. The aortic root is composed
of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) from the second heart field through Cardiovascular progenitor cell (CPC)
lineage. TGF-β is critical for SMC differentiation from the second heart field. The mutations of TGFBR1 or
SMAD3 in LDS patients are loss-of-function mutations. Our preliminary data showed that human induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with SMAD3 knockout or pathogenic TGFBR1 knockin (KI) mutations had
defective differentiation of SMCs through CPC lineage compared to isogenic normal control iPSCs. Therefore,
we hypothesize that pathogenic mutations in TGFBR1 or SMAD3 will disrupt SMC differentiation and thus
decrease the contractile activity of CPC-derived SMCs and disrupt the extracellular matrix, resulting in aortic
aneurysm. We have enrolled families of LDS type 1 and 3 patients, and normal controls, and generated iPSCs
from all subjects. We will create the pathogenic LDS knock-in mutations of TGFBR1 or SMAD3 in normal
control iPSCs, and correct the gene mutations in LDS iPSCs using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology.
We will then compare the SMC differentiation and function through CPC lineage (CPC-SMCs) in KI mutation
vs. normal control groups; LDS patients vs. mutation-corrected groups. Using CPC-SMCs, we will create a
tissue engineered blood vessel (TEBV) in a bioreactor with pulsatile flow, and compare the biomechanics of
the TEBV with or without TGFBR1 or SMAD3 mutations. Finally, we will transplant the TEBV into nude rabbits
to generate an in vivo human aneurysm with TGFBR1 or SMAD3 LDS mutations in rabbits to determine the
molecular mechanism of the aortic aneurysm formation due to TGFBR1 or SMAD3 mutations, enabling
screening of potential medical treatments. Our proposed study will provide in-depth knowledge of aneurysm
formation in LDS patients and provide the foundation to develop novel medical therapies for TAAD in general."
10836398,"SUMMARY
Transdifferentiation denotes the conversion of one mature cell type into another mature cell upon forced
expression of transcription factors or treatment with small molecules. Transdifferentiation systems typically give
rise to postmitotic cells, which poses a challenge for mechanistic studies and potential therapeutic applications.
To address this shortcoming in the muscle lineage, we recently developed a novel strategy to dedifferentiate
fibroblasts directly into “induced myogenic progenitor cells” (iMPCs) by transiently expressing the myogenic
transcription factor MyoD in the presence of three small molecules. iMPC cultures are comprised of stem-like
cells that give rise to progenitors and mature myofibers exhibiting spontaneous contraction, thus recapitulating
key stages of myogenesis in a dish. Moreover, stem-like iMPC subsets can be clonally propagated for at least
20 passages while retaining the ability to produce myotubes, demonstrating long-term self-renewal and
differentiation potential in vitro. Accordingly, bulk iMPCs transplanted into mdx dystrophic mice engraft and
differentiate into Dystrophin-expressing myotubes in vivo. Thus, our results represent the first successful
derivation of stable, expandable and functional muscle stem-like cells directly from fibroblasts and provide the
basis for this R01 application using three complementary aims. In SPECIFIC AIM 1, we will compare molecular
and functional properties between Pax7+ stem-like cells purified from iMPC cultures and Pax7+ satellite cells
purified from skeletal muscle using single-cell expression and chromatin analyses as well as a serial
transplantation assay. In addition, we will leverage a tetO-MyoD mouse we recently developed to test whether
different cell types are equally amenable to dedifferentiation into iMPCs and whether iMPCs derived from distinct
cell types retain a transcriptional memory from their cells of origin. In SPECIFIC AIM 2, we will investigate the
molecular mechanisms underlying this dedifferentiation process. First, we will assess whether the establishment
and maintenance of iMPCs depend on the same genetic regulators as satellite cells in vivo, with a focus on the
transcription factors Pax7, Myf5 and MyoD including MyoD mutants with altered DNA and cofactor binding. We
will further explore the specific roles of MyoD and small molecules during iMPC induction by examining enhancer
and gene expression dynamics in relation to transdifferentiation (MyoD alone). In SPECIFIC AIM 3, we will test
the potential therapeutic utility of iMPCs using mouse and human cells. Briefly, we will assess whether iMPCs
from dystrophic mdx mice recapitulate published disease phenotypes in vitro and whether iMPCs are susceptible
to gene therapy. Mechanistic insights gained throughout these 3 aims will finally be exploited for efforts to
generate human iMPCs. Collectively, our project will provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms
by which transcription factors and external signals rewire cell fate using the muscle lineage as a model
system and explore how this knowledge could be used in a therapeutic setting.

Iron enzymes play major roles in O2 activation in biology. These divide into four classes based on
their active site structures that reflect their mode of O2 activation: the non-cofactor dependent
mononuclear non-heme iron (MNHFe) enzymes, the cofactor (α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and pterin)
dependent MNHFe enzymes, the binuclear NHFe enzymes and the O2/H2O2 activating heme
enzymes. Crystal structures and oxygen reaction intermediates exist for metalloenzymes in all
four classes. Over the years, we have developed new spectroscopic methods enabling the
detailed study of the NHFeII active sites, and the geometric and electronic structures of their O2
intermediates and have now developed a method to quantitatively study the iron center in the
highly covalent and chromophoric heme environment. Among our accomplishments in the past 5
years are: 1) determined that FeIII-O2- species are the reactive intermediates in all the subclasses
of non-cofactor dependent MNHFe enzymes; 2) defined the O2 reaction coordinates to generate
the FeIV=O intermediates in both the α-KG and pterin dependent enzymes; 3) for the α-KG
dependent subclass, defined the geometric and electronic structures of their FeIV=O enzyme
intermediates and how these direct halogenation over the thermodynamically favored
hydroxylation in the halogenases; 4) showed that in contrast to the MNHFe enzymes,
hydroperoxide intermediates are active in the binuclear NHFe enzymes for direct reaction with
substrates; 5) for methane monooxygenase, where the peroxo-biferric intermediate rapidly
converts to a high-valent 2FeIV-oxo intermediate Q, we have determined the structure of Q (a
topic of current debate) and provided insight into its high reactivity with methane; 6) used the
spectroscopic method we have now developed for iron in heme environments to determine
experimentally the computationally controversial electronic structure of oxyhemoglobin; 7) and
extended this method to analyze active sites with strong Fe-oxo bonds. Our studies are now
directed toward completing the reaction coordinates of the four classes and their subclasses,
understanding O2 activation at the superoxo, peroxo and FeIV-oxo levels, determining the role of
the second iron in the enhanced reactivity of the binuclear NHFe enzymes, and understanding
the differences in the activation and selectivity of high-valent iron-oxo intermediates in
mononuclear NH, binuclear NH and heme enzyme active sites."
10836517,"As a constituent component of CIFASD5, this project will focus on improving the identification of
individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), across the lifespan, with the primary goal of
translation for clinical application. We target two main categories outlined in the Request for Application
(RFA) 1. To identify FASD cases early and accurately, and 2. To expand and translate basic and
mechanistic understandings of the effects of PAE. To address these topics, we aim to improve the
accuracy and reliability of the clinical recognition of FASD, controlling for the influence of sex, co-
exposures, and age. We seek to understand better how neurocognitive and facial morphology are
correlative and covariant in FASD and exploit this relationship to improve screening accuracy.
Previously, we have implemented methods and associated software for analyzing face shape and face -
brain-cognitive relationships to detect the effects of PAE. In doing so, we have created an effective
toolkit to automatically and objectively identify cardinal and subtle PAE-associated facial dysmorphism
across the FASD spectrum. It is now a priority to refine and optimize our methods, utilizing low-cost
3D imaging devices to validate and distribute to the clinical community. To accomplish our goals, we
propose to follow specific aims:
1. Explore the impact of factors secondary to alcohol exposure that may influence facial morphology;
2. Detect facial, cranial, and neural effects of prenatal alcohol exposure across the lifespan;
3. Develop, test, and validate automated methods for FASD screening, integrating neurocognitive
 assessment tools and distributing to the clinical community.
Achieving aims 1 and 2 will dramatically refine FASD recognition by understanding the factors
secondary to alcohol that may influence outcomes across the lifespan. Successful demonstration of
aim 2 will achieve the earliest possible diagnosis enabling further research and feedback for
intervention studies and also focus on recognizing traits in adults - a population significantly
underreported in the literature. Ultimately, aim 3 encompasses the primary goal of the project,
developing, testing, and validating multi-domain screening tools that assist with clinical identification.
We will work closely with consortium partners who will recruit subjects and provide facial images and
neurocognitive assessment data (U01: Chambers; U01: Coles & Weinberg; U01: Wozniak; U01:
DiClemente; U01: Petrenko). Particularly close collaboration is required for the face-neurocognitive
analysis, where we will integrate and combine facial and neurocognitive screening tools (U01:
Mattson). We will rely on research resources for data management (R24: Wetherill) and to validate
screening tools and gain clinical feedback (R24: Del Campo)."

Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) is a gram-positive food-borne intracellular bacterial pathogen that is
capable of causing serious invasive disease in humans. As a widespread environmental organism,
Lm is a frequent contaminant of food processing facilities and has been responsible for some of the
largest, most expensive, and most deadly food recalls in US history. Lm is one of a select number of
pathogens that is transmitted during pregnancy from mother to fetus. These infections can be
devastating, as often an infected woman does not even realize she has been infected with Lm until
she miscarries or gives birth to a stillborn or systemically infected infant. The high mortality rate and
devastating sequelae that accompany Lm invasive disease despite antibiotic treatment underlie the
critical need for new therapeutic strategies to safely and effectively manage Lm invasive infections.
We have recently discovered that select isolates of Lm have an enhanced ability to target the placenta
and fetus based on increased expression of the bacterial surface protein InlB. Increased InlB is
sufficient to transform a strain that normally exhibits a low frequency of fetal colonization to a strain
that is capable off nearly 100% fetal infection. Naturally occurring amino acid variations within InlB
may both increase protein stability and enhance stimulation of c-Met, the host growth factor receptor
bound by InlB. Met is abundantly expressed by placental tissue and is required for embryonic and
placental development. We hypothesize that Lm strains expressing select variants of InlB exhibit
enhanced invasion through the manipulation of c-Met signaling pathways, leading to increased rates
of fetal transmission. These strains additionally stimulate a robust immune response that leads to
placental barrier dysfunction and fetal death. The specific aims of this proposal will undertake a
functional assessment of Lm InlB to reveal molecular mechanisms underlying vertical transmission as
well as examine the contributions of maternal and fetal immune signaling to pregnancy outcome. Aim
1 will functionally define the mechanisms underlying InlB surface localization and activity. This aim will
define mechanisms that contribute to InlB stability at the bacterial cell surface and will examine
functional differences between surface localization and secretion. Aim 2 will decipher the mechanisms
underlying InlB enhancement of Lm vertical transmission. We will examine and compare portals of Lm
entry in pregnant mice, and explore host responses to Lm infection that influence pregnancy outcome.
Aim 3 will explore maternal and fetal defenses triggered by high efficiency vertically transmitted
strains that contribute to pathology. These studies will clarify how select Lm isolates gain access with
high efficiency to placental/fetal tissues to cause devastating forms of neonatal disease and death."

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common, affecting 14.8% of US adults, and disproportionately more in diverse
and underserved communities. CKD significantly reduces life expectancy and quality of life, while imposing
tremendous economic burden on society. A critical need persists for early identification of modifiable risk factors
in susceptible populations and to establish actionable support for medical decision making. Among the modifiable
risk factors, drug induced acute kidney injury (AKI) contributes to CKD development and progression. The current
knowledge of nephrotoxic drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is insufficient to prevent harm in heterogenous patient
subpopulations. Electronic health records (EHRs) from electronic medical records (EMR) and health insurance
claims data can help predict disparate CKD progression trajectories and uncover novel nephrotoxic drug
interactions. The Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) EHR collection includes rich clinical information
for 38 million individuals from regional and national populations over two-to-three decades. The IUSM EHR
collection is composed of Optum EHR derived from the Optum Clinformatics™ claim data and the Indiana EHR
incorporated from the EMR data of Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC) Research Database, Indiana
University Health (IUH), and Eskenazi Health (EH). We propose to develop the DisEase PrOgression Trajectory
(DEPOT), an evidence-driven, graph-based clinical informatics approach to model CKD progression trajectories
and individualize clinical decision support. We hypothesize that there are different CKD progression paths which
are: 1) driven by different pathogenic mechanisms, 2) susceptible to different nephrotoxic drugs, and 3) identified
by unique EHR data patterns. Mathematically, such CKD trajectory landscapes can be learned as principle
graphs representing the topological and temporal characteristics of the observed, fragmented EHR data. The
goal of this work is to use the IUSM EHR data collection to 1) establish EHR-based CKD progression trajectories
and 2) to learn actionable knowledge to prevent drug-induced AKI and CKD. The multi-specialty team proposes
to: Aim 1. Construct CKD progression trajectories using graph artificial intelligence model and the IUSM EHR
data and Aim 2) Identify nephrotoxic DDIs in the general population and trajectory-specific
subpopulations that increase risks of AKI and CKD. The success of the proposed work will generate novel
knowledge about the landscape of CKD health trajectories and nephrotoxic DDIs, bridging gaps between rich
longitudinal EHR data and decision support for precision medicine in CKD. This work will shift paradigms of big
data and complex disease research, enabling EHR data to become part of daily CKD management."
10836413,"Project Summary
Cholera is a severe dehydrating diarrheal disease caused by Vibrio cholerae. This Gram-negative rod has
the unusual capacity to colonize the small intestine and to cause explosive epidemics. Here we will address
fundamental questions in V. cholerae-host interactions, leveraging many of the approaches and tools we
have created in the past decades. V. cholerae O1, the cause of pandemic cholera, is divided into Ogawa
and Inaba serotypes, which differ only by the presence or absence of methylation of the terminal O-antigen
sugar respectively. Switching of the Ogawa and Inaba serotypes during cholera epidemics has been
recognized for over a century, but the consequences of serotype conversion on pathogen fitness are not
clear. We discovered that the Ogawa serotype has greater in vivo fitness than the Inaba serotype and that
the two serotypes rely on distinct metabolic process for growth in vivo. Thus, there are unexpected direct or
indirect phenotypic and physiological consequences of O-antigen methylation on V. cholerae growth in vivo.
The consequences and mechanisms that underlie the in vivo fitness differences of the V. cholerae serotypes
will be determined in Aim 1. Cholera toxin (CT) triggers the intestinal fluid secretion that largely accounts for
choleric diarrhea. We found that CT also leads to the secretion of hundreds of host proteins identified in
diarrheal fluid and re-models the intestinal epithelial transcriptional response to V. cholerae. Many of these
proteins and transcripts are linked to innate immune responses and we found that one of these proteins,
surfactant protein D (SP-D), restricts V. cholerae growth in the intestine. In Aim 2, we will analyze the
protective mechanisms mediated by SP-D and investigate the roles of additional V. cholerae-induced
secreted host proteins in impeding the pathogen’s colonization, to uncover host innate axes that protect
against V. cholerae infection. Cholera epidemics often spread extremely rapidly, and host passaging
increases V. cholerae infectivity, but the V. cholerae and host genes that govern cholera transmission are
largely unknown. In Aim 3, we will leverage our experience with pathogen barcoding and a new computational
framework to extend analyses developed in Aims 1 and 2, examining the roles of serotype and CT in
modulating host-priming of infectivity. Additional pathogen pathways and host processes that control V.
cholerae infectivity will also be elucidated, to deepen understanding of cholera transmission. Collectively, the
proposed research will yield new understanding of the interconnected processes that govern V. cholerae
intestinal colonization and infectivity as well as the host factors and mechanisms that limit colonization and
control transmission. This work will provide new perspectives on the biology of the two V. cholerae serotypes,
and on the actions of cholera toxin in stimulating innate host defense responses against the pathogen. Our
findings will also have important translational implications for design of new cholera therapeutics and
vaccines."

Accumulation of inflammatory macrophages as well as innate and adaptative immune cells is a common feature
of cardiometabolic diseases, including atherosclerosis, obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases.
Inflammation in metabolic tissues accelerates atherosclerosis and metabolic dysfunction. The ability to examine
changes in gene expression in immune cells, particularly macrophage populations, in the plaque, adipose tissue
depots, and liver during cardiometabolic disease provides insights into that key pathways that promote or inhibit
the inflammatory response and their corresponding effects on pathologic processes in these tissues. As such, a
Core will be established to: 1) isolate and quantify macrophage and other immune cell subsets from
atherosclerotic plaque, adipose tissue and liver by FACS; 2) monitor changes in metabolic parameters within the
systemic circulation, atherosclerotic plaque, adipose tissue and liver; and 3) perform sectioning and histologic
quantification of atherosclerotic plaques, fat depots and liver morphology. These procedures are key to the
successful execution of the Aims of all three projects in this Program Project, and centralizing the
immunohistochemical and biochemical assays will ensure consistency and reproducibility, which in turn will
maximize the efficiency and productivity of the scientists within each project."

The Mouse Breeding and Procedure Core (Core C) is essential for the smooth functioning of the Program
Project. Core C has two major functions. First, Core C will provide and oversee mouse breeding and genotyping
services. Mice will be bred centrally for all three projects of the Program Project in order to maximize quality
control and consistency of mouse lines, and to maximize efficiency, particularly for lines shared across the three
Projects. Mice will be mated, born, separated, and weaned by the Core members. The Core will direct tails for
genotyping to NYU Core for Genotyping Services. Once genotyped, Core C will allocate mice to either further
breeding or to experimentation depending on the needs and the genotype/sexes of mice obtained. Core C will
distribute all mice for studies to the three Projects by age 6 weeks. As indicated in the individual Projects, Core
C, through Core A, implements randomization and strategies that will be essential for rigor and reproducibility
and protection against bias. Second, Core C will coordinate and perform mouse procedures. Shared procedures
across the Program Project to be performed and overseen by Core C include: aorta transplantation surgery,
lethal irradiation and bone marrow transplantation; adipose tissue transplantation; parabiosis; glucose and insulin
tolerance tests; imaging studies (liver ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging and DEXA scanning);
isolation of primary cells from the liver, including hepatocytes, Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells and isolation
of extracellular vesicles. Core C will serve all three projects of the Program Project over all five years."

Consortium. The Catalog will incorporate results from IGVF experimental investigation, and
computational analyses using a wealth of information on genomic variants impact on function. The
previously created and publicly released experimental and computational results are unique data used
to discover the associations and networks between human variation, chromosomal elements, and
molecular phenotypes for the purpose of elucidating their complex relationship in human cells and

10841916,"ABSTRACT – ADMINISTRATION & ENRICHMENT CORE (A)
 The goal of the UW Center for Translational Muscle Research (CTMR) will continue to be a centralizing force
that enhances and accelerates research productivity, through critical services, resources and programs and
training to current and new investigators that are our Center members and affiliates. The CTMR promotes
cooperative interactions and recruitment of new clinicians and academic researchers, and enables acceleration,
effectiveness, and efficiency of new and ongoing research to ultimately translate these efforts into better and
new therapies for muscle diseases. In addition to CTMR resources and programs, this is accomplished by
facilitating important resources and expertise in other Centers and Institutes at the UW and the Seattle region.
The Administrative Core (A) coordinates all the necessary leadership, organizational and supervisory activities
of the CTMR. Importantly, the Administrative Core and all three Resources Cores are in close proximity (in three
adjacent and connected Research buildings) on the South Lake Union campus of the UW Medical School.
 The Specific Aims of Core A are to: Aim 1: Provide Effective Leadership, Management and Evaluation of
the Center; Aim 2: Recruit New Members and Promote Collaborations; Aim 3: Administer the Pilot Awards
Program; Aim 4: Provide Communication and Promotion of the CTMR; and Aim 5: provide Outreach and
Mentoring Activities. The Administrative Core is essential to accomplish the overall goals of the Center and the
Seattle area research community to create a `Google Earth' equivalent of muscle research, giving researchers
the ability to study muscle at all scales, from the atomic level where disease begins to the tissue level where
patients are most impacted. The success of the Pilot Awards program has resulted in additional resources that
will be provided by various UW entities in the renewal period. The biomedical research community in the Seattle
area is broad and diverse and covers many disciplines and fields. The integration of these efforts by being
inclusive and progressive is one of the great strengths of Center that is orchestrated through this Core. Multiple
Center efforts go beyond the Seattle area, to the Pacific Northwest region and across the US and western Europe
through collaborations, seminars and skills training. Providing a unified strong environment and voice for the
muscle community, that spans research, the clinic and industry will continue to serve individual and collective
research goals. Support from the P30 is crucial to maintain and grow the strength and vitality of our muscle
research community."
10841917,"ABSTRACT – MECHANICS & PLATFORM DEVELOPMENT CORE (B)
 The primary purpose of muscle is to provide mechanical activity and heat to support a variety of functions and
move bodies through space. These functions are often compromised with disease, injury, and age, originating
at different size and time scales. In turn, therapeutic interventions may be applied at these scales. As such, it
is important to assess muscle structure and function at multiple scales and have the tools that can integrate
information to provide detailed mechanistic insights. Technological advances are important to accelerating this
understanding and to provide improved and novel treatments for muscle dysfunction, using targeted and
potentially personalized approaches. The overall goal of the Mechanics and Platform Development Core is to
continue to provide state-of-the-art mechanical and structural evaluation of muscle across scales to study
disease, injury, aging, repair, and rejuvenation of muscle through training, recruitment, funding of new projects
and providing expertise and guidance to accelerate discovery and advancement in research and development.
 Over the first 4 years of the Center, this Core has developed into a full-service resource for the muscle
community in the Seattle region and beyond. New instrumentation has been developed or purchased that
increases the capacity of the Core to meet the needs of users and allow more detailed studies and mechanistic
insight. In this renewal application we propose to continue meeting user needs and further expand Core
resources to offer improved multi-scale assessment. The Core will continue to operate under the Direction of
Dr. Michael Regnier with additional expertise provided by Dr. Nathan Sniadecki, with training and operational
support by Core research scientists. The goals of Core B remain to provide 1) state of the art instrumentation
and other resources to investigators studying skeletal muscle development and diseases in human, animal and
stem cell models, 2) assays for maturation and manipulation of early-stage muscle cells to develop new human-
like models, and 3) testing and developing novel therapeutic interventions. The Core has instrumentation to
assess contractile function (mechanics and kinetics) at the protein, organelle (myofibril), cell, tissue and organ
levels, and assays for measuring early stage, maturing and adult muscle from animal and human sources and
inducible pluripotent stem cell derived muscle cells. These studies are augmented by the ability to perform
detailed structural and protein composition analyses, and protein biochemical kinetics. The Core also works with
investigators to develop new assessment platforms and assays and trains investigators individually in Core
facilities and through workshops, educates the research, clinical and lay community, and assists in development
of new therapeutic approaches for clinical application and commercialization."
10841918,"ABSTRACT Core C – METABOLISM
The ability to maintain metabolic and redox homeostasis is at the center of muscle health and degeneration.
The Metabolism Core provides access to unique state of the art tools to quantify altered metabolism and
mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle. Disruption of energy homeostasis due to mitochondrial dysfunction is
a key mechanism controlling diverse cellular processes that can lead to muscle degeneration, including the
balance between protein synthesis and degradation, contractile function, E-C coupling, and apoptosis. The
Metabolism Core will provide an integrative approach to analyze the role of changes in metabolic and
mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle dysfunction to a broad user base. We have developed state of the art
tools that include global and targeted metabolomics, magnetic resonance and optical spectroscopy, and
biochemical analyses of isolated mitochondria and permeabilized fibers that will provide vastly improved and
detailed insights into muscle biology, and an ability to monitor therapeutic approaches at the molecular level.
The goal of this core is to expand access to these tools and expertise for experimental design, data collection,
analysis, and interpretation to address the role of metabolism in skeletal muscle health and dysfunction. Aim 1
will provide a broad array of targeted and global metabolomic and lipidomic analyses as well as metabolic flux
measurements from skeletal muscle biopsy, ligaments and tendons, as well as biofluids and related biological
samples. Aim 2 will provide state of the art analyses of in vivo mitochondrial capacity and quality (ATPmax and
P/O) and muscle energy state (PCr/ATP and ADP/ATP). Aim 3 will provide detailed biochemical analyses of
oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial oxidative stress in permeabilized muscle fibers and isolated
mitochondria. These measurements will provide an integrated picture of muscle metabolism, mitochondrial
function and muscle energetics that can be used to understand the mechanisms leading to protection or
pathology in models of skeletal muscle disease. The central role of metabolism connecting all aspects of
muscle physiology allows this Core to provide a natural bridge between the Mechanics and Devices and
Quantitative Analysis Cores of the CTMR."
10914939,"Abstract
Brain circuits can be structurally rearranged with experience, and synaptic connections can grow and be
eliminated, even in adults. We have shown that activity at specific inputs can lead to the production of new
proteins, promoting either long lasting growth of single spines, or cooperation and competition between multiple
synapses following potentiation. The balance between such interactions during structural plasticity can be the
basis for plasticity at the circuit level, which allows for the rewiring of inputs within a dendritic domain. However,
in order to be able to achieve such reorganization, mechanisms for strengthening co-active inputs as well as
those that would achieve weakening and elimination of inputs would be required. The synthesis of new proteins
is crucial for the long term storage of information, long lasting synaptic potentiation and structural plasticity. Of
interest, this is also necessary for long lasting forms of synaptic depression, while much less is understood about
the bidirectional regulation of structural plasticity. In addition to these Hebbian plasticity processes, additional
forms of plasticity, such as homeostatic modulation, impact the plasticity capacity of dendritic branches.
Homeostatic plasticity can scale synaptic currents, as well as spine structures, and can interact with Hebbian
plasticity to elicit plasticity at non active neighbors. In addition, neurons receive diverse patterns of activity at
their inputs, and it is unknown how these effect structural plasticity, or whether they are more or less likely to be
subject to complex integration between co-active inputs. Therefore, using two-photon imaging and glutamate
uncaging to stimulate and monitor plasticity at single spines or defined groups of spines, we will investigate the
relationship between different forms of plasticity and spine structural changes. Specifically, we will determine
whether synaptic depression can be induced at single inputs, what are the structural outputs of this form of
plasticity, and whether protein synthesis dependent depression at multiple inputs can undergo competition.
Further, we will investigate the structural plasticity rules of interactions between different forms of activity, such
as Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity, when they coincide within a dendritic domain at multiple inputs. Beyond
these forms of plasticity, we will also investigate non-regular patterns of activity, that follow instead a Poisson
distribution, in order to build an understanding of how individual inputs process a diversity of activity, how they
integrate this with events at co-active neighbors, and what are the structural correlates of these forms of plasticity.
These experiments will allow us to investigate with unprecedented precision at the molecular, subcellular and
circuit level the dynamics of synaptic interactions, and how they contribute to the building and refinement of
neural circuits necessary for cognitive function."
10840649,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Several transition metals are essential nutrients in human physiology: their acquisition and distribution are
highly regulated, and alterations of metal homeostasis are associated with multiple pathological conditions
including neurodegeneration and cancer. Metal-binding pharmaceuticals are employed clinically to treat metal
overload; however, these chelators target systemic metals rather than intracellular metal dysregulation. Our
research program aims at the design of chelation systems to increase the current understanding of metals in
disease conditions and to modulate metal dysregulation for therapeutic applications in the long term.
 Our current experimental focus is on the role of iron in cancer progression. Because malignant cells require
higher iron levels to sustain fast proliferation rates, we are engineering antiproliferative chelators that are
activated upon cellular uptake to interfere with the availability of the labile iron pool. We employ disulfide bonds
and arylsulfonate moieties as activation switches in prochelators that are activated following reaction with
abundant thiols intracellularly. Exploiting the physiological differences between malignant and normal cells, we
design bioconjugation approaches that increase the selectivity of prochelators for cancer cells. Further
enhancing selectivity, we will also pursue the activation of prochelators by specific proteins that are
overexpressed (or uniquely expressed) in cancer cells. In addition, we will deploy pro-oxidant strategies that
enlist the redox chemistry of chelator-bound iron and copper complexes to generate reactive oxygen species in
targeted cells. A new class of prochelators based on tetrazolium cations will be employed to pilot an initiative to
image iron chelation via photoacoustic methods.
 Our experimental approach blends principles of coordination chemistry and chemical biology to produce a
new generation of advanced chelation strategies. Detailed mechanistic studies will delineate the cellular uptake
of our prochelators as well as their impact on cell cycle, cell death, and iron signaling. Because iron is a
fundamental player in malignant behavior, this research offers opportunities to impact a broad spectrum of
cancer phenotypes. These molecular design strategies are poised to enhance the scope of chelation in cancer
research and potentially in other pathological conditions associated with metal dysregulation."
10840668,"Bacteriophages are the most numerous biological entities in the biosphere. The phage population is also
dynamic, old, and not surprisingly, enormously diverse genetically. Bacteriophage genomes are replete with
genes of unknown function and because of their overall diversity, phage genomes represent the largest
reservoir of novel genes of unknown function. Although a small number of phages have been studied in
enormous detail, our lack of a deeper understanding of the broader diversity of phages represents a
substantial limitation. In particular, as the threat of antimicrobial antibiotic resistance continues to swell, the
therapeutic use of phages to control bacterial infections has garnered substantial attention, but a greater
understanding of phage biology and the determinants of phage-bacterium interactions is now imperative.
The dynamic interaction between bacteria and their viruses has markedly shaped the genomic profiles of both
bacteria and bacteriophages. Lytic infection of bacteria by their phages typically results in cell death, imposing
a strong selection for survival mechanisms. The discovery of restriction-modification (R-M) system marked the
beginning of the elucidation of bacterial defense systems, but other systems quickly followed, and CRISPR-
Cas phage defense has become widely recognized. It is notable that although these genetic systems were
discovered by exploring the basis of host preferences of the phages, R-M and CRISPR-Cas have fueled major
revolutions in biotechnology, harnessing the great enzymatic efficiency and specificity, finely tuned by billions
of years of evolution. The discovery of new phage defense systems has been an especially active area of
discovery, with dozens reported in the past few years, and seemingly many more awaiting recognition.
A collection of over 22,000 individual phages isolated on bacteria within the phylum Actinobacteria – 4,400 of
which are completely sequenced and annotated – provide a powerful resource for investigating bacteriophage
diversity, evolution, origins, and dynamics. A second and newer major resource is a collection of over 500
individual clinical isolates of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), including the opportunistic pathogen
Mycobacterium abscessus. M. abscessus infections are prevalent among people with cystic fibrosis and some
other immune disorders and are intrinsically resistant to most antibiotics and clinically very difficult to treat. The
therapeutic use of phages for treating these infections shows some promise, but broader implementation is
restricted because of the extreme and unpredictable variations in the phage infection profiles of M. abscessus
isolates. These dual resources thus provide a powerful system for exploring the determinants of phage host
range at a strain-specific level, in which bacterial defense systems, prophage-encoded defense systems, and
plasmids all play critical roles. Exploring these dynamics will provide key insights into the drivers of microbial
diversity and evolution and advance the prospects of bacteriophages to become key elements in the treatment
of diseases caused by Mycobacterium pathogens."
10843121,"Project Abstract
The protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium is one of the most important causes of severe diarrheal
disease. In the U.S. this parasite is responsible for half of all waterborne disease outbreaks, some
of which have occurred at massive scale. Patients suffering from immunosuppression due to
HIV/AIDS, organ transplantation, or cancer are in gravest danger. The global public health
impact is even larger: after Rotavirus, Cryptosporidium is the most important diarrheal pathogen
in small children. In particular in the context of malnutrition, cryptosporidiosis has a highly
significant imprint on childhood mortality. Cryptosporidiosis is also linked to stunting, thus
leaving a lasting shadow on the future of children. This parasite has a single host life cycle,
asexual and sexual processes occur sequentially in the intestinal epithelium of the same host.
Completion of this developmental program is required for continued infection, severe disease,
and transmission. We have built robust experimental systems to observe and manipulate the
sexual development of Cryptosporidium and we unraveled key elements of the mechanisms that
control the underlying gene expression systems. In this application we will define the epigenetic
mechanisms that govern transition from asexual to sexual replication, we will unravel how the
parasites choses between a male or female fate, and we will use emerging cyro-electron
tomography and parasite genetics to understand how the unique ultrastructure of male gametes
enables fertilization. The resulting findings will impact on our fundamental understanding of
parasite development and on translational efforts to develop drugs and vaccines."

Ongoing support is requested for a “Graduate Program in Comparative Medicine” in the College of Veterinary
Medicine at Cornell University. Six post-doctoral positions are requested to provide training to DVMs seeking a
PhD. The Comparative Medicine Program combines the very best that Cornell offers in the form of didactic
graduate-level instruction, faculty supervision and training related activities. Trainees can follow one of two
tracks: one is geared to a career in basic research and one to a career in translational science. In each case,
training is structured to ensure the orderly progression of scholars to independence. Research areas available
to trainees are broad and include infectious disease, immunology, epidemiology, cancer biology, cell biology
and signal transduction, genomics and genetics, developmental biology, molecular medicine, and
neuroscience.
The proposed program combines independent, faculty-guided research with formal didactic instruction in cell
and molecular biology, genomics, and biostatistics, career counseling, and a variety of professional enrichment
activities calculated to develop the trainees' critical capacity, communication and teamwork skills. Graduate
scholars would earn the PhD degree. The average time to degree for veterinarians seeking a PhD at Cornell
University is 4.3 years; however, funding is requested for three years. The first six to nine months of training
support will be provided by Graduate Research Assistantships provided by the College of Veterinary Medicine
at Cornell. It is expected that trainees will apply for individual fellowships (“K” awards or equivalent) that would
support the trainee as they finish their graduate studies and transition to independent careers. However, all
trainers are selected with the goal of ensuring training support continues independent of any fellowship award.
Program alumni are encouraged to undertake at least two years of research beyond their PhD degree
preferably in a related discipline and at a different institution before accepting their initial appointment as an
independent investigator. Many alumni are expected to realize careers as faculty members in U.S. veterinary
colleges or medical schools, although some may seek research positions in independent institutions,
government, or industry. The goal of the program is to train veterinary scientists that can meet the national
need for trained veterinarians within academia, industry, public health, and government to address problems
relating to animal and human health."
10843128,"Research Summary/Abstract:
The overall goal of the Grenning research lab is to develop programable and highly diversifiable platforms for
accessing complex chemical space of interest to drug discovery. Summarized herein is an overview of work and
future directions aimed at transforming the classic Cope rearrangement into a versatile synthetic transformation
of high value for complex molecule synthesis. While variants of the Cope rearrangement (e.g. the oxy-Cope
rearrangement, aza-Cope rearrangement, and divinylcyclopropane Cope rearrangement) have found extensive
use and value in modern chemical synthesis, the classic Cope has not. This transformation is a diamond in the
rough that, post-MIRA funding, will have clear and diverse value to chemical synthesis and drug discovery. In
our published and unpublished works, we have addressed (or are addressing) fundamental challenges related
to thermodynamics and kinetics and proposed potential applications of this transformation in modular complex
molecule synthesis. Our current and future directions will involve continuing to improve our understanding of this
transformation, develop unique, complexity generating transformations and/or sequences where this
transformation plays a key role, introduce a variety of catalytic-asymmetric methods for accessing
enantioenriched building blocks, and prepare molecules of modern interest to drug discovery; a well-rounded
and diverse research program focusing both on fundamental and applied chemical discoveries. Regarding the
latter goal, we currently have on going collaborations with many medicinal chemistry and chemical biology
groups and will continue to make new connections allowing for the most impactful discoveries related to synthesis
and medicine. Funding of this proposal will result in new and general transformations of value beyond the scope
of the proposal and new leads for drug discovery. For example, we have already established a highly modular
route to Vorinostat analogs and collaboratively (with the Pflum lab at Wayne State University) will examine their
bioactivity as HDAC inhibitors. Beyond or chemistry products (methods, syntheses, and molecules), we are
requesting significant funding for the training of students and postdocs to professional synthetic chemists which
will be of critical value to a knowledgeable, scientific workforce of value to a variety of technical industries. For
example, Ph.D. graduates from my lab are currently continuing their studies as post docs (e.g. Primali Navaratne;
Stoltz Lab) or have gone directly into industry (Ehsan Fereyduni; Research Scientist at Intel).

10843231,"The Yale School of Medicine has a strong record of accomplishments in training medical students for careers in
academic medicine and research. Yale is also home to several world-renowned, aging-focused research centers.
We are therefore ideally poised to address the critical shortage of physician-scientists trained in aging across the
translational spectrum. This resubmission application is for a competitive renewal of NIA support for medical
students (NIA Short-Term Training: Students in Health Professional Schools). The purpose of the grant
application is to provide intensive short-term training in research for selected pre-doctoral medical students in
outstanding aging-focused laboratories and training sites at the Yale School of Medicine by providing qualified
Yale medical students to research experiences in biomedical sciences in areas of interest to NIA. Notably, since
we were awarded our first NIA T35, there has been more than a 50% increase in the number of Yale medical
students conducting aging-focused research. Therefore, we have achieved our goal of catalyzing student
interest in this area and in the next funding period will continue this momentum as follows.
Trainees will be medical students who have completed at least one year of medical school curriculum. Ten
students per year will be selected for this short-term training support based on the quality of a formal written
proposal of the planned research and the quality of the mentor and the training environment. The Program will
be supported by Yale’s Program on Aging and will provide students with the opportunity to receive mentored
research training from aging-focused investigators at our institution. Participating departments and sections will
include anesthesia, comparative medicine, internal medicine (sections of geriatrics, cardiovascular medicine,
endocrinology, general medicine, infectious diseases, pulmonary, rheumatology), emergency medicine,
neurology, neuroscience, orthopedics & rehabilitation, psychiatry, public health (sections of health policy, and
social & behavioral sciences), and surgery (section of vascular). A carefully designed program of mentorship,
supplemented by a formal didactic program, will ensure that students receive rigorous training in aging research
that is appropriate for their stage of training.
By providing students with access to a diverse pool of mentors with projects ranging from experimental and
laboratory research to outcomes, health services, and community-engaged research across many clinical
disciplines, we are well poised to offer medical students short term research training in NIA related domains. The
proposed training program can inspire and facilitate the eventual pursuit of academic careers in aging by
supporting research and scholarly experiences focused on aging early in students’ training to which they may
not have otherwise had access."
10843233,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nearly 100,000 patients with kidney failure in the US await kidney transplantation. Living donation reduces the
wait and offers superior survival compared with deceased donation. Yet only 6,000 living kidney donations are
achieved every year with a substantial decline in donation among biologically related donors in across
race/ethnicity. While prior programs were associated with a 6-fold increase in donor referral, efforts to convert
donor candidates to donor nephrectomy have been largely unsuccessful. Access to a transplant center is a key
barrier to engagement of donor candidates. Alas, the pandemic has amplified this existing barrier.
Living kidney donor evaluation is a complex multiphase process that includes activities over approximately one
year. We have previously reported that two-thirds of referred persons are deemed medically ineligible donors
after reviewing medical history and/or laboratory screening results. Of the one-third who are deemed eligible
donor candidates, only 54% complete donor evaluation and counseling (of whom 58% ultimately donate),
whereas 35% cannot proceed to complete this initial outpatient clinic visit due to non-medical (personal, social,
and arrangement) reasons. The initial outpatient clinic visit is thus a bottleneck as it involves the first obligatory
trip to an in-person visit where access to a transplant center becomes a barrier for willing candidates facing
geographic, financial, or logistics challenges to come for their initial in-person evaluations. Efforts to promote
engagement of kidney donor candidates are needed. Telemedicine via synchronous video visits can facilitate
coordination of care in the donor evaluation process. Donor evaluation may become more accessible, efficient,
and convenient. The rapid adoption of telemedicine during the pandemic has created opportunities and
challenges. In our national survey of US transplant centers, we found that 81% reported telemedicine
challenges related to structure and processes of care. In primary care studies, telemedicine video visits have
achieved high levels of patient satisfaction and similar outcomes compared to in-person visits. A knowledge
gap exists regarding how donor candidates perceive telemedicine in care coordination, and how to best tailor
telemedicine care coordination in donor evaluation.
Our scientifically goal is to integrate a telemedicine care coordination intervention into the donor evaluation
process to enhance engagement of donor candidates and support completion of their evaluation. This award
will allow Dr. Al Ammary the protected time to complete his proposed research. Findings of this work will fill a
knowledge gap about the new paradigm using telemedicine for donor evaluation and offer preliminary data for
an R01-funded randomized clinical trial to test the effectiveness of telemedicine care coordination in increasing
living donation and support his transition to independence."
10841256,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Training the next generation of translational scientists to transform discoveries into benefits for clinical care
will require a strong research foundation adjoined to pioneering training in innovation and entrepreneurship.
Here, we propose a new T32 Postdoctoral Training Program, the Health Sciences Innovation and
Entrepreneurship (HSIE) Training Program, which is designed as an innovative learning solution to speed
the process of turning observations in the laboratory into clinical interventions to improve the health of
individuals and the public. The two-year, multi-disciplinary HSIE Training Program will offer traditional
department-based research training and deep disciplinary knowledge to trainees in the Colleges of Medicine,
Nursing, Pharmacy and Public Health at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Basic skills of
entrepreneurship also will be taught to postdoctoral trainees, who exhibit a passion for transforming health
science discoveries into new diagnostics, medications, medical devices, and telemedicine products. Seventy-
nine of the most innovative clinical and translational scientists across our campus will serve on coaching teams
with primary research mentors and entrepreneurship advisors from the Arkansas business community to
formulate individual development plans with trainees that will harmonize with their career goals. Trainees will
earn a 15-credit Graduate Certificate in Health Science Innovation and Entrepreneurship that will provide
individualized experiences tailored to their career interests including industry internships, shadowing of
entrepreneurs, and other opportunities to cross boundaries. The HSIE Training Program will sponsor a 2-credit
cross-CTSA seminar series, “Health Science Entrepreneurs: Innovators of Health Care”, which will offer
postdocs the opportunity to interact with national entrepreneurs, learn about varied career paths within the
translational science spectrum, and increase entrepreneurial activity across CTSA hubs by heightening
awareness of the steps required to translate new technologies and concepts through commercialization into
improved health care. Three 3-credit courses will be offered to trainees by the nationally ranked Graduate
Entrepreneurship Program in the Walton College of Business at the University of Arkansas flagship campus in
Fayetteville. After learning business principles, a Capstone Project is a gateway for teams of interdisciplinary
trainees to gain skills in communication, systems thinking, and process innovation while they develop a
business plan for translating a research discovery into a health care product or service. The HSIE Training
Program is an exciting opportunity that directly addresses the NRSA program objective of the National Center
for Advancing Translational Scientists (NCATS) to equip trainees with the knowledge, skills and abilities to
advance diagnostics, therapeutics, clinical interventions and behavioral modifications that improve health."
10841347,"Project summary
 Due to advances in genome sequencing, researchers have discovered that
hybridization, or genetic exchange between species, is widespread. Research over the
past decade has demonstrated that hybridization is an important process that has
contributed to the modern-day genomes of many eukaryotic species, including
humans and our relatives. Given how recently biologists came to appreciate the
importance of hybridization, there are basic unanswered questions about its genetic
and evolutionary consequences. Addressing these questions from the single gene to
the genomic scale is the major focus of research in my lab group.
 Hybridization is not simply a feature of a population's history; it can impact
diverse biological processes from adaptation to disease. During the first four years
of R35 funding in my lab group, we studied several fundamental genetic consequences
of hybridization and developed new computational methods to study hybridization.
Because the genomes of two species have been evolving is isolation, combining these
genomes can have severe consequences. We used the swordtail model system
developed by my lab to pinpoint the genetic interactions that breakdown in hybrids and
the mechanisms through which they act. We will continue this work by building the first
genome-wide map of such genetic interactions in vertebrates and by unravelling the
molecular mechanisms that lead to melanoma and embryonic lethality in hybrids.
 My lab also studies broad scale principles governing where in the genome
hybrid ancestry persists and where it is removed by selection. Our past work
uncovered a key role of recombination rate and the density of conserved base pairs in
shaping the dynamics of genetic exchange between species along the genome. We
propose to continue this work to uncover additional processes shaping evolution after
hybridization on a genome-wide scale, focusing on the role of structural
rearrangements, divergence in transposable element families, and protein complexes.
Together this research will help us understand the mechanisms shaping genome
evolution after hybridization in species across the tree of life."
10841352,"Social status is a major determinant of individual success. Status is gained or lost over the course
of repeated interactions generating hierarchies within groups. These dominance hierarchies are
key features of all animal societies, including our own. While hierarchies are often stable,
predicting an individual’s position within the hierarchy can be very difficult. This is in part because
status can be influenced by numerous factors such as nepotism, genetic variation and perhaps
most importantly, previous experience. Considerable evidence highlights how an individual’s
current success is strongly determined by their previous success: winners keep winning and
losers keep losing. Our understanding of how and why these winner/loser effects occur is still
limited, preventing our ability to explain and more importantly, predict why some interactions lead
to entrenched status and others lead to upsets in contest outcomes. Here I propose to use a novel
framework, Bayesian updating, to describe how individuals respond to dominance interactions
throughout their lives. Bayesian updating is a computational mechanism whereby individuals can
update their beliefs about the likelihood of a given outcome based on their previous (prior)
information and the current information they are receiving. Bayesian updating mimics the inherent
path-dependency of changes in social status and offers a longer-term perspective on phenotypic
change than current models. Here I will use this framework to make predictions about behavioral,
neurological and physiological responses to accumulated social defeats and successes over the
lifetime. I will do this using a novel animal system, the Amazon molly. This naturally clonal
vertebrate gives birth to independent offspring providing a unique opportunity to fully isolate the
effects of previous experience on behavior, neural activation and hormonal pathways while
controlling for genetic and inherited factors that also influence dominance and status. This work
will improve our understanding of how previous experiences can ripple forward to influence
current behavior which has implications for our ability to predict responses to behavioral and
pharmacological interventions, for pathological or maladaptive behavior (e.g. bullying, PTSD) and
can help highlight how inequities can perpetuate throughout the lifetime of individuals."

three R01's from NIDCR and has published featured articles in Developmental Cell, eLife, Development, and
PLoS Genetics on diverse topics ranging from craniofacial development to jawbone repair and arthritis of the
jaw. He has built up an exceptional research team, with several trainees receiving K99 and F31 fellowships
from NIDCR, as well as prestigious private fellowships. His previous trainees have gone on to tenure-track
faculty and industry positions, and postdocs in HHMI-funded labs. He also participates in local and national
efforts to recruit under-represented minority students into stem cell science from high school to graduate
levels. These efforts are reflected by a USC Mentoring Award to Dr. Crump in 2017. The research program
focuses on the roles of progenitor cells in building the facial skeleton and then maintaining and repairing it in
the adult. These studies exploit the unique genetic and imaging strengths of zebrafish, combined with its
impressive capabilities of natural regeneration as adults. The first program uses new gene editing technology
in zebrafish to analyse requirements for novel craniofacial patterning genes in progenitor regulation, as well as
to directly image progenitor lineage commitment using time-lapse microscopy. As exemplified by studies of
Jagged-Notch signaling from fish to man, efforts to validate zebrafish findings in mouse will be performed in
latter years. The second program investigates the stem cell-based maintenance of two types of joints, the
sutures of the skull and the synovial jaw joint. The third program builds on innovative models of bone, cartilage,
and joint regeneration in the adult zebrafish jaw, as well as a highly collaborative network of basic researchers
and clinicians at USC, to understand how different types of endogenous stem cells are activated to repair
craniofacial tissues. Completion of these studies will reveal commonalities and differences between the stem
cells that build and then maintain and repair the craniofacial skeleton, with foundational knowledge acquired in
zebrafish informing future regenerative approaches towards improving skeletal healing in patients."

member of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Stem Cell Research, a rapidly growing institute directed by Dr.
Andrew McMahon with exceptional core resources and recently recruited junior faculty. He is currently PI on
three R01's from NIDCR and has published featured articles in Developmental Cell, eLife, Development, and
PLoS Genetics on diverse topics ranging from craniofacial development to jawbone repair and arthritis of the
jaw. He has built up an exceptional research team, with several trainees receiving K99 and F31 fellowships
from NIDCR, as well as prestigious private fellowships. His previous trainees have gone on to tenure-track
faculty and industry positions, and postdocs in HHMI-funded labs. He also participates in local and national
efforts to recruit under-represented minority students into stem cell science from high school to graduate
levels. These efforts are reflected by a USC Mentoring Award to Dr. Crump in 2017. The research program
focuses on the roles of progenitor cells in building the facial skeleton and then maintaining and repairing it in
the adult. These studies exploit the unique genetic and imaging strengths of zebrafish, combined with its
impressive capabilities of natural regeneration as adults. The first program uses new gene editing technology
in zebrafish to analyse requirements for novel craniofacial patterning genes in progenitor regulation, as well as
to directly image progenitor lineage commitment using time-lapse microscopy. As exemplified by studies of
Jagged-Notch signaling from fish to man, efforts to validate zebrafish findings in mouse will be performed in
latter years. The second program investigates the stem cell-based maintenance of two types of joints, the
sutures of the skull and the synovial jaw joint. The third program builds on innovative models of bone, cartilage,
and joint regeneration in the adult zebrafish jaw, as well as a highly collaborative network of basic researchers
and clinicians at USC, to understand how different types of endogenous stem cells are activated to repair
craniofacial tissues. Completion of these studies will reveal commonalities and differences between the stem
cells that build and then maintain and repair the craniofacial skeleton, with foundational knowledge acquired in
zebrafish informing future regenerative approaches towards improving skeletal healing in patients."

Auditory-guided behavior is ubiquitous in everyday life, whenever auditory information is used to guide the
decisions we make and the actions we take. One such behavior is auditory categorization, a process that reflects
the ability to transform bottom-up sensory stimuli into discrete perceptual categories and use these perceptual
categories to drive a subsequent action. Although this process is well-documented at the behavioral and
cognitive levels, surprisingly little is known about the explicit neural circuit mechanisms that underlie categorical
computation and how the result of this computation drives behavioral outcomes.
We believe that the transformation of auditory information into an appropriate behavioral response is necessarily
a brain-wide endeavor. The deep layers of the auditory cortex give rise to several massive projection systems
that exert influence over many downstream brain areas. Of these, extratelencephalic (ET) neurons within layer
5b have long been regarded as canonical “broadcast” neurons, pooling inputs from a variety of sources and
transmitting signals throughout the brain. These neurons are unique in that they provide the only direct
connection between the neocortex and various behaviorally relevant subcortical structures, placing them in a
privileged position where they can readily influence auditory-guided behavior.
To understand the role that ET neurons play in auditory-guided behavior necessitates in vivo, cell-type specific
recordings, in awake behaving animals. To this end, we have designed a novel auditory categorization task that
can be readily learned by head-fixed mice. Our preliminary data, both anatomical and physiological, posits that
ET neurons become selective to discrete perceptual categories across learning, and this selectivity is mediated
by top-down input from higher-order cortex. The goal of this proposal is to leverage cutting-edge techniques to
test three specific hypotheses: (1) ET neurons are necessary for auditory categorization, and this necessity is
both learning-dependent and specific to distinct axon collaterals (Aim 1), (2) ET response properties change
across learning to reflect discrete perceptual categories (Aim 2), and (3) ET learned categorical selectivity is
shaped via top-down inputs from higher-order cortex that act as a flexible, task-dependent filter (Aim 3).
Combined, this research will take an important first step towards understanding the role of descending circuits
in auditory-guided behavior will unveil the greater auditory pathway that lies beyond its classical terminus in
primary auditory cortex."

Regulated exocytosis – stimulus-dependent exocytic vesicle fusion – mediates a broad range of fundamental
biological processes including nutrient homeostasis, cell-to-cell signaling, and elimination of transformed or
virally infected cells. Imbalances in these exocytic pathways lead to major forms of human disease. The long-
term goal of this project is to uncover the protein networks governing regulated exocytosis. A major model
pathway we use is insulin-stimulated GLUT4 exocytosis, a physiologically important but poorly characterized
regulated exocytic pathway. We also examine key aspects of other exocytic pathways, aiming to establish
conserved and divergent mechanisms of regulated exocytosis. In our previous research, we carried out CRISPR
genetic screens to systematically dissect insulin-stimulated GLUT4 exocytosis and other exocytic pathways, and
identified a large number of new regulators. In this proposed research, we will carry out in-depth biochemical
and genetic studies to characterize new exocytic regulators isolated in the screens. We will also investigate how
exocytic vesicle fusion is coupled with other cellular processes such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME)
and intracellular signaling to achieve an appropriate exocytic response. In particular, we will examine how AP2
adaptor, a central player in CME, is assembled in the cytosol with the assistance of dedicated assembly
chaperones. Besides these in-depth mechanistic studies, we will continue to identify and validate new regulators
based on candidate genes isolated in our CRISPR screens. The mechanistic studies and CRISPR screens are
fully complementary and will provide a comprehensive understanding of regulated exocytosis that neither
approach alone could generate. Successful completion of this proposed research will fill major gaps in the
knowledge of regulated exocytosis and will serve as a springboard for understanding the molecular basis of
membrane trafficking in general. Ultimately, insights gleaned from this work will facilitate the development of new
therapeutic strategies for diseases caused by dysregulated exocytosis."

In 2018, an estimated 88 million Americans 18 years of age and older or approximately one-third of the adult
U.S. population had prediabetes. In 2002, the Diabetes Prevention Program clinical trial demonstrated that an
intensive lifestyle intervention designed to produce and maintain a 7% reduction in initial body weight and
increase moderate physical activity to 150 minutes per week reduced the incidence of diabetes by 58% over 2.8
years. In 2010, Congress authorized the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to establish,
manage, and expand the National Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). Eligibility criteria for enrollment in the
DPP (fasting glucose 100-125 mg/dl or 2-hour glucose 140-199 mg/dl or hemoglobin A1c 5.7-6.7% or high risk
score on ADA/CDC prediabetes risk screener or personal history of gestational diabetes) were broader than
those used in the clinical trial, the format of the intervention (group versus individual), the personnel delivering
the intervention (medical personnel versus trained lay leaders), the delivery mode (in-person versus virtual
(telehealth) versus online), and the duration (3 years versus 1 year) all differed from the clinical trial. Although
the trial demonstrated that the intervention was both effective and cost-effective, the long-term effectiveness and
cost-effectiveness of DPP-like programs implemented in real-world settings have not been established. The
purpose of this proposal is to assess individual and system-level barriers to and facilitators of participation in the
National DPP/Medicare DPP and to evaluate the long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the DPP as
implemented in real-world settings. By assessing individual and system level barriers to and facilitators of
participation in the DPP, and by evaluating the long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the DPP as
implemented in real-world settings, this study will provide information critical to improving the uptake and impact
of the DPP on diabetes in the United States."

In an innovative scientific partnership between researchers, the UC Office of the President (UCOP), and
Intermountain Healthcare, we will leverage existing electronic health record (EHR), insurance claims and
DPP cohort data to examine the long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Diabetes Prevention
Program (DPP), as well as barriers and facilitators of participation in DPP in real-world settings. We
proposed a rigorous evaluation using diverse data sources from the University of California (UC), which is a
multi-campus university system and one of the largest employers in the State of California, and
Intermountain Healthcare, which is a three-state regional health network. We will create a merged multi-
ethnic and geographically diverse electronic cohort of adults at-risk of developing type 2 diabetes who
enrolled in DPP and propensity-matched controls who did not enroll in DPP. We will include all DPP delivery
models that have been in existence for nearly a decade in both systems. To assess the effectiveness of
real-world DPP delivery, we will examine percent weight change at 5-years follow-up among adults at risk
for developing type 2 diabetes, comparing those who completed DPP with those who did not enroll, and
also comparing those who started but did not complete DPP with those who did not enroll (primary
outcome). Secondary outcomes will examine changes in cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., blood pressure,
tobacco use), rates of incident type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related healthcare service utilization and
related costs. To assess the cost-effectiveness of real-world DPP delivery, we will estimate cost per case of
type 2 diabetes prevented and cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained at 5-years follow-up. We
will also examine whether long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness vary by several factors, including
DPP entry criteria (e.g., blood test vs. risk test), program delivery mode, social determinants of health, age
group, or race and ethnicity. To examine barriers and facilitators to DPP participation, we will survey a
representative subset of DPP participants and non-participants. We will leverage our team's expertise in
DPP evaluation and track record of collaboration, and we will work closely with the coordinating center to
carry out this comprehensive multi-site evaluation study. Findings from this study will inform future UC
System and Intermountain Healthcare strategies addressing obesity and type 2 diabetes prevention, as well
as dissemination of effective strategies to other large university systems, healthcare systems and
employers."

Complex structural variants (SVs) are a class of mutations consisting of clustered DNA copy number changes
and rearrangements. These alterations can produce driver mutations in cancer but have been underexplored
due to the analytical limitations of bulk short read sequencing. There is an urgent need for new computational
tools that can apply long-range and single cell genomic profiles to structural variant analysis. Genome graphs
are a computational framework that can be extended to these new data modalities to study the allelic structure
and evolution of complex SVs. Recent genome graph analysis of pan-cancer whole genomes by our lab identified
a novel complex structural variant pattern termed pyrgo. Pyrgo consist of “towers” of clustered tandem
duplications and are enriched in prostate and ovarian adenocarcinomas. In Aim 1, we will construct haplotype
graphs to characterize the allelic structure of pyrgo. Haplotype graphs represent allele-specific genomic
segment and junction copy numbers and will be inferred from long range profiling data. Using these graphs, we
will characterize the parental and somatic allele structure of pyrgo duplications in pan-cancer genomes. We will
identify associations between allelic structure and cell-of-origin, prior systemic therapy, and genomic features
such as chromatin loops and replication timing. In Aim 2, we will construct single cell genome graphs that
recapitulate the evolution of pyrgo. Single cell genome graphs are a set of phylogenetically linked genome
graphs representing the structural variants present in individual cells, along with the ancestral subclone in which
each aberrant genomic junction first arose. These graphs will be inferred from single cell whole genome profiles.
We will use single cell genome graphs to model the acquisition of tandem duplications comprising pyrgo during
tumor evolution in ovarian adenocarcinoma tissue samples."

For patients with advanced cardiovascular disease, implanted cardiac devices can significantly improve their
survival and quality of life. While lifesaving, cardiac devices carry the added risk of developing a cardiac device
infection (CDI), in which case the device has to be surgically removed. In many cases, patients with a CDI
present with vague symptoms and undergo a number of inconclusive tests, resulting in a delay in their diagnosis.
If left undiagnosed or untreated the mortality from a CDI is high. If identified early, CDIs can be treated swiftly,
thereby reducing infection-related complications. Currently there are no reliable methods for early prevention or
identification of CDI. Rapid and accurate CDI diagnosis is critical in cardiac device recipients who have a
Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection, as the risk of CDI approaches 50%. Building on the candidate's
published work, this research will use the singular resource of the Bloodstream Infection Biorepository to define
the vascular biomarker signature associated with an individual's risk for a S. aureus-CDI. Second, the biological
basis for why some, but not all patients, develop a CDI will be identified through the application of a novel in vitro
model system of bacteremia, created by the candidate in collaboration with Biomedical Engineering. This project
will: 1) define the biomarker signature associated with S. aureus-CDI, 2) determine how changes in vascular
mechanics affect infection risk, and 3) apply a novel tissue engineered blood vessel system to identify critical
endothelial-bacterial-device interactions that impact CDI risk. Results from this project will serve as a basis for
follow-up R01 proposals, which will prospectively evaluate adjunctive CDI biomarker signatures among other
etiologies of bloodstream infection and determine if a patient's endothelial phenotype is an independent risk
factor for CDI. This project has direct relevance to the NHLBI's strategic goals and objectives of identifying
phenotypic, biomarker, and molecular characteristics predictive of outcome, that when applied in clinical studies,
can predict differential response to therapy in individuals. This project will also support the candidate's transition
to an independent research career. This project will provide expertise and advanced skillsets in tissue
engineering, vascular biology, and clinical research, all of which are necessary for the candidate's long-term
career goal of identifying key factors that impact susceptibility to CDIs and developing effective therapeutic
strategies for their prevention and treatment. The primary mentor for this award is Dr. Vance Fowler, an
internationally recognized clinician-scientist in S. aureus bacteremia who has extensive experience as a mentor
of junior faculty researchers. A complementary and diverse group of mentors will provide guidance in tissue
engineering (Dr. Truskey) and vascular biology (Dr. Kontos). The candidate will use the outstanding resources
and interdisciplinary working groups at Duke University Medical Center, the Pratt School of Engineering, the
Duke Cardiovascular Research Center, and the Antibiotic Resistance Leadership Group to launch her career as
an independent physician-scientist."

 Genome-wide screens using CRISPR-Cas9 technology have revolutionized studies of
host-pathogen interactions, leading to identification of many key host cellular factors required for
the actions of human pathogens and bacterial toxins. However, this powerful approach has yet to
be utilized in insect cells to uncover host factors required for insect-borne pathogens, which are
responsible for a long list of infectious diseases such as malaria, Dengue, West Nile, Zika, and
Lyme diseases. This is largely due to a technical barrier: the inability to efficiently deliver genome-
wide guide RNA library into insect cells. We recently overcame this barrier and developed a
genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening method in cultured Drosophila cells. Using this method,
and by leveraging the expertise of Dr. Norbert Perrimon’s lab in insect models and of Dr. Min
Dong’s lab in bacterial toxins, we carried out extensive preliminary studies, leading to the
identification of a potential insect receptor for a member of the major bacterial toxin family known
as Tc toxins, demonstrating the power and feasibility of our unbiased genome-wide screen

understanding of toxin-receptor interactions and their role in pathogenesis in vitro and in vivo. We
further propose to expand our approach to establish the first genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9

key host factors for two novel bacterial toxins that showed selective toxicity on mosquito but not
Drosophila cells. The success of our proposal will uncover receptors and key host cellular factors
for important bacterial toxins and establish generalizable methods and essential tools for
investigating pathogens and toxins at genome-wide scale in insect cells relevant to transmitting

Protein-nucleic acid interactions are central to many biological processes. Our research is
focused on two areas of protein-nucleic acid interactions: bacterial defense systems and
translesion DNA synthesis (TLS). The studies on bacterial defense systems are an extension of
our decades-long work on restriction-modification (R-M) systems. Over the past few years, many
new bacterial defense systems have been discovered, and motivated by our success with R-M
systems, we will undertake studies on two new systems: the cyclic oligonucleotide based anti-
phage signaling system (CBASS) and a short prokaryotic Argonaute (pAgo) system. We will
determine how these systems confer bacterial immunity; in particular, how they become
allosterically activated for abortive infection - to prevent propagation of the invading DNA
throughout the bacterial cell population. The studies on TLS are a continuation of our pioneering
work on TLS polymerases and in understanding how cells cope with DNA damage. Recent
advances in cryo-EM have allowed us to approach what seemed impossible at one-time, namely
the structure of the complex multi-subunit TLS polymerase Polz. Polz stands out as the pivotal
DNA polymerase in eukaryotes for maintaining genome integrity, and we will address how Polz
works in conjunction with another polymerase Rev1 to extend DNA synthesis from DNA lesions.
Together, these studies will set new paradigms in our understanding of bacterial immunity and in
how eukaryotic cells cope with daily genotoxic stresses."
10842010,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Epigenetics refers to effects on gene expression or function that are inheritable through mitosis
or meiosis without altering the primary DNA sequences. Epigenetic mechanisms play important
roles in regulating cell identity and activity. Failure in appropriate epigenetic regulation leads to
abnormal behaviors of cells, which underlies many diseases such as diabetes, muscular
dystrophy, neurodegenerative disease, infertility, and many forms of cancer.
Many types of stem cells undergo asymmetric cell divisions to give rise to two daughter cells
with distinct cell fates: a self-renewed stem cell and to another daughter cell that differentiates.
We found that during the asymmetric division of Drosophila male germline stem cell (GSC), the
preexisting histones are selectively segregated to the GSC whereas newly synthesized histones
are enriched in the differentiating daughter cell. Our studies provide the first direct evidence that
stem cells retain preexisting histones during asymmetric cell divisions in vivo, which may
contribute to maintain their unique epigenetic memory.
In this proposal, we plan to: (1) explore what mechanisms control asymmetric versus symmetric
histone incorporation in Drosophila male germline; (2) study asymmetric histone inheritance and
its biological functions in Drosophila neuroblast and intestinal stem cell systems; (3) develop a
new method to identify genetic locus with epigenetic signature. We anticipate that our studies
will lead to (1) a series of findings to resolve fundamental questions in biology and yield new
insights in explaining cell fate determination in multicellular organisms, (2) the development of
new tools that will benefit the broader scientific community, and (3) insight on therapeutic
strategies against various diseases, such as degenerative disease and many forms of cancer, due
to mis-regulated cell fate determination."

10834882,"Background: Over 75% of Veterans referred for behavioral health assessments endorse significant relationship
concerns. Relationship distress leads to a wide range of health and mental health problems, whereas healthy
intimate relationships are an important part of biopsychosocial models of resilience and rehabilitation.
Improving social functioning is an RR&D priority, and VHA directive 1163.04 mandates all Veterans have
access to a flexible continuum of family mental health services. However, access to couples’ interventions is
limited: trained couple therapists are limited in number and location, and they are underutilized due to logistical
barriers couples face including coordinating schedules, dual time off work, childcare, and stigma. Because of
these barriers, over 60% of divorced couples never accessed couples’ treatment, and Veterans spend four to
seven years in relationship distress before getting help. Digital health is a critical part of solving problems of
access to care. Digital interventions for couples provide flexible access to evidence-based relationship
interventions and are essential for providing scalable access to family mental health care. OurRelationship is
an online adaptation of an evidence-based couple therapy (Integrative Behavioral Couple Therapy), which
combines eight hours of a self-paced online couples’ program with three 20-minute telehealth coaching
sessions. Several RCTs show OurRelationship improves relationship functioning and individual mental health,
including among community-recruited Veterans. Our pilot data from 13 couples recruited over two months in
VA San Diego indicate Veterans find OurRelationship appealing and helpful. However, OurRelationship has
not yet been rigorously evaluated with a Veteran population in a VA medical center setting.
Methodology: The proposed 5-year study is a 2-month waitlist-controlled randomized clinical trial. We aim to
serve 90 Veterans with mental health concerns and relationship distress and their partners (N = 180), recruited
from individual and family mental health clinics within VASDHS. Data on rehabilitation outcomes including
relationship functioning (primary outcome), relationship behaviors (e.g., communication, conflict), individual
functioning (e.g., functional disability, family role), and psychiatric symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety) will be
collected at baseline, mid-program, post-program, and 6-month follow-up. We will collect participant feedback
via qualitative interviews and quantitative ratings of therapeutic alliance and program satisfaction.
Aims: Aim 1 is to examine feasibility and acceptability of implementing OurRelationship in a VA setting with
Veterans and their partners. Aim 2 is to evaluate efficacy of the OurRelationship program on improving
relationship functioning for Veterans and their partners. Aim 3 is to explore mediation of improvements in
individual functional outcomes by improvements in relationship functioning.
Career Development Plan: This mentored career development award will support Dr. Knopp in becoming an
independent clinical researcher and an expert in the role of digital health and couples’ interventions in
rehabilitation within the VA system. Through mentorship from Dr. Leslie Morland and co-mentorship from Dr.
Colin Depp, Dr. Shirley Glynn, and Dr. Brian Doss, this CDA-2 training plan builds on Dr. Knopp’s clinical and
research background in intimate relationships to enhance her 1) competence in clinical trial design and
analysis, 2) knowledge of digital healthcare technology and research, 3) skills in longitudinal dyadic trial data,
and 4) professional development as a VA rehabilitation clinical researcher. This training will prepare Dr. Knopp
to continue this program of research by submitting a VA RR&D Merit award application focused on providing
adjunctive digital couples’ interventions to maximize benefit of individual mental health treatments."
10834978,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Cataracts result from progressive aggregation of eye lens crystallin proteins. Severity of age-onset cataract has
been linked to specific post-translational modifications in crystallins that accumulate during aging. Two important
classes of cataract-associated modifications are oxidation of Trp residues to more hydrophilic products and
oxidation of Cys residues to generate disulfide bonds. Our prior research has revealed a crucial synergy between
the two. The W42Q variant of human γD crystallin (a Trp oxidation mimic) and the W42R congenital-cataract
variant, are destabilized but well folded and soluble under reducing conditions, yet formation of a non-native
internal disulfide bond (Cys32-Cys41) kinetically traps them in a partially unfolded conformational intermediate,
generating rapid and robust aggregation at physiologically relevant temperature, pH, and concentration in vitro.
We have developed a rapid, atomistic Monte-Carlo modeling method, with a knowledge-based statistical
potential, that is uniquely suited for the study of conformational intermediates, including in multiple polypeptide
chains as they simultaneously unfold to reveal new protein-protein interactions. We have already applied this
method to γD crystallin and its variants to predict not only the structure of the aggregation-prone intermediate
but also, for the first time, an atomistic model of the aggregated state. Experimentally, we recently discovered a
novel oxidoreductase activity in human γD crystallin and demonstrated that native-state disulfides in WT can be
transferred to generate the non-native, aggregation-promoting disulfide in W42Q. We found an even more
surprising WT/mutant interaction – domain interface stealing – that allows WT to catalyze mutants’ aggregation
even in the presence of an abundant external disulfide source. We will now (1) investigate the physical principles,
kinetics, and evolutionary and disease implications of the novel interface stealing interaction by a combined
computational, biochemical, and proteolysis/mass spectrometry approach we are now developing; and (2)
distinguish among atomistic models for the aggregation precursor and the aggregated state and (3) apply these
newly refined atomistic models to rationally design structure-based peptide inhibitors of the aggregation process.
Although our studies have focused on the W42Q/R variants, other cataract-associated variants (V75D, L5S)
appear to behave quite similarly. Moreover, both the native and the non-native disulfide we identified as culprits
in aggregation processes have been entirely supported by tissue proteomics of aged and cataractous human
lenses in the absence of any genetic mutation. We will therefore test the hypothesis that many mutations or post-
translational modifications converge on few conformational intermediates that determine aggregation. We will
generalize the detailed mechanistic and structural picture of aggregation to other γ-crystallins and other cataract-
associated variants testing whether human γC and γS crystallins are also redox-active and capable of interface
stealing. A more general understanding of the synergy between structural destabilization and redox chemistry in
cataract will improve design of aggregation inhibitors testable on existing genetic mouse models of cataract."

A highly effective malaria vaccine is likely required to eradicate the disease. Transmission blocking vaccines
(TBVs) induce antibodies that block parasite reproduction and development in the mosquito midgut and are
part of the World Health Organization Malaria Vaccine Technology roadmap. This R01 response to program
announcement PA-19-077: Accelerating Malaria Vaccine Discovery, which specifically encourages studies that
will lead to discovery of new vaccine candidates that interrupt malaria transmission. Pfs48/45 is a TBV
candidate antigen, and is the target of one of the most potent transmission-blocking monoclonal antibodies
(85RF45.1). Pfs48/45 has not yet been tested in humans, in part due to difficulties in producing the antigen.
We will follow-up on our recent advances in producing first-in-class, well-defined, fusion-free Pfs48/45.
Serendipitously, glycosylation at a non-essential epitope of the protein led to drastically enhanced protein yield,
enabling us to solve its three-dimensional structure, also revealing the target epitope of 85RF45.1. This new-
found structural information will be used to guide advanced antigen design, including stabilizing mutations and
antigen design that is immunofocused to the potent neutralizing epitope. Rationally-optimized Pfs48/45 will be
optimized in the context of a next-generation vaccine adjuvant. This adjuvant enables combining (via simple
mixing) well-characterized antigens with a liposomal adjuvant to induce spontaneous nanoliposome-antigen
particleization (SNAP). We discovered that liposomes that contain small amounts of cobalt porphyrin-
phospholipid (CoPoP) bind to well-characterized his-tagged antigens with simple mixing via spontaneous
insertion of the his-tag into the bilayer. Unlike other approaches, CoPoP liposomes give rise to rapid antigen
particleization that is stable in biological media. His-tagged Pfs48/45 is simply mixed with CoPoP liposomes
without further purification to convert the soluble antigen into a 100 nm particle with uniform, arrayed antigen
display. In some immunization conditions, SNAP immunization induces orders of magnitude higher functional
IgG responses with TBV antigens compared to other vaccine adjuvants. Antibody durability compares
favorably to current toxin conjugation strategies which have progressed into clinical studies. Using immuno-
focused and stabilized Pfs48/45 constructs, particleization parameters will be assessed and iterative antigen
improvement will be carried out. Another relevant attribute of the SNAP approach that will be investigated is
seamless multiplexing by simple mixing of multiple antigens at the time of immunization (without further
purification), resulting in a balanced and functional IgG response (i.e. to each included antigen). The impact of
multiplexing other TBV antigens (Pfs25 or Pfs230) on the Pfs48/45 response will be assessed, as will whether
additive or synergistic functional activity is induced. Finally, the safety of SNAP immunization with the
optimized Pfs48/45 construct and formulation will be tested."

damage in the central nervous system (CNS), it becomes urgent to understand the role of interplays between
METH and HIV in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). However, studies of
HAND have been hampered by difficulties in collecting live brain cells from autopsy or biopsy of HIV patients.
Recent success in generating microglia and cerebral organoids from human induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs) now offers a great opportunity to investigate the impact of METH and/or HIV on the CNS. The overall
objective of this project is to validate and establish a clinically relevant in vitro brain model for
NeuroAIDS research in the context of drug abuse. The project will be carried out by two P.I.s who have the
complementary expertise and experience in the proposed studies. Dr. Ho has been working on the impact of
abused drugs (METH and opioids) on peripheral/CNS innate immunity and HIV infection of
macrophages/microglia since 1999. Dr. Hu’s research focuses on neurogenesis, iPSC generation,
inflammasomes, CRISPR/Cas HIV eradication and HAND. Their recent collaborative work has successfully
generated and characterized the human iPSC-derived microglia-containing cerebral organoids (MCOs) which
express the major CNS cell types: neural stem/progenitor cells, neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. More
importantly, these MCOs could be infected by HIV. Based on these important findings, we propose three
specific aims: Aim 1. To study dynamic HIV infection of human iPSC-derived MCOs and the impact of METH
on HIV infection of MCOs; Aim 2. To determine HIV-infected cell types and the primary target/reservoir cells of
HIV in MCOs; Aim 3. To study the impact of HIV infection on the development and neuronal circuitry in MCOs.
Successful completion of this project should provide an in vitro brain model to study the roles of HIV infection
and drugs of abuse in the pathogenesis of NeuroAIDS."
10910189,"An estimated 6.2 million Americans aged 65 and older are living with Alzheimer's Disease and its Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) in 2022. Of these, two thirds are women. Blacks and Hispanics have been shown to have a higher risk of AD/ADRD compared with whites. The vast majority of diagnosis of AD/ADRD occurs in non- specialty settings such as primary care. But by 2019, only 16% of seniors were regularly screened for cognitive impairment in the primary care setting. Late diagnosis deprives patients and their families of the opportunity to receive anticipatory guidance, participate in clinical trials, or benefit from any potential disease-modifying therapy. Leveraging data sources such as MRI imaging and electronic health records (EHR) can potentially allow scalable monitoring of cognitive health and early detection of AD/ADRD. However, existing tools are built with mostly white educated populations without significant comorbidities. Patients represented in real-world clinics are more diverse and medically complex. However, working with such data requires solving several core machine learning challenges. Here, we propose a set of novel methods that enable us to use large real-world clinical multi-modal datasets for the purpose of building robust, unbiased, fair and accurate models for early AD/ADRD detection for diverse populations, with an emphasis on under-represented groups. Specifically, we propose to develop novel self-supervised learning techniques that learn robust representations from large unlabeled datasets which can then be used to design algorithmically fair models. Our proposal offers new objective functions to leverage multi-modality (pairing of T1, FLAIR and PET MRI images and EHR data) as an asset to better train models. This work can extend beyond AD/ADRD diagnosis to diseases which have imaging and clinical biomarkers."

 Ischemic cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the USA. Despite
advancement in therapeutics, treating patients with severe conditions are still far from optimal. Recently, cell
therapy emerged as a promising option for those advanced cases for which no interventional or surgical
therapy is able to effectively revascularize the ischemic areas.
 Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), which include human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human
induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), have emerged as a promising candidate for vascular regeneration as
they have strong target cell differentiation capacity as well as paracrine effects. Thus, investigators have
developed various protocols to differentiate hPSCs into endothelial cell (EC)-lineage cells. We have developed
a fully defined, xenogeneic ingredient-free cell culture system that can generate purified functional endothelial
cells (ECs) at high yield. We further demonstrated that these hPSC-derived ECs (hPSC-ECs) have robust and
prolonged vessel-forming activities in vivo. However, one of the caveats of this approach is that their contribution
is mainly restricted to the capillary level without pericytes. For optimal vascularization, more stable and larger
vessels are also necessary. In previous cell therapy studies, this aspect was virtually unaddressed. Therefore,
we recently generated human PSC-derived SMCs (hPSC-SMCs) by using a defined culture system as well
and observed their contribution to vessel formation as vascular pericytes and SMCs.
 Another important barrier for cell therapy is short-term survival of the transplanted cells. To overcome
this problem, we and others have investigated bioengineered cell therapy and demonstrated its effectiveness for
cell survival and function. However, uneven and localized distribution of the injected cells emerged as another
problem. Recently, we have developed a novel biodegradable hybrid copolymer consisting of gelatin and poly
glycerol sebacate (PGS), which was further made into a microbead form with alginate. We refer to this co-
polymer as AlGPM. This hybrid polymer is biodegradable and elicits minimal inflammatory responses. Moreover,
its microbead form promotes wide and homogeneous distribution of encapsulated cells in vivo.
 Accordingly, in this study, we will address two unmet needs of the current cell therapy for ischemic
vascular disease. First, we will use both hPSC-ECs and hPSC-SMCs to induce formation of not only bare
capillaries but also pericyte-covered capillaries and SMC-covered arterioles. Second, we will develop a new
biomaterial that can enhance cell survival and distribution in vivo to maximize stable vessel formation and
therapeutic effects. Specifically, we will investigate whether a combination of these two cell types with
AlGPM hydrogel microbeads is able to exert the optimal effects on vascular regeneration. The long-term
goal of this study is to develop clinically applicable regenerative therapy using hPSC-derived vascular cells
combined with bioengineering technologies."
10840259,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Many common oncogenes and tumor suppressors directly regulate metabolic pathways that support cancer
cell survival, growth and proliferation. Metabolites also contribute to the regulation of the chromatin landscape:
multiple cellular metabolites serve as critical co-substrates of enzymes that deposit or remove chemical
modifications on histones and DNA. Oncogenic mutations in several metabolic enzymes result in the
pathological accumulation of metabolites that interfere with normal maintenance of histone and DNA
modifications. However, absent these specific metabolic mutations, whether the more general cancer-
associated metabolic alterations driven by common oncogenes and tumor suppressors likewise affect the
regulation of the chromatin landscape remains poorly understood. Using mouse models of pancreatic cancer
harboring reversible expression of the tumor suppressor p53, we discovered that p53 controls levels of
intracellular alpha-ketoglutarate (αKG), an obligate co-substrate of a family of αKG-dependent dioxygenases
that includes the ten-eleven (TET) family of DNA methylcytosine oxidases. Restoring p53 function in malignant
pancreatic cancer cells triggered intracellular αKG accumulation, which was both necessary and sufficient to
increase markers of TET activity, induce tumor cell differentiation and blunt tumor progression.
Our findings raise the possibility that p53-mediated accumulation of αKG and concomitant changes in the
chromatin landscape and gene expression profiles contribute to the tumor suppressive function of wild-type
p53. The goal of this work is to determine how wild-type p53 functions to regulate cellular αKG levels in
response to oncogenic stress and how αKG contributes to p53-mediated tumor suppression. We hypothesize
that regulation of metabolic pathways by p53 promotes accumulation of αKG, thereby activating gene
expression programs that safeguard against malignant progression. To address this hypothesis, we will
determine the mechanisms by which p53 regulates αKG (Aim 1); elucidate the pathways through which αKG
induces tumor differentiation (Aim 2), and test whether αKG is a barrier to malignant progression (Aim 3). The
proposed experiments will reveal how metabolic alterations that commonly occur in human tumors contribute
to the maintenance of the malignant state and identify pathways that can be targeted to enforce tumor
suppressive outputs even in malignant cells."

provide interactive postdoctoral research training to produce well-rounded laboratory and clinical scientists who
are better able to address the knowledge gaps needed to end the global AIDS epidemic. To foster
multidisciplinary research opportunities for ADEAR trainees, the program has engaged experienced and
productive HIV/AIDS investigators as mentors for trainees. The areas of mentored training available to
trainees include antiretroviral discovery through basic and translational science, clinical evaluation of
antiretrovirals, and application of antiretrovirals in clinical and community settings. The proposed program
includes the following innovative features:
  Thomas Campbell, M.D., an experienced clinical investigator and mentor, and Mamuka Kvaratskhelia,
 Ph.D., an experienced basic scientist and mentor will serve as Co-Program Directors.
  Integrated HIV Clinical Investigator and HIV Basic/Translational Scientist pathways within the program
 to better meet the training needs of trainees with diverse research backgrounds and career paths.
  A robust plan to facilitate recruitment of trainees both from within the affiliated institutions and from
 other institutions outside of Colorado.
  A formal plan to improve the mentoring skills of program faculty.
  Measures to facilitate trainee careers as NIH funded independent investigators including a required
 individual Career Development Plan; clearly defined career development “deliverables” including
 research publications and requirement of submission of a K award application; and provision of up to 3
 years of support to trainees to ensure sufficient time to develop a K application.
  Robust methods for internal and external review of program progress and procedures for adjusting the
 training curriculum, if necessary, to better meet the needs of trainees.
The proposed postdoctoral training program will be well equipped to train basic and clinical scientists from
diverse disciplines, prepare them for collaborative research careers, and thereby produce investigators with the
skills needed to fill knowledge gaps in the use of antiretrovirals as tools to end HIV/AIDS."
10840369,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most prevalent diseases affecting human joints, characterized by decreased
proteoglycan content and disruption of the collagen fiber network in the cartilage extracellular matrix. Magnetic
resonance (MR) imaging has been used to quantify cartilage composition and microstructure changes due to
degeneration in OA. Among all MR techniques, MR relaxometry is the most popular and can provide non-invasive,
high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging biomarkers, which would be highly valuable in quantifying human
tissues. Cartilage spin-spin (T2) relaxation time has been found to be sensitive to the changes of collagen
ultrastructure associated with early cartilage degeneration. Cartilage spin-lattice relaxation in the rotating frame
(T1ρ) is sensitive to the concentration changes of macromolecules and is correlated with proteoglycan loss in
OA. The role of spin-lattice relaxation (T1) time has also been reported to correlate with the mechanical property
changes of cartilage and is sensitive to progressive damage of the tissue. While each relaxation parameter
provides limited and complementary information of cartilage, the capability of imaging T1, T2 and T1ρ together
would provide a set of comprehensive imaging biomarkers for synergistically accessing the macromolecular
content and their ultrastructure of cartilage. However, due to long scan time, poor image acquisition efficiency,
and complex image reconstruction and tissue modeling, simultaneous multi-relaxation mapping is very
challenging thus remains underdeveloped in OA research studies. This proposal will provide rapid three-
dimensional simultaneous multi-relaxation imaging for mapping T1, T2, and T1ρ of the knee through developing
a novel imaging sequence and reconstruction method (Aim 1). This new technique will leverage efficient three-
dimensional golden-angle image acquisition and will be accelerated through a novel deep learning method that
leverages self-supervised learning and MR physics-informed tissue modeling. The derived MR imaging
biomarkers will be correlated with cartilage histological, biochemical, and mechanical properties, which will
create a basis for interpretation of the clinical study results (Aim 2). A pilot clinical study using the optimized and
accelerated imaging technique will be performed on patients with varying degrees of knee OA, establishing the
clinical evidence of the utility, efficiency, and overall clinical value of multi-relaxation mapping on detecting and
staging OA (Aim 3). Our proposed new methods will root from developing novel rapid image acquisition,
combined with advanced deep learning reconstruction and automatic processing, all of which are pioneered by
our team. Successful completion of the proposal will offer a new rapid imaging technique to non-invasively
monitor disease-related and treatment-related changes in tissue composition and ultra-structure through multi-
relaxation assessment. It will have broad clinical applications for OA and other diseases."

The Steelworkers Charitable and Educational Organization (SCEO), the non-profit (501c3) arm of the United
Steelworkers (USW), is applying for HWWTP and HDPTP funds to support a vibrant training partnership
linking two of the largest U.S.-based industrial unions with rapidly expanding immigrant worker centers and
Tribal communities. The SCEO’s training entity, the Tony Mazzocchi Center (TMC), brings together the
USW, the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the Labor Institute (LI), the National Day Labor
Organizing Network (NDLON), Make the Road New York (MRNY) and the Umatilla, Cayuse, Walla Walla,
Yakama, and Nez Perce Tribes.
Through the HWWTP five-year program, we will conduct 2,265 courses to reach 50,075 workers,
managers, community residents and Tribal members with 545,200 hours of training to help
prevent toxic releases, fires, explosions, injuries, sickness and death. A primary focus is on training and
mentoring union, immigrant and Tribal H&S advocates to promote concrete and lasting prevention at their
worksites and on their Tribal lands.
Target Populations: The TMC has access to over 6,000 workplaces and worker centers including the USW
(600,000 members), the CWA (600,000 members), NDLON (55 worker centers) and MRNY (23,000
members at 5 centers). TMC Tribal partners include Umatilla, Cayuse, and Walla Walla (3,000 members); the
Yakama (31,000); and the Nez Perce (18,800). Our training populations are employed in metal mining,
refining, milling and manufacturing; telecommunications; transportation; oil refining, pulp and paper mills

 Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a progressive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane
conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Premature stop codon mutations including W1282X are among the most
severe and there are no curative treatments for patients. Genome editing agents could offer promising
therapeutics applicable to all CF patients. Engineered nucleases including CRISPR/Cas9 systems that can
catalyze correction of disease-causing mutation(s) have shown promise and entered clinical trials. To mitigate
aberrant nuclease activity and reduce off-target effects, prime editing technology combines a catalytically
impaired Cas9 endonuclease fused with an engineered reverse transcriptase programmed with a prime editing
guide RNA (pegRNA) that also encodes the desired edit. As an alternative technology, triplex-forming peptide
nucleic acids (PNAs) have no intrinsic nuclease activity and stimulate endogenous DNA repair with low off-target
effects when bound adjacent to the target site and co-delivered with donor DNA oligonucleotides. Despite
advances in gene editing technology, in vivo delivery remains a primary barrier to clinical translation. The goal
of the proposed research is to develop a genome editing-based therapeutic strategy for treating the
W1282X nonsense CF mutation as well as high-throughput technologies for identifying effective vehicles
for in vivo therapeutic nucleic acid delivery. In Aim 1, PNA- and CRISPR/Cas9 prime editing-based gene
editing reagents will be designed to correct the W1282X mutation, encapsulated into poly(amine-co-ester)
(PACE) nanoparticles (NPs), and tested in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 2, novel PACE materials will be developed
for in vivo delivery of nucleic acid-based therapeutics to the lungs and assessed using high-throughput in vivo
platforms to determine the structure-function relationships guiding physiological fate. In Aim 3, physiologically
relevant 3D culture models will be developed as high-throughput screening tools to assess delivery and efficacy
of CF therapies. Overall, the proposed interdisciplinary research is highly clinically relevant, furthering the
translation of promising gene editing/nucleic acid therapeutics for CF and other genetic diseases.
 Dr. Piotrowski-Daspit received her Ph.D. in Chemical and Biological Engineering and is currently a
postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Yale University. Thus far, she has been
developing polymeric NPs for nucleic acid delivery and high-throughput in vivo tools. The career development
plan outlines a comprehensive strategy for acquiring the technical, conceptual, and professional skills required
to complete the proposed studies and launch an independent research career. The proposed training would
enable her to gain significant experience in therapeutic development for CF and integrate her into the CF
research community. The training plan, together with her background in biomedical engineering, biomaterials
and drug delivery, will place her among a select group of scientists with the skills and breadth of knowledge
necessary to effectively pursue interdisciplinary work on nucleic acid delivery and editing of genetic disorders."
10835885,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Knowing how environmentally-induced epigenetic alterations are established in the mammalian germline,
transgenerationally inherited, and contribute to disease in the adult, can lead to a more complete understanding
of pathophysiology as well as novel preventive care opportunities. However, the mechanisms underlying the
transgenerational inheritance of epiphenotypes remain perplexing due to the extensive epigenetic remodeling
that happens in the germline during germ cell development and after fertilization. Work from the Corces lab
suggests that aberrant transcription factor (TFs) occupancy due to environmental perturbations during primordial
germ cell (PGC) development shields regions from DNA-methylation remodeling and results in lasting changes
in chromatin accessibility. Understanding the protein makeup, genomic distribution, and fate of environmentally
induced TF binding sites from the gametes to the post-implantation embryo is essential to understand how
germline epimutations can withstand epigenetic remodeling, and how these alterations can influence the health
of later generations. To address these issues, we propose to examine the transgenerational effects of
polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs). Rural populations in Michigan were highly exposed to PBBs in contaminated
livestock in the 1970s, resulting in numerous adverse health outcomes in individuals exposed in utero, including
earlier puberty and other reproductive alterations by mechanisms that remain unknown. Whether this mass
exposure could have transgenerational effects is also unknown. My preliminary mouse studies show that PBB
exposure during PGC development leads to differentially accessible sites in sperm chromatin containing binding
sites for the androgen receptor (Ar) that persist transgenerationally. This mouse exposure results in similar
maternal adipose PBB levels as directly exposed Michigan residents, and leads to early puberty in female F1
mouse offspring, as observed in daughters of directly exposed mothers from the Michigan PBB registry.
Importantly, early puberty is also observed in the unexposed F3 generation in mice. The goal of the proposed
project is to use this mouse model reflecting the Michigan PBB exposure to increase our basic understanding of
the transmission of epimutations with direct relevance to the exposed Michigan population. Aim 1 will test the
hypothesis that transgenerationally persistent Ar footprints in sperm chromatin are hypomethylated, bound by
Ar, and are flanked by nucleosomes possessing histone variants and modifications indicative of enhancers.
Further, this aim will test the hypothesis that ancestral PBB exposure also results in differential Ar footprints in
oocytes that overlap with those observed in sperm. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that TF sites induced by PBB
exposure are transmitted from the gametes to the embryo after fertilization. These experiments will generate
highly significant results that will fill a critical gap in our understanding of the mechanisms governing
transgenerational phenomena in mammals that will be directly applicable to the understanding of the health
problems affecting thousands of exposed Michigan residents and their descendants."
10835886,"Variation in epidermal pigmentation is one of the most striking features of human populations and is critical for
protection against the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation. Many genes that control pigmentation have been
identified in animal models, but little is known about the genetic basis of normal human skin pigment variation.
Filling this knowledge gap will likely reveal novel molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying melanocyte
biology, melanoma risk and rare genetic diseases. Because of their high genetic diversity and wide spectrum
of skin tone, African populations are particularly informative for discovering genes that regulate pigmentation.
Accordingly, our team recently used a genome wide association study and scans of natural selection in a
unique dataset from 1600 ethnically diverse Africans to identify genetic variants that affect skin tone in
Africans. These included genes with previously unknown functions in pigmentation such as MFSD12, encoding
a predicted transmembrane transporter that localizes to lysosomes but not to melanosomes and thus regulates
pigmentation by a novel mechanism. Preliminary analyses also identified additional candidate transporters and
regulators of receptor-mediated signaling that were not known to function in pigmentation and that may
regulate melanogenesis in novel ways. Here, employing a multi-PI team headed by experts in human genetics,
membrane trafficking/ organelle biology, and membrane signaling/ ion transport in collaboration with three
additional experts, we propose to identify (i) new pigmentation genes in a larger set of 3,000 Africans for which
we have whole genome sequence data, and (ii) the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which the products
of these genes control human skin pigmentation. We will accomplish our goal by integrating human genomic
and pigmentation data in our unique African cohort, genetic analyses of the impact of non-coding sequence
variants on gene expression, and cell culture studies of melanocyte cell biology and physiology. The three
specific aims will test our hypotheses that variation in pigmentation results from genetic variations in the
regulatory elements of genes encoding proteins that alter either the melanosomal milieu directly or indirectly
via signaling mediated by receptors such as the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R). Specifically, we will employ
the following three specific aims:
 1. Identify novel genetic variants influencing skin pigmentation and test whether the variants influence
 gene expression from nearby genes;
 2. Define novel mechanisms by which transporters in lysosomes or melanosomes influence
 pigmentation by defining how MFSD12 and other newly identified transporters impact melanogenesis;
 3. Determine the function of newly identified receptor-mediated signaling proteins that regulate
 pigmentation resulting from our new analyses and test whether and how they influence MC1R signaling."

Background: Food allergy (FA) is a potentially life-threatening condition that affects an estimated 8% of
children in the United States. Although differences between Black, White, and Latinx children in the
prevalence and severity of other atopic conditions such as asthma and eczema have been well described,
little is known about such differences in FA. Black children may have worse clinical outcomes, including
rates of FA-related fatal anaphylaxis and FA-related emergency department(ED) visits, than their White
peers. Phenotypic and endotypic differences, including rates of sensitization and co-morbidities, between
Black and White children are beginning to be examined. Data on racial differences in FA management
practices are incomplete; preliminary data suggest that Black families spend significantly less on allergen-
free foods and FA medications than do White families. Families caring for children with FA experience
significant impairments in psychosocial outcomes, including FA-related quality of life (FAQoL); however,
these data come primarily from White, privately insured families, and little is known about psychosocial
outcomes in Black families. There is limited data on these outcomes among the Latinx population of children
food allergy. Two recent reviews concluded that existing studies examining racial disparities in FA are far too
methodologically limited to draw definitive conclusions, primarily due to reliance on self-report of FA
diagnosis and cross-sectional designs.
Specific Aims and Methods: Our goal is to prospectively study a cohort of 1,450 Black, White, and Latinx
children with FA in order to:
 1) Determine the clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with differences in the development
 of clinical immune tolerance and the development of new food allergies;
 2) Determine differences in FA management and outcomes during pivotal developmental periods (i.e.
 middle childhood; adolescence) by expanding assessment of patient-reported outcomes to include
 dyadic assessment of the following caregiver-reported and patient self-reported constructs:
 Psychosocial Outcomes and Disease Management (e.g. epinephrine carriage and allergen exposure)
 and Eating behaviors and nutrition environments (e.g. in the home and community).
 3) Identify phenotypic and endotypic differences in FA by applying state-of-the-art precision medicine
 approaches for multidimensional phenotyping and endotyping of FA patients.
Hypotheses and Expected Results: We hypothesize that compared to White children, Black children are
less likely to develop clinical immune tolerance to foods and more likely to develop new-onset food allergy
during the study period. We also hypothesize that concordance between patient- and caregiver-report data
will decrease as children age and eating behaviors and nutrition environment will differ by child race/ethnicity.
Additionally, we hypothesize that White, Black, Mexican-American and Puerto-Rican children have unique FA
phenotypes (e.g., specific allergens, symptoms, reaction severity) as well as unique FA endotypes (e.g.,
hyper-eosinophilic FA)
Significance and Effects on Other Research: Confirming and further characterizing differences
between Black, White, and Latinx children with FA will provide the data required to develop clinical
guidelines,optimize treatment, and build health policies that meet the needs of Black, White, and Latinx
children."
10836348,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The proposed study seeks to examine the role of physiological threat dysregulation (TD) as a contributor to
social impairment and psychotic-like experiences in youth at-risk for psychosis, and further examine the extent
to which faulty cognitive and affective threat responses play a role in partially mediating this relationship.
Although the “diathesis-stress model” is a well-established framework for the onset of psychosis and other
forms of psychopathology, the exact mechanism as it applies to psychosis remains unclear. This is an important
mechanism to examine because TD can generate chronic fear and arousal, states which interfere with social
relationships and healthy development. The proposed study will address this gap in the literature by
comprehensively examining physiological TD, including the function of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal
(HPA) axis and the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS). The current proposal uses multiple methods, including
laboratory assessments, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and ambulatory psychophysiology, to
examine the link between TD and outcomes in the laboratory and in daily life. This proposal will utilize a
longitudinal design to examine how TD is associated with the persistence or worsening of social impairment
and psychotic-like experiences over 1 year. Given that the post-pubertal adolescent developmental stage is a
sensitive period for the development of psychotic disorders, we propose to recruit a post-pubertal (age 14-17)
sample of adolescents at clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR; n = 105) and a group of age- and sex-matched
controls (n = 70). Multi-method assessments will include 3 laboratory visits (Baseline, 6 months, and 1 year
later) with clinical assessments and evaluation of TD before, during, and after a social threat induction task.
Visits will be followed by 2 weeks of at-home EMA to investigate real-time ANS threat response (via cardiac
wearable device), social impairment, stress, and psychotic-like experiences (via smartphone self-report). The
proposed study would be novel in that it will to pair EMA with cutting-edge, ambulatory cardiovascular
psychophysiology assessment. Thus, this proposal would unite established in vitro (laboratory) assessments of
key variables with novel in vivo (EMA) assessments, the latter of which have high ecological and clinical
validity. The aims of the project match well with the strategic goals of the National Institute of Mental Health
(NIMH); in particular, Strategies 2 and 3. The proposed conceptual model is highly relevant to the NIMH
Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains of the sustained and acute threat systems, as well as the “social
processes” domain; thus, this research should have relevance to the study of psychopathology across diagnostic
boundaries. The proposed award should 1) provide precision to investigation of a theoretical model of TD and
its impacts on social impairment and psychotic-like experiences, 2) contribute to the development of an EMA-
based “early warning system” to predict changes in psychosis, and 3) suggest new directions for improved
prevention and intervention strategies for adolescents at-risk for psychosis."

The overarching goal of this five-year grant proposal, submitted on behalf of the Beckman Research Institute of
City of Hope and the University of California, Riverside, in response to RFA-CA-19-035, is to test the efficacy
of an advance-practice nurse (APRN)-driven telehealth Survivor Self-Management (SSM) Intervention in 414
lung and colorectal cancer survivors. This research is critical because lung and colorectal cancer survivors
have high post-treatment needs, are older, and suffers from greater co-morbidities and poor quality of life
(QOL). Lung and colorectal cancer survivors remain underrepresented in research, leading to significant
disparities in post-treatment outcomes. Based on the Chronic Care Self-Management Model (CCM), the SSM
Intervention includes the following components: 1) care coordination and communication between oncology
and primary care on surveillance/follow-up, health promotion, disease prevention, and comorbidity
management; 2) provision of clinician care plan to PCPs; 3) comprehensive patient/geriatric assessment for
survivors of all ages; 4) personalized care plan for survivors; and 5) survivor self-management skills building
for surveillance/follow-up, late and long-term effects of treatments, comorbidities, and healthy living. It is
administered in five telehealth sessions (Zoom videoconferencing) and three subsequent maintenance
telehealth sessions for survivors who are four months post-treatment. We will test the efficacy of the SSM
Intervention using a randomized design of attention control arm versus an intervention arm to pursue the
following specific aims: Specific Aim 1 (Primary): Determine the efficacy of the intervention on care
coordination, communication, and provider knowledge at 4 months post-accrual; Specific Aim 2 (Primary):
Determine the efficacy of the intervention on survivor outcomes at 4 months post-accrual; and Specific Aim 3
(Exploratory): Assess the reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance (RE-AIM) of the
intervention. The RE-AIM Framework informs intervention delivery process, which will set the stage for future
large scale implementation for sustainability in real-world care settings. This proposal is innovative because it
addresses a critical need to improve care delivery and outcomes for high needs, understudied survivorship
populations (lung, colorectal, older survivors), and the telehealth approach promotes scalability. The
interdisciplinary team, which includes expertise in nursing science (Sun, Reb, Ferrell), oncology (Fakih), and
primary care (Kim) is uniquely suited to conduct this research. The proposal is significant, with high scientific
rigor and outcomes that are of critical importance to survivors, clinicians, healthcare systems, the National
Cancer Institute, and the Beau Biden Cancer MoonshotSM. The research will address a critical gap in
knowledge of how self-management interventions improve care delivery and outcomes during post-treatment
transitions to follow-up care."

Vector-borne diseases account for more than 17% of all infectious disease and cause more than 700,000 deaths
annually 1. Mosquitoes alone cause 400,000 malaria deaths and transmit viruses to hundreds of millions 2. The
vectorial capacity of mosquitoes depends on their ability to survive infection. The damaging effects of pathogenic
invasion of the mosquito midgut are well-documented 15-22, but little is known about how mosquitoes tolerate this
stress. Intestinal stem cell (ISC) mediated midgut epithelial repair is essential for Drosophila survival following
oral ingestion of pathogens 33. The mosquito midgut epithelium contains ISC-like cells 27, 34, 37-39, but their functional
significance for infection outcomes and mosquito survival is unknown. We propose to address this knowledge
gap in vector biology by investigating the mosquito gut regenerative response to pathogenic invasion.
 The “black box” regarding the functional significance of ISCs in the mosquito midgut is part of a fundamental
knowledge gap: physiological studies treat the mosquito midgut as a homogeneous whole, rather than a
complex, regionally compartmentalized tissue comprised of multiple cell populations (e.g. enterocytes,
enteroendocrine cells, and ISCs). The specific contributions of these cell types to gut-pathogen interactions have
not been investigated. The proposed work will not only illuminate mosquito epithelial responses to infection at
the cellular level but will lead to the creation of new and innovative tools for the broader vector biology community.
 The first two aims of this project are (A) to characterize gut epithelial cell dynamics in mosquitoes under
conditions of homeostasis and oral infection and (B) to evaluate the role of midgut epithelial repair in
mosquito infection outcomes. Aedes aegypti will be used as a model to determine what stimuli (including
human pathogens) affect gut epithelial turnover rates, whether post-infection repair rebuilds the gut
homeostatically or alters epithelial composition, what genetic pathways control midgut epithelial repair, and what
role epithelial repair plays in vector survival and competence. Our third aim is (C) to determine the specific
contributions of functionally differentiated cell populations to epithelial dynamics and infection
response. We will use single-cell RNAseq/ATACseq to establish how many cell types compose the midgut
epithelium, create new transgenic lines expressing fluorescent markers for important cell types (enteroendocrine
cells and ISCs), and, using these lines, couple fluorescence-activated cell sorting with RNAseq to examine the
transcriptional response of the three major cell types (enterocytes, enteroendocrine cells, and ISCs) to infection.
 Our study will fill a critical gap in our understanding of mosquito midgut regenerative responses to pathogenic
invasion. Our long-term goal is to identify new targets for vector control strategies that disrupt gut regeneration
and reduce survival of infected mosquitoes below the critical incubation threshold required for pathogen
transmission. In addition to laying the groundwork for innovative control targets, we will create tools for the
broader vector biology community, paving the way for novel discoveries in mosquito midgut physiology."

Many epilepsy syndromes associated with severe, early-onset seizures result from de novo variants in genes
involved in early brain development. Recent studies have also identified somatic variants in focal epilepsy
associated with cortical malformations, including hemimegalencephaly and the more common focal cortical
dysplasia (FCD) type 2. These post-zygotically acquired variants arise during neurogenesis and are therefore
present in only a fraction of cells. Expanding on these early discoveries implicating somatic variants in epilepsy,
we recently identified brain-specific somatic mutations in SLC35A2 in individuals with refractory neocortical
epilepsy. Germline variants in SLC35A2 were previously implicated in a rare X-linked developmental and
epileptic encephalopathy. Our data suggest that somatic variants in SLC35A2 may also be responsible for
approximately 17% of intractable non-lesional focal epilepsy cases. The number of cells harboring a pathogenic
SLC35A2 variant allele appears to correlate with disease severity, and several of the cases have FCD type 1a
(FCD1a) pathology. Pathogenic variants in SLC35A2, both somatic and germline, prevent the Golgi-localized
transporter from moving UDP-Galactose (UDP-Gal) into the Golgi apparatus for use in the formation of essential
galactosylated glycans. There is theoretical, experimental, and observational data suggesting that Gal
supplementation may be able to restore glycosylation to the cell to provide therapeutic benefit. In this study, we
will define the functional consequences of SLC35A2 variants in epilepsy. Given that not all cells carry the variant
allele in the individuals with a somatic SLC35A2 variant, in Aim 1 we seek to use resected human brain tissue
specimens to identify the specific cell types in the brain harboring the variant alleles. This will allow us to
determine which cell types contribute to SLC35A2 epilepsy and whether cell-type-specific burden dictates the
pathological observations. In Aim 2 we will evaluate the effects of the variants on cell-type-specific glycosylation
in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neural progenitor cells and mature glutamatergic
neurons, a cell type that we have preliminary data to support involvement in the epileptogenic processes. Since
nearly all patients with an SLC35A2 variant have seizures, and a significant fraction has FCD1a, in Aim 3 we will
also characterize the effects of the variants on individual and neural network activity, neural migration, and
neurodevelopment in both human (e.g., hiPSC-derived neurons, 3-D organoids) and mouse models (e.g., mouse
neural progenitors and in utero electroporation). In Aims 2 and 3, we will assess the effectiveness of Gal to
restore glycosylation and reverse effects on neuronal development or activity. Collectively, these studies will
translate our exciting initial discovery implicating a novel pathway underlying a significant fraction of individuals
suffering from intractable seizures into studies of the role of glycosylation defects underlying localized brain
dysfunction in focal epilepsy. Given that the glycosylation pathway represents a potentially druggable target, this
work may inform precision medicine approaches to the treatment of refractory epilepsy."
10837062,"More than 25% of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) develop epilepsy as co-morbidity. In AD with epilepsy
(ADxEpi), seizures accelerate cognitive decline and further reduce life expectancy compared to AD alone. One
hallmark of both AD and epilepsy is blood-brain barrier dysfunction. We discovered that barrier dysfunction is
more severe in ADxEpi patients compared to seizure-free AD patients. Collectively, our data suggest that a
combination of Ab and seizure-released glutamate (Aβ/Glu) triggers a dual positive feedback loop which exac-
erbates barrier dysfunction, seizures, and cognitive decline in ADxEpi. However, the detailed mechanism(s) that
leads to barrier dysfunction in ADxEpi is/are unknown, and treatment options for ADxEpi patients are limited to
anti-seizure drugs that by themselves accelerate cognitive decline. This knowledge gap represents a critical and
unmet need which will prevent us from achieving therapeutic advances for ADxEpi patients. Our overall objective
in this application is to define the mechanism that underlies barrier dysfunction in ADxEpi and to develop a
therapeutic intervention. Based on preliminary data, the central hypothesis is that blocking Aβ/glutamate signal-
ing repairs barrier dysfunction, reduces seizure burden, and slows cognitive decline in AD with epilepsy. The
rationale for the proposed research is that its completion will provide the basis for a novel therapeutic intervention
to successfully treat ADxEpi patients. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Identify
the mechanism responsible for Aβ/glutamate-mediated barrier dysfunction. 2) Define the relation between barrier
dysfunction, cognition, and seizures in AD patients with epilepsy. 3) Develop a therapeutic intervention that re-
pairs barrier dysfunction in AD with epilepsy. In Aim 1, we will determine signaling steps that lead to Aβ/Glu-
mediated neurovascular inflammation and barrier leakage in isolated mouse brain capillaries and verify these
findings in vivo. In Aim 2, we will determine barrier dysfunction in brain tissue from ADxEpi patients and correlate
the degree of barrier dysfunction with seizure burden and patient cognition scores. In Aim 3, we will develop an
intervention therapy designed to repair barrier dysfunction, and we will evaluate the benefit of this intervention
in two rodent ADxEpi models. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a substantive departure
from the status quo by shifting the focus from traditional anti-seizure drugs to targeting molecular pathways to
repair barrier dysfunction, thereby improving seizure burden, and slowing cognitive decline in ADxEpi. The pro-
posed research is significant because it holds the promise of a new therapeutic approach that has translational
potential for clinical use to advance the treatment of ADxEpi patients."

Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) is a chronic debilitating inflammatory skin disease. Despite its high prevalence and
morbidity, HS is understudied, and there is currently no uniformly effective treatment for this condition. Elucidation of
disease pathogenesis, target identification and evaluation of novel treatments has been limited by the lack of
comprehensive studies examining the immunology of this disease. This is compounded further by the fact that there are
currently no animal models that accurately recapitulate the findings seen in HS skin. We have assembled a multi-
disciplinary team of investigators at UCSF to better understand the immunopathogenesis of HS at both the cellular and
molecular levels. This is centered around the recently established 'UCSF Hidradenitis Suppurativa Center of Excellence'
(HSCE), a clinic dedicated entirely to providing first-rate care for HS patients and performing translational studies in this
disease. With the HSCE, my laboratory has made significant advances in our understanding of the immunology of HS,
including new observations of defects in the regulatory T cell (Treg) compartment. Tregs normally reside around hair
follicles and regulate both neutrophilic inflammation and dermal fibrosis, two pathologic hallmarks of HS skin. Our
preliminary results suggest that Tregs are both quantitatively and qualitatively defective in skin of HS patients. We
hypothesize that dysfunctional Treg-mediated control of Th17 immune responses plays a central role in the
pathogenesis of HS and that correcting this imbalance will effectively ameliorate inflammation and restore tissue
immune homeostasis. Experiments outlined in this proposal will functionally dissect the cellular and molecular
mechanisms controlling the Treg/Th17 balance in HS skin. We have developed an innovative ex vivo immune cell assay
using HS skin. In addition, we have begun to establish a humanized mouse model of HS that recapitulates the
inflammatory infiltrate observed in diseased skin of these patients. In these newly established model systems, we will
utilize a novel molecule that preferentially binds to the high affinity IL-2 receptor to functionally determine if selective
Treg augmentation attenuates inflammation in HS skin. In addition, we have recently discovered two cell surface
receptors preferentially expressed on Tregs in human skin, CD27 and OX40, that play a major role in inhibiting Th17
differentiation in these cells. In separate experiments, we will determine whether inhibiting Th17 differentiation in Tregs
via signaling through CD27 and/or OX40 restores immune balance in HS. The experiments outlined in this proposal
represent a conceptually and technically innovative, comprehensive, and multidisciplinary approach to elucidate how
functional manipulation of the Treg/Th17 differentiation axis influences inflammation in HS skin. The Th17 pathway in
human skin has primarily been studied in psoriasis and several therapeutic approaches developed for psoriasis are now
being considered for HS. Thus, the results of the studies proposed herein are both timely and relevant, in our attempts to
better understand the pathogenesis of HS and determine whether immune pathways targeted in psoriasis may or may not
translate to this disease."
10932993,"The objective of the PHLHousing+ Evaluation is to test whether unconditional, monthly cash payments made
directly to tenants increases housing security and thereby reduces health disparities for low-income renters
who, in the city of Philadelphia, are disproportionately Black. This objective is aligned with the strategic aim of
NINR to understand which pandemic-era housing policies would best be continued to advance health equity.
The PHLHousing+ Evaluation comprises three groups, all of whom earn below 50% area median income and
have at least one child under the age of 16 years living at home: 270 households who receive monthly cash
payments in lieu of a rental voucher (Cash group), 225 households who are eligible for (or currently using) a
rental voucher (Voucher group), and 789 households on the Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA) waitlist who
will not be offered a rental voucher for the foreseeable future because of their randomized position on the
waitlist (Control group). Of the 1,284 households in the study, 82.5% are headed by single women and 82.8%
are Black. There are 2,678 children in the sample, ranging in age from 1 to 19 years (median = 10, IQR = 5-
15). Monthly cash payments range from $89 to $2079, with a median payment of $881; payments vary based
on household income, family size, and fair market rent. Households in the Cash group will receive monthly
payments for 2.5 years. All three groups are surveyed every six months for three years via an online survey;
the first wave of surveys was deployed in August 2022. Existing surveys include measures of self-reported
mental and physical health and hospital utilization for adults and children. We propose to extend these data in
three ways: (1) by extracting electronic health record (EHR) data on emergency department (ED) visits and
hospital admissions linked to our survey respondents; (2) by administering brief, monthly surveys that will
increase participant retention between biannual surveys and will measure mood and health-promoting
behaviors that might be pathways by which PHLHousing+ promotes positive health outcomes; and (3) by
linking household addresses with census-based data on neighborhood opportunity and Philadelphia Police
Department crime data. Aim 1 is to test whether rental assistance (Cash + Voucher vs. Control) or type of
assistance (Cash vs. Voucher) is associated with self-reported mental and physical health and with affective
volatility and health-promoting behaviors. Aim 2 is to test whether the availability or type of rental assistance is
associated with ED use or hospital admissions as recorded in EHR, specifically for problems that are
disproportionately associated with housing insecurity (e.g., mental health problems). Aim 3 is to test whether
availability or type of rental assistance is associated with exposure to housing problems (e.g., pests, mold),
access to neighborhood opportunity, or exposure to crime. Study findings will have immediate implications for
the City of Philadelphia's model for providing housing assistance, will inform efforts to establish similar
programs in other cities, and will inform federal approaches to rental assistance."
10839822,"Project Summary
Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and venous leg ulcers (VLUs) are prevalent chronic wounds with a debilitating impact
on patient quality of life, morbidity, and mortality, imposing a major economic burden to healthcare systems
worldwide. Effective treatments for chronic wounds are scarce. Their efficacy is further limited by the presence
and recurrence of infection. While arising from different etiologies, both DFUs and VLUs share common features
such as a hyperproliferative, non-migratory epidermis, fibrosis, decreased angiogenesis, and a de-regulated
inflammatory response. In addition, a major common characteristic is a shift in the microbiome from benign
commensal bacteria to an abundance of pathogens. Unfortunately, a lack of animal models that closely
recapitulates the human chronic wound condition impedes the understanding of this complex host-microbiome
interaction. Thus, our laboratory focuses on the analyses of human tissue samples to decipher core molecular
pathways that contribute to the non-healing phenotype of DFUs and VLUs. We used tissue samples from DFUs
and VLUs (n=19), RNAseq and bioinformatic analysis to determine a core chronic wound transcriptome common
for both types of chronic wounds. Analyses of this novel and unique core chronic wound gene signature indicates
suppression of two host response pathways that may be modulated by the microbiome: the aryl hydrocarbon
receptor (AHR) signaling pathway and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway.
As these pathways have been implicated in host antimicrobial response, as well as cell migration, and
proliferation, we postulate that suppression of the AHR and STAT3 signaling pathways is mediated by a
dysregulated microbiome and impairs chronic wound healing. Thus, the goal of this proposal is to understand
the mechanisms by which the wound microbiome modulates the AHR (Aim 1) and STAT3 (Aim 2) pathways in
DFUs and VLUs. We will use an integrative approach that includes patients’ wound samples, primary human
cells and human skin ex vivo wound infection models. By using patient-relevant wound models, we will greatly
advance understanding of the mechanisms by which the wound microbiome modulates the host response in
chronic wounds and contribute to the inhibition of healing. In turn, understanding the interaction of the
microbiome with the AHR and STAT3 pathways will further identify novel therapeutic targets for wound infections.
Prevention and treatment of wound infections will have a major impact on healing outcomes of both DFUs and
VLUs, decreasing lower leg amputations, morbidity and mortality."
10839823,"Despite great advances in AIDS diagnosis and treatment, the continuing AIDS epidemic demands
continuing efforts to understand all aspects of HIV replication and to develop new methods for its inhibition.
In pursuit of these goals, we have sought to define the activities and interactions of the HIV-1 structural
(Gag) proteins, with a specific focus on the N-terminal matrix (MA) domain. The Gag proteins initially are
synthesized as precursor Gag (PrGag) proteins that are myristoylated at the N-terminus of MA, and MA
domains target PrGag delivery to plasma membrane (PM) virus assembly sites virtue of preferential binding
to the signaling phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI[4,5]P2). Evidence also indicates that
MA-RNA binding helps chaperone PrGag proteins to assembly sites, and that virus membranes are
enriched for lipid raft constituents such as cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and ceramide. In addition to its
trafficking role, MA has been shown to influence the incorporation of wild type (WT) HIV-1 envelope (Env)
glycoprotein trimers into virus particles. Previous investigations have shown that HIV-1 Env proteins that
carry cytoplasmic tail deletions (CT) in their transmembrane (TM; gp41) domains can be incorporated into
virions in a fashion that is cell type-dependent, but MA-independent. In contrast, MA mutations that impair
WT Env incorporation into virions have been identified. Moreover, other MA mutations have been shown to
suppress Env incorporation defects imposed either by MA mutations, or Env CT mutations. Such
observations imply that there could be direct MA-CT interactions, but proof has been lacking. During the
past funding period, we have made significant progress in understanding how MA and Env proteins interact.
We have shown that MA directly binds to Env CTs, and that binding depends on MA trimerization. We have
demonstrated that C-terminal amphipathic helices of HIV-1 Env CTs are involved in MA binding, and that
MA-CT binding is blocked by MA-RNA binding. We have discovered lipid composition changes that perturb
WT Env activity, and have obtained novel evidence of CT processing. Using this as a foundation, we
propose the characterization of MA-CT interactions and the roles of these interactions in HIV-1 replication.
In particular, we will define how Env proteins associate with MA trimers and lattices so as to determine how
WT Env proteins become incorporated into virus particles; and we will examine how Gag and Env proteins
collaborate in virus particles to perform their functions. Our results will help clarify how HIV Gag and Env
proteins cooperate, and will foster the development of novel approaches to interfere with HIV-1 replication."
10931675,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Irritable bowel syndrome is a globally prevalent disorder (~11%) characterized by an alteration in stool
form/frequency and abdominal pain one or more days per week. Abdominal pain in IBS, like other forms of
visceral pain, is often diffuse and poorly localized, making it difficult to delineate the site of pathology, and as a
result there are few therapeutic options. Gut microbial products have been shown to be important luminal signals
for abdominal pain, but these studies have largely focused on the colon. We recently found that small intestinal
microbial composition is associated with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms like abdominal pain, but the mechanisms
underlying the role of small intestinal microbiota/microbial products in the pathophysiology of abdominal pain
remains a critical knowledge gap. To address this gap, we will elucidate the sensory innervation of the proximal
small intestine and identify the cellular and molecular pathways by which the small intestine detects and
transduces luminal microbial signals that contribute to visceral hypersensitivity. In our extensive preliminary
studies, we established a dedicated model to study the physiologic effects of human small intestinal microbiome
in germ free (GF) mice, metabolite effects on isolated DRGs and epithelial cells, and a novel ex vivo spinal cord-
small intestine preparation to study the transmission of luminal signals to the spinal cord via luminal metabolite
signaling through (1) EC cells, that are epithelial cells which signal to neurons via serotonin, a neurotransmitter
in the gut that modulates visceral pain, and (2) sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG), the first-order
afferent neurons of pain pathways. Using these models, we identified distinct bacteria and bacterial metabolites
that activate EC cells and thoracic DRG neurons. Based on our preliminary findings, we hypothesize that small
intestinal bacterial products contribute to visceral hypersensitivity by activating small intestine sensory afferents
directly and through neuro-epithelial connections by activating EC cells. We will address the hypothesis in two
Specific Aims using cutting-edge stimulation/acquisition approaches, including combination of Ca2+ imaging in
organoids, electrophysiology of EC cells and DRG neurons, ex vivo preparations from novel transgenic mice,
and adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) characterizing the sensory input from the small intestine, and optogenetics
to study neuro-epithelial signaling. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine mechanisms underlying activation of EC
cells and DRG neurons, and in Specific Aim 2, we will determine the sensory transduction pathways involved
in responding to distinct microbial products. These studies will be the first to provide a functional and molecular
characterization of sensory neurons in the DRG that innervate the small intestine, determine which
subpopulations are activated and/or sensitized by microbial products in the lumen, and test whether EC cells are
involved in the sensory transduction pathway. Our findings will allow the development of novel microbial
therapies for abdominal pain that target distinct microbial pathways in the small intestine."
10827592,"Project Summary
The development of the human brain is a highly coordinated process involving the controlled
expression of thousands of genes, where deviations from this genetic code can result in neurological
conditions or deficits in cognition and behavior. Thus, it is crucial to understand the complexities of gene
expression variation of the cortical transcriptome in the human brain across all life-stages. Recently, with
advancements in sequencing technology, researchers can now examine the transcriptomic heterogeneity in
humans and correlate these variations to neuroanatomical and functional properties of the brain. Prior research
in adults has shown that a small subset of genes is indeed related to regional variability in function and
neuroanatomy, but it is still presently unknown how this translates across development. Thus, this project aims
to identify which genes are highly variable across all developmental stages, what neuroanatomical properties
these genes are associated with, their localized and cell type expression, and which are specific to human
development. Findings from this project will complement those from early prenatal stages, which has been
heavily researched, and will provide novel insights for later stages of development, primarily across childhood
and adolescence. To carry out the proposed research, the applicant will implement a novel pipeline established
in the lab that identifies genes most differentially expressed across development in both humans and
macaques, carry out gene enrichment and network analyses, spatially localize identified gene expression
patterns, and determine related neuroanatomical properties through cross-modal neuroimaging analyses. Both
aims will take advantage of publicly available transcriptomic atlases. Aim 1 will examine the transcriptomic
variability across human development using bulk RNA sequencing analyses and in situ hybridization. Aim 2 will
then apply the same methods from Aim 1 on transcriptomic data from macaques in order to make cross-
species comparisons and to identify which genes from Aim 1 are human-specific. Findings from these
approaches will identify novel sets of human-related genes that are crucial to various stages of development
and ultimately, will be beneficial to applications in mental health. The two sponsors of this project, Profs. Kevin
Weiner and Silvia Bunge, along with thesis committee member Dr. Mercedes Paredes, will provide relevant
expertise and guidance in the field of neuroanatomy, development, and transcriptomics. Additionally, support
from consultants and resources from UC Berkeley and the Helen Wills Neuroscience institute will ensure that
the applicant successfully completes the dissertation and is prepared for a competitive post-doctoral fellowship
and research career investigating the transcriptomic basis of human brain development."

Symposium
The C. elegans Metabolism, Aging, Pathogenesis, Stress and Small RNAs symposium (MAPS) is a biennial
international gathering that brings together researchers using C. elegans to study aging and the related
disciplines of stress, metabolism, pathogenesis and small RNAs. With the advent of the 8 hallmarks of aging, it
has become clear that aging is a multifaceted process that will require interdisciplinary approaches to fully
understand. Since each of the areas of focus of MAPS 2024 have been shown to have important roles in the
aging process, the meeting provides a unique opportunity for aging researchers to learn about new discoveries
in the aging field, to obtain innovative perspectives and to initiate interdisciplinary collaborations. This is the
only conference focused on a single model organism used for aging studies. C. elegans is a major platform for
aging research and many foundational discoveries and mechanistic insights have originated through worm
studies. Indeed, this meeting is a prominent convention for the wider aging community and attracts world
leaders in the field. Major goals of the 2024 MAPS meeting are (i) to provide a platform for presentation of
predominantly unpublished, cutting-edge discoveries in worm aging from both established and new
investigators, (ii) to provide opportunities for postdoc and graduate-student trainees, especially women and
under-represented minorities (URMs) to present their research in oral talks and posters, (iii) facilitate mentoring
and networking platforms for new faculty and trainees, particularly women and URMs.
The 2024 meeting roster so far includes confirmed invited speaker presentations from 41 renowned scientists
(17 women (41%), 3 international). Four of the six session chairs are rising-star women in aging research
(66.7%). The program contains 6 innovative, interdisciplinary session of talks and features intended to
increased participation and visibility of new faculty, post-doctoral trainees and graduate-students: 1) slots for
17 short presentations by speakers selected from submitted abstracts, 2) 40 lightning-round oral presentations
by junior trainee poster-presenters aimed at attracting more interest in poster presentations and improving
junior participant visibility, and 3) two poster sessions. Based upon feedback from prior meetings, the 2024
meeting also includes two novel workshop initiatives: a strategic ‘Paired-Mentoring’ of young faculty with senior
scientists, and ‘Concepts in Geroscience’ initiative to bring new and out-of-the-box thinking to aging research.
Through this application, we are requesting funds to support the attendance of the invited speakers as well as
the investigators at various career stages, from graduate students and post-docs to newly-independent faculty,
who will be participating in the meeting. We will allocate 55% of the funds from this grant to support attendance
of female scientists and members of ethnicities under-represented in science. We will offer on-site child-care
services to attendees to facilitate participation of young scientists, especially women, with family
responsibilities, and to make the meeting fully accessible to individuals with disabilities."

This application, “Postdoctoral Research in Neurodevelopmental Disorders,” is a request for five years of
funding to continue a National Research Service Award (NRSA) Institutional Training Grant (T32). Advances in
behavioral science, neuroscience, and molecular genetics have led to dramatic gains in our understanding of
the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders. The proposed training program will develop researchers
with dual expertise in the biological basis and clinical manifestations of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs).
This broad-based, integrated perspective will enable trainees to develop cross-disciplinary research
perspectives that will maximize their ability to make transformative advances in understanding the
pathogenesis of NDDs and developing effective treatments. Ultimately, this training will prepare researchers to
span disciplines and to use their broad perspective to address the health-related research needs of the nation
– the primary objective of the T32 program.
The proposed training plan provides a variety of opportunities including: (1) mentored research training in
specific methods, disorders, and underlying pathogenetic mechanisms; (2) a range of didactic experiences
(including courses, seminars, and lectures) that integrate the study of clinical disorders, normal developmental
processes, mechanisms of disease, and research methods; (3) clinical exposures to complement previous
basic science knowledge, and basic science exposure to complement clinical experiences; and (4)
appreciation and contribution to improving equity and inclusion in neurodevelopmental disorders research, with
the further goal of instilling diversity outreach as a career value. Fifteen Ph.D. or M.D. level trainees (three new
trainees per year) will participate in this two-year training program, over the five-year period of this proposal.
This proposal addresses the critical need for focused training opportunities beyond formal graduate programs
by using the existing interdisciplinary research and administrative structure of the Carolina Institute for
Developmental Disabilities (CIDD). All faculty mentors are members of the CIDD NICHD-funded Intellectual
and Developmental Disabilities Research Center (IDDRC). The CIDD is a comprehensive program for
services, education, and research in developmental disabilities. Together with the excellent clinical and basic
science resources of the University of North Carolina (UNC), the CIDD provides an ideal environment for
integrating training in biological and behavioral research in NDDs."
10829263,"ABSTRACT
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most common causes to pediatric death globally. Rapid RSV
diagnostics is important for judicial use of antibiotics, to reduce disease spread in healthcare facilities, and to
enable prompt treatment since several RSV antiviral therapies are on the horizon. Current diagnostic methods
rely on time-consuming laboratory-based tests including virus culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and
rapid diagnostic tests (e.g., lateral flow immunoassay, LFA) are not sufficiently sensitive as standalone diagnosis.
Therefore, there is an unmet need for rapid and ultrasensitive diagnostic tests for RSV. The plasmonic coupling
assay is a rapid colorimetric diagnostic test that makes use of the optical response of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)
during the process of target recognition to analyze its concentration. Despite its easy operation, the sensitivity of
the plasmonic coupling assay is limited. In this proposed work, we aim to substantially improve the limit of
detection (LOD) of the plasmonic coupling assay by innovative digital nanobubble detection. Specifically, we
propose to directly detect intact RSV particles with antibody-conjugated AuNPs that recognize the RSV surface
fusion (F) protein. AuNPs bind to multiple RSV F proteins and lead to plasmonic coupling. Ultrashort laser pulse
selectively activates coupled AuNPs due to their enhanced absorption compared with a single AuNP. This
greater optical absorption leads to nanoscale cavitation bubbles, i.e. nanobubbles, which can be measured easily
from the bubble-induced and transient scattering. Single nanobubble generation leads to a sensitive digital
detection with “on” and “off” signals. Our preliminary results suggest ~3 orders of magnitude improvement of
LOD in detecting RSV. In this proposed work, we will firstly innovate the AuNP probe by optimizing the AuNP
formulation (size, concentration and conjugation), investigating the non-spherical nanoparticle for more efficient
virus binding, and exploring the asymmetric antibody-coated Janus nanoparticles for controlled binding. Next,
we will design and build a prototype device for automated sample loading, reading, and data processing for the
digital nanobubble assay. Lastly, we will test this assay with clinical RSV isolates (from diverse genetic strains)
and clinical specimens. By comparing with current PCR and rapid diagnostic tests, we will establish the clinical
sensitivity and specificity for the digital nanobubble test. This test is fast (< 30 minutes), low-cost (AuNP reagent
cost is similar to lateral flow immunoassay), and highly sensitive and specific for RSV. Furthermore, the direct
detection of virus particles eliminates the need of extensive sample preparation such as nucleic acid extraction.
Success of our project will meet urgent demands of rapid and sensitive RSV diagnostics and address a major
healthcare need for pediatric patients that are affected by RSV."

Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) is an important human fungal pathogen which is responsible for 
significant morbidity and mortality, particularly among immunocompromised patients. In recent years, we 
have made important progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate sensing of 
pathogens such as A. fumigatus by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), 
NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and AIM2-like receptors (ALRs). Certain members of the NLR and ALR family 
assemble a cytoplasmic multi-protein complex termed the ‘inflammasome’, which activates caspase-1 and 
induces maturation and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 and drives pyroptotic cell 
death. The inflammasome plays critical roles in clearing fungal infections.
My laboratory is a founding member of the inflammasome field and continues to radically advance this 
research area with our pivotal studies, elucidating the mechanisms driving inflammasome activation and 
identifying the importance of these pathways in immune responses. Our strong track record of studies focused 
on inflammasomes and pyroptosis has also allowed us to also make important discoveries about programmed 
cell death pathways. We fundamentally advanced the field of cell death by identifying extensive molecular 
crosstalk among seemingly distinct pathways. For example, we characterized Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1) 
as an innate sensor of influenza A virus that triggers the NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptosis as well as 
apoptosis and necroptosis (PANoptosis). We also identified that PANoptosis is mediated by a complex called 
the PANoptosome, which provides a molecular scaffold that allows interactions and activation of the machinery 
required for the inflammasome/pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis.
As a result of the significant progress made during the last funding period (which resulted in 129
peer-reviewed papers since the submission of this R37 5 years ago, including publications in Cell, 
Nature, Nature Microbiology, Nature Immunology, and Immunity), we are now in an excellent position
to pursue new directions that will investigate the molecular, biochemical, and cellular mechanism of
inflammasome activation and PANoptosis in response to the global pathogen A. fumigatus. Our 
recent studies demonstrated that the novel A. fumigatus PAMP galactosaminogalactan (GAG) activates the 
NLRP3 inflammasome to drive cell death and in vivo protection against fungal-induced mortality. In addition 
to inflammasome activation, we also recently discovered that A. fumigatus induces PANoptosis and that the 
innate immune sensor ZBP1 is critical for driving inflammatory cell death. However, the molecular 
mechanisms and signaling cascades that regulate and control these pathways, along with the implications of 
PANoptosis in vivo, remain unknown.
In this grant application for extension of our R37, we propose to investigate the signaling pathways regulating
formation and activation of PANoptosomes driven by A. fumigatus infection. We will use a multifaceted 
approach, employing cellular, biochemical, genetic, and unbiased large-scale screening experiments, to 
identify key regulators and components of the PANoptosome and elucidate the fundamental molecular 
mechanisms of PANoptosis. We will employ a CRISPR-based whole-genome functional screening approach to 
determine which genes are essential for PANoptosis and to characterize their functions. We will treat a pool of 
cells in which each non-essential gene in the genome is deleted in individual cells with A. fumigatus-derived 
PANoptosis triggers and positive select for cells that are deficient in key PANoptotic components. We will then 
perform next-generation sequencing to identify the disrupted genes. The power of this system presents a 
tremendous opportunity to reveal novel sensors and regulators in PANoptosis. Furthermore, we will also 
perform immunoprecipitations of the PANoptosome components and incorporate targeted and unbiased 
proteomic approaches including mass spectrometry-based analyses and computational tools to identify and 
characterize the full spectrum of PANoptosis components upon infection with A. fumigatus. 
In addition to using molecular techniques to characterize the newly identified PANoptotic regulators, sensors, 
and componenets, we will also analyze where in the PANoptotic pathway each of these molecules functions 
using genetic approaches. We have developed advanced tools to study innate immunity, generating numerous 
knockout mouse strains that will be critically important for evaluating the newly identified regulators and 
members of the PANoptosome and PANoptotic pathway. As we have done with the PANoptotic regulators 
previously identified in our laboratory, such as ZBP1, we will use these established models to systematically 
dissect where these molecules fit into the pathway and rigorously test their roles in host defense against A. 
fumigatus infection.
Continuation of this R37 and completion of our aims is expected to identify major innate immune 
signaling pathways and the molecular mechanisms that regulate the PANoptosome and PANoptosis 
in response to A. fumigatus. These discoveries are expected to identify novel signaling pathways that 
could be targeted by therapeutic interventions."

In the United States, transgender women of color (`trans women of color') experience cyclical, interlocking
systems of structural and institutional oppression rooted in racism and transphobia, which fuel economic
vulnerability. Together, cycles of intersecting racism, transphobia, and economic vulnerability create conditions
that give rise to extreme HIV inequities among trans women of color. Microeconomic interventions – designed
to improve financial standing by increasing income generation and access to financial resources through
entrepreneurship, cash transfers, and training — have the potential to address structural factors underlying HIV
risk. Over the past few years, several trans-led organizations, including the Trans Sistas of Color Project, have
integrated microeconomic strategies, specifically emergency assistance (i.e., unconditional cash grants) into
their programming. Building on our formative work in Detroit, this project seeks to adapt and examine the
acceptability and feasibility of an enhanced microeconomic intervention designed to address HIV prevention
and care continua outcomes. The enhanced microeconomic intervention builds on our community partner's
existing microeconomic interventions, which includes: (1) an emergency assistance; and (2) peer and legal
support to obtain legal gender affirmation (i.e., legal name and gender markers on identification documents).
The existing intervention will be enhanced to include (1) weekly educational sessions on economic
empowerment (i.e., job acquisition, income generation through micro-business, and financial literacy) and HIV
prevention and care; (2) employment-focused mentoring; (3) weekly social media posts of job openings in
Detroit; and (4) an unconditional grant ($1,200) for use towards acquiring self-led or formal employment. Our
community advisory board composed of trans women of color will provide ongoing consultation. The proposed
research plan is directly in line with the prioritization of sexual and gender minority communities for health
disparities research and the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative, as well as NIH priority areas for
reducing HIV incidence. Findings will provide the necessary groundwork to examine intervention efficacy and
implementation processes in a future, large-scale trial."

develop a mechanistic understanding of PHLPP-mediated regulation of cellular stress response in supporting
cell survival and tumorigenesis. In exciting recent findings, we demonstrated that chemotherapy-induced ER
stress promotes PHLPP degradation and PHLPP-loss provides a survival advantage by upregulating
eIF2α/ATF4-mediated signaling. In addition, we found that downregulation of PHLPP promotes mitochondrial
fission by regulating Drp1 phosphorylation. Collectively, the central hypothesis driving this proposed study is
that PHLPP serves an essential stress sensor in CRC, in which cellular stress signals trigger PHLPP degradation
to promote cell survival and tumorigenesis. The following specific aims are proposed: 1) to delineate the
molecular mechanism underlying PHLPP-mediated regulation of eIF2α/ATF4 signaling. We will determine if
downregulation of PHLPP renders colon cancer cells resistant to chemotherapy drugs as a result of autophagy
activation; 2) to determine the functional importance of PHLPP-mediated regulation of mitochondrial dynamics.
We will test the hypothesis that PHLPP plays an important role in regulating mitochondrial dynamics by
enhancing Drp1 activity in order to cope with proinflammatory stress signals; and 3) to define the role of
mitochondrial dynamics in cooperating with PHLPP-loss to promote tumorigenesis in vivo. We will utilize Drp1
and PHLPP knockout mice to determine the function interaction between PHLPP and Drp1 on regulating colon
cancer tumorigenesis in vivo. Our proposed study centers on a novel hypothesis that that PHLPP-loss plays a
pivotal role in orchestrating multiple pro-survival responses downstream of cellular stress signals to promote
tumorigenesis. Our study will fill an important knowledge gap on how altered mitochondrial dynamics contributes
to tumor initiation and progression in colon cancer. Ultimately, by providing mechanistic insights into PHLPP-

10829348,"Project Summary
This proposal aims to uncover the underexplored epigenetic and biomechanical roles of folate (FA, Vitamin B9)
for neuronal morphogenesis and develop novel epigenetically stimulating, biodegradable, and photoacoustic
nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) for the repair of critical-sized peripheral nerve (PN) defects. The hypotheses
are that (1) local delivery of an inexpensive and stable (half-life of over 100 days) folate (also known as vitamin
B9) directly to the peripheral injury site at a critical concentration level of mg/L can enhance nerve regeneration
and functional recovery through an intriguing epigenetic modulation; (2) folate-releasing NGCs could orchestrate
intriguing biochemical-to-biomechanical force transduction to promote neuronal differentiation and regeneration;
(3) incorporating FA into POC results in a polymer that enables photoacoustic imaging (PAI) in the tissue trans-
parent near-infrared (NIR) window for non-invasive, real-time, in-situ monitoring of nerve scaffold degradation
and nerve regeneration. The project’s innovation lie in 1) synthesizing new folate-releasing and photoacoustic
citrate biodegradable polymers (POCFA) for nerve scaffold fabrication; 2) elucidating the underexplored gene-
specific epigenetic and biochemical-to-biomechanical transduction effects of folate for neuroregeneration; 3) for
the first time, exploring the PN regeneration by delivering folate at critical concentrations (mg/L) directly to the
injury site; and 4) in vivo real-time dual-modality photoacoustic and ultrasound (PAUS) imaging of nerve scaffold
degradation and nerve regeneration. Ultrasound imaging provides underlying anatomical or structural infor-
mation of the tissue, whereas spectral photoacoustic imaging (PAI) maps light-absorbing polymers along with
vascular structure and associated functional oxygen saturation of the tissue exploiting differential absorption of
oxy- and deoxy- hemoglobin’s in the NIR window. The Rigor of Prior Research includes 1) we have previously
developed multifunctional multi-channeled biodegradable elastic CUPE NGCs promising for PN regeneration; 2)
we have obtained compelling data to support that biologically stable folate displayed intriguing dose-dependent
epigenetic and biomechanical effects to promote neuronal differentiation migration and proliferation of both rat
Schwann and neuron cells, and the regeneration and functional recovery of 20 mm sciatic nerve defects in rats
as early as 4 weeks post-implantation; 3) POCFA displayed unexpected strong absorption in near-infrared-I
(NIR-I, 700-1000 nm) and even in NIR-II (1000-1700 nm) window for PAI. The expected outcome of this pro-
posal is a practical methodology for the optimal design of imageable NGCs with suitable epigenetic, biomechan-
ical, and topographical cues for the regeneration and functional recovery of critically sized nerve defects."
10829351,"ABSTRACT
Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in nearly 1 of 5 hospitalized patients and is associated with increased morbidity
and mortality across all ages. Many AKI patients will recover kidney function post-injury but then progress to
chronic kidney disease (CKD). The mechanisms are poorly understood and there are currently no effective
therapies to prevent, limit, or reverse the tissue damage. There is a critical need to identify mechanisms involved
in the pathogenesis of AKI. Our long-term goal is to elucidate these mechanisms and leverage them for new
therapies to limit AKI and prevent the transition to CKD. Proximal tubule epithelial cells (PTEC), a major site of
damage during AKI, are very metabolically active and rich in mitochondria. Mitochondrial metabolism causes
increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) which has been implicated in both ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI)
and cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. Modulating mitochondrial function during AKI is an attractive, but thus far
unachievable, strategy. Our central hypothesis is that loss of the mitochondrial sirtuin lysine deacylase Sirt5
leads to shifts in PTEC metabolism that protects against AKI. This is supported by preliminary data showing
protection against both IRI and cisplatin-induced AKI in global Sirt5 knockout (Sirt5-/-, Sirt5+/-) mice in vivo and
in vitro as well as in primary human PTEC with siRNA knockdown of Sirt5. Further data support our proposed
mechanism of protection in which Sirt5-/- PTEC exhibit a form of metabolic adaptation characterized by a shift
of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) from mitochondria to peroxisomes. Peroxisomes have previously been linked to
renoprotection in other animal models, most likely due to their ability to eliminate ROS. In Sirt5-/- kidneys,
peroxisomes are more resistant to damage during AKI. Our central hypothesis will be tested with two aims. Aim
1 will define the specific site of Sirt5 action during kidney injury with a particular focus on PTEC. While aim 2 will
drill down on the renoprotective role of metabolic FAO inhibition coupled with stimulation of peroxisomal fatty
acid oxidation during kidney injury. Both aims will utilize a rigorous, mechanistic approach that combines in vitro
and in vivo models. In vivo studies in mice will use both global Sirt5-/- PTEC-specific knockout of Sirt5 as well
as global and PTEC-specific knockout of LCAD-/- (key mitochondrial FAO enzyme). In vitro studies will use
isolated primary mouse and human PTEC as well as genetically manipulated mouse and human cell lines.
Human AKI will be modeled in mice by unilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury and single high dose treatment with
the nephrotoxin cisplatin. We have also optimized a CKD model using a unilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury
model. This project will significantly advance the field by opening up new therapeutic avenues where Sirt5 can
be pharmacologically inhibited or its renoprotective mechanism can be harnessed in the context of AKI to protect
against injury and block the progression to chronic kidney disease."
10829912,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of this project is to decipher the functional role of testicular macrophages and other leukocytes in the
pubertal testis after exposure to the Sertoli cell toxicant mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP). Although these
cells have traditionally been known for their phagocytic and antigen presentation functions, there is a growing
body of evidence that these cells are critical for normal development, homeostasis and repair/regeneration of
tissues after toxicant injury. We have previously described a robust infiltration of CD11b+ immunoreactive cells,
representing macrophages, neutrophils, monocytes, natural killer and dendritic cells, into the testicular interstitial
space in pubertal aged rats (PND 28) after MEHP (700 mg/kg, p.o.) treatment. The most pronounced infiltration
of these cells occurs in pubertal rats, with lesser amounts in adult rats. Further, C57BL/6J mice at both ages do
not have a significant infiltration due to MEHP exposure. The species and age-dependent sensitivity of MEHP-
induced testicular injury is well recognized, although the mechanisms that account for these differences remain
unresolved. A detailed evaluation of the cells that lie adjacent to the basement membrane of the seminiferous
tubules revealed a specific testicular macrophage sub-population, the peritubular macrophages (ptMφs), that is
increased in number and in specific regional localization along the periphery of the seminiferous tubules for a
sustained period (>2 weeks) after MEHP exposure. The ptMφ subtype has gained attention in the field of testis
biology because they are predicted to play a critical role in the maintenance of the microenvironment supporting
the spermatogonial niche. These findings have led to the hypothesis that MEHP-induced Sertoli cell injury
incites an increase in the number and localization of distinct testicular macrophage subtypes as a
mechanism to facilitate the efficient repair and recovery of spermatogenesis. To test this hypothesis, the
first specific aim will characterize and determine the localization of macrophages subtypes in the pubertal testis
in response to a range of MEHP doses (from a low of 10 mg/kg with increased dose intervals of 100, 250, 500
or 700 mg/kg). In the second aim, the cellular mechanisms that induce an infiltration of leukocytes into the testis
will be defined. In the final aim, the extent that testicular macrophage subtypes are involved in mediating the
recovery of spermatogenesis after a sub-chronic low dose MEHP treatment regimen will be determined as a
strategy to more accurately translate the findings of this research project to human relevant exposures. Insights
gained from this work will be valuable for predicting individuals susceptible to toxicant-induced infertility and the
prevention of reproductive health risks associated with this ubiquitous environmental toxicant. Assessing the
individual susceptibility to interactions of environmental toxicants with the immune system is consistent with goals
of the NIEHS 2018-2023 strategic plan."
10829913,"Most disease associated GWAS variants have relatively modest effects on expression in reporter or
CRISPR perturbation assays. In addition, enhancer disruption in vivo often has surprisingly weak
phenotypic consequences. We hypothesize that a critical missing element is our lack of quantitative
models of how multiple TFs interact at an enhancer, and how multiple enhancers interact at a locus to
respond to perturbations in a nonlinear way through altered gene network activity. Predicting the impact
of genomic variation thus requires quantitative modeling of how one variant's impact depends on other
variants through their combined effect on altered cellular regulatory state. The central aim of this
proposal is to develop computational methods to infer quantitative models of these combinatorial
interactions by training on temporally-resolved measurements of gene activity, enhancer activity, and
core cell fate-regulating transcription factor (TF) activity across cell state transitions in early human
development. Our preliminary studies show that while promoter knockdown has robust effects on target
gene expression, individual enhancer knockdown is often weaker and affects temporal transition
dynamics, but not the final steady state. We show that gene network models based on sequence-based
machine learning are consistent with these observations. We propose improvements to our sequence
based models to develop kinetic rate equation and stochastic simulation gene network models to predict
the variable and often temporal effects of enhancer perturbation. We will generate high time resolution
ATAC, H3K27ac, and scRNA-seq data to train these models, and validate the gene network predictions
of network response with CRISPRi in a native genomic context. We will first focus on our embryonic-
stem-cell to definitive-endoderm (ESC-DE) system, and we will then develop methods to generalize
application of these focused models to larger ENCODE regulatory datasets. Our work will enable a
quantitative understanding of how the altered activity of regulatory elements affects the stability and
dynamics of the gene regulatory networks within which the element operates, and how they play a role in
controlling developmentally important and disease relevant cell state transitions."
11174023,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Functional precision oncology holds great potential to improve the current clinical paradigm by using patient-
derived ex vivo systems (e.g., PDXs and organoids) for personalized treatment-specific readouts. However,
presently, these models take long to establish, are not scalable and are costly; such challenges impede their
wide-spread applicability and commercial potential. Therefore, there remains an unmet need to develop novel
functional precision medicine strategies that pair the right therapy to each patient to improve clinical outcomes.
Xilis is answering this call by developing a novel FDA, CLIA and IVDR-compliant medical device that can rapidly
grow micro-organospheres (MOS) – high-fidelity, ex vivo patient avatars. Xilis has developed a proprietary
benchtop MOS generator instrument (MOSgen) to generate MOS based on the following processes: 1)
formation of Matrigel droplet-based MOS “micro-reactors” in oil emulsions from low volume clinical samples (e.g.,
18G biopsies) 2) polymerization of the Matrigel via heat through our unique chip design, 3) sample
demulsification using our proprietary process, where the oil is removed, and the droplets are resuspended in
media for downstream establishment. Although functional, the current MOSgen prototype has disparate, stand-
alone workflows for MOS formation, polymerization and demulsification that need complex tubing, complicated
user interaction, and requires lengthy disinfection procedures, which impedes its use and applicability in clinical
workflows. Thus, in this SBIR Fast-track, our multi-disciplinary team with engineering, biological and
clinical expertise will build an automated, end-to-end, commercial-grade MOSgen instrument that rapidly
generates MOS in a scalable and reproducible manner with minimal risk of contamination. Xilis currently
is engaged with its strategic partner, MD Anderson Cancer Center, and will implement the MOSgen into the
existing clinical workflow to validate its operation. SBIR funding would also bolster Xilis’ collaboration with Mayo
Clinic to enable device validation by supporting the NCI-funded BEAUTY clinical trials. In Phase I, we will develop
a penultimate prototype of our MOSgen instrument, which will integrate the hardware and software workflows.
We have engineered a series of novel serpentine microfluidic chipsets, which we will integrate into our instrument
for an all-in-one solution. We will test the prototype using colorectal cancer samples (leveraging our registered
clinical trial with leading site, MD Anderson) and multiple myeloma samples (from our collaboration with Duke
University). In Phase II, we will build our end-to-end, commercial-grade MOSgen, in compliance with FDA’s QSR
Part 320. This instrument will be automated and easy-to-use, to readily support seamless implementation into
current clinical workflows. To test the MOSgen, we will partner will MD Anderson and Mayo Clinic (subaward)
and integrate our instrument into existing clinical trials to validate its operation. Successful completion will support
the development of a commercial, fully-automated, commercial-grade microfluidic instrument that can streamline
the generation of MOS to enable robust functional precision medicine capabilities."

The Veteran population is skewed in terms of age, with more than 55% of Veterans already over 65 years of
age. Older individuals with deficits in muscle size, strength and power can become mobility-limited to a degree
that simply walking to the mailbox is at the upper limit of their physical capacity. An age-associated vascular
dysfunction leading to muscle de-conditioning, particularly in the lower extremities, has been described as a
“vicious loop” as inactivity and muscle atrophy result in weakness and low power production which leads to
reduced mobility and an even greater restriction of activity leading to even more pronounced vascular and muscle
deterioration. The central goal of Dr. Richardson’s research is to attenuate the process of vascular aging such
that fatigue resistance and impaired mobility are achieved and vascular aging continues to be attenuated. Thus,
Dr. Richardson’s work has significant implications for the VA and rehabilitative medicine. Due to Dr. Richardson’s
research interests, related to the vascular and metabolic changes associated with the aging process, he was
recruited from the Division of Physiology, at the University of California, San Diego, in 2007 to the University of
Utah, Division of Geriatrics, and the Salt Lake City Geriatrics, Research, Education, and Clinical Center
(GRECC), as a Professor and Associate Director for Research, respectively. In 2015 Dr. Richardson received a
VA Rehabilitation Research Service, Senior Research Career Scientist (SRCS) Award and the current
application represents his request to renew this award. Since, receiving the SRCS Award, in 2015, Dr.
Richardson has published over 110 papers disseminating his research in good peer reviewed journals. Dr.
Richardson has worked on a wide variety of integrative physiologic studies for almost 30 years, and, as of now,
he has published almost 300 papers, has an h-index of 69, and his work has been cited well over 16,000 times.
In recognition of Dr. Richardson’s contributions to the field, in 2018, he was Awarded an Honorary Doctorate, in
Biological Sciences, from his alma mater, Brunel University in London England. Currently, he is the PI of two
VA RR&D Merit Awards, one focusing on the role of the vasculature in Alzheimer’s Disease and the other
developing a promising, clinically relevant, assessment of vascular health. He is the Co-I on another RR&D
funded Merit and a CSR&D funded Merit as well as two NIH funded R01s. Additionally, Dr. Richardson has
successfully mentored well over 40 people at the Graduate, Post-Doctoral, and Faculty levels, as evidenced by
the fact that he is currently the PI of NIH T32 Institutional Training Grant entitled Cardiovasomobility (and a
mentor on two other T32s, Cardiology and Pulmonary), a Co-I of an American Heart Association Institutional
Training Grant, and is just embarking on the mentorship of his third VA CDA2 recipient. Dr. Richardson is now
in his 14th year as full time VA scientist and is keen to carry on his work for the VA and the RR&D Service with

10834960,"High School Research Initiative Expansion Project Summary/Abstract
Rural students and teachers are far from universities, have fewer resources, and most students are not attending
college. The vast state of Texas includes more schools in rural areas than any other state (i.e., 36% schools in rural, [4]),
and these rural Texans have low enrollment into higher education (i.e., 29%, [5]). Further, the Texas population is almost
40% Hispanic, and 14.9% of the state population is at or below the poverty le vel [1], both groups underrepresentedin
STEM. In a geographically expansive area that amounts to the area of New England, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and
North Carolina combined [2], Texas has its unique challenges in STEM education and enrollment into college.
Now, during the public health crisis that has sparked a desire to be involved, and when teachers and students demand
action, it is the time to reach this audience. The University of Texas at Austin High School Research Initiative (HRI)
Expansion Project seeks to enhance educational science resources, teacher training, and a community of higher ed and
high school educators to promote a diverse workforce to meet the growing health science needs of the country.
The HRI Expansion Project seeks to address this need by broadening the audience and reach of the original program,
leveraging the infrastructure of the HRI, including the HRI partnerships with more than ten regional high schools and
partnerships with two nationally recognized models for STEM education: The Freshman Research Initiative (FRI) and
UTeach. FRI is an ambitious program that involves 1000+ freshmen and sophomores participating in authentic research
experiences while receiving course credit. UTeach prepares pre -service and in-service STEM teachers; the UTeach
Professional Development program has a proven track record of recruiting rural teachers for training opportunities [13].
The HRI Extension Project will apply effective practices to new programming designed to address the specific challenges
faced in STEM education in rural Texas and encourage more rural students to pursue higher education and careers in
health sciences. In all, the HRI Expansion Project will (1) develop and disseminate inquiry-driven science modules, which
translate R1 University research, to rural high schools in the state of Texas (≥300 students/yr; 7 modules over 5 yrs), (2)
develop a robust yearlong professional development organization for high school teachers (≥ 15 teachers/yr), which
includes a 4-week remote professional training steeped with content (e.g. statistics, molecular biology, etc.) and

Opioid overdose deaths and the development of opioid use disorder (OUD) associated with the rise in
problematic opioid use patterns have reached crisis levels in the United States. Pregnant women with OUD often
undergo medication for OUD (MOUD) with methadone or buprenorphine (BUP) to reduce the severe health
effects of OUD in mothers and their newborns. However, there is increasing evidence that maternal opioid
treatment is associated with developmental defects that aberrantly affect offspring brain and behavior. Yet, the
underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Maternal opioid exposure may influence early lineage and fate
decisions for neurons and glia in the central nervous system by acting on opioid receptors expressed on neural
stem progenitor cells (NSPCs), but knowledge gaps exist in this regard. We hypothesize that maternal opioid
exposure with BUP management alters embryonic neurogenesis, which leads to aberrant development of the
mesocortical dopamine pathway, causing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like behavioral
sequelae in a sex-dependent manner. This hypothesis will be tested in a novel murine model of maternal opioid
exposure that mimics the standard of care for medication management of OUD. Three specific aims are
proposed: 1) determine cellular mechanisms underlying maternal opioid-induced abnormal brain development
in offspring, 2) determine the relationship between opioid-altered mesocortical development and aberrant
behavior in offspring, and 3) determine molecular mechanisms underlying effects of maternal opioid exposure
on embryonic NSPC function. This integrative study employs biochemical, genetic, and pharmacological
manipulations in both in vitro cell and in vivo animal models; and the outcomes will be evaluated by molecular,
cellular, neuroanatomical and behavioral analyses. Deciphering mechanisms underlying the impact of maternal
opioid exposure on NSPCs, brain structure and behavior will advance our knowledge of maternal opioid
exposure on brain and behavior abnormalities of offspring and pave the way toward identification of innovative
targets for the development of new treatments or preventive strategies to combat the health effects of opioids
during pregnancy."
10835086,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
My career goal is to improve the personalization of stroke gait rehabilitation and develop novel rehabilitation
technologies using neuromechanics-based data-driven modeling in conjunction with hypothesis-driven
experimental design. The proposed research aims to understand how neural constraints impact stroke survivors’
ability to coordinate execution-level joint dynamics to flexibly modulate whole-body center-of-mass (COM)
dynamics between slow inverted pendulum and fast spring-mass dynamics during walking; a task critical to
achieving stable, efficient, and rapid movement. My preliminary data in a single individual suggest that COM
dynamics are asymmetric post-stroke, but further characterization of joint coordination and COM dynamics is
needed to understand their relationship with interindividual and inter-limb differences in post-stroke walking
function and treatment responses. Two major methodological barriers to characterizing these relationships are
a lack of 1) metrics and techniques to encode complex, individual-specific gait dynamics post-stroke, and 2) long
time-series datasets containing diverse movement patterns needed to test neuromechanical hypotheses about
gait. To address these challenges, I will work with Sponsor Ting and Co-Sponsor Berman to extend data-
driven techniques developed in my doctoral research to identify COM dynamics and characterize their
relationships to joint dynamics; with Sponsor Ting and Co-Sponsor Kesar I will design and collect new datasets
from stroke survivors of diverse movement patterns using biofeedback during walking. Aim 1: Test whether
interindividual and inter-limb differences in COM dynamics post-stroke are associated with walking speed. I will
evaluate the similarity of baseline post-stroke COM dynamics to able-bodied (AB) adults and between paretic
and non-paretic limbs. Further, I will examine whether the paretic-limb transitions from inverted pendulum to
spring-mass dynamics at faster treadmill speeds, decreasing asymmetry in COM dynamics. Aim 2: Characterize
reductions in stroke survivors’ ability to modulate joint dynamics to achieve desired COM dynamics. Using visual
biofeedback to prescribe COM dynamics, I will test whether stroke survivors have reduced ability to emulate
COM dynamics compared to AB adults and determine if joint dynamics characterize COM dynamics less
accurately in stroke survivors than AB adults. Aim 3: Test whether sub-groups of individuals with similar COM
and joint dynamics predict biofeedback responses more accurately than discrete metrics. I will test whether,
across a range of biofeedback-prescribed COM dynamics, baseline COM and joint dynamics can classify
changes in joint dynamics with biofeedback more accurately than discrete clinical or biomechanical variables. I
will also have training in clinical trials by participating in Sponsor Kesar’s ongoing gait rehabilitation study. The
proposed research and training will complement my doctoral skillset, preparing me to lead independent research
combining experimental design and computational techniques to discover neuromechanical mechanisms
underlying gait dysfunction and develop novel gait rehabilitation for individuals with neurological injuries."

The ultimate product of our Center will be a series of comprehensive developing human and non-human primate
(NHP) brain atlases of unprecedented cellular, spatial, and anatomical resolution. In Aim 1, we will characterize
transient cell populations, establish the diversity of cell types present in specific brain regions, unravel complex
developmental trajectories, and reveal conserved and divergent cell-type specific features. We will jointly profile
of single nucleus RNA (snRNA-seq) and accessible chromatin (snATAC-seq) using the 10X Genomics
snMultiome platform. All aims will include 30 anatomically distinct regions of fresh frozen developing human,
rhesus macaque, and marmoset brains at four developmental epochs: mid-gestation, neonatal, childhood, and
adolescence and perform probe-based validation.
 In Aim 2, we will conduct spatial transcriptomic and epigenomic mapping of cell types in fresh-frozen
developing human and NHP brains using DBiT spatial-RNA-seq and spatial-ATAC-seq platforms. This approach
will allow us to discover spatial and temporal features, including the developmental niche, proximity of cell types
to each other, and regional abundance. In Aim 3 we will create Common Coordinate Frameworks for the
developing human and NHP brain using high resolution (9.4T and 7T) MRI-based developmental structural
atlases and leveraging existing developing human MRI data. Our final aim will create a cross species molecular
and spatial atlas of brain development in human and NHP. This integration will enable us to identify conserved
and diveregent aspects of the human brain and identify the developmental stages, spatial distribution, gene
regulatory elements and cell types vulnerable to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. We will
coordinate to ensure that our developmental atlases merge with adult human, macaque and marmoset atlases
that other BICAN centers create.
 The data collected by our Center will be perfectly aligned with the overarching goal of the BICCN in
generating a comprehensive census of brain cell types across the lifespan that integrates molecular, anatomical,
functional, and cell lineage data for describing cell types in human and NHP brains. By leveraging innovations
in cell capture and spatial mapping technologies, the current proposal will have broad implications for
understanding the cellular origins of diseases and for highlighting patterns of selective cell type vulnerability in
neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. Additionally, our plans to create
developmental cellular and molecular resolution maps of marmoset and macaque will provide foundational data
for establishing primate models of human disease. Finally, our atlas of conserved molecular, epigenetic, and
spatial properties will support the precise monitoring, targeting, and replacement of specific cell types and the
improvement of in vitro models."
10902023,"Abstract:
The retina has high metabolic activity, and retinal degenerations have been associated with mitochondrial
dysfunction, dysregulation of metabolism, and toxic oxidative damage. However, little is known about how
metabolism is maintained under normal conditions or is dysregulated in degenerating retinas. AMPK (AMP-
activated protein kinase) is a key regulator of metabolism in highly metabolic tissues and is a candidate to
regulate metabolism in photoreceptors, and its role in retinal metabolism will be rigorously studied in this
proposed project using both gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches. Peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor gamma coactivator-alpha (PGC-1α) and beta (PGC-1β) are key regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis.
Adenosine monophosphate dependent kinase (AMPK) is an important regulator of PGC-1 activity. Our goal in
this study is to determine the roles of AMPK and PGC-1 activity in retinal photoreceptors."
10836414,"PROJECT SUMMARY
African-American populations are disproportionately impacted by Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias
(ADRD). Existing evidence suggests that a complex interplay of mechanisms contribute to elevated risk,
including structural inequities in education, income, and community resources. What is not known is whether
the undue burden of ADRD can be partly explained by exposure to community violence over the lifecourse.
The current older adult population of African-Americans experienced an epidemic of violence and incarceration
in their childhood to midlife years, with ongoing racial disparities even as violent crime overall has declined.
Exposure to community violence is associated with multiple ADRD risk factors, including toxic stress, lower
educational attainment, poor mental health, substance use, hypertension and obesity. Furthermore, African-
American communities are subjected to structural violence, i.e. the extent to which community violence is
sanctioned or created by racism in policies and programs. The overall objective of this study is to examine
whether exposure to community and structural violence over the lifecourse is associated with cognitive function
and ADRD among older African-Americans. The central hypothesis is that violence exposure at key
developmental periods, e.g. childhood and adolescence, as well as lifetime cumulative exposure, lead to
increased risk of cognitive decline and ADRD. The study will leverage two longitudinal cohorts, the Study of
Healthy Aging in African-Americans (STAR) and the Kaiser Healthy Aging and Diverse Life Experiences
(KHANDLE), which have data on social and behavioral measures, five decades of health records, and
residential history of participants at several time points from birth until later life. We will use publicly available
historical crime, incarceration and demographic data to address the following aims: 1) Examine associations
between community and structural violence exposure at multiple time points, and cognitive decline and ADRD
incidence; 2) Examine associations between violence exposure, and social, behavioral and health risk factors
for cognitive decline and ADRD; and 3) Delineate the interplay between community and structural
socioeconomic disadvantage, violence exposure, and cognitive decline and ADRD. We will conduct cross-
sectional and longitudinal analyses of cognitive function, decline and ADRD incidence. African-Americans are
disproportionately represented in the ADRD epidemic and yet very little is known about how community and
structural violence may contribute to brain aging. It is critical from a public health standpoint to identify how
policies affecting childhood and adult exposures can mitigate ADRD risk and cognitive decline in later life."

MARC at Temple University
Building on the 10-year success of “TU MARC U* STAR Program,” Temple University (TU) seeks funding to
advance its mission to train undergraduate students of racial/ethnic and disadvantaged groups that are
traditionally underrepresented (UR) in biomedical sciences, and prepare them for graduate school PhD or
MD/PhD programs. TU provides access to a relatively large undergraduate population of UR students
consistently ranking in the top programs in the nation in undergraduate diversity. In the College of Science and
Technology (CST), black and Hispanic students comprise 24% of the total. Many TU undergraduate students
are first-generation college students and many UR students attended public schools in the Philadelphia area.
Underprepared students have few college-level study skills, and often have part- or full-time jobs. TU has the
potential to increase the pool of students who would not otherwise consider or be prepared for PhD programs.
Our initial MARC program was established at Temple University in 2009 with funding for the first cohort of 8
rising juniors. We successfully oriented students to research and a built cohort, students were assigned to faculty
mentors matched with their research interests. Mentors from TU included faculty in the College of Science and
Technology, research centers at Lewis Katz School of Medicine (LKSOM), College of Engineering
(Bioengineering Department) and College of Public Health. Over the past 10 years of two funding cycles (2009-
2019), our MARC program graduates successfully enrolled in or graduated from PhD, MD/PhD or enrolled in
PREP programs for PhD or MD/PhD or Master’s program with goal of entering a PhD program. Our overall
success rate of MARC graduates entering graduate programs in biomedical sciences within 3 years of
graduation is 85%. In this application, we aim to extend and expand the MARC program by addressing the
shortfall of college students in biomedical sciences and urgent need to increase the diversity of biomedical and
behavioral research. We have and will continue to address the need to ensure more UR undergraduates pursue
PhD or research-focused MD/PhD programs. The successful features of the past program will be integrated with
new components with the addition of the community engagement in research training. The goal is to build on the
research support at Temple University from the CST Research for Undergraduate Program (URP), LKSOM U54
Cancer Health Disparity Research and Education program (PI: Dr. Ma) and T32 programs, as well as continue
student research support through graduation and transition into graduate PhD or MD/PhD programs. We will
enroll 16 promising students into our MARC program for two years of research support. Faculty mentors across
multi-disciplines and colleges agreed to provide full-time, hands-on research training and mentorship. Trainee
measurable outcomes will be GPA, number of research presentations and co-authored publications and
acceptance to competitive PhD or MD/PhD programs through graduation and participation in the biomedical
workforce as a result of improved research, communication and social skills/emotional intelligence."
10836546,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This K23 application outlines a career development plan that will advance Dr. Heidi Lindroth on her pathway to
becoming an extramurally funded, independent clinician-nurse scientist. Her long-term career goal is to
become an international leader focused on mitigating delirium severity in older adults, reducing the risk and
burden of adverse outcomes, including Alzheimer’s Disease and related Dementias (ADRD).
Delirium, an acute and fluctuating disturbance in consciousness and cognition, impacts 70-80% of
mechanically ventilated, intensive care unit (ICU) older adults. Severe delirium accelerates the rate of global
cognitive decline leading to an increased risk of ADRD. Therefore, reducing delirium severity holds great
promise in decreasing ADRD burden. Unfortunately, delirium severity is seldom monitored in the ICU. Accurate
and timely measurement of delirium severity is urgently needed to implement the proper, evidence-based
treatment at the right time. To begin to fill this significant gap in clinical care, Dr. Lindroth’s proposed research
study will leverage the foundational work completed in the Mayo Clinic Herasevich Clinical Informatics
Laboratory to develop and preliminary test a passive digital marker (PDM) for delirium severity in critically ill,
older adults. Like a continuous vital sign, this PDM would provide immediate and actionable feedback to
clinicians on the status of delirium severity in ICU patients. Older adult (>65 years old) patients who are
anticipated to remain in the ICU for >24 hours will be prospectively recruited upon their admission to the
medical ICU at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, and the general ICU at the Mayo Clinic, Eau Claire, WI for both
stages of the study (development-aims 1 and 2; pilot RCT-aim 3; total n=230) and followed until either death
and/or discharge from the ICU. Data collected will include continuous digital video recordings of the patient in
their ICU room, routine EHR data, and study team administered delirium severity assessments. The pilot RCT
in Aim 3 will randomize participants (1:1, computer-generated assignment) to either the intervention (PDM for
delirium severity) or usual care with the primary outcomes of usability and acceptability.
Dr. Lindroth has co-designed a career development plan and a research proposal with her transdisciplinary
mentorship team to accomplish the following short-term objectives to: 1) acquire informatics and data science
knowledge to design/build tools that support clinical decision making; 2) gain experience in the conduct of
prospective ICU clinical trials in older adults, and; 3) acquire and develop grant writing skills. These short-term
objectives will be accomplished through formal training (Masters in Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare),
experiential learning (conduct of proposed study), and focused mentorship Thus, this K23 award will allow Dr.
Lindroth to progress in her career development plan and provide her with necessary protected time to acquire
the outlined research skills, knowledge, and experience to continue her pathway towards independence."

Bacteria within the human microbiome typically benefit the host. However, an imbalance of some
bacteria groups such as Bacteroidales can lead to diseases like obesity and inflammatory bowel
disease. A current grand challenge in the microbiome field is to identify products produced by
microbiome bacteria that tip this health-to-disease balance. The lack of knowledge about these
products is a significant barrier to improving therapies that modulate our microbiome (e.g. fecal
transplants)—a current area of intense investigation. The objective of my laboratory is to identify
products from normal microbiome bacteria that promote health or disease and determine their
mechanisms of action. To this end, we discovered a previously undescribed family of Contractile
Injection System that bacteria use to naturally promote the development of an invertebrate host
(a tubeworm called Hydroides elegans). Contractile Injection Systems work by injecting
stimulatory effector proteins into host cells that either promote development or elicit disease. This
new family of Contractile Injection System is unique because they exclusively target eukaryotic
organisms (e.g. amoeba, insects, tubeworms). Until now, this family of Injection System was not
known to occur in human-associated bacteria. However, we recently discovered that the gut
microbiomes of nearly all human adults (>99%) from the United States and Europe carry a closely
related, yet previously undescribed Contractile Injection System. Moreover, our in vitro
experiments show that Contractile Injection Systems in Bacteroides bacteria promote human cell
line proliferation and inflammatory responses. In this proposal, we will lay the foundation for
determining the impact of these newly discovered Contractile Injection Systems on human health.
Our central hypothesis that this new Injection System family comprise a key means of interaction
between microbiome bacteria and host, promoting both development and disease depending on
the effectors deployed and context of interaction. Efforts for the next five years focus on (Project
1) investigating the functions of Subtype-4 CIS effector proteins and link effector activity with the
host’s cellular responses; (Project 2) determining how this class of CIS binds to eukaryotic cells
using fibers that structurally resemble eukaryotic cadherin proteins; and (Project 3) elucidating
the structure-function relationship of Subtype-4 CIS from human gut Bacteroidales using cryo-
electron tomography and fluorescence microscopy. Our results will lay a foundation for technology
employing Bacteroidales bacteria and their Contractile Injection Systems as probiotics to
modulate the human microbiome and host health."

People with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) experience barriers to care and a lower quality of life (QOL).
Responsive to the Collaborative Initiative on FASD (CIFASD5) objectives of improving interventions and early case
identification, this proposal evaluates three developmentally-appropriate and scalable interventions to improve QOL
across the lifespan. Each intervention leverages technology to increase accessibility and overcome significant barriers to
care. These technological interventions are versatile with good potential for dissemination, offering high potential public
health impact. All three interventions are theoretically grounded in self-determination theory (SDT) and are integrated
with useful best practices in “FASD-Informed Care,” derived from FASD research, clinical wisdom, and policy. Our
methodological approach builds on our success developing mobile health (mHealth) applications within CIFASD4, which
has included the Families Moving Forward (FMF) Connect app for caregivers of children ages 3-12 (U01 AA026104) and
the My Health Coach app for adults with FASD (UH2 AA02050). Study aims will be accomplished using our established
systematic user-centered design approach to mHealth interventions, which emphasizes engagement of key stakeholders
throughout the development and testing process. Trial design and outcome measurement are guided by implementation
science frameworks with the vision towards optimizing success of future dissemination in community settings. Aim 1
tests whether the “Provider-Assisted FMF Connect” intervention and an Extension of Community Healthcare Outcomes
(ECHO) implementation package increases mental health providers’ (n=250) FASD-informed care knowledge, self-
efficacy, and practice change (including screening and diagnosis of FASD). We hypothesize mental health providers
trained in Provider-Assisted FMF Connect through ECHO tele-mentoring will evidence greater practice change compared
to providers in self-directed implementation or waitlist conditions. A larger-scale efficacy trial, Aim 2 will test whether
the My Health Coach app improves SDT and QOL outcomes for adults with FASD (n=120). Patterns of app usage
relating to outcomes will guide further app refinements and dissemination. Leveraging advisory board and focus group
input, Aim 3 will develop and assess usability of a caregiver-assisted mHealth app for adolescents called the
“Determined” app system. The Determined app system will include both adolescent and caregiver apps, with
synchronized features supporting adolescent self-determination skill building, caregiver autonomy-supportive parenting,
and family QOL. Inclusion of these three aims across the lifespan facilitates efficient and mutually informative
intervention development. It also addresses gaps in intervention research, especially in adolescence and adulthood. All
three aims draw from diverse geographic regions, benefitting directly from recruitment via other CIFASD sites yet
expanding beyond them. To other CIFASD5 projects and investigators, we provide much needed, scalable interventions to
offer their participants and a clinical setting to test new diagnostic innovations. From findings of our CIFASD colleagues,
we will glean content vital to improve our interventions."
10836550,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ischemic stroke is a serious condition affecting nearly 800,000 people in the United States annually and is a
leading cause of long-term disability. Although stroke survivors commonly experience accelerated bone loss and
higher fracture risk compared to typically aging adults, the underlying causes remain poorly understood and
cannot be explained solely by bedrest. Inflammatory cytokines are present in serum post-stroke, but whether
cytokine dysregulation is a driving factor for altered bone remodeling following stroke – as seen in inflammatory-
related bone loss in other conditions like arthritis – is unknown. Our primary hypothesis is that the inflammatory
environment seen post-stroke stimulates a pro-inflammatory response in bone vasculature that acts to suppress
osteoblast activity and drive an increase in secreted proteins to activate bone resorptive programs. Microdevices
and “organ-on-chip” constructs are effective 3D in vitro platforms for mechanistically probing different cell-cell
interactions in controlled microenvironments. Such microdevices have been used successfully to examine the
response of different niches within bone to pharmaceuticals, radiation, and genetic disorders, but they have not
yet been used to examine mineralized bone and vascular interactions. The overall goal of this project is to expand
understanding of underlying factors contributing to stroke-related bone loss, specifically inflammatory factors, by
developing and implementing a bone-vascular microdevice platform that mimics the mineralized bone
microenvironment. Aim 1 will determine optimal manufacturing conditions for producing a mineralized
extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffold for osteoblast support in the microdevice. Aim 2 will develop the novel bone-
vascular microdevice platform and investigate osteoblast-endothelial cell interactions under homeostatic
conditions. Aim 3 will determine the effects of inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6, interleukin-1β, and interferon-
γ on osteoblast-endothelial paracrine signaling using the microdevice platform. We will accomplish these aims
by leveraging traditional ECM scaffold fabrication techniques with passive mineral deposition, computational fluid
dynamics modeling of fluidic shear and nutrient transport, and biological assays of osteoblast activity and
vascular barrier function. This work will create a new in vitro platform that enables mechanistic probing of
complex bone-vascular interactions and advance understanding of inflammatory regulation of bone loss post-
stroke, thereby providing a framework that may inform better treatment strategies to mitigate stroke-related bone
fragility."

Defining the factors/pathways that regulate intra- and inter-organ communications in cardiometabolic disease is
a pursuit of each Project of this PPG. In collaboration with P2 and P3, P1 will comprehensively investigate
molecular mechanisms by which caloric restriction and the common clinical finding of subsequent weight regain
(as in “yo-yo” dieting) resolves and exacerbates, respectively, metabolic inflammation in plaques, eWAT, and
liver. The goal is to identify maladaptive pathways in obesity and IR and strategies to interrupt them, in order to
promote inflammation resolution and tissue homeostasis in atherosclerosis, obesity and NAFLD/NASH. P1 will
include studies of clinical samples and integrate ‘omic data with human data sets to estimate the clinical
relevance of the outlined models to human cardiometabolic disease, as well as to suggest molecular
mechanisms underlying the human data. Given that the phosphorylated form of LXRα occupies the promoters
of multiple genes under study in P1-P3, and our report that the inability to phosphorylate LXRα globally
attenuated NASH, we are also motivated to determine the cell types and the transcriptional regulation
responsible for this notable benefit in the liver.
 Thus, there are 2 Aims in P1:
Aim 1: To determine the mechanisms by which caloric restriction (CR) resolves atherosclerotic plaque and
eWAT inflammation, and how these benefits are lost upon weight regain.
Aim 2: To determine the effects of CR and LXRα phosphorylation on NASH.
Like the other Projects, through the employment of state-of-the-art approaches and shared complementary
examinations in human tissues and human transcriptome databases, P1 will contribute to this Program Project’s
goal to discover new mechanistic insights that lead to therapeutic approaches to quench the exaggerated
macrophage accumulation, inflammation and intra/inter-organ communications that amplify cardiovascular risk."
10841516,"Project Summary
Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a dangerous arrhythmia that leads to sudden cardiac arrest if left untreated. VT
most often involves regions of the heart that are structurally and/or electrically heterogeneous which provide a
substrate for reentry. Currently available antiarrhythmic and catheter ablation therapies are limited in both safety
and efficacy. In patients with VT that is refractory to conventional therapy, stereotactic body radiation therapy
(RT) has emerged as a promising new treatment. An initial clinical trial showed that a single fraction of 25 Gy
ionizing radiation to the heart was associated with greater than 99.9% reduction of VT burden, and this VT
reduction persisted for at least 12 months. Importantly, studies at several independent academic hospitals have
now demonstrated the efficacy of RT for the treatment of ventricular tachycardia. Despite these promising results,
the precise mechanisms by which high-dose radiation reduces VT is unknown. It has been hypothesized that 25
Gray radiation to arrhythmogenic regions of the heart causes late-stage fibrosis thereby preventing re-entry,
analogous to scar created by thermal catheter ablation. However, histologic data from explanted hearts of SBRT-
treated patients suggests that fibrosis alone cannot account for the magnitude of the observed clinical effect
(unpublished). Instead, our preliminary data suggest that radiation to the heart causes functional changes in the
electrical substrate that may prevent reentry and reduce VT. We hypothesize that ionizing radiation to the heart
leads to changes in cardiac gene expression and electrophysiology. The proposed studies will characterize key
molecular and cell-signaling mechanisms by which ionizing radiation influences cardiac conduction. The
following specific aims will (1) determine the cellular mechanisms by which ionizing radiation influences cardiac
electrophysiology, (2) determine the minimal dose response in a porcine model, and (3) translate biological
insights from animal models into humans through analysis of serum-derived biomarkers from RT-treated
patients. Defining the acute effects of irradiation on the electrical substrate is expected to facilitate clinical
implementation of this promising new anti-arrhythmic therapy and advance the field of cardiac radiation biology."
10841557,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Although much is known about the embryo during early development, the structural uterine
environment in which the early embryo develops is not well understood. A poor uterine environment at the time
of blastocyst entry and attachment can cause long lasting detrimental effects on the health of the growing
embryo, leading to defects such as miscarriage, placental insufficiency, intra-uterine growth restriction,
preeclampsia and preterm birth. Using confocal imaging in combination with 3D image analysis we have
identified and quantified dynamic changes in murine uterine luminal structure in preparation for implantation.
When applied to mouse mutants deficient in progesterone signaling, mice with excess progesterone signaling
or mice deficient in WNT5A signaling, with known molecular implantation defects, this approach reveals
striking abnormalities in uterine structure at the time of implantation.
 The goal of this proposal is to determine, embryo and progesterone driven mechanisms that
guide uterine folding in preparation for embryo implantation and pregnancy success. In Aim 1 we will
determine how the embryo itself affects the 3D structure of the uterus. Using a time-course we will determine
the temporal pattern of fold formation along the mesometrial-anti mesometrial axis. We will determine if the
embryo is required as a physical object or as a biological signaling center to cause structural changes in the
uterine lumen. In Aim2 we will test the hypothesis that progesterone influences receptivity of the endometrium
by shaping uterine 3D structure. First we will assess endometrial folding in human subjects in both the
estrogen dominant proliferative and progesterone dominant secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. We will
then use physiological, supra-physiological progesterone treatment, and a mouse model of superovulation with
increased progesterone levels, to determine how progesterone regulates folding. We will also use mouse
mutants deficient in progesterone signaling to determine if progesterone regulates folding developmentally or
during early pregnancy. Studies in Aim 3 will determine if progesterone affects uterine luminal shape by
interacting with the WNT5A signaling pathway. We will also test if aberrant localization of embryos and
aberrant axis alignment, in aberrantly structured folds, explains the entirety of poor pregnancy outcomes in
aberrant folding mutants (superovulated and mutants deficient in WNT5A signaling).
 The methods developed in this proposal will be crucial to analyze the uterine structure in three-
dimensions for different implantation-defective genetic mutants, pathological conditions, and will help uncover
novel molecular and structural pathways involved in successful implantation. The long-term vision of my
research is to identify novel uterine 3D structure based mechanisms that govern endometrial receptivity with
the goal of developing new approaches to improve fertility outcomes for assisted reproduction and potential
clinical situations for patients with hormonal disruptions."

provocative testing followed by sample acquisition, high-tech monitoring, full-scale bioinformatics and beyond.
Investigators can seek help with any part of their skin associated research project. The Core will offer consultation
to build a solid study design and provide a skin challenge facility for in vivo monitoring of the exposome. The
Core will also maintain a roster of healthy volunteers and individuals with skin disease to donate skin and
participate in IRB-approved skin challenge experiments. A dedicated clinical unit and staff will acquire tissue and
test exposure to environmental agents that affect skin biology. The Core will offer guidance for IRB applications
and oversee the tissue acquisition repository as a resource for banked fresh skin, blood, and other specimens.
Sample acquisition also covers non-invasive methods with direct access to molecular analysis. Safe biobanking
is accomplished through a central biorepository with secure records; coded, deidentified tissues are distributed
to scientists for use in individual laboratories or for further processing by the Cores. We further provide isolation
of various immune cells from healthy and diseased skin. Inflammation is central to many skin disorders, so
evaluation of immune cells and their interface with epidermal cells is an important, but not an exclusive focus of
a SBDRC with “The Keratinocyte and its Microenvironment” as its theme. We will provide guidance for the
expansion of immune cells from skin and blood to be recombined with 3D reconstituted human skin or explants
by the STEM Core. Prior to reconstruction, cells can be genetically manipulated with products from the GET iN
Core. TEST IT2 will interact with both cores to better understand the keratinocyte microenvironment and expand
its research to include interaction with circulating and systemic factors in the “macro”environment. Analysis using
high-end, innovative, multi-omics approaches is offered largely at the single cell level. We offer full scale
characterization of skin and extracted cells at the transcriptome, proteome, signalome and secretome levels,
and collaborate with other cores for additional omic analyses. An extra dimension is added by novel technologies
that offer direct spatial information within intact tissue to better understand biologic activity within the skin.
Subsequent to assessment, the core will newly offer expertise in skin bioinformatics to work with the large

CRISPR/Cas9 technologies and both viral and non-viral methods for the delivery of DNA, RNA, and other
biomolecules into skin cells in 2D and 3D cultures, skin explants, and intact skin. Specifically, the Core will
generate highly consistent viral stocks in a broad range of systems (lenti/retro/adeno/AAV) for gene manipulation
using siRNA, cDNA, and Cas9/sgRNA. The Core will also facilitate the use of spherically oriented nanocarriers
(e.g., spherical nucleic acids and high-density lipoprotein nanoparticles) for intracellular and transcutaneous

CRISPRi), and genome-wide CRISPR screen capabilities, widely used for functional gene discovery. As another
new service we will also provide reagents and offer expert advice on novel approaches for genome editing, such
as single base editing. The GET iN Core will maintain human and mouse lentiviral shRNA libraries, establish a
panel of frequently used reagents (viral vectors, DNA/RNA inserts, CRISPR gRNAs, and genetically modified
skin cells) for skin research, and offer reagents for CRISPR technology. The Core will sponsor educational and
consultation programs, given by both internal and external speakers, on the topics of: effective delivery of genetic
material, gene manipulation using nanotechnology, CRISPR technology, genome editing, genetic screens, and
gene therapy. Having a wide range of customized viral vectors and unique reagents, novel CRISPR/Cas9
services, and innovative nanotechnology approaches, this Core will provide the most advanced tactics for
genetic manipulation in 2D and 3D skin cultures, as well as skin in vivo. Our services, and collaboration with
other SBDRC and Northwestern Cores, will further enhance skin biology and diseases research at NU and
nationally, ultimately facilitating the bench to bedside translation of research."

The NIH has made substantial research investments in response to the large burden of musculoskeletal
diseases in the United States. The Washington University Resource-Based Center for Musculoskeletal
Biology and Medicine was formed to enhance NIH-funded, musculoskeletal research on our campus, with a
focus on basic and pre-clinical research. The Center has profoundly enhanced the musculoskeletal
Research Community at WashU and beyond through state-of-the-art Resource Cores and a multifaceted
Enrichment Program. Since 2019, our three Resource Cores have supported the work of 155 principal
investigators (PIs), including 15 non-WashU PIs. Their work led to 237 publications that have accrued
>3,000 citations. We currently represent a diverse Research Community of 97 PIs. The majority (85) are
WashU faculty, representing 15 departments. With this renewal application, we aim to increase the impact
and inclusiveness of our Center with a new Affiliate Member category targeting investigators in neighboring
states who bring added expertise to our Center. Our initial group of Affiliates comprises 12 faculty from six
institutions located in five states. In total, the annual extramural funding of our Research Community is $108
million, with $89 million from NIH, of which $13 million is from NIAMS. Our work addresses the most
prevalent and costly musculoskeletal disorders – arthritis, back pain, bone and joint trauma, osteoporosis,
and metastatic cancer. We have designed the three Resource Cores of the P30 Center to support the
critical needs of the Research Community in the development, implementation and evaluation of research
models for musculoskeletal biology and medicine. The Administrative Core (A) will provide Center
leadership and direct an Enrichment Program. The Musculoskeletal Structure and Strength Core (B) will
support access, training and cost-effective utilization for X-ray based imaging methods, and biomechanical
methods to quantify mechanical properties of musculoskeletal tissues. The Musculoskeletal Histology and
Morphometry Core (C) will perform processing, embedding, sectioning and staining for the range of tissues
and techniques required in musculoskeletal research, and support access and training for routine
microscopy and histomorphometry, and for advanced microscopy. The Animal Models of Bone & Joint
Injury and Disease Core (D) will provide training and hands-on implementation for reproducible mouse
models of arthritis (OA, RA) and fracture, and support access and training for state-of-the-art measures of in
vivo pain and function. In summary, we propose Cores that will provide essential support for our Research
Community to develop, implement, evaluate and interpret research models for musculoskeletal biology and
medicine. A common theme for each Core is support for training and instruction to enhance rigor and
reproducibility, and for enrichment activities to foster the development of the next generation of
musculoskeletal investigators."
10843586,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Administrative Core (A)
The NIH has made substantial research investments in response to the large burden of musculoskeletal
diseases in the United States. The Washington University Resource-Based Center for Musculoskeletal
Biology and Medicine was formed to enhance NIH-funded, musculoskeletal research on our campus, with a
focus on basic and pre-clinical research. We have achieved a positive impact through efficient delivery of
essential and rigorous research services and a strong enrichment program. In the past 4 years the P30
Center Grant (AR074992) has been linked to 237 publications that have generated more than 3,000
citations. We now seek to maintain our local impact while we extend our programs to researchers at other
institutions. The Administrative Core will lead the Center, under the direction of Matthew Silva (Director) and
Deborah Veis, Roberto Civitelli and Roberta Faccio (Associate Directors). We bring extensive leadership
experience along with a history of collaboration and commitment to musculoskeletal research at
Washington University (WashU). We represent a Research Community of 97 investigators: 85 WashU
faculty plus 12 Affiliate faculty from other institutions. We propose four Aims. Aim 1: Provide leadership of
the Center through a transparent organizational structure. We will coordinate interactions with an Advisory
Board, and collaborate with other WashU Centers and Programs to promote musculoskeletal research. We
will lead outreach activities to introduce students to musculoskeletal science and promote diversity, equity
and inclusiveness. Aim 2: Promote, manage and evaluate the Center and its three Resource Cores. We will
provide oversight of the Research Cores to ensure that they are accessible, efficient and state-of-the-art.
Through regular evaluation of utilization and performance, we will ensure that the Resource Cores have
strong impact locally and nationally. Aim 3: Communicate with stakeholders and increase outreach and
recruitment of Affiliate Members from nearby states who will strengthen our Center. We will advertise
Center resources, events, news, and opportunities, to members of the Research Community and beyond,
via multimedia communications. Aim 4: Administer the Enrichment Program. We will administer the Pilot &
Feasibility Grant Program to support promising studies that build toward extramural grants by early-career
investigators and those new to musculoskeletal research. We will organize weekly seminars, and an Annual
Research Symposium to highlight the work of the Research Community and provide training and
enrichment opportunities to our members. Through these Aims, we will accelerate, enrich, and enhance the
effectiveness of basic and pre-clinical musculoskeletal research at WashU and at other institutions."
10843587,"PROJECT SUMMARY (CORE B)
The examination of structure and strength is crucial for studies of musculoskeletal biology and medicine.
The rigorous assessment of these outcomes requires substantial expertise, a battery of specialized
equipment, well-trained users, validated protocols, and regular systems maintenance and calibration. We
will support critical infrastructure, shared facilities, training, full-service data acquisition, and project
consultations for evaluating structure and mechanical behavior of musculoskeletal tissues. We will achieve
these goals through following specific aims: Aim 1 – Maintain protocols, equipment, and enable the
imaging/mechanical testing of musculoskeletal structures and tissues. Standard imaging techniques
include plane radiography, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DeXA), micro-computed tomography
(microCT), and high-resolution X-ray microscopy. Standard mechanical testing techniques include long-
bone bending, vertebrae and intervertebral disc compression, torsion testing for bone/fracture calluses,
fracture toughness in bone, and bone and cartilage microindentation. Investigators have an ongoing need
for musculoskeletal imaging and mechanical testing that can generate quantitative outcomes. By assuring
that the equipment is properly maintained and accessible to users, we can continue to be an effective
resource for the Research Community to generate quality data with broad impact. Aim 2 – Provide
training, engage users, and assist with data compliance to optimize quality, efficiency, and impact.
Present workshops and seminars, and produce training documentation (SOPs and videos) to educate users
and ensure best-practices are followed for rigor and reproducibility. We will consult with investigators prior
to the initiation of studies to promote integrate approaches within Core B and across other Cores. To
support the Research Community with NIH Data Management Compliance, we will assist users in exporting
and curating datasets. Aim 3 – Enhance state-of-the-art infrastructure and drive innovation within the
Research Community. Collaborate with the Research Community to develop and validate new protocols
with the goal of broad adaptation and dissemination. Continue to validate and disseminate new techniques
broadly, such as the osteocyte lacunar network imaging and time-lapse microCT for nondestructive
measurements of bone remodeling. Through regular solicitation of user feedback, we will continue to be
responsive to needs of the Research Community. In summary, Core B will provide critical access and
support to members of our dynamic Research Community to enable cost-effective utilization of methods to
quantify morphology and mechanical properties from diverse musculoskeletal tissues. Through our efforts
we will enhance research productivity and rigor, provide training and access to state-of-the-art and
emerging techniques, and enhance innovation in the Research Community."
10843588,"Abstract
Histological analysis of animal and human tissues has played a key role in our understanding of development,
homeostasis, and disease in the musculoskeletal system. Fundamental histologic approaches and techniques
remain important tools for cutting-edge research projects. Additionally, the last few years have seen the
development of new methods for molecular analyses performed in situ, including spatial transcriptomics and
multiplex immunofluorescence. The complex cellular composition and location-dependent function of cells in
the skeleton make these approaches particularly attractive to researchers. However, the unique nature of
musculoskeletal tissues (e.g. calcification, unique and abundant extracellular matrix, large differences in
composition of adjacent relevant structures, etc.) renders them a substantial technical challenge.
The presence of high-quality core services enables investigators to incorporate these state-of-the-art analyses,
along with standard but expertly performed techniques, into their research programs without hiring lab staff
with histology experience. Our comprehensive approach promotes appropriate qualitative and quantitative
assessment of musculoskeletal histology while facilitating the rigor and reproducibility of core-associated
results. We continually adapt to the needs of our Research Community by meeting with investigators to assess
their needs and to provide individualized service. We also continue to work with the Washington University
Center for Cellular Imaging (WUCCI), a well-equipped microscopy resource on campus, to provide state-of-
the-art imaging options for downstream analysis of sections produced by our Core. Aim 1 – Histology services:
1) Processing, embedding, and sectioning utilizing paraffin, MMA/plastic, and frozen section approaches,
performed by Core staff; 2) 20+ routine and special stains performed in the Core; 3) Access and support for
trained users. Aim 2– Resources for Imaging and Analysis: 1) Local, in-core confocal microscope; 2) In-core
BioQuant Osteo system for histomorphometry; 3) Coordination with the Washington University Center for
Cellular Imaging. Aim 3 – Consultation, training, and development/implementation of new techniques: 1)
Individual consultation for project planning and data interpretation by Core staff and/or directors; 2)
Individualized technical training for Core equipment; 3) Technical development and support for spatial
molecular techniques; 4) Seminars and workshops. Aim 4 – Quality control and communication: 1) Support
rigor and reproducibility; and with Core A 2) Maintain website with information on services, protocols, and
didactic materials; 3) Communicate regularly with users about available services and other related resources,
and survey needs."

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) are highly prevalent conditions that have reached epidemic
proportions in the US and worldwide. These joint diseases are characterized by inflammation, swelling, pain,
and limited mobility. Despite significant advances in developing anti-inflammatory therapies, biologics, and
symptomatic pain relief measures, significant shortcomings in treating these diseases remain, emphasizing the
need for additional research to meet this urgent health predicament. Fracture healing is impeded in these and
other inflammatory and metabolic diseases, such as aging, obesity, and diabetes, requiring better development
of appropriate animal models to study underlying mechanisms and advance therapeutic interventions.
A wide range of small animal models of bone and joint disease has been developed in recent years and helped
advance our understanding of disease pathology, underlying mechanisms, disease management and
therapeutic intervention. However, the reproducible implementation of these models is challenging, especially in
the hands of casual non-experts, and due to scarcity of validated benchmark criteria across studies. At the same
time, tests of animal behavior, sensitivity, and musculoskeletal (MSK) function have demonstrated value in
identifying symptoms and dysfunction of arthritic joints. Yet, the full spectrum of creation of bone and joint
injury/disease models and evaluation of functional outcomes to achieve comprehensive analysis remain scarce
due to limited availability of essential expertise or resources. Core D was created to address this need by
supporting model implementation and functional assessment as an integrated resource. During its first funding
period, Core D implemented eight essential models of murine RA, OA, and bone fracture, established a new,
well-equipped pain and functional testing facility, created a murine tissue repository, and carried out a robust
training and enrichment program. Our ability to do so rests on the collective expertise of the Core leaders in
inflammatory joint disease, post-traumatic OA and bone fracture, and functional assessment of joint pain and
dysfunction. Our long-term goal is to advance current knowledge to bridge gaps in our understanding of the basis
of bone and joint pathology, and to develop and evaluate new therapeutic strategies. The Core will develop and
maintain standard protocols and will (i) support the reproducible execution of RA, OA and bone fracture models
for use by the Research Community, (ii) facilitate collaboration with Cores B and C to enable comprehensive
analyses, (iii) organize critical resources for testing murine MSK function and behavior, (iv) maintain organized
biomaterial resource for tissue and serum samples from RA and OA mouse models, which will be made available
to all investigators. Finally, (v) provide hands-on training and enrichment program to train the next generation of
joint investigators. Aim 1: Support the implementation and utilization of reproducible OA, RA and fracture mouse
models. Aim 2: Provide measures of biomechanics, behavior, and function to assess mouse joint function. Aim
3: Establish murine OA and RA biomaterials repository. Aim 4: Provide hands-on training and enrichment."

 Dynamic trans-bilayer movement of ions and phospholipids across cell membranes is vital for cellular
life and death. In stark contrast to our extensive understanding of membrane ion transport, the mechanisms
and consequences of phospholipid flip-flop remain elusive. The TMEM16 transmembrane protein family,
implicated in various diseases, such as heart attack, stroke, epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, cancer, and
infections like AIDS and COVID-19, comprises both ion channels and lipid scramblases. By closely examining
TMEM16 family members, our previous work has eliminated the conceptual barrier between ion channels and
lipid scramblases, the two major types of passive transporters on cell membranes cooperating distinct
substrates. This conceptual breakthrough has allowed us to determine novel ion and lipid transport principles
at the molecular level and uncover new cellular and physiological functions for TMEM16 ion channels and
lipid scramblases. In this application, we will investigate TMEM16 lipid scramblases to deepen our
understanding of lipid flip-flop and its undiscovered cell signaling roles. We aim to develop innovative methods
for monitoring and controlling lipid flip-flop under physiological conditions and to decipher how calcium and
voltage activate TMEM16 lipid scramblases at molecular and cellular levels. Additionally, we will employ our
novel methods to explore lipid scramblase-mediated cell signaling during cell-cell fusion, an essential yet
poorly understood process for human health. Our proposed studies will offer a comprehensive understanding
of lipid and ion transport in health and disease, paving the way for developing new therapies to prevent and
treat a wide array of diseases, including stroke, heart attack, atherosclerosis, neurological disorders,
infectious diseases, and pregnancy complications."
10843910,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder with 4% of the population over
age of 40. In addition to the high prevalence, ET is also a progressive disorder and tremor
becomes more severe over time, leading to disability. Therapeutic options for ET are far from
satisfactory, and there is no existing therapy can slow down the disease progression to prevent
disability, in part due to an unclear understanding of the disease mechanism. Recent advances
of ET neuropathology and animal models of tremor indicate that cerebellar excitatory synapses
play a role in tremor. Moreover, a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) has identified
the association of excitatory amino acid type 2 (EAAT2) in ET, providing clues of astrocytic
contribution to excitatory synapses in ET. However, the detailed mechanism how cerebellar
excitatory synapses and astrocytes could influence tremor still remain obscure, which will be
important knowledge to bridge the prior discoveries into therapeutic development. In this
proposal, we will test the hypothesis that excessive cerebellar excitatory synaptic transmission,
modulated by astrocytic EAAT, contribute to PC degeneration and progressive tremor, using
both animal models and postmortem human ET brains. We will determine whether the speed of
tremor progression or PC degenerative changes can be altered by either long-term over-
excitation of cerebellar excitatory synapses (Aim 1) or the manipulation of cerebellar EAAT2
levels (Aim 2) in a novel mouse model of tremor. We will also test whether astrocytic pathology
and related PC pathology could be observed in genuine ET and correlate with tremor severity
by studying structural alterations in postmortem human ET brains (Aim 3). These data will
advance our understanding of cerebellar excitatory synapses in tremor and will provide scientific
basis to develop mechanism-based therapies for ET."
10843748,"This proposal will test the hypothesis that host-derived aldehydes are a critical component of host immunity
against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We will use bacterial and mouse genetics, biochemistry, immunology and
cell biology experiments to test this hypothesis. We will identify bacterial mutants that are either more resistant
or more sensitive than parental strains to various aldehydes in combination with nitric oxide, which appears to
strongly synergize with several different aldehydes to kill bacteria. The isolation of these bacterial strains will
allow us to test whether or not these pathways contribute to bacterial survival in mice. We will also investigate
various host pathways from aerobic glycolysis to aldehyde dehydrogenase activity to assess the contribution of
aldehyde products of these pathways in bacterial infection control. The outcome of our studies may ultimately
help promote a clinical trial repurposing an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of tuberculosis and possibly
other diseases."
10842093,"Project Summary
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are an important superfamily of seven transmembrane proteins involved
in cell-to-cell communication essential for sensing, movement, and thought processes. A significant portion of
current approved drug therapies target GPCRs, but suffer from “on-target” side-effects related to the
engagement of differential signaling pathways known as “functional selectivity” or “biased signaling.” Exploiting
biased signaling represents a promising approach toward designing pathway-selective drugs with better “on-
target” profiles, but the mechanisms at the structural level that lead to biased signaling are still poorly
understood. Recent advances in structural details of biased ligand recognition have led to the identification of
common binding pocket motifs important for `switching' balanced agonists toward biased agonists, and vice
versa. Using a structure-based and chemical biology approach, my laboratory aims to use a variety of recently
discovered biased ligands to uncover common mechanisms within the binding pocket that govern biased
signaling at key GPCR targets. Strategies will incorporate a combination of structure-guided mutagenesis, use
of structure-activity relationships (SAR) for recently discovered biased ligands, and high-throughput assays
measuring ligand kinetics, G protein dissociation, second messenger production, β-arrestin recruitment, and
internalization. This approach focuses on molecular determinants between G protein and β-arrestin-bias
agonism at key receptors that have historically shown biased agonist phenomena. Through these studies, a
comprehensive mechanistic understanding into GPCR biased signaling will guide researchers toward
generations of superior therapeutics.

10830260,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite the success of the unprecedented COVID-19 vaccine rollout in the U.S., vaccine hesitancy is evident,
partly due to safety concerns about severe adverse events (SAEs) surrounding the novel technology of mRNA
COVID-19 vaccines and reports of blood clots following receipt of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. While
rigorous safety monitoring may help support COVID-19 vaccination, it is methodologically challenging to
thoroughly evaluate the safety of the two-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and the one-dose Janssen COVID-
19 vaccine. Existing approaches can produce false positive and false negative signals when 1) risk windows
after vaccination are incorrectly specified, 2) a constant risk of SAEs during the risk window is wrongly
assumed, 3) factors that may influence receipt of the second dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are not
accounted for, and 4) the nature of the risk of SAEs during potential overlapping risk windows of the first and
second doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines is not assessed.
In response to the FOA, PA-18-873, this proposal addresses the specific objective: “creation/evaluation of
statistical methodologies for analyzing data on vaccine safety, including data available from existing data
sources such as passive reporting systems or healthcare databases.” We propose to develop novel statistical
models to properly measure the risk of new COVID-19 vaccines by allowing the risk level to vary during
unknown risk windows and using a data-driven approach to define these risk windows. We will also create a
new metric for measuring the risk of SAEs considering both the risk level and the length of the risk window,
address the potential overlap of risk windows of two doses, and employ a propensity score model approach to
account for factors that may influence receipt of the second dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. We will
establish these novel approaches to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine safety and will apply them to existing data
from members of Kaiser Permanente Southern California, a large, racially, and socio-economically diverse
population.
Through this research, we will detect SAEs of concern, better inform the public and policymakers about the
safety of COVID-19 vaccines, and generate vaccine safety information that may be helpful for clinicians to
deliver appropriate care to those at risk."

the United States alone costs related to loss of work, crime, and health care exceed $700 billion a
year. The field of addiction spans numerous disciplines including, but not limited to, medicine,
psychiatry, neurobiology, pharmacology, public health, and law, illustrating the impact that drugs of
abuse and addiction have on the human condition. We are currently experiencing an amazing growth
of technologies yielding new insights into the biological effects of drugs of abuse and mechanisms for
the development of dependence and addiction. At UC Irvine, the community of faculty and
researchers studying the neurobiology of addiction is rapidly growing with support from the UC Irvine
Center for Addiction Neuroscience (ICAN), a new NIDA P50 Center of Excellence called the Impact of
Cannabinoids Across Lifespan (ICAL), and a new center focused on the medical and legislative
challenges of legalized marijuana (Center for the Study of Cannabis). The goal of the proposed
Training Program in Substance Use and Use Disorders is to train the next generation of innovative
researchers in the field of addiction neuroscience by leveraging the exceptional strength in
neuroscience at UCI, and the new centers focused on addiction research, to provide an educational
and research experience that will position trainees as new leaders in the field. The training program is
focused on predoctoral students and will provide the following: 1) a modern and interdisciplinary
neurobiology of addiction course; 2) two courses related to cannabinoids and the endocannabinoid
system that dovetail with the P50 ICAL research endeavors; 3) an annual addiction neuroscience
symposium; 4) a training program annual retreat; 5) a scientific writing course; 6) a public speaking
course provided by Activate to Captivate; 7) an addiction research seminar series; 8) a journal club; 9)
instruction in methods for enhancing reproducibility; and 10) conference presentations. This will be the
first training program on campus that is specifically focused on drugs of abuse and addiction.
Together, the new centers focused on addiction bring together scientists and clinicians from over a
dozen departments and four schools to address the grand challenges in this field, to train and educate
the next generation of investigators and clinicians, and to disseminate important information to the
public."
10830344,"Project Summary
 Current FDA-approved drugs are usually either small molecules (MW <500) or large proteins (MW
>5000). Small molecules are generally limited to targeting proteins (and other biomolecules) that contain
deep binding pockets (e.g., enzymes and GPCRs), which represent ~10% of all disease relevant human
proteins. On the other hand, biologics (e.g., monoclonal antibodies) are restricted to extracellular targets,
which represent another ~10% of all drug targets. The remaining ~80% drug targets, which are primarily
proteins involved in intracellular protein-protein interactions (PPIs), are currently undruggable by either
approach. The same limitations apply to the use of small molecules and proteins as research tools. In
addition, there are ~7000 human genetic diseases affecting ~10% of the US population; only a very
small fraction of them currently has pharmacologic treatment. The overall goal of my research is to
develop a general approach to targeting the ~80% undruggable proteins and treating human genetic
diseases. Accomplishing this goal requires effective delivery of large biomolecules into the mammalian
cell. Over the past decade, my group has discovered a novel class of cyclic cell-penetrating peptides
(CPPs), which efficiently deliver all major drug modalities into the cytosol of mammalian cells in vitro and
in vivo, and elucidated their mechanism of endocytic uptake and endosomal escape. During the next five
years, we will continue three areas of investigation. First, we will investigate how linear and cyclic CPPs
directly translocate across the plasma membrane, how bacterial toxins and some human proteins escape
the endosome into the cytosol, and how CPPs and some proteins exit the mammalian cell by a yet poorly
defined “unconventional protein secretion” mechanism. Second, we will use the mechanistic knowledge
gained to develop CPPs of improved properties, e.g., CPPs with specificity for tumor tissues, and
engineer a mammalian membrane translocation domain (MTD) for intracellular delivery of proteins.
Finally, we will leverage the cyclic CPPs and MTDs to develop cell-permeable peptides and proteins as
chemical probes and potential therapeutics against several key “undruggable” targets."
10914647,"The overarching goal of the Enrichment & Research Administration Core (ERAC) is to support the scientific
mission of the Dartmouth Cystic Fibrosis Research Center (DartCF): to foster a superior environment for
discovery of new principles of CF biology, epithelial function, microbial colonization, and host responses, and
their translation into clinical outcomes, in areas of interest to NIDDK. Launched in 2018, DartCF will continue to
support three Biomedical Research Cores. It will expand its pilot program to recruit new investigators and fund
new research directions, including CF gut dysbiosis, GI microbial communities, and liver function. It will also
support an intensive research development program and will leverage institutional resources for program
enrichment, including annual symposia and new training modules in best research practices. Working across
the basic and translational spectrum, these components will advance the identification and validation of new
therapeutic strategies in CF. Scientific leadership will be provided by Director Dean Madden, PhD, the DartCF
leadership team, Internal and External Advisory Committees, and an inclusive Faculty Council. The role of the
ERAC is to provide efficient scientific leadership, organizational support, and fiscal oversight for all Center
components. Building on strategies developed for other programmatic awards and deployed in year one of
funding, the ERAC will achieve the following Specific Aims: (1) To provide scientific leadership supporting all
DartCF members as they explore new high-impact research directions; (2) To support strategic research
development opportunities; (3) To facilitate robust scientific communication; (4) To offer streamlined
administrative and fiscal support, providing timely and accurate reporting to DartCF and institutional leadership
and NIDDK Program staff; and (5) To enrich the scientific and research environment by deploying institutional
resources. Each of these aims will advance the DartCF mission. Inclusive, experienced leadership will identify
and create new opportunities for Center faculty to pursue basic and translational research projects in CF, with
a goal of improving therapeutic options and patient outcomes. The education program will provide expert
guidance to our faculty, enhancing their research productivity and generating additional extramural support for
CF research. A weekly research-in-progress series, interspersed with invited seminars and an annual Dartmouth
CF Retreat, will sustain a highly integrated, interactive scientific community and stimulate the exploration of new
research directions. Together with the Biomedical Research Cores, pilot and core funding will both recruit faculty
to the Center and increase their ability to compete for extramural funding. Program leadership has a strong track
record of scientific collaboration and two decades' experience with multiproject awards. Leveraging these
skillsets, we have developed an Administrative Core committed to providing excellent organizational support to
the investigators of DartCF and to advancing its success as an NIDDK-supported CF Research Center."
10834983,"This project seeks to understand the role of the integrated stress response (ISR) in brown adipose tissue
(BAT) for systemic metabolic homeostasis. The studies proposed herein have the potential of uncovering a
novel pathway to amplify thermogenic activation of BAT and to induce the BAT secretome, that might be
independent of β3-adrenergic activation, and might be leveraged to combat obesity and its comorbidities.
BAT plays a critical role in maintaining core body temperature through adaptive thermogenesis, and can affect
adiposity by regulating key pathways in energy homeostasis. Accordingly, strategies designed to activate
BAT, as well as to promote browning of white adipose tissue (WAT), could be attractive for combating obesity
and associated diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recent studies demonstrated
that the ISR is activated in BAT in response to acute cold exposure, which correlated with induction of the
unfolded protein response (UPR) and secretion of batokines known to exert protective effects on systemic
metabolism, such as fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF15).
We have generated preliminary data confirming these findings. In addition, we observed similar inductions of
the UPR and the ISR in mice with BAT-specific deletion of the mitochondrial protein Optic atrophy 1 (OPA1).
Interestingly, these mice had improved metabolic fitness and were better able to adapt to cold. Although
studies suggest that BAT-derived FGF21 plays a negligible role on the systemic metabolic adaptations to cold
exposure, the contribution of BAT-derived GDF15 on adaptive thermogenesis and on systemic metabolic
homeostasis is incompletely understood. Therefore, we hypothesized that cold exposure and mitochondrial
stress lead to the induction of the ISR and its master regulator activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) in BAT,
via the activation of the UPR kinase protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) to
induce BAT secretion of GDF15, thereby improving systemic metabolic homeostasis. Extensive examination
of the ISR in BAT will shed light on BAT physiology and adaptation to stress and may uncover novel
therapeutic targets for the treatment of obesity, diabetes and CVD. Aim 1 of this proposal will investigate the
requirement of PERK for ISR and ATF4 activation in BAT in response to cold and mitochondrial stress. Aim
2 will determine whether ATF4 is required and sufficient for GDF15 induction and for proper adaptive
thermogenesis. Aim 3 will determine whether GDF15 is required to mediate the systemic metabolic
adaptations following cold exposure and mitochondrial stress in BAT, and whether it mediates its effects
through central activation of its receptor glial-derived neurotrophic factor receptor alpha-like (GFRAL).
Generation of novel genetic mouse models will reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying ISR activation
and the physiological roles of ATF4 and GDF15 in BAT, which may inform novel therapeutic strategies to
combat obesity and its comorbidities."
10834988,"Summary
Medical treatments for cancer or other non-malignant conditions can cause permanent infertility. The only
fertility preservation option available to prepubertal male patients who are not producing sperm is experimental
testicular tissue freezing. Prepubertal boys do have spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) in their testes that have
the potential to produce sperm. With this in mind, academic centers around the world are cryopreserving
testicular tissues for boys in anticipation that those tissues can be used in the future to restore fertility.
Although methods to produce sperm and live offspring from immature frozen tissues have been developed in
mice, translation to efficient and safe methods to produce sperm from those tissues in humans has not been
achieved. We will use our rhesus macaque model of cancer survivorship to test next generation technologies
that might be used to protect endogenous SSCs from gonadotoxic therapies or produce sperm and offspring
from cryopreserved, prepubertal testicular tissues. In addition, each patient who preserves testicular tissues at
the Fertility Preservation Program in Pittsburgh (https://fertilitypreservationpittsburgh.org/) donates a portion of
their tissue to research, which will enable us to extend the studies on macaques to human. SSC
transplantation is an established approach to regenerate spermatogenesis after gonadotoxic treatment, but
there are limitations to this method. This application will test three alternative approaches that may circumvent
some or all of these limitations. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that co-administration of modulation of
granulocyte colony stimulating factor or fibroblast growth factor signaling at or around the time of gonadotoxic
treatment will enhance survival of endogenous SSCs and recovery of spermatogenesis. Aim 2 will build on our
recent demonstration that cryopreserved testicular tissue from prepubertal Rhesus macaques could be
autologously grafted under the back skin or scrotal skin of the same macaque or immunotolerant mice and
matured to produce sperm and a healthy baby. Graft recipients in those studies were peripubertal and
castrated. Since young fertility preservation patients will not be castrated and may not have tissues re-
implanted until adulthood, Aim 2 will confirm that immature testicular tissues can be matured in pubertal or
adult animals with intact testes. Immature human testicular tissues will also be grafted and matured in mouse
and monkey hosts. The limitations of the grafting approaches are the risk of reintroducing cancer cells if the
graft is done in human or exposure to xenotropic viruses if the graft is done in an animal. To circumvent these
issues, Aim 3 will utilize a testicular tissue organ culture, developed by Ogawa and colleagues, to mature
prepubertal testicular tissues ex vivo. This approach has not been replicated in mice or translated to other
species. We propose to replicate, modify and improve the Ogawa technique and compare to other in vitro
gametogenesis platforms in mice. Finally, we will determine whether prepubertal monkey or human testicular
tissues can be matured to produce sperm efficiently in any of these in vitro gametogenesis platforms."

arrest and senescent programs or via apoptosis and other mechanisms of cell death. However, the
molecular, morphological, and physiological consequences of this transcriptional program remain poorly
understood in vivo. We have defined the physiological p53 transcriptional program using the mouse as a
model system. Global p53 activation causes anomalies in the pancreas (an acinar to ductal metaplasia),
intestine (crypt atrophy) and kidney (dilated tubules), and directly activates hundreds of genes many in a
tissue-specific manner. Seven genes, however, are universally expressed in the five tissues (pancreas,
intestine, kidney, ovary, heart) examined and represent a pan-tissue p53 transcriptional signature which
includes Mdm2 (which encodes a potent p53 inhibitor) but not p21 (a cell cycle inhibitor and first identified p53
target gene). The pan-tissue p53 transcriptional signature includes three other genes with central functions in
cell survival or cell death for which little is known. Eda2r is a transmembrane receptor and member of the TNF
family with the ability to induce apoptosis. Significantly reduced expression of EDA2R is observed in mutant
p53 breast, colorectal, and lung cancers and in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and glioblastoma. Gtse1
encodes a cytoplasmic protein that migrates to the nucleus upon DNA damage, and binds and inhibits p53
activity in cells in culture. A review of cancer sequencing data indicates that amplification of GTSE1 is
mutually exclusive with TP53 alterations in angiosarcomas further implicating it as an inhibitor of p53
function. Polκ is an error prone DNA polymerase that allows replication of damaged DNA and ensures cell
survival, but contributes to an increased mutation burden. We hypothesize that these three transcriptional
targets are key effectors of the p53 pathway and functionally contribute to ensure cell survival (via cell cycle
arrest or senescence) or initiate cell death. In addition, two of these effectors have opposing properties: Eda2r
induces apoptosis, while Gtse1 inhibits p53 activity and ensures cell survival. Single cell analysis in the
pancreas upon p53 activation, either by deletion of Mdm2 or inflammation, will be performed to understand
the cell-specific and dynamic nature of the p53 transcriptional program. The specific aims are: 1) to
determine the roles of Eda2r in p53-dependent processes in vivo; 2) To determine the importance of Gtse1
in inhibiting p53 activity in vivo; 3) To determine the functional significance of p53 regulation of Polκ in
homeostasis, inflammation and cancer; and 4) To determine the specificity of the p53 response using single
cell analyses of the pancreas. A deep fundamental knowledge of the physiological p53 transcriptional
program and individual cellular outcomes is essential to maximize the efficacy of p53 activation therapies and
may reveal novel therapeutic strategies."
10835119,"As the age of people living with HIV has been rising steadily due to the success of antiretroviral therapy
(ART), and continued new infections, the number of people with HIV in the US is now 1.2 million and continues
to rise. Since most older adults living with HIV were infected as young adults or in middle age, long-term
effects of HIV and ART are now emerging. HIV/ART-associated comorbidities represent a major challenge for
HIV-infected individuals. Of noninfectious comorbidities, coronary artery disease (CAD) has become one of
leading causes of death among older people with HIV infection. In addition to CAD traditional risk factors, HIV
and ART, cocaine use has been shown to be associated with CAD. In 1999, we received the first NIH grant in
the US to investigate the effects of HIV and cocaine use on subclinical atherosclerosis, specifically HIV-
associated cardiovascular comorbidity. Since then, 4 NIDA-funded studies by this team were conducted and a
cohort of study participants, with/without HIV infection, with/without ART and with/without cocaine use, has
been established and followed in Baltimore, Maryland for 17 consecutive years. Pursuing the goal of examining
the individual and combined effects of HIV infection, long-term exposure to ART, chronic cocaine use, and
other factors on subclinical CAD, we found that cocaine use may induce/accelerate subclinical CAD and other
HIV-associated comorbidities. We recently identified several high priority research questions/hypotheses that
deserve to be explored thorough collaborations with other investigators: (1) coronary plaque volume may be
more sensitive to quantify factors associated with coronary plaque burden, (2) telomere length may be
associated with HIV, cocaine use and aging, (3) Troponin T may be a maker for the degree of coronary plaque
burden, and (4) homocysteine may be a potentially useful biomarker for HIV/cocaine associated comorbidities.
The central objective for this U01 is to further examine whether and how cocaine use influences the HIV/ART-
associated CAD and other comorbidities. The specific aims of this proposed study are: (1) to maintain and
expand our existing cohort involving HIV/ART and cocaine-associated cardiovascular and other comorbidities
as a platform for high priority research and as a platform for other scientific collaborations; (2) to examine
longitudinally the effects of HIV, chronic cocaine use, and prolonged ART exposure on the presence,
development and progression of CCTA-defined subclinical/clinical CAD, (3) to investigate whether cocaine use
exacerbates the HIV-associated decline in cognitive function in HIV-infected cocaine users, (4) to investigate
whether HIV and cocaine are associated with telomere shortening, and (5) to examine interrelationships
between homocysteine (Hcy) and HIV/ART/cocaine-associated comorbidities. All the hypotheses proposed in
this application have not been tested and are crucial to the scientific field of HIV/AIDS and substance abuse.
The proposed study will make unique contributions to a better understanding of whether and how drug abuse
exacerbates cardiovascular and other comorbidities in those with HIV and substance use disorder."
10834891,"Project Summary/Abstract
Premotor neurons of the cerebellar nuclei (CbN) are spontaneously active neurons that integrate excitatory
and inhibitory input, largely from mossy fibers and Purkinje neurons, to generate the output of the cerebellum.
The cerebellum facilitates coordinated movement and corrects errors in real time, and also changes to learn
new motor patterns over time. These observations raise the question of how synaptic input modulates intrinsic
firing in a manner that permits premotor CbN neurons to identify deviations from predicted sensory input and
encode appropriate corrective outputs. We are studying the biophysical and synaptic mechanisms that
constrain and define patterns of CbN cell firing in response to physiological patterns of synaptic input in vitro
and expected or unexpected sensory input during motor behaviors in vivo. Recent work suggests that the
degree of inhibitory synchrony from convergent Purkinje cells may dictate cerebellar output in mice in a
condition-dependent manner. We will therefore study cerebellar physiology and behavior in mice and in larval
zebrafish, to provide a comparative approach, both in vitro and in vivo. Purkinje and CbN cell firing patterns will
be monitored both during well-learned, predictable motor behaviors, during unpredicted sensory inputs, and
during motor learning such as habituation and associative conditioning. The observations will be related to
synaptic studies of the interaction of excitatory with inhibitory inputs, convergence and connectivity, and short-
term and long-term plasticity. Such linking of the biophysical and behavioral levels will help explain the
mechanisms by which the cerebellar circuit produces adaptive responses to deviations from predictions,
thereby facilitating well-executed movement."
10830484,"SUMMARY
Recent studies have begun to characterize the accumulation of somatic mutations over the
lifetime of an individual. A variety of mutational processes, both cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic,
underpin these mutations, which if occurring in key driver genes, may alter the fitness of the cell
and lead to adverse outcomes. However, much work is needed to fully understand the functional
effect of clonal somatic mutations across human tissues. In particular, tissues emerge from
coordinated migration, differentiation and expansion of progenitor cells. For many tissues, such
as most epithelial tissue types, spatially cohesive clonal fields emerge as common tissue-resident
progenitors expand. Measuring the spatial arrangement of clones offers two critical insights for
studying the effects of somatic mutations: 1) clone-specific genetic variants spatially aggregate,
creating a local dominance in allele frequency, facilitating the discovery of somatic mutations, and
2) tissues require the proper spatial organization of cell types for function, with clonal mosaicism
extrinsic cues may drive the expansion of clonal fields and/or genetically altered clones may
remodel their surrounding tissue to drive tissue dysfunction. As such, there is an immense
opportunity and need for methods that spatially localize clonal somatic variants. We have
developed an approach to capture DNA onto high resolution (10 micron) spatially barcoded
arrays. This approach, Slide-DNA-seq, is unbiased, modular, and allows for paired measurements
with other modalities such as the transcriptome and epigenome. Here, we seek to develop a
technology platform, built on Slide-DNA-seq, to 1) perform spatial variant detection at scale in
human tissues, 2) to associate those variants with functional changes in cell-types and states,
and 3) to disseminate these technologies within the SMaHT consortium."

The Steelworkers Charitable and Educational Organization (SCEO), the non-profit (501c3) arm of the United
Steelworkers (USW), is applying for HWWTP and HDPTP funds to support a vibrant training partnership
linking two of the largest U.S.-based industrial unions with rapidly expanding immigrant worker centers and
Tribal communities. The SCEO’s training entity, the Tony Mazzocchi Center (TMC), brings together the
USW, the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the Labor Institute (LI), the National Day Labor
Organizing Network (NDLON), Make the Road New York (MRNY) and the Umatilla, Cayuse, Walla Walla,
Yakama, and Nez Perce Tribes.
The HDPTP program will expand our multi-lingual team of Specialized Emergency Response Trainers
(SERTs) from 9 to 15 members. SERTs are prepared to go anywhere at any time to provide pre- and post-
incident training for high-hazard workers and community responders. Also, we will develop 25 Disaster
Response Hubs at high-hazard sites, in worker centers and on Tribal lands to serve as locations for pre- and
post-incident training and related activities. SERTS will also serve on our Opioids working group to provide
training in response to this major health crisis. Our HDPTP program will offer 190 classes that will
provide 3,475 at-risk workers with 35,600 hours of training.
Target Populations: The TMC has access to over 6,000 workplaces and worker centers including the USW
(600,000 members), the CWA (600,000 members), NDLON (55 worker centers) and MRNY (23,000
members at 5 centers). TMC Tribal partners include Umatilla, Cayuse, and Walla Walla (3,000 members); the
Yakama (31,000); and the Nez Perce (18,800). Our training populations are employed in metal mining,
refining, milling and manufacturing; telecommunications; transportation; oil refining, pulp and paper mills
and manufacturing; chemical manufacturing and synthesis; nuclear energy; rubber and plastics;
pharmaceuticals; automobile parts; electrical, appliance and other manufacturing; cement; construction;
shipbuilding; health care, and education. Immigrant day-laborers and temporary workers are employed in
clean-up activities, especially during emergencies; construction; cleaning; home care; warehousing; and
distribution. Tribal workers engage in emergency services including fire, police, and medical services as well as
in the construction trades. Approximately 850,000 of these workers are potentially exposed to hazardous

10836376,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 This is an application for renewal of the T32, “Translational Research Training in Child Psychiatry” that has
been funded continuously since 1980. The mission of this program is to recruit and train the next generation of
translational scientists who recognize that the development of effective prevention and/or therapeutic
strategies for neurodevelopmental disorders requires studying the bidirectional pathways between the
underlying biology and environment at both the individual and population level. The success of the training
program is reflected in both the accomplishments of the trainees and in the diversity of the fellows.
 In the past 15 years, 46 applicants were selected into the training program, of whom 74% were female and
33% were MDs (5 MD/PhDs and 10 MDs) and the remaining were PhDs. Over the past 15 years, our trainees
have received substantial independent funding including 14 career development awards (K08, K01, and K23),
19 R01-level grants (R01, SC1, UH3, UG3), 4 R21s, 2 R25s, 1 T34, 1 U79, 21 foundation grants, 4 awards from
the Sackler Institute of Developmental Psychobiology, 4 NIH loan repayment awards, and 1 award from the New
York State Office of Mental Health. In addition, 3 K award applications are under review from current fellows or
very recent graduates. Of the 46 trainees who have completed our T32 in the past 14 years, 83% are now in
research positions. We currently have 6 fellows, with 1 graduating next month and 1 new MD fellow accepted to
begin July 2019.
 In the last submission of this T32, the committee noted the high rate of success amongst past trainees who
have largely gone on to secure academic positions and who have demonstrated strong track records of
publishing and obtaining extramural funding. The committee also noted our “outstanding group of mentors who
represent broad interdisciplinary expertise” and our “well-outlined training curriculum that strongly incorporates
RDoC, and the excellent pool of applicants.” Herein, we take steps to further improve our successful training
program and our recruitment of a diverse applicant pool and, specifically, physician scientists. We include
explicit processes for mentoring our mentors and now emphasize training in data science and computational
psychiatry methods, while continuing to offer innovative training in translational neuroscience."
10836996,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT—INVESTIGATOR DEVELOPMENT CORE 
The scientific community faces a critical need to diversify its scientific work force and to improve representation 
from health disparity populations in all facets of public health and environmental health research. This need 
transcends multiple levels of educational attainment, and is not restricted to PhD level scientists, as 
dissemination of public health preventive measures to and engagement with diverse communities increasingly 
requires a well-trained and diverse workforce. Therefore, the primary mission of the MADRES Center’s 
Investigator Development Core will be to foster the next generation of independent scientists and research staff 
in environmental health disparities research. Underlying this mission is a commitment to providing formal and 
informal mentoring across multiple levels of education from undergraduate to assistant professor. The IDC goals 
will be accomplished through the following specific aims: (1) facilitate a pilot projects program for promising early 
stage investigators from health disparity populations; (2) re-establish an environmental epidemiology and 
community engagement internship program designed for undergraduate and graduate students from health 
disparity populations currently enrolled in consortium partner university, California State University Northridge 
(CSUN) and (3) facilitate mentorship of students, postdocs, and early stage investigators (including pilot project 
awardees) across the continuum of higher education, from undergraduates to assistant professors, through 
individualized career support, networking opportunities, and review of reports, presentations, and grant 
proposals. The IDC, with support from the Administrative Core, will operate a formal process for receiving, 
evaluating and selecting up to six pilot projects per year ranging up to $50,000 each depending on scope of the 
project to promote scientific research careers of early stage investigators from health disparity populations. The 
MADRES Center internship program with CSUN and the pilot projects program will foster undergraduate student, 
graduate student and early stage investigators’ careers and stimulate new multidisciplinary collaborations in 
environmental health disparities research."

scientists and clinicians with residents, communities, health care providers, policymakers and public health 
officials to create equitable and sustainable partnerships. The CEDC engages with community-based social 
justice and health care organizations working in health disparity communities, scientists and public officials using 
a multi-directional and culturally-appropriate and language justice framework to disseminate information, 
research findings, and policy strategies to understand and reduce maternal environmental health disparities. The 
CEDC has developed a successful model to engage Latinas together with multi-ethnic health disparity 
communities in addressing household- and neighborhood- level environmental health concerns in urban Los 
Angeles, CA. In the current award, we developed novel methods to train mothers, residents and youth in 
participatory environmental health workshops, conducted community air monitoring, collaborated with multiple 
stakeholders implementing a novel effort to assess and reduce toxic air emissions at a neighborhood scale, and 
leveraged traditional and nontraditional communications techniques to disseminate Center science broadly. In 
the MADRES renewal we will continue to advance environmental health literacy among mothers and leverage 
new partnership with community health workers. We will disseminate research to local and national audience 
utilizing innovative communication methods and develop culturally-appropriate tools to share findings and results 
with MADRES cohort participants. The CEDC will further provide strategies to eliminate, reduce or mitigate

Depression is the leading cause of mental health-related morbidity worldwide, affecting approximately 300 million 
people annually. Depression is nearly twice as prevalent among women than men and multiple individual and 
psychosocial risk factors are associated with risk of depression. Hispanic women in the US have unique risk 
factors for depression and other mental health disorders relative to non-Hispanic women including overcoming 
stress associated with acculturation as well as lower awareness and utilization of mental health care services. 
Traffic-related and ambient air pollutants are potentially modifiable environmental exposures that are known to 
disproportionately impact health disparity populations and have increasingly been implicated in risk of 
depression. Pregnancy is a period of dynamic biological and hormonal fluctuations designed to support fetal 
development that may increase susceptibility to environmental insults and effects on later depression. Despite 
growing evidence of the impact of prenatal air pollution on depressive symptoms in the first few months 
postpartum, there have been no studies on whether exposures during this critical period may increase long-term 
risk of maternal depression. Understanding biological mechanisms that mediate downstream effects of 
environmental exposures may lead to improved treatment approaches and reductions in morbidity associated 
with depression. As primary regulators of gene expression, epigenetic mechanisms, such as microRNA (miRNA), 
may be important mediators of air pollution effects on depression. MiRNA regulate numerous cellular processes, 
including neuroendocrine and inflammatory pathways important in depression pathophysiology. We will 
investigate these mechanisms and the following specific aims in 500 women in the first four postpartum years in 
the MADRES pregnancy cohort—an ongoing cohort of predominantly Hispanic, socioeconomically- 
disadvantaged women in urban Los Angeles. We will (1) investigate the association of prenatal exposures to 
traffic-related and regional air pollution with symptoms of maternal depression in the first four years postpartum 
and examine whether these associations vary by prenatal psychosocial stressors and acculturation factors; (2) 
evaluate whether there is a sustained response at 2 and 4 years postpartum between prenatal air pollution 
exposures and neuroendocrine (cortisol, norepinephrine and epinephrine) and pro-inflammatory markers (IL-6 
and CRP) known to be associated with depression; and (3) determine the role of neuroendocrine and 
inflammatory-related miRNA in prenatal air pollution-related associations in maternal depression in the first four 
years postpartum and test whether they mediate associations between prenatal air pollution and maternal 
depression as well as examine the functional relevance of these miRNA. Results from this study may improve 
policy and treatment approaches to reduce the burden of depression among health disparity populations."
10837002,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT—PROJECT 2 
 The prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has continued to climb among US women, despite 
greater prevention efforts. Pregnancy may provide an understudied window into a woman’s long-term 
cardiovascular health. Normal physiological adaptations to support a fetus can act as a stressor on a woman’s 
body, potentially uncovering or exacerbating underlying chronic conditions. Cardiovascular-related 
complications, such as preeclampsia and hypertension, may have persistent effects into the postpartum period 
and have been related to elevated CVD risk in later life. Moreover, environmental exposures such as air pollution 
have been associated with altered maternal blood pressure and lipid homeostasis, while psychosocial stressors 
may independently influence maternal health by increasing inflammation and risk of prenatal hypertensive 
disorders. Efforts to understand the roles of both the environment and psychosocial stress in prenatal 
cardiovascular complications and long-term maternal health risks may be most critical among health disparity 
populations living in urban communities, who disproportionately experience the combined impacts of multiple 
social, physical, and environmental stressors that may exacerbate health risks. Despite growing evidence of the 
impact of such exposures on maternal cardiovascular health during pregnancy, there is little to no research 
available on whether environmental exposures and social stressors during the prenatal period may enhance a 
mother’s cardiovascular risk in the postpartum period and into later life, particularly in minority populations. Even 
less is known about the mechanisms underlying these effects in the postpartum context, but recent studies 
support a key role for miRNAs in both pregnancy and in risk of CVD and suggest that these epigenetic regulators 
can be modulated by environmental exposures. We propose to investigate whether prenatal traffic-related and 
ambient air pollution exposures increase maternal postpartum cardiovascular effects in 500 women in the 
MADRES cohort, a prospective pregnancy cohort of predominantly Hispanic, socioeconomically-disadvantaged 
women. We will accomplish this by the following specific aims: (1) investigate the impact of air pollutants and 
social stressors during pregnancy on trajectories of cardiovascular risk factors in the first four years postpartum 
and examine whether these effects vary by pregnancy-related complications and acculturation factors; and (2) 
determine the role of cardiovascular-related miRNA in prenatal air pollution-related associations in 
cardiovascular health trajectories in the first four years postpartum, and test whether they mediate these 
associations and examine their functional relevance. These results may shed light on the contribution of 
environmental and social stressors to CVD risk factors in the postpartum period and could be critical for 
identifying women at greater risk of developing chronic disease in later life."
10837006,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT—PROJECT 3 
 Social inequalities related to race, ethnicity and socioeconomic (SES) status lead to spatial patterning in 
neighborhood risk factors, where certain groups such as Hispanics are disproportionately exposed to 
environmental hazards (e.g., air pollution, toxic releases) and place-based social stressors such as crime, 
poverty and deprivation. This “double jeopardy” contributes to their increased susceptibility and to persistent 
maternal health disparities, with Hispanics at a significant disadvantage compared to whites in terms of 
pregnancy-related maternal morbidity and mortality and access to postpartum health care. Pregnancy and early 
postpartum years are also a time of high residential mobility (i.e., address moves), which is important to capture 
to better inform exposure assessment of not only the residence but also the full geographic and temporal context 
around it, including the built, physical and chemical environment which may also contribute to health disparities. 
One health indicator thought to contribute to increased susceptibility within disparity populations is allostatic load 
(AL), where allostasis refers to the body’s multisystemic ability to regulate internal physiology in response to 
actual and anticipated objective or perceived stressors. The AL model posits that repeated, chronic exposure to 
hazards and stressors can dysregulate the body’s adaptive systems leading to “wear and tear” on organ systems 
and negative outcomes over the life course, such as cardiovascular, cognitive and stress-related diseases, with 
important racial and ethnic differences. Air pollution, social stressors and neighborhood socioeconomic 
deprivation have all been associated with AL. Yet very few studies have investigated the contribution of joint 
exposure to environmental hazards and social stressors during pregnancy and postpartum on AL, particularly in 
racial and ethnic minorities and low SES groups. Our project interrogates this question in our recently established 
MADRES pregnancy cohort of predominantly low income, Hispanic women in Los Angeles, CA. We aim to first 
understand distinct patterns in neighborhood and residential environmental exposures and social stressors in 
relation to residential mobility during pregnancy and postpartum, and then investigate their effects on maternal 
AL as an early indicator of stress maladaptation in the first four years postpartum. In addition, we will investigate 
whether individual-level characteristics such as demographics, psychosocial stressors and acculturation modify 
these effects using a multilevel framework. Our proposed project will contribute to advancing the science of 
environmental health disparities by providing a scientific basis for how the environment interacts with social 
stressors across multiple levels to impact physiological mechanisms that may signal early stress maladaptation 
and increased risk before onset of disease in disparity populations."
10837077,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The purpose of this proposed K01 Mentored Research Career Development Award is to support the applicant
in advancing and maximizing her research skills in order to launch an independent research career in the
dissemination and implementation of evidence-based substance use treatment for safety net populations. Safety
net populations, especially individuals who are publicly insured by Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance
Program (CHIP), have been disproportionately impacted by the U.S. opioid epidemic. Despite a significant need
for treatment, lifesaving medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are underused by this population. Low
MOUD use is driven by a myriad of misaligned federal, state, Medicaid/CHIP agency and managed care
organization benefit and utilization management policies informed by varying levels of evidence. Federal policy
requires all three MOUD (i.e., buprenorphine, methadone, naltrexone) be included as mandatory Medicaid state
plan benefits, but not all states have complied, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
acknowledges that enforcing coverage is not feasible. Even when Medicaid/CHIP agencies cover all three
MOUD, they can restrict access via preferred drug lists, fail-first, prior and re-authorization requirements – thus
imposing potentially life-threatening care delays on beneficiaries. Managed care organizations (MCOs) that
many state agencies contract to administer benefits can enact additional utilization management policies that
limit MOUD access. Research is needed to promote Medicaid/CHIP and MCO policymakers’ use of scientific
evidence when designing MOUD benefits. Under the mentorship of Dr. Gregory Aarons (sponsor and mentor)
and an expert mentoring team, the applicant will pursue training in: (1) survey design, (2) multivariate statistical
analysis, including latent class analysis and finite mixture modeling, (3) policy dissemination strategy
development, including packaging and communicating evidence for policymakers, and (4) developing research
partnerships with policy-relevant decision-makers. These training goals will facilitate accomplishing research
aims to: (1) develop and administer a national survey to Medicaid/CHIP agency and MCO policymakers to
identify determinants, mechanisms, and intermediaries that influence their evidence use behaviors; (2)
empirically identify and describe distinct subgroups of Medicaid/CHIP agencies and MCOs based on their
evidence use behaviors when designing MOUD benefits; (3) design and pilot test the acceptability,
appropriateness and feasibility of dissemination strategies, tailored to each latent class, for promoting
policymakers’ evidence-based decision-making regarding MOUD benefits. This proposal is aligned with NIDA’s
strategic objectives to assess the impact of substance use disorder-related federal, state and systems policies
on public health, and to identify strategic intermediaries and policy implementation strategies aimed at improving
evidence use in policy. The planned K01 activities will effectively position the applicant to achieve an independent
research career focused on improving access to evidence-based substance use treatment."

10837391,"PROJECT 1 SUMMARY

Despite the deployment of proven malaria control interventions, malaria incidence in Cameroon has been increasing since 2012, ranking among the top 11 high-burden countries. The failure of current interventions to effectively reduce the malaria burden in Cameroon is evident, necessitating the urgent search for evidence to support the rational design and implementation of effective control strategies. The reasons for this failure are likely complex due to Cameroon's diverse eco-climatic settings and corresponding divergent malaria epidemiology. Therefore, the overall goal of this project is to characterize malaria transmission across various epidemiological settings in Cameroon where different interventions are being implemented and determine the underlying mechanism for the epidemics of Plasmodium vivax malaria. We hypothesize that current region-specific interventions in Cameroon do not effectively target the critical transmission reservoirs to reduce malaria transmission. To test this hypothesis, we will conduct longitudinal cohort studies and entomological assessments to elucidate the critical transmission reservoirs, evaluate the impacts of different interventions on the reservoirs, the vectorial system, and the spatiotemporal evolution of parasite populations, and identify key factors responsible for persistent malaria transmission. This research will be conducted in strategically selected sites located in different eco-climatic zones where different control interventions (e.g., different types of bednets, RTS,S vaccine, seasonal vs. perennial malaria chemoprevention) are implemented. Specifically, we will (1) conduct longitudinal cohort studies and mosquito feeding experiments to elucidate the critical transmission reservoirs for both P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria; (2) investigate the impact of the different interventions on vector community, biting behavior, and vectorial capacity and correlate these changes with disease incidence; and (3) determine how malaria interventions impact the spatiotemporal evolution of parasite populations using population genomics. The findings from these studies will provide insights into the underlying mechanisms responsible for the persistent high-level malaria transmission in different ecological settings and inform the development, evaluation, and implementation of integrated malaria management strategies in Cameroon and other high-burden countries to reduce the malaria burden."
10837392,"PROJECT 2  SUMMARY

Insecticide-based vector control and antimalarial drug-based case management and prevention are critical pillars supporting malaria control and elimination. Insecticides are used primarily in long-lasting insecticide-treated net (LLIN) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) programs to reduce malaria transmission by mosquitoes. Clinical malaria cases require prompt diagnosis and treatment, while preventive programs target high-risk populations such as children (seasonal/perennial malaria chemoprevention) and pregnant women (intermittent preventive therapy during pregnancy). Although these strategies have been implemented to varying degrees in malaria-endemic countries, their effectiveness is compromised or threatened by the evolution of resistance in mosquitoes to available insecticides and malaria parasites to commonly used antimalarial drugs. To optimize and maximize the effects of the control interventions, it is necessary to understand resistance mechanisms and keep up-to-date with the changing resistance landscape. Thus, we propose to conduct extensive resistance surveillance of vectors and parasites in our established study and sentinel sites, which have highly divergent malaria epidemiology and have used different interventions. This project will test the hypothesis that resistance development in vectors and parasites is influenced by the intensity of transmission and the types of interventions deployed, while resistance progression, in turn, impacts the effectiveness of the current control measures. In selected study sites across Cameroon, we will perform serial surveillance of resistance mediators/markers in vectors and parasites, determine genotype-phenotype associations, look for correlations between marker prevalence and intervention use, and identify and confirm new mutations conferring resistance. Specifically, we will (1) determine the prevalence, distribution, and mechanisms of insecticide resistance in major malaria vectors and evaluate the impact of resistance on vector control interventions, (2) assess the dynamic of antimalarial drug resistance, monitor clinical efficacy in different epidemiological settings, and collaborate with the National Malaria Control Program to develop treatment guidelines for Plasmodium vivax malaria, and (3) determine how the complex interactions between drug and insecticide resistance shape the local malaria transmission patterns. By pursuing these interrelated objectives, we aim to gain insights into how different malaria interventions affect the evolution of resistance across Cameroon over time. Understanding the extent and dynamics of insecticide and drug resistance will provide the critical knowledge base for evidence-based resistance management and guide and refine the selection and implementation of LLINs, IRS, and antimalarial drugs."

Glycogen metabolism is impaired in >20 individual rare genetic diseases. Several of these diseases are
caused by the formation of insoluble glycogen, which deposits in polyglucosan bodies (PBs). Without
treatment currently available, PB accumulation causes pathology in liver, muscle, heart, and/or brain tissue.
The mechanisms underlying the prevention of pathogenic insoluble glycogen are poorly understood. The PI’s
work with established mouse models of polyglucosan body diseases links both glycogen phosphate and
branching directly to glycogen solubility and imply a functional interdependence of phosphate and branching.
The objective of this proposal is to identify how phosphate covalently linked to glycogen and glycogen
branching impacts glycogen solubility in health and disease, and whether genetic modulation of each factor
can decrease pathogenic PB accumulation in vivo. Utilizing novel in vitro and in vivo approaches, the
proposed work will test the central hypothesis that glycogen phosphorylation and glycogen branching 1) are
interrelated cellular processes that affect the solubility of glycogen, and 2) that when genetically manipulated
can improve the physiological functionality of glycogen.
Aim 1 characterizes the impact of glycogen phosphate, branching, and associated proteome on the
precipitation risk of soluble glycogen in mouse models with insoluble glycogen accumulation. Analyses and
experimental manipulation of these parameters will provide a mechanistic explanation for the structural
changes in soluble glycogen that lead to glycogen insolubility. Aim 2 focuses on the impact and regulation of
phosphorylation during glycogen synthesis, to interrogate glycogen phosphate as part of a GBE1-regulated
protection mechanism of the cell to prevent glycogen insolubility. Aim3 determines the potential of enhanced
branching in the prevention of insoluble glycogen. The impact of branching on glycogen precipitation risk will
be characterized, and a new therapeutic approach for polyglucosan body diseases will be provided. This
proposal uses established mouse models with PB-triggered pathology. In addition, two new mouse lines were
generated, to separately modulate glycogen phosphate and branching in vivo. Combined with state-of-the-art
glycogen biochemistry and proteomics, these new tools provide a unique opportunity to tease apart the
interrelations of glycogen phosphate and branching and their effects on glycogen solubility. The proposed
work can (1) shift the paradigm of glycogen phosphate being detrimental for glycogen solubility to phosphate
as a protection mechanism from glycogen insolubility, (2) reveal regulatory connections between glycogen
branching and phosphorylation, as well as (3) lead to the discovery of unknown glycogen kinases. It will (4) lay
the ground work for new therapeutic approaches for polyglucosan body diseases and (5) provide a better
grasp of vital cellular processes related to glycogen metabolism with implications for several rare diseases."
10830290,"While the regulation of gene expression is well recognized as being important to human
disease, there is a fundamental gap in understanding the role of post-transcriptional
processes. Because post-transcriptional processes are critical for the regulation of
protein production, addressing this knowledge gap will facilitate better models of the
relationship between genotype and phenotype. Like transcription, mRNA translation is
regulated by cis-acting sequences and trans-acting factors. upstream Open Reading
Frames (uORFs) are cis-acting regulatory element found in most human genes, and
some disease-linked mutations appear to alter the presence of uORFs. The primary
focus of my laboratory is to determine how cis-acting sequences and trans-acting factors
control translation. Our goal for the next funding period is to determine the functions of
human uORFs and evaluate their regulation by trans-acting RNA binding proteins
(RBPs). To accomplish this, we have adapted our yeast Massively Parallel Reporter
Assays (MPRAs) for use in human tissue culture. In addition, our computational analysis
has identified thousands of primate-conserved human uORFs, many of which have
conserved RBP binding sites downstream of their start codons. The vast majority of
these uORFs have not been functionally studied. Our innovative approach combines
exquisite systems biology tools with cutting-edge computational modeling to investigate
the functions of these ubiquitous cis-regulatory elements. The proposed research is
significant because it is expected to fundamentally advance our understanding of human
gene regulation."
10830359,"CD8+ T lymphocytes are essential players in mounting protective cellular immune responses against
pathogens and malignantly transformed cells. Depending on the nature of antigen challenge, CD8+ T cells are
equipped with certain levels of plasticity to maximize reduction of infected or tumor cells. After pathogen
clearance resulting from acute infections, memory CD8+ T cells persist for long term and provide enhanced
protection against the same or related pathogens, and these features constitute the basis for prophylactic
vaccines. On the other hand, antigen persistence, as a result of chronic infection and cancers, causes CD8+ T
cell exhaustion or dysfunction; nonetheless, the exhausted CD8+ T (Tex) cells can be partly reinvigorated, as
seen in recent success of checkpoint blockade in cancer immunotherapy.
Understanding molecular circuits that underlie T cell memory and exhaustion is critical for fully harnessing the
potentials of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells for improving viral or cancer immunity. In this competitive renewal
application, our goal is to uncover the uncharted links of Tcf1 and its HDAC activity with chromatin accessibility
and chromatin looping-based enhancer-promoter interactions in memory and exhausted CD8+ T cells. The
specific aims are as follows:
Aim 1. To investigate how Tcf1 preprograms enhanced recall responses by memory CD8+ T cells.
Memory CD8+ T cells exhibit enhanced recall response by more robust proliferation and more rapid activation
of cytolytic activities than naïve T cells. A major knowledge gap remains regarding the molecular basis and
molecular regulators that underlie the heightened immune response. We hypothesize that Tcf1 preprograms
central memory CD8+ T cells for their enhanced responsiveness to recall stimulation. We will use unbiased
systems biology approaches including DNase-seq and HiC to define how Tcf1 and its HDAC activity control
chromatin accessibility and looping. Combined with comprehensive functional studies, we will perform in-depth
dissection of the unique molecular wiring that dictates enhanced recall responses by Tcm cells.
Aim 2. To determine the capacity of Tcf1 to enhance functional restoration of exhausted CD8+ T cells.
Recent advances revealed that Tex cells elicited by chronic infection contain a CXCR5+Tim3– subset that has
stem cell-like self-renewing capacity and expresses an elevated level of Tcf1. We hypothesize that Tcf1-
dependent regulatory circuits can be utilized to durably enhance Tex functional restoration. We will test various
Tcf1 forms and cofactor combinations in chronic viral infection and tumor models, and determine their impact
on chromatin accessibility/looping and its link to favorable functional output by Tex cells.
This proposal will mechanistically elucidate how Tcf1 orchestrates 3D-genome to program memory CD8+ and
exhausted CD8+ T cells for enhanced functional output, and provide timely, much needed insights into devising
more effective vaccines and therapeutics for infectious diseases and cancers."

This project aims to define the role of farnesylated prelamin A in premature and physiological aging.
Genetic mutations leading to defective processing of prelamin A, the precursor for the nuclear scaffold protein
lamin A, result in persistence of its farnesyl modification and cause premature aging disorders. The best known
of these is Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), in which a truncated farnesylated prelamin A variant
called “progerin” is expressed. Mandibuloacral dysplasia-type B (MAD-B) is a related disease, where
unprocessed farnesylated prelamin A itself accumulates in cells. Some evidence suggests that prelamin A also
accumulates during physiological aging. However, the mechanistic role of farnesylated prelamin A in
premature aging disorders remains unclear, and its association with physiological aging has not been
rigorously tested. We hypothesize that prelamin A is a driver of osteoporosis and cardiovascular
disease that occurs in premature and possibly physiological aging. To specifically examine the
consequences of prelamin A accumulation, we generated a novel mouse strain (LmnaL648R/L648R) with a
mutation that abolishes its processing by the zinc metalloprotease ZMPSTE24. These mice express solely
prelamin A (and no mature lamin A), exhibit profound bone loss, but have a significantly longer lifespan than
other progeria models and are thus ideal to study the effects of prelamin A during aging. In Aim 1, we will
determine how prelamin A affects the number, function, development, transcriptomes and signaling of bone
cells, and compare these to what occurs in physiological aging. We will also assess whether these mice
develop vascular disease as they age or develop accelerated atherosclerosis when combined with genetic
(Ldlr-/-) and high-fat diet interventions that sensitize mice to atherosclerosis. In Aim 2, we will determine how
prelamin A affects cultured cells and define the mechanism(s) by which it promotes cellular alterations related
to aging. We will carry out chronological transcriptomic analyses in cultured cells to define the earliest events
promoted by prelamin A to distinguish causal changes from chronic responses. We will also test the hypothesis
that prelamin A induces nuclear envelope rupture that could stimulate a cytosolic DNA sensor and lead to a
transcriptional program of inflammation. We will relate the mechanistic insights obtained from these in vitro
experiments to affected cells in the LmnaL648R/L648R mice. In Aim 3, we will determine if prelamin A actually
accumulates during physiological aging by examining bone and vascular tissue of young and old mice. We will
also probe human tissue arrays and a panel of fibroblasts from young and aged individuals for prelamin A.
Elucidating the cellular mechanisms and consequences of prelamin A accumulation could change clinical
paradigms for the treatment of prelamin A-based premature aging disorders. More broadly, the results of this
project could rigorously implicate prelamin A in physiological aging, identifying it as a potential therapeutic
target for age-associated osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and possibly other ailments."

Fasting regimens can increase lifespan, improve health or both in diverse species including mammals. Fasting
also has an emerging role in inhibiting tumor growth, yet little is known about how it impacts tumor initiation or
how fasting-imposed metabolism can be therapeutically exploited to treat established tumors. Given that adult
stem cells coordinate tissue adaptation and drive tumorigenesis, understanding the mechanism(s) that mediate
their response to fasting has important implications for enhancing tissue repair after injury or aging where stem
cell function declines, and may provide new therapeutic inroads for cancer. In the mouse intestine, where
LGR5+ intestinal stem cells (ISCs) drive the rapid renewal of the intestinal lining, we showed that fasting
augments ISC function by inducing a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARd) driven fatty acid
oxidation (FAO) program, which breaks down free fatty acids into acetyl-CoA units. This work raises the critical
question of how fasting functions through the FAO pathway to regulate intestinal stemness. We hypothesize
that beta-hydroxybutyrate (βOHB), a ketone body and biosynthetic product of FAO generated acetyl-
CoA, functions as a signaling metabolite and energetic substrate that mediates the ISC fasting
response. In support of this idea, we recently found that the LGR5+ ISCs strongly express enzymes of the
ketogenic pathway that produce βOHB, including its rate-limiting enzyme HMGCS2 (3-hydroxy-3-
methylglutaryl-CoA synthetase 2), compared to non-stem cell populations and that fasting strongly elevates
HMGCS2 and βOHB levels in ISCs. HMGCS2 loss in the small intestine reduces βOHB levels in LGR5+ ISCs
and skews their differentiation towards secretory cell fates, which we showed can be rescued by exogenous
βOHB and class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibitor treatment. Mechanistically, βOHB acts as a
signaling metabolite to reinforce the NOTCH program in ISCs by inhibiting HDAC-mediated transcriptional
repression. Dynamic control of βOHB levels in ISCs, therefore, could enable the rapid adaptation of the
intestine to diverse physiological states like fasting. Many important questions that form the basis of our aims
remain regarding the role ketone bodies as effectors of the fasting response in ISCs such as understanding the
in vivo signaling (Aim 1) and energetic (Aim 2) roles of βOHB in this process. Another critical question is to
decipher how the fasting-induced FAO program in ISCs influences tumor initiation and progression (Aim 3).

 Our long-term goal is to accurately identify who is at risk of driving decline, to establish whether driving
behavior can be used as a functional, neurobehavioral biomarker of Alzheimer disease (AD), to forecast when
driving decline will occur, to intervene before the time of decline, and to prevent a significant number of
crashes, injuries, and death. Our findings indicate that the long preclinical stage of AD, as reflected in amyloid
and tau imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers among cognitively normal older adults, is associated
with poorer driving performance on a road test, as well as with fewer trips made in a personal vehicle. This
project will test the extent to which an in-vehicle datalogger, measuring everyday driving behavior continuously,
reflects underlying neuropathological AD and is associated with prevalent and incident cognitive impairment.
 This research is significant because 36 million licensed drivers are aged 65 years or older, and the
number of older adults in the United States is expected to double by 2050, when 1 in 4 drivers will be 65+. Our
work suggests that changes in driving, an instrumental activity of daily living that involves both cognitive and
functional abilities, may reflect neuropathological AD and precede the emergence of dementia symptoms.
 Our Specific Aims will (1) Use established cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and imaging biomarkers to define
preclinical AD and test the ability of the Driving Real-world In-Vehicle Evaluation System (DRIVES) to
distinguish persons with and without preclinical AD among cognitively normal individuals, and assess the ability
of this system to predict the future onset of dementia, (2) Test the ability of the DRIVES data to distinguish
cognitively normal persons from those with dementia cross-sectionally, and to examine driving behavior over
time for both groups, (3) Determine whether the DRIVES data, combined with cognitive, health, and functional
data from older adults, can improve prediction of incident cognitive impairment and dementia.
 To test these Specific Aims, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in AD,
neuroimaging biomarkers (amyloid and tau), fluid biomarkers (CSF and blood), naturalistic driving, spatial
navigation, cognitive and brain aging, and longitudinal biostatistical methods. We will capitalize on existing
institutional infrastructure to longitudinally follow 300 cognitively normal older adults and 50 older adults with
mild or very mild dementia, to create a cohort of 350 individuals. This cohort will be followed using a naturalistic
driving methodology that will capture their driving behaviors on a daily basis. Their cognition will be tested
annually using the Clinical Dementia Rating and various neuropsychological measures.
 Once obtained, this knowledge can be used to map driving as a neurobehavioral biomarker that may be
monitored and used for clinical trials and interventions throughout disease progression of AD."
10839875,"Each year in the U.S., more than one in 10 children are born preterm (PT). Approximately half of very
preterm survivors, born at < 32 weeks’ gestation, develop language-based learning impairments that may be
discovered late and put children at substantial risk for poor outcomes throughout their lives. Our previous grant
(HD069150) convincingly demonstrated that language processing efficiency, assessed at 18 months in an eye-
tracking paradigm, called looking-while-listening (LWL), was more predictive of long-term outcomes than
standardized tests and parent reports. PT children who were faster at language processing at 18 months
showed advantages in both verbal and non-verbal skills at 54 months. Our next step is to understand early
predictors of language processing efficiency in PT children. In this renewal, we enroll PT neonates (n = 140)
from two language groups, primarily English- and primarily Spanish families, to increase the diversity of our
sample and to improve generalizability. We assess social-environmental predictors at 12 months (infant
environment) and 18 months (toddler environment) using day-long audio recordings of the child’s language
environment and naturalistic laboratory observations of caregiver-child interactions. We assess neurobiological
predictors, focusing on white matter microstructure, in the neonatal period (neonatal scans) and at 12 months
(infant scans). We use two complementary types of MRI scans to assess white matter axonal properties and
myelin content. At 18 months, the primary outcome measure is language processing speed in the LWL task,
the time it takes the child to shift eye gaze to the picture of an object that was just named. Parent reports of
vocabulary and scores on a standardized test of language development are secondary measures. Our aims
are to: (1) determine if properties of the infant and/or toddler environments predict language processing speed
and secondary outcomes in PT children from the two language-groups; (2) determine if properties of white
matter pathways, assessed from neonatal and/or infant MRI scans, predict language processing speed and
secondary outcomes, after consideration of language group, clinical variables, and other covariates; and (3)
investigate the contributions of social-environmental factors and white matter development on language
processing speed in this diverse sample of children born PT. Our main hypothesis is that relations between
language learning environments and language processing speed are mediated by changes in white matter
development, suggesting that supportive learning environments impact language outcomes because learning
environments advance the development of white matter microstructure. The demonstration that white matter
change mediates the association of social-environmental factors on language outcomes provides a clear
example of experience-dependent plasticity in the human brain. This finding would represent a theoretical
contribution to models of learning and development in PT children across language groups and would inform
clinical practice and early intervention for PT children who are at high risk for poor language outcomes."

Alagille Syndrome (ALGS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by pleiotropic neonatal and adult
pathologies resulting from haploinsufficient JAGGED/NOTCH signaling (1). Specifically, ALGS is caused by
heterozygous loss-of-function mutations predominantly in the Notch ligand gene, JAGGED1 (JAG1), and less
frequently, in NOTCH2 (N2) (2-5). Although this disorder is characterized by defects in multiple organ systems,
cardiovascular and hepatic pathologies are the most life-threatening. However, in vivo genetic modeling of this
disease has been challenging due to the mild and variable penetrance of Jag1 heterozygous mice (6). Further,
there is currently no well-established drug that can enhance Notch signaling to potentially treat this genetic
disorder. To generate a more phenotypically robust vertebrate model of ALGS, we leveraged the zebrafish model
to control the genetic dosage of jagged alleles to produce consistently strong and penetrant pathologies
analogous to ALGS, including failure of liver bile duct paucity to resolve and spontaneous hemorrhaging.
Moreover, we have validated a small molecule Notch agonist that can directly enhance Notch signaling in
mammalian cells and in zebrafish. These critical new tools will allow us for the first time to investigate the rescuing
of Notch signaling as a therapeutic approach for this haploinsufficient Jag/Notch signaling genetic disease.
 In the ALGS liver, bile duct cell paucity can lead to cholestasis and liver failure. With a prevalence
estimated at 1/40,000 births (7) and a 76% mortality rate by the age of 19 years for those without a liver transplant
(8), ALGS urgently requires an effective treatment. Our zebrafish in vivo studies reveal for the first time that
restoring Jagged/Notch signaling leads to regeneration of the lost liver duct cells. This discovery, together with
postnatal recovery of liver duct paucity in Jagged1 heterozygous mice (6, 9) and fluctuations in liver function in
ALGS patients (10), suggest that ALGS pathologies may be reversible. The reversibility, as well as the variable
and dynamic pathological penetrance in ALGS patients and their JAG1 heterozygosity, led us to the hypothesis
that Jag/Notch signaling may be teetering between being insufficient and sufficient. Therefore, these ALGS
pathologies may potentially be treatable with a slight augmentation of Notch signaling. We rigorously validated
a new small molecule Notch agonist that can robustly enhance Notch signaling in mouse livers cells and ALGS
patient fibroblasts with JAG1 mutations. We propose here to test this newly validated Notch agonist in zebrafish,
mouse, human Jag mutant models of ALGS. Our emerging preliminary studies reveal that this Notch agonist
does indeed stimulate liver duct cell regeneration in jag mutant zebrafish. Our studies will be critical to yield
proof-of-concept data for the use of a Notch agonist as a therapeutic strategy for resolving the most life-
threatening ALGS pathologies. These studies are necessary fundamental steps towards pre-clinical studies."

Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias are typically thought of in terms of progressive cognitive decline,
and relatively little is known about episodes of lucidity that occur among people with dementia. Paradoxical
lucidity is defined as spontaneous, relevant communication or connectedness in a person with dementia. Few
studies have focused on paradoxical lucid episodes, and little is known about what may cause paradoxical
lucidity, how common lucid events are, and how lucidity impacts family caregivers of persons with dementia.
The broad goal of this study is to define paradoxical lucidity, determine the prevalence and predictors of
paradoxical lucidity, and assess the impact that lucidity has on family caregivers. Our proposal will establish a
definition of paradoxical lucidity based on survey data and interviews with caregivers, as well as input from a
panel of clinical experts in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. Next, we will administer an online
survey to 8,000 dementia caregivers across three time periods (baseline, 6-months, and 12-months) to
measure how frequently paradoxical lucidity occurs across time. We will analyze survey data to establish what
may predict paradoxical lucidity and how paradoxical lucidity is linked to caregiver well-being. The results of
this work will help inform clinical practice, build capacity for Alzheimer’s Disease education and advocacy, and
build knowledge on an understudied aspect of dementia."

 More than 20% of patients undergoing major surgery experience acute kidney, brain, and heart injury,
and these perioperative complications lead to persistent organ dysfunction, long-term morbidity, and death. My
research program is investigating and manipulating mechanisms of perioperative organ injury in order to
identify therapeutic targets and develop novel therapies. We are currently focused on the critical impact of
oxygen tension on organ injury, because perioperative oxygen administration is inconsistent, unguided, often
excessive, and potentially harmful. Both hypoxia and hyperoxia can be harmful to surgical patients, yet both
occur frequently, despite the ease with which the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) can be manipulated in the
perioperative period. Our laboratory is focused on identifying and investigating molecular pathways and
therapeutic targets that a) impact oxygen tension in tissues during surgery and b) impact hypoxia- and
hyperoxia-mediated organ injury. We target these molecular pathways to reduce organ injury.
 We have recently demonstrated that: 1) perioperative oxidative damage increases acute kidney, brain,
and heart injury; 2) intraoperative normoxia improves vascular reactivity compared to hyperoxia possibly by
reducing intraoperative oxidation of the heme moiety of vascular smooth muscle soluble guanylyl cyclase; 3)
normoxia upregulates hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-regulated transcription and reduces circulating markers of
oxidative damage; and 4) increased circulating cell-free hemoglobin (Hb) oxidizes lipids and is independently
associated with postoperative kidney, lung, and brain injury. In the next 5 years we will investigate the effects
of oxygen tension on mechanisms of organ injury, including oxidative damage, vascular function, HIF signaling,
and cell free Hb-mediated organ injury, using a multifaceted translational approach. Our program combines
laboratory experiments in human tissues and preclinical models with prospective cohort studies and
mechanistic trials in patients having major surgery. We perform experiments on arterioles and arteries isolated
from patients during surgery to study the effects of hypoxic, normoxic, and hyperoxic treatments on vascular
function. We investigate the impact of oxygen treatments during preclinical models of acute kidney injury in
genetically engineered mice in collaboration with oxygen biologist nephrologist Volker Haase, and we are
measuring the effect of intraoperative hyperoxia vs. normoxia treatment in samples biobanked from the
NIGMS-supported ROCS clinical trial. Examples of these experiments include the measurement of HIF-
regulated transcripts in atrial myocardium and the oxidation state of the heme group in plasma cell-free Hb. We
will complement these hypothesis-driven experiments with unbiased approaches to measure the transcriptome
and protein responses in vascular and murine tissues to identify and support new paths of investigation.
 This rigorous multimodal strategy provides the framework to advance the understanding of perioperative
organ injury and guide the development of therapies for hundreds of thousands of surgical patients."
10845479,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Lesion symptom mapping (LSM) is a crucial tool used to make causal inferences about behavior from
neuroimaging data. Recent work has suggested that structural white matter (WM) and functional connectivity
between cortical regions play an important role in supporting healthy language function. However, any causal
role of connectivity in language remains unclear, due to both intrinsic limitations of the cohorts typically studied
with LSM and often discordant findings across patients and healthy controls. To shed light on this problem, the
proposed project will use a multimodal approach to examine connectivity and language in a large and still-
growing dataset of patients undergoing resective neurosurgery. This population (a) regularly experiences
transient, site-specific aphasias in the acute period following surgery, (b) is not subject to the same confounds
of populations typically studied in LSM, and (c) can be studied using electrocorticography (ECoG) prior to
resection, allowing both healthy and aphasic language to be neurally characterized within the same individuals.
The central hypothesis is that the neurosurgical cohort will reveal classical language syndromes to be a
function of disconnection rather than modular damage, with marked deficits in language arising primarily from
lesions to WM bottlenecks supporting functional connectivity within the broader language network. The
rationale is that this unique approach will contribute a new and clarifying perspective on language and the
brain, allowing us to directly examine the extent to which connectivity is necessary for versus simply involved in
healthy language processing. The central hypothesis will be investigated via two specific aims: (1) to use
multivariate LSM (MLSM) to determine the extent to which the structural integrity of white matter (WM) tracts
predicts fluency and comprehension in the acute period following resective neurosurgery over and above what
is predicted by the integrity of classical, cortical language regions alone, and (2) to use network analysis of
ECoG to determine whether the resection of tissue that exhibits strong functional connectivity prior to surgery
predicts poorer fluency and comprehension outcomes post-surgery. In the first aim, MLSM models based on
cortical and WM ROIs will be statistically compared to determine which provide the most accurate predictions
of language outcomes. In the second aim, functional connectivity of ECoG from later-resected tissue will be
analyzed to determine whether pre-surgical measures of connectivity lead to better predictions of language
outcomes. The research proposed here will provide the first multimodal study of language including both
MLSM and ECoG, with a distinct focus on the causal role of connectivity in language. This work is innovative
because it will make use of a rare cohort, sophisticated multivariate and network-based analyses, and an
unusually large dataset to predict language outcomes. The research is significant because it will provide vital
insights into the causal role of connectivity in language, with the potential to improve patient care through
better prediction of language outcomes and more effectively targeted strategies for intervention."

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) with or without parkinsonism, is an Alzheimer’s disease related dementia
(ADRD) that has been linked to sporadic and familial mutations in the MAPT gene, including the autosomal
dominant R406W missense point mutation. Patients with FTD MAPT R406W present progressive memory loss,
and late-onset of parkinsonism, personality changes, and/or language deficits. Typical pathological findings
include abnormal intraneuronal accumulation of phosphorylated tau filaments (tauopathy), frontotemporal
atrophy, neuronal loss, and gliosis. At the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center (WNPRC) in
collaboration with Baylor College of Medicine, a rhesus monkey was identified as a carrier of the MAPT R406W
mutation, identical to human patients. Progress in the development of biomarkers and treatments for FTD and
other dementias has been hampered by the lack of faithful animal models of the disorder. Nonhuman primates
(NHPs), in particular rhesus macaques, are an ideal species to study dementias and related neurodegeneration,
due to the complexity of their behavior and neuroanatomy. In the R61 phase of this application we propose
to phenotype the MAPT R406 carriers of this family and to identify additional MAPT R406W mutation
carriers. The rhesus will be evaluated with a battery of age-appropriate behavioral tests (cognitive, mood and
motor), MRI (for neuroanatomical and volumetric analysis) and F18-MK6240 PET (to visualize tau accumulation)
and compared to age- and sex- matched controls. These animals will be the founders of a breeding colony of
MAPT R406W carriers. During the R33 phase we will aim to create a MAPT R406W rhesus colony resource,
by breeding the mutated rhesus and generating induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from the carriers’
fibroblasts. The offspring will be genotyped and neurobehaviorally evaluated. The iPSCs will be a platform to
study the effects of ADRD alleles on in vitro neural differentiation. The overarching goal of this project is to
generate an NHP resource for the ADRD research community. A well characterized NHP model of genetic FTD,
supported by in vivo behavioral and imaging outcome measures and associated iPSC lines, will help understand
the pathological mechanisms of the disease, which could lead to the identification of biomarkers and therapeutic
targets. We have assembled a strong team of investigators across different disciplines focused on translational
neuroscience and neurodegenerative diseases, human and nonhuman primate genetics, stem cells, and, most
importantly, experts devoted to nonhuman primate breeding and care."

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, with neuropathology such as beta-
amyloid (Aβ) deposits and reduced hippocampal volume developing years before clinical cognitive impairment.
Early identification of these preclinical AD stages is imperative for improving prevention and treatment efforts.
Unfortunately, capturing the earliest subtle cognitive changes is difficult with traditional neuropsychological
tests, which 1) were developed to detect overt clinical cognitive impairment, and 2) measure peak performance
at a single, and potentially non-representative, time point in a well-controlled environment that is detached from
daily life. These limitations underscore the need for valid assessment tools that capture not only the range of
everyday cognition but also aspects of daily life, such as psychosocial factors, that signal resilience to AD
clinical symptomatology. Mobile health (mHealth) assessments that utilize common smartphone technology
may help overcome these limitations by sampling behavior multiple times per day in ‘real-time’, over the course
of several days. Repeated sampling enables characterization of the time-course of a person’s behavior, both in
terms of their cognition and their psychosocial context.
 The goal of this proposal is to examine the utility of a mHealth program to detect early markers of AD
cognitive vulnerability. The specific aims are to examine whether variability over time on mHealth cognitive
measures (i.e., intraindividual cognitive variability) is 1) a signature of AD neuropathologic risk, and 2) predicts
longitudinal cognitive decline on traditional neuropsychological tests. An exploratory aim proposes to examine
whether individuals with more AD neuropathology show stronger synchrony between their everyday
psychosocial context (interpersonal interactions, mood, loneliness) and everyday cognitive performance.
Participants will be cognitively normal Aβ positive and negative individuals recruited from ongoing longitudinal
studies that gather neuropsychological and neuroimaging (PET, MRI) markers of AD neuropathology.
Participants will undergo a 14-day mHealth protocol, twice over two years, that samples psychosocial factors
and cognitive performance. The proposed training aims include 1) building foundational mHealth skills and
specific expertise in using mHealth to measure cognition and psychosocial factors, 2) acquiring advanced
expertise in psychosocial factors that contribute to resistance and resilience to AD symptoms, and 3)
developing in-depth knowledge of PET and MRI imaging of AD neuropathologic risk factors.
 In summary, this proposed K23 award sets the foundation toward understanding whether individuals at
high AD neuropathologic risk show early markers of cognitive vulnerability on mHealth assessments. The
results of this study will establish the necessary groundwork for the PI’s development as an independent
neuropsychologist-investigator using cutting-edge approaches for early identification of risk and resiliency
factors that influence AD symptom development, and ultimately, AD treatment."

 The transfer of patients between acute care hospitals (inter-hospital transfer, IHT) is often undertaken
to provide patients with specialized care that is unavailable at the transferring hospital. Over 100,000 Medicare
patients with high rates of multiple chronic conditions undergo IHT annually. However, IHT exposes patients to
the risks of discontinuity of care and lacks potential safeguards that might protect against gaps in
communication. Our extensive prior work examining IHT demonstrates sub-optimal transfer processes,
including frequent gaps in communication and inadequate information exchange, with up to 35% of patient
transfers missing essential clinical information on transfer. Sub-optimal HIE during IHT has been associated
with patient harm such as therapeutic errors and delays in care and may contribute to greater mortality
observed among select IHT patients. Given the complexities of this care transition, effective HIE has proven
difficult to achieve due to the need for solutions to address workflow, data visualization and interoperability to
be effective.
 The overall goals of this study are to leverage our extensive research experience in IHT and health
information technology innovation to design, implement, and rigorously evaluate an intervention to improve HIE
during IHT in three use cases with different levels of integration between transferring and accepting hospitals:
hospitals within the same health system, hospitals in different systems that share a common EHR, and
hospitals in different systems that use different EHRs. To achieve this, we propose to refine and implement an
interoperable HIE platform that improves reliability of and access to necessary clinical information during IHT.
We will build on our prior work that identifies essential clinical information and data visualization for effective
HIE during IHT, and utilize user-centered design to rapidly identify, design, develop, refine, and implement
requirements from interprofessional users, including clinicians and personnel at transferring and accepting
hospitals. The HIE platform will use interoperable, data exchange standards and APIs to seamlessly integrate
with existing vendor EHRs within each use case. Our team will rigorously evaluate the impact of this
intervention on patient safety outcomes, including medical errors and adverse events, using interrupted time
series methodology, and our team will conduct robust mixed-methods evaluation on utilization, perceived
usability, and facilitators and barriers to implementation from interprofessional users who interact with the
platform. Finally, these data will be presented to steering committee members with expertise in care transitions
and dissemination strategy, and executive and health IT leadership from participating hospitals, to generate
input on best practices for further refinement and implementation to create a dissemination toolkit to share with
other similar institutions."
10836933,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Two-drug regimen (2-DR) containing potent second-generation integrase inhibitor (INI) and non-nucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) are currently available as oral formulation (dolutegravir-rilpivirine) and
long-acting injectable nanosuspension (cabotegravir-rilpivirine) for HIV prophylaxis and therapy. Oral 2-DR tablet
(Juluca; dolutegravir-rilpivirine) is equally effective but with significantly lower adverse effects compared to the
three-drug regimen based on 2 NRTIs. However, dolutegravir (DTG) and rilpivirine (RPV) both have pH
dependent solubility, low oral bioavailability and long-term use of INI can lead to metabolic diseases including
diabetes. Given the need for lifelong administration of these drugs, strategies that can improve the oral
bioavailability of DTG and RPV are highly desirable for optimal drug utilization and to achieve a reduction in
therapeutic dose and dose-related side effects. While the intramuscular long-acting cabotegravir-RPV
nanosuspension is highly effective in the long-term management of HIV infections, there is a strong need to
develop a non-invasive, strategy that can allow for self-administration and long-term HIV therapy. The non-
invasive transdermal route is yet to be explored for the delivery of 2-DR containing INI and NNRTI. Ionic liquids
(ILs) are low-melting organic salts with a melting point < 100°C and pharmaceutically acceptable fatty cations
and/or anions can be used to develop amphiphilic ILs with excellent drug solubilization capacity.
Pharmaceutically acceptable cations and fatty anions can be assembled into amphiphilic ILs with excellent
biocompatibility and drug solubilization capabilities. We hypothesize that carnitine, a generally regarded as safe
(GRAS) cation and fatty anionic permeation enhancers with GRAS status can be assembled to develop
amphiphilic ILs with excellent solubilization capacity for hydrophobic drugs such as DTG and RPV and that
subsequent incorporation of these ILs into oral lipid-based formulations (LBFs) such as self-nanoemulsifying
systems (SNES) and transdermal LBFs such as nanoemulsion-based gel will improve oral and transdermal
delivery of DTG-RPV combination. Our preliminary data show that a co-processed mixture of DTG and RPV has
very high solubility (RPV: ~ 166 mg/g and DTG: 334 mg/ml) in amphiphilic carnitine IL (carnitine salcaprozate)
and carnitine salcaprozate containing DTG-RPV mixture showed significantly higher in vitro permeability through
skin mimicking Strat-M membrane compared to DTG-RPV suspension. Aim 1 will focus on the development,
characterization, and in vitro evaluation of nanoemulsion of carnitine ILs containing DTG-RPV combination
suitable for oral and transdermal delivery. Aim 2 will focus on the pharmacokinetic evaluation of oral and
transdermal lipid nanoformulations of carnitine IL containing DTG-RPV combination in healthy mice to establish
the proof of concept. The successful completion of this proposal will lead to the development of pharmaceutically
viable formulations containing INI based 2-DR to achieve effective long-term management of HIV infection in a
non-invasive manner and this strategy can be expanded to other antiretroviral drug combinations."
10836936,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Biological tissues exhibit a high degree of phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity, comprising many different
subpopulations of cells in various states. Quantifying this heterogeneity at the single-cell level and with molecular
depth across large numbers of cells and multiple classes of molecules provides information that cannot be
obtained at the bulk scale and will ultimately lead to improved diagnostics and more effective treatments. While
single-cell nucleic acid sequencing approaches are having a significant impact on biomedical research, proteins,
lipids and metabolites mediate the bulk of cellular function and measurement of their expression provides more
direct insight into cellular phenotype. There is thus an urgent need to develop new technologies for large-scale
direct proteome, lipidome and metabolome profiling at the single-cell level. To fill this gap, mass spectrometry
(MS)-based profiling of protein expression in single cells has recently been demonstrated through the
implementation of more efficient sample processing workflows, novel experimental designs and improved
instrument sensitivity. Label-free MS-based proteomics can now quantify >3,000 protein groups per cell across
>4 orders of magnitude of dynamic range. Here we propose to apply mass spectrometry to study biomolecular
expression at the single-cell level beyond the global proteome. We will develop global and targeted approaches
to profile posttranslational modifications in single cells, beginning with phosphorylation. We will also extend
nanoflow liquid chromatography-MS capabilities for in-depth single-cell lipid profiling. Ultimately, we will develop
novel means of generating complex LC gradients that utilize more than two mobile phases to efficiently profile
multiple classes of biomolecules (e.g., proteome and lipidome) from the same single cell. These research
directions will, in combination with mature nucleic acid sequencing strategies, provide an unprecedented view of
cellular regulation from genotype to phenotype at the single-cell level."
10836940,"Vaccination is one of the most effective tools to control the spread of infections and reduce child mortality,
however the WHO estimates 1.5 million children under 5 years old die each year from vaccine preventable
illnesses. Vaccine efficacy may be reduced by host immune modulating factors that impair optimal immune
responses, including exposure to HIV, infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV), and other factors related to
maternal or infant infections and inflammation. Regions with high prevalence of HIV, poverty, and malnutrition
also often have sub-optimal vaccine coverage. Together, these factors put large populations of infants and young
children at risk for preventable deaths. Several studies have reported deficits in antibody responses to routine
childhood vaccines in HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) compared to HIV-unexposed (HUU) children, but few
studies have looked at cellular vaccine responses in HEU. There is also evidence that infection with CMV, which
elicits profound immune activation and inflammation following infection, impacts vaccine responses, but results
are not conclusive. Thus, substantial gaps remain in our understanding how exposure to maternal HIV infection
and infant infection with CMV may impact humoral and cellular vaccine immune responses. Our overarching
hypothesis is that early-life exposure to immune modulating infections, specifically HIV and CMV, may affect
immune responses to vaccines given during infancy as well as to vaccines first administered in middle childhood.
We will extend follow-up of an existing birth cohort of HEU and HUU Kenyan children previously followed from
pregnancy to 4 years postpartum with longitudinal collection of specimens and clinical data, including vaccine
records. We will determine the effect of HIV exposure and/or early CMV acquisition on humoral and cellular
responses to infant vaccines from birth through 4 years of age (Aim 1), and on humoral and cellular responses
to influenza vaccination in middle childhood at 6 years (Aim 2). Data from our existing project
(virome/microbiome, enteric enteropathy, growth, child and maternal in utero inflammation, infections) will be
assessed as modulators of vaccine-induced immunity in HEU and HUU children from infancy through
toddlerhood, early and middle childhood (Aim 3). The proposed studies offer an unprecedented opportunity to
understand how HIV, CMV, malnutrition and inflammation alter early life and long-term immune reactivity in
African children. Results from this study have great potential to inform novel vaccination strategies and
interventions for children in areas of high HIV prevalence, CMV and malnutrition."
10838511,"Project Summary
The goal of this project is to better understand the regulation and function of RNA derived from
retrotransposable elements (RTEs) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with a focus on
double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). RTEs occupy roughly 40% of the human genome. They
constitute a major subgroup of transposons, defined as genomic sequences that mobilize using
a ‘copy-and-paste’ mechanism where an RNA intermediate is involved. To date, most RTEs
have lost the ability to mobilize to new locations, at least in normal physiological conditions.
However, these elements may still retain regulatory activities through expression of RTE-derived
RNAs. This functional aspect is particularly relevant in the human brain, where RTE expression
is highest compared to other tissues. Given the multi-copy nature of each family of RTEs, their
transcripts often form dsRNA structures, resulted from repetitive sequence content, bi-directional
transcription or natural sense-antisense transcript pairs. Numerous studies have shown that
aberrant expression of cellular dsRNAs is related to the pathogenesis of various human
diseases. Recently, increasing evidence supports the existence of enhanced RNA expression
from RTEs in neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. This expression leads to accumulation
of dsRNAs in neurons, which is correlated with, for example, loss of nuclear TDP-43 or burden of
tau tangles. As a result of dsRNA accumulation, type I IFN response may be elicited in neurons,
which may contribute to AD pathogenesis. In this project, we aim to determine the identity and
origin of AD-relevant dsRNAs derived from RTEs and experimentally validate their functional
relevance in neurons. In addition, we will examine the impact of RNA-binding proteins (including
ADAR1) on RTE-derived dsRNAs and their functional relevance to AD. This work will allow a
previously unattained level of understanding of the regulation and function of RTE-derived
dsRNAs in AD and provide new insights to better understand RTE-related disease mechanisms."

10838516,"Project Summary
Led by a multi-PI team of a cell biologist and a biophysicist, this project is a renewal of our
investigation into the cellular detection of and responses to wounds. For our model system, we
use the Drosophila pupal notum, a diploid epithelial monolayer, and we wound it by laser
ablation. Although the tissue is diploid, the region at and near the wound margin is dominated
by giant syncytial cells. The origin, function, and fate of these syncytial cells are all unknown.
Using live imaging, we have found that the giant syncytia are formed via cell-cell fusion of
multiple diploid cells. These fusions occur within ~20 minutes of wounding and the resulting
syncytial cells migrate more quickly and close wounds faster than diploid cells. By the end of
tissue repair, most of these giant syncytia are eliminated from the epithelium. Interestingly, we
have found that the amount of cell fusion and syncytia formation depends on the mode of
wounding. We will compare wound healing behaviors in wounds that lack syncytia and those
that have syncytia to investigate how these giant cells increase the rate of wound closure (Aim
1). In Aim 2, we will investigate how wounds induce mononuclear diploid cells to fuse into
syncytia. In Aim 3, we will analyze the long-term fate of these syncytia, which appear to die by
apoptosis and extrusion as wound closure is ending. Syncytial and polyploid cells have been
observed in other organisms and tissues in response to wounds, but our system is the first to
make a detailed analysis of their formation, contribution, and elimination possible using live
imaging.
Cells involved in wound-healing generally share behaviors with tumor cells, and the wound-
induced giant syncytial cells may represent the wound equivalent of Giant Polyploid Cancer
Cells, a syncytial cell type found in many cancers. Giant Polyploid Cancer Cells are malignant,
resistant to all therapies, and appear to be a major source of tumor cells fueling metastasis and
relapse. We expect that our studies into the adaptive functions of wound-induced syncytia will
be important for understanding the biology, origin, and potential therapies for maladaptive Giant
Polyploid Cancer Cells."
10828093,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Histiocytic disorders, or histiocytoses, are a family of rare hematologic diseases encompassing the histiocytic
neoplasms (including Langerhans cell histiocytosis, Erdheim-Chester disease, and Rosai-Dorfman disease) and
the hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) disorders. Histiocytosis affects both adults and children, and
clinical disease is mediated by accumulation of macrophage, dendritic cell, or monocyte-derived cells in
affected tissues. These are orphan diseases with an aggregated prevalence of fewer than 10,000 patients in the
US. Despite important recent advances in histiocytic disorders, key knowledge gaps remain owing to their rarity
and to the absence of collaboratively executed investigation across adults and children and across the disease
subtypes. Specifically, there is a lack of unified approach to observational and natural history studies, as well as
a coordinated approach to the prioritization and implementation of therapeutic trials. Additionally, there is an
urgent need to engage the community of stakeholders in histiocytosis investigation in order to elevate its
patient-centeredness and ensure that research is responsive to the community’s needs. Last, there is a
pressing need for the histiocytosis scientific community to appraise its own composition and to take a deliberate,
inclusive approach towards incorporating diverse perspectives into the vision and execution of future research.
The proposed Histiocytosis Disorders Workshop (HDW) represents an unprecedented gathering of senior and
junior scientists—across adult and pediatric diseases, HLH and histiocytic neoplasms—eager to align priorities
and approaches to research in these diseases. The two-day event will include approximately 50 in-person
diverse attendees including histiocytosis scholars, patients and stakeholders, experts in (a) patient engagement
and patient-reported outcomes, (b) diversity and inclusion, (c) junior career development, and representatives
from NIH, FDA, and PCORI. The workshop will include lectures, moderated panels, and breakout sessions on
the topics of observational studies, therapeutic trials, biomarkers and response assessment, patient reported
outcomes, community engagement, faculty development and inclusiveness, and diversity and inclusion. The
event will be advertised by social media and email to scientific societies and patient and community groups with
emphasis upon inclusion of junior investigators and attendees from diverse communities.
The HDW is timely in (1) its integration of the most current and advanced science related to histiocytosis and (2)
its leveraging the North American Consortium for Histiocytosis (NACHO), a mature and operational consortium
for pediatric histiocytosis to host and implement the meeting. The workshop will be useful to the scientific
community by defining (1) key data elements for observational studies, (2) strategies for prioritizing and
implementing therapeutic trials and (3) strategies for meaningful community engagement to elevate patient-
centeredness of research and care. We propose that this singular gathering will ignite, nurture, and catalyze
partnerships in histiocytosis research, as well as reorient and direct the science of this field."

The objectives of the 2024 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) “Lymphatics” are to present state-of-the-art
research on the lymphatic vascular system, to fuel scientific exchange across race and expertise, and to
spearhead new ideas and collaborations. The meeting will bring together investigators in all racial backgrounds
and from all career stages converging on lymphatics as one common theme. Specific Aims are (1) To present
conceptual advances in research of the lymphatic vascular system and its pathologies; (2) To discuss paradigm
shifting findings of lymphatics in different organ systems and their contribution to disease; (3) To integrate
knowledge from different disciplines; and (4) To nurture underrepresented, low-income, disabled, women
scientists and junior investigators. Sessions will cover conceptual advances in development and disease of
lymphatic vessels from basic aspects to potential clinical application. The meeting will in particular, highlight
recent insights into the diversity and organ-specificity of lymphatic endothelium. Novel molecular regulators for
lymphatic vasculature during bone development, Schlemm’s canal in the eye and lacteals in the intestine will be
discussed. New factors for regulating lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic integrity will be introduced. Advances
in research of lymphatic malformations, lymphedema and other congenital lymphatic diseases will be discussed.
Meeting will also present emerging concepts on the role of lymphatics in atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction,
and congestive heart failure. Paradigm shifts in the field will be presented, crosstalk between lymphatics and
immune system discussed. Advances in understanding how lymphatics contribute to disease, including
cardiovascular inflammation, cancer, autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases will be highlighted. A main
goal for this meeting is to serve as a platform to promote diversity, inclusivity and equality. Abundant opportunities
for the presentation of research by underrepresented minorities and early career investigators will be provided.
Gordon Research Seminar on Lymphatics organized by junior investigators solely provides additional
opportunities for junior investigators to present their work and form collaborations. Aside from presentation and
poster sessions, a career development session will be held during Gordon Research Seminar. A “Power Hour”
to discuss racial and gender biases and burdens placed on URM in science along with a patient session to allow
researchers to learn from patients and a special session hosting NIH official to educate us about NIH’s initiatives
and efforts to support lymphatic research will be held. The sponsoring organization GRC is dedicated to
advancing the frontiers of scientific research. In accordance with its mission, this conference will place an
emphasis on the presentation of unpublished data, high quality science and rich discussions in many fields such
as cardiovascular disease, cancer, immunology, metabolism and neurobiology. We anticipate that URM and
junior investigators will rise up as future leaders so future of lymphatic research will be flourished with diversity."
10828261,"ABSTRACT
Population aging suggests the need for a diverse workforce of community advocates, academic scholars, health care
providers, and other professionals with training in gerontology/geriatric medicine or a related discipline. Established in the
early 19th century, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) were created to educate Black students when they
were not allowed to attend certain public and/or private predominately white institutions. With increasing enrollment,
HBCUs are now being recognized for their progressive academic presence in the Black community educating distinguished
scientists, inventors, politicians, and world leaders. These institutions have similarly become increasingly integrated into
the aging network by educating (undergraduate/graduate) some of the most influential Black gerontologists and geriatric
practitioners. Despite the role of HBCUs in educating and preparing established and emerging scientists, there remains
limited professional development opportunities, a lack of scholarly resources, and inadequate mentoring and networking
supports for HBCU scientists by established (Black) gerontologists. To address these issues, the Gerontological Society of
America’s (GSA) HBCU Collaborative Interest Group and Black in Gerontology and Geriatrics (BIGG) will collaborate to
organize and host conferences for emerging and early career scientists from HBCUs. The aims of the HBCU aging
conference series are to: host five multidisciplinary annual conferences; address knowledge gaps and identify future
priorities in gerontology related to minority/Black aging; prepare scientists for leadership positions/roles in gerontology;
facilitate professional development, mentoring, and networking opportunities within and between HBCUs, and other
community-based and academic institutions; and sponsor a select number of emerging and early career scientists from
HBCUs to attend and participate in the annual conference through the HBCU Aging Ambassadors Program (HAAP). Each
conference will be an interactive two-day pre-conference workshop during the GSA’s annual scientific meeting. All
attendees will be engaged with panel discussions, professional development breakout sessions, and facilitated mentoring
and networking opportunities. This conference series will serve as an essential hub for knowledge transfer and exchange,
professional skills and practice improvement, sustainable best practices in gerontology, proficiency in established
competencies, and transformation in the quality of aging scholarship. The novelty of these conferences is that, to our
knowledge, it is the first to focus exclusively on scientists engaged in gerontology or a related discipline from HBCUs, and
it aligns with NIH’s mission to diversify the scientific workforce, while engaging minority serving institutions (e.g.,
HBCUs) in research and addressing racial inequities across the biomedical research establishments."
10828793,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We study formation of upper gastrointestinal premalignant lesions, as well as their progression to neoplasia. A
key premalignant lesion in gastric cancer, pseudopyloric or Spasmolytic Polypeptide Expressing Metaplasia
(SPEM), occurs when chronic inflammation (usually via the bacterium Helicobacter pylori) leads to death
(atrophy) of acid-secreting parietal cells and a change in differentiation pattern of the other key gastric gland
lineage, the zymogenic chief cell (ZC). We and others have shown that ZCs in SPEM become proliferative and
metaplastic. They do so via a sequence of molecular-cellular events that is conserved across many tissues
and species in scenarios where mature cells are recruited back into the cell cycle in response to tissue
damage. Thus, ZCs undergoing metaplasia undergo an evolutionarily conserved program, termed paligenosis.
In paligenosis ZCs: first degrade/recycle their differentiated cell specialized components (Stage 1), then induce
expression of more progenitor-like genes (eg. Sox9 = Stage 2), and ultimately re-enter the cell cycle (Stage 3).
Metaplasia can resolve as tissue is repaired or become chronic and increase risk for progression to dysplasia
and cancer. We have shown that paligenosis is governed by dynamic changes in mTORC1, the key cellular
translational control complex. mTORC1 is elevated at baseline in ZCs to drive production of digestive
enzymes; it shuts off at Stage 1 and reactivates at Stage 3. Without mTORC1, paligenosis stops at Stage 2
with cells looking metaplastic but unable to enter the S-phase.
 Here, we explore the mechanisms underlying progression through paligenosis. Our overarching
hypothesis is that paligenosis is a licensing procedure to ensure that old cells, which may have accumulated
mutations and have damaged organelles, undergo a strict error-checking protocol before being allowed to
reenter the cell cycle. Errors in paligenosis may lead to tumors as cells with mutations may inappropriately
proliferate. In the current proposal, we focus on mechanisms regulating Stage 1 and Stage 3 and determine
effects on tumorigenesis with correlation to humans. We undertake these studies with our long-standing
collaborators at China Medical University in Shenyang, China. They provide vast tissue databanks of normal,
metaplastic, and cancerous stomach tissue with accompanying clinical data. And they have established
pipelines for sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. Our Aims are: 1) to determine effects of cells either being
stuck or skipping Stage 1; 2) to elucidate the effects of altering the p53-mTORC1 hub that determines Stage 3;
and 3) to translate our findings towards human relevance using long-term tumorigenesis models with mouse
mutants in cycles of paligenosis as well as correlation in mouse/human ex vivo organoids and in tissue
microarrays of ~1000 human patients.
 Together, our combined US-China teams will bring resources and expertise to bear on a global,
understudied health problem with particularly high prevalence in Northeastern China: gastric cancer."
10928740,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The increase of obesity and diabetes in the US is associated with the highly palatable sugar content of the
western diet. The sweet taste receptor (T1R2+T1R3) is historically known to be the primary detector of sugars
and non-caloric sweeteners. However, recent investigations from my mentor demonstrated that mice with genetic
deletion of T1R2+T1R3 (or its downstream signaling mechanisms, TRPM5) still prefer the taste of glucose
and/maltose, suggesting the involvement of other orosensory receptors. The Schier lab recently identified a
glucose sensor in taste bud cells, glucokinase (GCK), that is upregulated with sugar exposure and is required to
rapidly detect and develop preference for glucose over fructose in sweet-sensitive mice. However, GCK does
not directly engage with maltose. Therefore I hypothesized that the α-glucosidase, maltase glucoamylase
(MGAM) generates free glucose ligands that activate nearby sweet receptors and/or GCK-linked sensors to drive
licking for maltose. My preliminary findings show that MGAM is upregulated in response to sugar exposure and
that virogenetic knockdown of either MGAM or GCK reduces the hedonic appeal of maltose in sweet-sensitive
mice. In this proposal, I aim to enhance this research by determining if MGAM- and GCK-linked behaviors
depend on TRPM5-mediated taste transduction (Aim 1). With additional training in fiber photometry, I further aim
to understand how the taste signals generated by metabolically distinct sugars recruit the mesolimbic
dopaminergic reward system to guide ingestive decisions (Aim 2). The overarching goal of these studies is to
understand and link glucosensing mechanisms to the central gustatory reward axis."
10829352,"PROJECT SUMMARY
African Americans (AAs) are disproportionately burdened by diabetes mellitus (DM) with rates twice as high as
Whites (13% vs 7.5%), and increased rates of DM-related complications and comorbidities (e.g. amputations,
cardiovascular disease). A key pre-DM risk factor is overweight/obesity. Nearly 70% of AAs are overweight or
obese, with higher rates among AAs with low-income. A critical component of national efforts to reduce
growing obesity rates and prevent DM is the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a lifestyle intervention
proven to reduce or delay DM onset with diet change, exercise, and modest weight loss (5-7%) in a rigorously
evaluated national trial. A group-based version of the DPP has been widely disseminated and numerous
community-based trials support its efficacy. In spite of these successes, there are significant health disparities
in DPP attendance and outcomes and considerable room exists for improving success rates among AAs, a
population that tends to experience half the amount of DPP weight loss compared to Whites. We aim to build
on our promising pilot studies by tailoring the DPP via a social determinants (SD) of health lens to achieve
optimal DPP attendance and clinically meaningful weight loss with pre-DM AAs. This includes tailoring on
cultural and socioeconomic SD mechanisms that are associated with improving health outcomes and align with
predisposing needs among AAs who are primarily of low-income and live in low-resource AA communities.
We propose a randomized controlled trial of 360 pre-DM AA patients from a safety net hospital (SNH) to test a
standard DPP (S-DPP) against a culturally tailored DPP (TC-DPP; e.g., tailoring of language, foods, values,
religiosity, norms, values) alone and a culturally tailored DPP enhanced to address access and support related
economic barriers (TCE-DPP; hybrid group/online/text DPP; community health worker support to improve
access to DPP classes, healthy food, exercise, and other community and health resources; and financial
incentives) over 12 months. We will: 1) examine effects of TC-DPP and TCE-DDP on percent weight loss and
attendance (primary outcomes) and on secondary outcomes (physical activity, completion of physician follow-
up visit, hbA1c, and blood pressure) at 6 and 12 months with SNH AAs, 2) evaluate potential mediators/
moderators related to weight loss and attendance among AA SNH patients at 6 and 12 months to determine
modifiable facilitators and barriers, and 3) conduct a process evaluation to examine TCE-DPP acceptability,
feasibility, and fidelity, and relationships between delivery dose, exposure, costs, and outcomes to identify and
improve essential intervention components. Our multidimensional DPP interventions are guided by our past
pilots, and based on components that, all together, were used to help drive clinically important outcomes in the
original DPP trial – and are certainly needed to achieve similar outcomes with AA primarily of low-income. To
our knowledge this is the first study to test multidimensional tailoring via an SD lens to truly impact DPP
attendance and outcomes, and has potential to be a feasible, scalable model to reduce DM disparities among
at-risk AA."
10829457,"As terminologies change and are used over time by different entities, there can develop
changes and divergence in what the use of a single code or a set of codes represent. These
can range from adding a new, more special meaning, to a code set (e.g., adding another
possibility to codes whose meaning was first listed as a NEC (not elsewhere classified) code, to
a major version change (as in the transition from ICD-9CM to ICD-10CM), and to local adaption
(e.g. using a more general code to indicate a more specific condition by an institution.) Such
altering of the semantics of codes presents a challenge that can be termed representational
semantic integrity (RS integrity). If multiple codes or multiple combinations of codes can
represent the same phenotype, cohort identification or cohort variable assignment based on
the codes becomes problematic. As numerous research projects utilize large electronic health
record (EHR) datasets containing standardized terminology codes, violations of RS integrity
would be expected to propagate errors in subsequent analyses and findings. The proposed
project seeks to address the question: How to assess and improve RS integrity in
longitudinal and heterogenous EHR data using automated methods? We propose to
develop novel data driven methods to analyze the temporal pattern and the context of
EHR variables. Using ICD-9CM, ICD-10CM, CPT and SNOMED codes as our use cases, this
study will leverage very large, longitudinal, heterogenous datasets: the Clinical Data Warehouse
of the Veteran Administration (VA)’s national EHR system, the Cerner Real World Data (RWD)
and the EHR data repository from a large medical center at University of Alabama at
Birmingham (UAB). Our aims are: 1) Develop data-driven approaches to assess RS
integrity in longitudinal EHR data. We will develop statistical and deep learning models to
perform multivariate time-series analysis for the purpose of detecting aberrant signals in codes
in EHR records; 2) Develop data-driven approaches to improve RS integrity in longitudinal
EHR data. We will analyze the contexts of codes over time and across data sources using
embedding techniques and develop a semantic matching tool that generates semantic
equivalent clusters for data from different time periods and facilities; and 3) Validate the
assessment and improvement approaches on different coding sets and data sources. We
will also assess the impact on predicative modeling."
10829408,"Communication between nerve cells takes place by the release of neurotransmitters at synapses.
Signaling can be extremely rapid – transmitting information via hundreds of action potentials per second.
It is not possible to synthesize new synaptic vesicles at this pace, so rapid recycling is essential.
Although endocytosis at the synapse is at the core of synaptic transmission, the debate about the
mechanism has continued for over 40 years without resolution. We recently discovered that synaptic
vesicle endocytosis at synapses in the nematode C. elegans and mouse hippocampal neurons occurs as
rapidly as 30-50 ms rather than 30 seconds, as determined previously. Our preliminary results suggest
that this process requires synaptotagmin and interacting adaptors.
Aim 1. Synaptotagmin. We will determine if ultrafast endocytosis and vesicle budding is defective in the
 absence of synaptotagmin in C. elegans.
Aim 2. Adaptors. Synaptotagmin interacts with two mu-homology domain proteins: stonin and AP2- µ2.
 We will determine if ultrafast endocytosis is defective in stonin mutants and vesicle regeneration is
 defective in AP2 mutants. We will also determine whether these proteins are localized to endocytic
 domains at the synapse.
Aim 3. Cargo. We will determine if synaptic vesicle components synaptotagmin and synaptobrevin are
 enriched at endocytic sites before stimulation and whether they are recovered by ultrafast endocytosis
 in rat hippocampal neuron cultures.
 There is growing evidence that understanding synaptic vesicle endocytosis will have direct impact on
applied health research, since mutations in endocytosis play causative roles in Parkinson's Disease and
contribute to Alzheimer's Disease. It is our hope that understanding the process of endocytosis may lead
to drug therapies for these diseases in the future. Finally, we are developing innovative new techniques
that will aid other researchers by bringing new weapons to bear on these and other problems."

As a chronic neuropsychiatric disease, addiction is associated with specific molecular and functional
neuronal plasticity changes that are triggered by repeated drug exposure leading to persistent changes in
neuronal function and ultimately behavior. One powerful mechanism that may underlie aspects of this
persistence is epigenetics. Epigenetics (i.e. modulation of gene expression that occurs through altered
chromatin structure without fundamental changes to the DNA sequence itself) has been shown to establish
stable changes in cell function. These stable changes in cell function can give rise to remarkable changes at
many levels of observation (e.g. neuronal plasticity, behavior). Currently, we still know very little about the
epigenetic mechanisms that could establish the persistence characteristic of drug-seeking behavior and
whether such mechanisms may also be involved in reinstatement, or other relapse-like behaviors. This
proposal is focused on examining the molecular and cellular mechanisms that may be involved in
reinstatement. More specifically, we will focus on the role of the medial habenula (MHb) in cocaine-induced
reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior. Most studies investigating the MHb have focused on nicotine
seeking due to the high concentration of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors found throughout the medial
habenula-interpeduncular nucleus pathway. Recent studies have begun to implicate the MHb in cocaine-
associated behaviors, yet the role of the MHb in regulating reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior
remains largely unknown. In fact, the MHb is rarely included in reward circuitry diagrams. Our recent
findings demonstrate that the MHb is engaged by cocaine-primed reinstatement and the activity of choline
acetyltransferase (ChAT) expressing neurons in the MHb is sufficient to drive reinstatement (Lopez et al.,
2018). These results suggest that the MHb is a powerful regulator of relapse-like behaviors, which has
important implications for understanding the reward pathways in the brain related to relapse. We will also
examine the role of a histone deacetylase, called HDAC3, and a key HDAC3 target gene, called Nr4a2, in
MHb-dependent reinstatement of drug-seeking. HDAC3 is a key negative regulator of memory formation
and associative plasticity, which functions by repressing the expression of Nr4a2. NR4A2 is a transcription
factor that regulates aspects of dopamine signaling during development. Both HDAC3 and NR4A2 are
highly expressed in the MHb within ChAT expressing neurons, indicating these important regulators of
memory processes have a central role in behaviors associated with MHb-dependent reinstatement. In this
proposal, we will test the central hypothesis that the MHb is a key regulator of reinstatement of cocaine-
seeking behavior, and does so in an HDAC3/NR4A2-dependent manner. Successful completion of these
studies will demonstrate the key nature of the MHb in reinstatement, identify the physiological processes in
the MHb responding to cocaine, and identify key epigenetic regulators of MHb function."

B-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (B-ALL) is a neoplasm of B-cell lymphoid precursors that typically affects
children, but occurs in adults as well. While intensive multi-agent chemotherapy is highly effective in the
pediatric population, outcomes remain poor in adults and high-risk patients. The recent introduction of
blinatumomab and CD19-directed CAR T therapy has transformed the care of patients with relapsed and
refractory (r/r) B-ALL. However, an increasing number of reports describe a high rate of post-treatment relapse
due to acquired resistance to these immunotherapies, notably via down-regulation or loss of CD19 surface
expression. CAR T cells that were recently developed against another target, CD22, showed similar
shortcomings with relapses associated with diminished antigen expression. The search for alternative targets
is therefore essential to overcoming antigen escape. To address this issue, we have developed CAR T cells
against a new B-ALL target, the B-cell activating factor receptor (BAFF-R). BAFF-R is a marker of B cells that
is also functionally expressed in B-ALL, including in patients with CD19-negative relapse. Although one of
BAFF-R’s ligands (BAFF) has been successfully targeted for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, we are
the first to have developed BAFF-R CAR T cells that are effective against B-cell malignancies in vivo, including
in CD19-negative mouse models. Because BAFF-R is a critical regulator of B-cell function and survival, we can
expect that the tumor’s ability to escape therapy by down-regulation of BAFF-R will be limited. While we
anticipate clinical efficacy of BAFF-R CAR T cell therapy, dual targeting of CD19 and BAFF-R can prevent the
emergence of resistance and improve clinical outcomes. Therefore, we are also developing bispecific CD19-
BAFF-R CAR T cells that we aim to rapidly translate from the bench to the bedside. In Specific Aim 1, we will
evaluate BAFF-R CAR T cell therapy in a first-in-human clinical trial in patients with r/r B-ALL who are ineligible
for or have failed prior CD19-directed therapy. The trial, currently open at City of Hope, will use our TN/MEM-
derived manufacturing platform, which yields a naïve/memory T-cell enriched T cell product and has shown
remarkable efficacy and tolerability in B-ALL. We will conduct extensive correlative studies using cutting-edge
technologies, such as assessing the kinetics of the CAR T cells and that of diverse cytokines, therapeutic
effect, and potential mechanisms of relapse and antigen escape. In Specific Aim 2, we will establish the
therapeutic efficacy of bispecific CD19-BAFF-R CAR T cells against mixed (CD19-negative + BAFF-R-
negative) B-ALL tumor models that mimic the heterogenous tumor phenotype leading to resistance. We will
also perform extensive testing of cGMP-grade bispecific CD19-BAFF-R CAR T cells that is required prior to
submission of an IND application to the FDA. Our proposal addresses the urgent need for new therapeutic
options in patients with r/r B-ALL and could also benefit patients with other B-cell malignancies."
10829432,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chromatin can be characterized by proximity to membraneless nuclear compartments such as the lamina,
which is associated with repressive heterochromatin, or speckles, which facilitate mRNA splicing. Many
genomic regions spanning tens to hundreds of kilobases interact with these nuclear compartments. This level
of genome organization is regulated and provides a 3-dimensional (3D) architecture for transcriptional
regulation. Nuclear compartment-associated genome organization in post-mitotic, mature neurons is not
known, and emerging evidence indicate that nuclear compartments are grossly perturbed in a wide range of
neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recently, a new technique called Genome
Organization with Cut and Run Technology (GO-CaRT) was developed to identify chromatin domains in
proximity to specific nuclear compartments – the nuclear lamina (lamina associated domains, LADs), and
nuclear speckles (speckle associated domains, SPADs) – in cells isolated from mouse and human brain. In
human neural precursor cells, SPADs are enriched for genes involved in microtubule-based movement,
suggesting that speckles regulate ongoing key cellular processes. In other Preliminary Studies, SPADs were
found to be highly enriched for known AD risk loci. Tauopathies are progressive, neurodegenerative diseases
defined by insoluble tau aggregates in the brain. Multiple studies have demonstrated that key speckle proteins
become mislocalized to aggregates of pathogenic tau, severely disrupting the structure of nuclear speckles.
Based on this scientific background and Preliminary Studies, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that the
mislocalization of speckle proteins to tau aggregates in tauopathies leads to loss of speckle-association of key
neuronal genes, which results in defects in their transcription and splicing. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will
elucidate the maturation of genome organization in healthy, post-mitotic cortical neurons in the mouse using
GO-CaRT and related epigenomic and transcriptomic methods. Aim 2 will then investigate effect of tau
aggregates on genome architecture, using established animal models of pathogenic tau expression.
Successful completion of these Aims will elucidate the relationship between gene regulation and nuclear
compartment-associated genome organization in neurons in vivo. Results will also provide insights into how
disruption of nuclear compartments in tauopathies can contribute to aberrant gene expression and splicing,
potentially generating new models of the pathogenesis of tauopathies such as AD. From a training
perspective, this proposal compliments the applicant’s past experience with bioinformatics/computational
biology with training in “wet lab” molecular biology and animal models of human neurological disease.
Providing training in these aspects of experimental biology will be invaluable to the applicant’s career interests
in neurology and neurodegenerative disorders."

Mucus and macrophages protect the lungs in health, but they can also contribute to disease following lung
injury. How their protective vs. pathological functions are calibrated is poorly understood. We seek to
determine mechanisms that control their interactions during responses to lung injury. For mucus-mediated
defense, the mucin glycoprotein MUC5B is essential. In mice, absence of Muc5b causes particles and
bacteria to accumulate in the lungs, ultimately resulting in early mortality. Despite its requirement for health,
MUC5B is an important risk factor in human pulmonary fibrosis, where it is misexpressed in bronchiolar club
cells and type 2 alveolar epithelia. Overexpression of Muc5b in these cell types in mice potentiates fibrosis
following bleomycin-induced lung injury. These data suggest that the levels and locations of MUC5B/Muc5b-
expression are significant factors in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. Nonetheless, we do not yet fully
understand cellular and molecular mechanisms that explain how MUC5B/Muc5b promotes lung fibrosis. Our
recent work suggests that defensive and pathologic effects of airway mucus are regulated by interactions
between Muc5b and airspace macrophages (AMs). Resident AMs are present constitutively and are required
for non-inflammatory defense. In response to injury, AM pools increase through recruitment of blood
monocytes that mature into macrophages. These recruited AMs are more inflammatory than resident AMs, but
they are also short-lived, resulting in transient expansion and then contraction of the AM pools. Mechanisms of
acute and resolving inflammation that distinguish resident and recruited AM types also impinge on fibrotic
repair. The presence of both MUC5B/Muc5b and AMs in distal airspaces, along with our prior observation of
AM dysfunction in Muc5b knockout mice, implicate a connection between MUC5B/Muc5b and AM functions.
We identified a potential mechanism mediated by mucin glycans and AM glycan receptors. MUC5B/Muc5b is
heavily coated with sialic acid (SA) that is attached to galactose via an α2,3-linkage. It is also a ligand for sialic
acid binding immunoglobulin like lectin-F (Siglec-F), an inhibitory signaling molecule found almost exclusively
on AMs in healthy lungs. We found that a Muc5b-SA-Siglec-F axis is critical for resolving inflammation, as
shown by prolonged recruited AM accumulation in mice lacking each component. We now also show that
bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis is suppressed in Muc5b-SA-Siglec-F axis disrupted mice. Thus, while
protective in response to bacterial inflammation, this mechanism appears to be detrimental in a pro-fibrotic
injury setting. We hypothesize that fibrotic repair of lung tissues is mediated by a Muc5b-SA-Siglec-F
dependent AM programming mechanism. This will be tested in three aims that test whether 1) promotion of
lung fibrosis by Muc5b requires α2,3-sialylation; 2) ligation of Siglec-F by sialylated Muc5b mediates fibrosis;
and 3) the Muc5b-SA-Siglec-F axis regulates fibrotic programming of resident vs. recruited AMs."

Environmental mold (fungal) exposure has long been recognized as a critical risk factor for asthma and asthma
exacerbation. The prevalence of fungal sensitization can be up to 48% in asthmatics and fungal asthma is
oftentimes poorly managed with frequent exacerbations and hospitalizations. Efforts to reduce indoor fungal
exposure by cleaning have been proven impossible in the recent HEAL study. However, an average person
exposing to a large number of fungal spores each day, up to 50,000 spores per cubic meter of air during the
fungal season, has no detectable respiratory abnormality and not all individuals with fungal sensitization
develop asthma. Thus, it is significant to understand the mechanistic basis of this resilience to maintain airway
homeostasis despite the impact of abundant asthmagenic substances produced by fungi. Interestingly, IFN
signatures were discovered in the fungal asthma model using live Alternaria spores. Epithelial cells were found
to sense fungal spores by triggering IFN-I/III production as well as their downstream signaling cascades. IFN-I
receptor blockade or deficiency augmented asthmatic phenotypes, suggesting a protective role of IFN-I against
asthma. Thus, our overall hypothesis is that fungal spore sensing activates protective IFN-I/III pathway and the
impairment of this protection leads to asthma. To test this hypothesis, we will elucidate the protective function
of IFN-I/III in the fungal asthma model using a set of knockout mice. Then, we will determine the mechanistic
basis of fungal detection and innate defense. Finally yet importantly, we will examine IFN signatures in clinical
samples from human asthma with or without fungal sensitization by utilizing datasets and samples from a NIH-
supported Asthma Research Program. The completion of this proposal will advance our knowledge about the
pathogenesis of fungal asthma, and establish a foundation for the further therapeutic development to treat this
type of asthma."
10829892,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the USA. An estimated 53,200
people will die from CRC in 2020. Another disturbing fact is that the rates of incidence and mortality from young
adults have been increasing since the 1990s for unknown reasons. The mortality of CRC patients is mainly
attributed to tumor metastasis, a complex, multistep process. This proposal aims to uncover the underlying
mechanisms that control CRC metastasis and the key pathways and environmental factors that contribute to it.
One possible factor is sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), the consumption of which has dramatically increased
in the past four decades. SSBs are any liquids that are sweetened with refined sugars, such as sucrose and
high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), both of which consist of glucose and fructose in a ratio of approximately 1:1.
More than half of the adults in the USA consume SSBs on a given day. Epidemiological studies have shown a
positive correlation between SSBs consumption and the recurrence of and mortality from advanced-stage CRC.
However, it is still unclear whether SSB consumption can directly affect metastasis on advanced-stage CRC and,
therefore mortality, independently of obesity. This question is critical because certain CRC patients regularly
consume SSBs. Moreover, oncologists and nutritionists in the US recommend that their CRC patients drink
energy drinks and concentrated juices—which are, in fact, SSBs with high amounts of added sugar—because
these SSBs also contain calories, protein, and/or micronutrients. Our preliminary data show that a medium
containing both glucose and fructose (hereafter, the HFCS condition) increased the migration and invasion of
CRC cell lines (hereafter, CRC motility), which was correlated with an increased level of sorbitol. The deletion of
a NAD(H)-dependent sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD) decreased CRC motility and sorbitol level in the HFCS
condition. Our xenograft mice models also showed that HFCS treatment increased CRC metastasis (local
invasion and liver metastasis), and SORD was necessary for the metastasis. Notably, the loss of SORD also
inhibited CRC motility in the high-glucose condition, in which glucose converts to fructose via the polyol pathway.
It is known that chronic consumption of SSBs causes a high concentration of glucose in the blood. Thus, we
hypothesize that SORD plays a key role in accelerating CRC metastasis by interacting with sugars. We propose
three aims: Aim 1: Determine how SORD accelerates CRC motility in the HFCS condition. Aim 2: Determine
how SORD increases CRC motility in the high-glucose condition. Aim 3: Understand the role of SORD in CRC
metastasis. Successful completion of these proposed studies will characterize SORD as a novel therapeutic
target for CRC metastasis. Further, our results will identify metabolic pathways and metabolites that may serve
as new biomarkers or targets for preventing CRC metastasis. Finally, our study will highlight the danger of HFCS
consumption, especially in the form of SSBs, which may accelerate CRC metastasis. This will change current
clinical practices and dietary guidelines for CRC patients, significantly reducing CRC mortality."

The primary aim of the current R01 application is to examine the efficacy and maintenance of a home-based
preventive intervention to decrease behavior problems in infants from high-risk families. Behavior problems are
exceedingly common in early childhood and are associated with high impairment and a long-term negative
trajectory for negative outcomes. Despite the empirical evidence supporting the use of clinic-based parent-
training treatments for early behavior problems, children from economically disadvantaged and
underrepresented minority families, who are at considerably higher risk for behavior problems, have higher
treatment dropout rates and poorer outcomes when completing treatment. We propose instead to intervene
during infancy, which would likely require less intensive and shorter interventions, thereby decreasing the
burden for high-risk families. Extending promising findings from pilot testing of a home-based intervention
targeting changes in parenting behavior (K23 MH085659: PI, Bagner), we propose to conduct an adequately
powered randomized controlled trial (n = 288) to demonstrate its efficacy and maintenance in reducing
behavior problems and increasing infant regulation relative to an enhanced pediatric primary care active
control condition. Based on work by the current investigative team and others, we also will examine the
mediating role of changes in parenting behavior and the moderating role of parental distress on intervention
outcome. Rather than focus exclusively on whether the effect of the intervention can be produced, an important
step in further developing the evidence base in prevention science is to examine how and for whom indicated
preventive interventions work. The proposed work is consistent with the research priorities of the Child
Development and Behavior Branch (CDBB) of the NICHD to investigate the impact of a behavioral promotion
intervention in pediatric primary care and identify developmental factors and mechanisms which promote short-
and long-term psychosocial adjustment for children exposed to high-risk family and neighborhood
environments. In light of the extensive needs and depleting resources faced by low-income and
underrepresented minority families, the proposed work provides a unique opportunity to help promote optimal
behavioral functioning and reduce the risk for psychopathology in infants from the most vulnerable families."
10834073,"V(D)J recombination lies at the heart of antigen receptor diversity and adaptive immunity. The RAG
complex (RAG), which includes RAG1, RAG2 and HMGB1, initiates this critical process by binding
recombination signal sequences (RSSs) and creating DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs). The
resulting breaks are repaired via the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, the predominant
DSB repair mechanism in mammalian cells. Mutations in RAG or NHEJ proteins cause defects in V(D)J
recombination leading to joining errors, chromosomal deletions and translocations, and genome
instability. Defective V(D)J recombination is associated with a range of human disorders including
cancer, common immune deficiency (CID) and severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), and
ionizing radiation (IR) sensitivity.
 Despite much progress in the field, a particularly critical step of V(D)J recombination–the
transition from RAG-mediated DNA cleavage to NHEJ-mediated DNA repair–remains poorly
understood. Two particularly glaring gaps in our knowledge of this process are: 1) What are the steps
and RAG-NHEJ factor interactions that mediate this process? and 2) How are the RAG and NHEJ
complexes organized and regulated (dysregulated) in the “recombination centers” within which V(D)J
recombination takes place in vivo? Research into these questions has been hampered by limitations
inherent in traditional biochemical, structural, and cell biological approaches, limitations that can now be
overcome by high-resolution single molecule methods.
 In this application, we propose to address these knowledge gaps by defining the molecular
mechanism of the RAG-NHEJ handoff process and how its dysfunction leads to aberrant V(D)J
recombination. To accomplish this, we will use of an array of innovative single-molecule techniques and
assays. The proposed studies are supported by key preliminary experiments including the application
of single-molecule assays to monitor the RAG-NHEJ handoff process in vitro in real-time, and utilization
of super-resolution imaging of recombination complexes during transactions of V(D)J recombination in
cells."
10834075,"ABSTRACT
 Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are a major public health problem and pose significant challenges to
clinicians, patients, and health systems. AUDs are associated with serious medical conditions, can complicate
medical treatment and increase avoidable health service utilization and costs. Yet most patients who would
benefit from evidence-based AUD treatment, including pharmacotherapy, do not receive these services.
Although medications such as naltrexone, acamprosate and disulfiram can be effective for moderate to severe
alcohol problems, primary care providers (PCPs) are often reluctant to prescribe, and AUD medications remain
underused. Innovative care models are needed to give PCPs the tools they need to address AUDs in primary
care settings, but few studies have examined interventions to improve AUD medication delivery and specialty
care initiation. To address this substantial gap in the evidence base, this pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial in
adult primary care clinics (n=20) in a large, ethnically and socioeconomically diverse healthcare system, will
examine the effectiveness of an innovative, multi-faceted intervention: the Addiction Telemedicine Consultant
service, or “ATC.” The ATC provides a flexible, efficient, centralized approach to bringing Addiction Medicine
expertise directly into primary care. PCPs can access the ATC via three routes: real-time video or telephone
connection during primary care visits, asynchronous email, and telephone consultation. The ATC, a clinical
pharmacist, may assess the patient, discuss appropriate AUD medications with the PCP and patient, and if
appropriate, guide the PCP through prescribing logistics, or initiate the prescription themselves. The
motivational interviewing-trained ATC may also encourage the patient to initiate specialty addiction treatment
and facilitate connection to a local program. The ATC intervention will also offer initial continuing medical
education training on AUDs and AUD medication prescribing, and ongoing technical assistance, to all PCPs in
the ATC arm. We will compare the ATC arm to Usual Care, which includes routine alcohol screening, brief
intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT) in primary care. We conducted a pilot feasibility study of the
ATC model, and the proposed trial builds on our pilot findings, the extant literature, and incorporates
stakeholder feedback in its design. We will use electronic health record data captured during the course of
regular clinical care to examine treatment arm effects on implementation outcomes (AUD medication
prescription rates and addiction treatment referral rates) and patient outcomes (AUD medication fill rates,
addiction treatment initiation, alcohol use (drinking days/week, # drinks/week, # of “heavy” drinking days
(4+/5+/day) in past 90 days), and health services utilization and costs, over two years. If the intervention is
effective, this study has the capacity to spur the use of safe, effective pharmacotherapy for AUDs as a standard
practice in primary care settings and profoundly affect how we treat and study the full spectrum of alcohol use
problems."

Newborns have immature liver function that is inefficient at metabolizing bilirubin. Consequently, nearly 80% of
preterm and 60% of term babies develop hyperbilirubinemia resulting in neonatal jaundice within a week of
their birth. As severe hyperbilirubinemia can be fatal, early, frequent and accurate monitoring of bilirubin is vital
to avoid severe health issues and determine appropriate treatment. The gold standard for detecting
hyperbilirubinemia is an invasive blood test to measure total serum bilirubin (TSB); however, frequent blood
sampling in neonates is costly, painful and increases the chance of infection. Existing non-invasive methods to
monitor hyperbilirubinemia lack sufficient accuracy to replace blood tests. Although commercial transcutaneous
bilirubinometry (TcB) is clinically accepted for jaundice screening, it has low correlation with TSB for clinical
decision-making in dark-skinned neonates and has low availability in low/middle income countries (LMICs).
 A main reason for the limitation of TcB is spectral cross-talk: the inability to reliably distinguish
contributions between skin analytes (i.e., melanin) and blood. Our central hypothesis is that a non-invasive
mobile phone-based bilirubin detector can be developed that provides accurate, point-of-care blood bilirubin
measurements in dark-skinned neonates. We propose to use spectroscopic optical coherence tomography
(sOCT), an imaging technique those depth-resolved capabilities can overcome spectral cross-talk. In Aim 1 we
will develop portable, mobile phone-integrated sOCT for non-invasive, depth-resolved measurement of blood
spectra. Our working hypothesis is that depth-resolved, sOCT spectra of bilirubin correlate strongly with
spectral data from whole blood samples. Our innovative technical design will miniaturize and integrate
traditional sOCT components into a compact smartphone attachment. We will also develop a smartphone
application to perform data processing, analysis, display and HIPAA-compliant transmission or storage in lieu
of a bulky computer. In Aim 2 we will refine and test the sOCT algorithm in vivo. Our working hypothesis is that
sOCT measurements correlate better with lab-based TSB than does clinical TcB across a diverse range of skin
tones. In a clinical study of 100 neonates, we will compare sOCT data to the TSB blood tests and commercial
TcB. In Aim 3 we will validate the performance of sOCT in dark-skinned neonates from Kano, Nigeria. Our
working hypothesis is that sOCT performs comparably to lab-based TSB tests in dark-skinned neonates and is
acceptable for use in a LMIC setting. We will also assess potential challenges to incorporating sOCT into the
clinical workflow of a LMIC hospital. If successful, sOCT can provide an accurate alternative to commercial
TcB across diverse skin tones, including dark-skinned neonates and may potentially replace invasive methods
to detect and monitor hyperbilirubinemia in LMICs."
10835094,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Almost 70% of Latinx people with mental health disorders fail to receive the treatment they need due to various
barriers to accessing culturally specific mental health care. 
We propose that particularly trusted voices might be able to decrease mental health stigma in their 
communities and strengthen social networks to improve mental health services connections. In Spanishspeaking communities, lay health workers called promotoras fulfill this role: promotoras act as educators, 
cultural brokers, and bridges between the community and health services.
We will engage with a promotora learning collaborative to develop and assess a community-wide mental health 
education and empowerment campaign to increase culturally specific knowledge of mental health, trauma, and 
support services and to improve mental health services utilization in the Latinx population of East San José, 
CA. By collaborating with deep-rooted community partners, we seek to achieve the following specific aims: 1) 
Map the landscape of and pathways to mental health services within the community; 2) Strengthen 
promotoras’ capacity to engage their community around mental health services use; and 3) Determine if 
engaging promotoras in a mental health education and empowerment campaign increases mental health 
services utilization community-wide.
Under the first aim, we will work with community partners and promotoras to create a rich community asset 
map of culturally specific mental health services, layered with findings from a community-wide assessment of 
mental health services use, using geographic information system mapping (GIS). Promotoras will then be 
trained to facilitate Mental Health Education, (self-)Efficacy, and (outcomes) Expectancy (MHE3) gatherings –
a co-created culturally specific intervention to improve mental health services use. Finally, in the third aim, we 
will implement MHE3 as a cluster randomized trial and determine its impact at the individual, interpersonal, and 
community levels. Beyond self-reported outcomes, we will investigate the impact on social networks used to 
identify and choose mental health services. We will combine findings from existing facility-based and claims 
data with the results of a newly collected annual cross-sectional survey of the community to determine broader 
community-level impact on mental health services use.
Understanding how promotoras help overcome barriers to mental health and services use will deliver insights 
that inform collaboration with and integration of promotoras into care pathways and delivery strategies to 
decrease mental health disparities among Latinx communities more widely. Furthermore, we believe this work 
can also serve as a template for how to conduct outreach to other underserved populations. Finally, the 
proposed research will further NIMH’s mission to strengthen the public health impact of research by testing 
innovating approaches to reduce disparities in care access."

 Chronic autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system recognizes self-
antigens as foreign, leading to inflammation and destruction of specific tissues and
organs. Although the etiology of many chronic autoimmune diseases is generally
unknown, there are many examples of diseases in which bacterial infections initiate
or exacerbate autoimmune responses. One of the well-described autoimmune
conditions that develop in response to an infection is reactive arthritis (ReA), also
known as post-infectious arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis. Following
gastrointestinal infections with enteric pathogens such as Salmonella, Shigella, or
Yersinia, 5-10% of patients develop ReA, a painful form of inflammatory arthritis. By
using Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm) as a model organism, we
discovered that a STm amyloid surface structure involved in biofilm formation, curli
fibrils, form stable complexes with DNA, and that the curli/DNA complexes are
potent stimulators of autoimmunity. Systemic exposure to these complexes triggers
an autoimmune response characterized by the production of type I interferons
(IFNs) and anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) autoantibodies.
 The primary objective of this application is to investigate the mechanisms by
which curli/DNA complexes are recognized by the immune system and trigger
autoimmunity following gastrointestinal infection. Here, we hypothesize that that
the production of curli in the gut by the invasive STm leads to autoimmune sequelae
by triggering epithelial damage and activating TLR2 and TLR9, which in turn results
in the upregulation of type-I IFN and of type-17 immunity. In aim 1, we will
determine the role of curli-expressing bacteria and of curli/DNA complexes in the
development of autoimmunity. In aim 2, we will identify the immune pathways that
contribute to the autoimmunity induced by STm infection. In aim 3, we will
determine whether genetic susceptibility to autoimmunity enhances the immune
activation by curli/DNA complexes."

Alzheimer’s disease is severely under-studied in Sub-Saharan Africa: the few existing estimates suggest that
prevalence is currently low but changing risk factors predict that it could double in the next 20 years. We
propose to study risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) in the Kenya Life
Panel Survey (KLPS), a unique, richly phenotyped cohort of Kenyan adults who have been followed since
childhood, and who were participants in a randomized child health intervention (school-based deworming). The
existing dataset contains information on health, cognition, educational, demographic, social attitudes, and labor
market outcomes for over 6,500 Kenyans first surveyed in 1998 (at ages 8-15) through 2021 (ages 31-39).
KLPS thus provides an unusual opportunity to study cognition, and the determinants of AD/ADRD and related
risk factors, over the life course, with direct measurement during childhood, young adulthood, and midlife.
This project proposes an additional field interview in the KLPS Round 5 Aging Module (KLPS-5A) to collect
detailed “midlife baseline” cognition and aging-related health data, as well as information on AD/ADRD risk
factors, among participants, who will be 35 to 43 years old at the time of survey. One novel aspect is the ability
to link these midlife measures to rich existing longitudinal data from childhood and early adulthood, including
cognitive assessments (achievement and cognitive test scores), as well as educational outcomes, health
status and behaviors, and economic outcomes (e.g., earnings, migration, occupational complexity) collected
contemporaneously rather than via recall in later life. By combining state-of-the-art cognitive measures at this
new midlife timepoint with the extensive cognitive measures and exposures already collected, we hope to
establish KLPS as the premier African study of life-course dementia determinants. There are very few surveys
globally that include such detailed data from childhood to old age, and these data would open up multiple
avenues for investigating dementias tied to life-course disadvantages. We will make all data publicly available
to researchers across disciplines.
Another notable feature is the ability to utilize experimental variation from a randomized child health
intervention that has been documented to meaningfully affect adult living standards and several risk factors for
dementia, to better understand pathways over the life course and the scope for public health interventions to
reduce AD/ADRD risk. The Primary School Deworming Program provided deworming medication to
randomly-selected schools starting in 1998 in a region with high worm prevalence (>90%): 10 to 20 years after
treatment, the intervention had positive effects on self-reported health, educational attainment; adult living
standards; urban residential status, and occupation in the non-agricultural sector. This setting offers an unusual
opportunity to experimentally test the extent to which an effective child health intervention can affect AD/ADRD
risks and midlife health and cognition, as much of the associational literature suggests."

The landscape of biomedical research is changing rapidly due to major technological and conceptual
advances, creating new research opportunities and expansion in the scope of occupations while posing
challenges for graduate training in quantitative and multidisciplinary science. Furthermore, an emphasis on
best practices in graduate education and mentorship has emerged from socioeconomic shifts. To respond to
these ongoing developments and the needs of students and the broader society, the Department of
Biochemistry & Molecular Biology (BMB) and the Department of Chemistry (Chem) at The University of
Chicago propose an interdisciplinary, predoctoral training program directed at the interface of the chemical and
biological sciences (CBI) that aims to recruit, educate and train a diverse, new generation of biomedical
scholars by deploying new best practices in training, mentoring, and education to promote rigorous cross-
disciplinary research while developing quantitative literacy and maintaining depth in the core discipline, thereby
preparing them for success in careers that require scientific training. The program benefits from outstanding
faculty and students and introduction of new courses in interdisciplinary science. The 25 training faculty
consists of twelve faculty with appointments in BMB (one with a joint appointment in Chemistry), ten faculty in
Chemistry (one with a joint appointment in BMB), two in the Ben May Department for Cancer Research, and
one in Molecular Engineering. Strategies to develop cross-disciplinary training include: (1) satisfactory
completion of a core course in Chemical Biology and a breadth course in the department of the other scientific
discipline; (2) cross-disciplinary thesis research; (3) participation in a series of monthly meetings throughout
the academic year designated as ""Integrative Discussions at the Interface of Chemistry & Biology"" to gain
acquaintance with theoretical concepts and methods; (4) participation in two quarterly meetings focused on
advanced chemical tools in biology (ACT-Bio) and biological problems that require chemical solutions
(BPRCS); (5) participation in two in two annual half-day events: a CBI Minisymposium and an “in-house” poster
retreat; and (6) workshops to promote quantitative literacy and rigor and reproducibility. Participation in a
division-wide career development program helps students explore and prepare for different career paths.
The broad scope of the interdisciplinary research interests of the faculty strengthened through collaborative
research and teaching ensures a wide variety of opportunities for meaningful cross-training. The program will
promote excellence in mentorship through more frequent advising, mentoring compacts and required annual
faculty mentorship training. Through active participation in pipeline, outreach, and bridge programs, and
through participation in graduate admissions and faculty recruitment, program faculty will promote the
recruitment and retention of an increasingly diverse scientific community. An external advisory committee and
professionally implemented evaluation instruments will guide improvements to the program."
10841646,"Technical Abstract
 It is now appreciated that the adaptive immune system plays an integral role in the removal of toxic Aβ
oligomers from Alzheimer disease (AD) brains. This is accomplished through T effector cell entry into the brain
via the choroid plexus (CP) and their subsequent interaction with resident microglia. However, the role of the T
regulatory (Tregs) cells, which moderate Teff antigen inflammatory response, in the removal of Aβ oligomers is
currently debated. We have found that Treg cells are oxidative while Teff cells are glycolytic and that AD is
associated with chronic mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHS) defects and increased mitochondrial
reactive oxygen species (mROS) production. Therefore, we hypothesize that preexisting differences in
mitochondrial OXPHOS and mROS production can predispose to Alzheimer disease amyloid
accumulation and cognitive decline due to chronic neuronal cell damage, stimulation of toxic Aβ
oligomer formation, and alteration in the Treg control of immune function.
 To test this hypothesis, we propose three specific aims. First, to determine the importance of
mitochondrial defects in AD, we will combine the classical nuclear DNA (nDNA) APPswe AD transgene with
mtDNAs harboring defined OXPHOS defects (COIV421A and ND6P25L) or established Treg suppressive function
(mtDNAB6 and mtDNANZB) and document their effects on clearance of Aβ plaques and restoration of cognitive
function. Second, to determine the role of Treg in modulating Aβ pathology and cognition, we will use adoptive
transfer of weakly Teff-suppressive mtDNANZB Treg cells and strongly Teff-suppressive mtDNAB6 Treg cells in
APPswe mtDNAB6 or mtDNANZB mice and evaluate Aβ plaque removal and cognitive function. Lastly, to
determine the effects of mitochondrial OXPHOS defects and mROS production on the central nervous system,
CP, Treg cells, and microglia in terms of Aβ pathology and cognitive decline, we will use tissue-specific Cre
recombinases to either 1) inactivate the nuclear Ant2fl gene thereby reducing OXPHOS or 2) activate the
mitochondrially-targeted anti-oxidant mCATfl gene, thereby reducing mROS in Tg2576 APPswe + mtDNAB6 or
mtDNANZB mice.
 According to our hypothesis, the first specific aim is predicted to confirm that mitochondrial dysfunction
is causally related to AD and that mitochondria modulate the anti-Aβ oligomer removal by Treg cells. The
second specific aim is predicted to confirm the importance of Treg mitochondrial function in Aβ plaque
removal. The last specific aim is predicted to confirm the role of partial OXPHOS defects in the brain and
microglia in predisposition to AD and to establish the importance of Treg mROS in modulating Aβ plaque
removal and cognitive pathology. Should these predictions be born out, they may suggest that therapies to
enhance mitochondrial function and reduce mROS may prove beneficial in treating AD."
10841654,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Exposure to trauma is associated with a range of negative outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) and substance use disorder, particularly cannabis. The early posttrauma period (i.e., the days, weeks,
and months following exposure) represents a critical period of risk for long term problem behaviors, especially
among emerging adults (aged 18-25), which constitutes continued development accompanied by a peak in
substance use and increased risk for trauma exposure. As regional laws, cultures, and beliefs about cannabis
use (CU) continue to shift, there is concern that trauma exposure may exacerbate use (via self-regulation) and
lead to greater cannabis-related problems, as many individuals report using cannabis to relieve distress,
hyperarousal, and other posttrauma symptoms. Furthermore, while the majority of US states that have
legalized cannabis for medical use include outcomes of stress and trauma, such as PTSD, as qualifying
conditions for a state-issued medical marijuana license, little is known about how cannabis may impact the
early post-trauma course. Given that the endocannabinoid system plays an essential role in regulating stress
response and learned fear, CU in the acute post-trauma period may alter mechanisms contributing to
alterations in fear neurocircuitry (e.g., alterations in consolidation/ reconsolidation, retrieval, extinction) and
physiological reactivity. Limited (and contradicting) evidence, however, regarding safety and efficacy of
cannabis preclude strong conclusions about its potential therapeutic role, with some prospective studies
demonstrating detrimental or no long-term effects of CU on PTSD symptoms. The overall goal of our study is
to examine the interplay between posttraumatic stress symptoms and cannabis use behavior during the period
immediately following trauma exposure. We will recruit and prospectively follow N=200 trauma-exposed
regular cannabis users admitted to the general hospital emergency department after medical evaluation for
traumatic injury. Upon discharge, participants will complete ecological momentary assessment (EMA) paired
with wearable biosensors (smartwatch) to record CU behavior, symptom development, and physiological
output (i.e., heart rate) during early trauma recovery. Participants will return for completion of clinical interview
and self-report, as well as laboratory procedures to characterize fear extinction and physiological reactivity.
The main goals of this research are to: (a) assess alterations in fear response and physiological reactivity
associated with CU, (b) characterize the impact of posttraumatic stress symptoms on cannabis use behaviors,
and (c) determine whether early markers of altered physiology and posttraumatic stress symptoms are makers
for trajectories of long-term adverse cannabis-related outcomes (i.e., use disorder, problems, chronic/heavy
use)."
10841702,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The sparse landscape of targetable mutations in pediatric cancers in general and neuroblastoma (NB) in
particular, together with the recent successes of the anti-GD2 antibody, dinutuximab (2), provides a compelling
rationale for further development of immune-based treatment strategies against this devastating cancer.
However, responses to adoptive immunotherapy and checkpoint blockade have met with limited success, partly
due to an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms underlying immune responsiveness or resistance in this
tumor marked by significant heterogeneity. We undertook an unbiased clustering analysis of transcriptional
signatures derived from a large primary NB data set and
identified a subset of tumors, characterized by the high
expression of immune response activation and suppression genes, and indicating the potential for eliciting an
anti-tumor immune response. These signatures were seen mainly in tumors of the mesenchymal (MES) lineage,
one of the two epigenetically regulated cell states in NB, comprised of undifferentiated malignant cells with
primitive neural crest-like properties. By contrast, tumors with committed, adrenergic (ADR) neuron-like
malignant cells were less immunogenic and exhibited PRC2-mediated suppression of key tumor cell-intrinsic
immune activation genes. These promising results led to our central hypothesis that cell lineage state is an
important predictor of immune therapy response in NB. In Aim 1, we will elucidate the epigenetic
mechanisms underlying lineage-specific activation of immune response genes. Aim 2 will assess lineage-
dependent functions of cytotoxic T cells in tumor control by determining whether MES NB cells possess an
inflamed TME that facilitates cell-based therapies. In Aim 3, we will determine whether the increased expression
of NK cell receptor ligands in MES tumors translates into response to NK cell therapy and whether PRC2
inhibition will augment such responses in ADR tumors alone or in combination dinutuximab. Together, these
studies are expected to provide a compelling rationale for the use of tumor cell lineage for the selection of patients
who are most likely to benefit from immunotherapy and to pre-clinically validate treatment strategies involving
combinations of epigenetic and immune-based therapies to target the specific immune evasion mechanisms
deployed by NB cells, our long-term goal."
10841706,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Gastrointestinal parasitic infection is a widespread global health problem and can be a cause of significant
morbidity. Nevertheless, there is limited information on how T cells respond to these parasites. In some cases,
despite a robust T cell effector response to the parasite, tolerance to food antigens is maintained or enhanced.
This has led to the notion that chronic parasitic infection could explain in part the hygiene hypothesis, which
states that elimination of colonization or reduction of recurrent infections due to sanitation and pest control
increases the risk of allergic and autoimmune diseases. We aim to understand how intestinal parasites induce
effector T cell responses to parasitic antigens, and yet facilitate tolerance to food antigens present in the
intestine. We will study two parasites that induce opposite T cell effector responses in mice. We will use a
newly identified strain of Cryptosporidium tyzzeri, a commensal protozoan that induces a Th1 response, and H.
polygyrus, a helminth that induces a Th2 response. The rationale for using parasites which elicit disparate T
helper responses is to uncover potentially convergent mechanisms that may underly prevention of
immunopathology during anti-parasitic responses and maintenance of tolerance to innocuous food antigens. In
each infection, we will use TCR repertoire analysis to identify parasite-specific TCRs expressed by CD4+ T
cells. This approach will allow us, for the first time, to precisely track the fate of such parasite-reactive T cells
during these infections as they differentiate from naïve T cells to effectors or regulatory subsets. Given the
central role of the transcription factor Bhlhe40 in regulating effector function and IL-10 production, we will also
test its role in parasite-specific T cell fates and the development of a Tr1 phenotype which may provide
immune tolerance to these parasites. In Aim 1 we will characterize the anti-parasite T cell response to H.
polygyrus. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the mechanisms that regulate immune tolerance to Cryptosporidium. In
Aim 3, we will determine how infection with these parasites impacts on the tolerogenic T cell response to food
antigens and on the induction of food allergy. Overall, these studies will provide novel and important insights
into how parasitic infections drive effector T cell responses to parasite antigens while simultaneously promoting
tolerogenic or pathogenic responses to food antigens."
10840676,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Stem cells have the unique property to self-renew or differentiate into any of the 200+ different cell types
of the body. Understanding the mechanisms that contribute to stem cell identity and specific cellular
differentiation is essential to direct them to specialized cell states which can then be utilized for targeted therapy
for countless diseases. There has been increased interest in understanding the role of chromatin regulatory
factors in stem cell identity due to their essential roles in cellular processes and during development. During
development, lineage specification is accompanied by genome-wide chromatin reorganization and gene
expression pattern changes. Therefore, it is not surprising that epigenetic factors represent one of the largest
protein classes that are mutated in disease states, including developmental disorders. Our research interests
focus on the similarities and differences in chromatin structure among different cell types and how chromatin
regulatory factors that modulate these differences regulate cell fate. The long-term goals of our laboratory are to
comprehensively understand the functions, targets, regulation, and mechanisms of action of non-coding RNAs
(ncRNAs) and chromatin regulatory factors with critical functions in gene regulatory networks.
 Here, we propose three related but distinct research directives. We will determine the mechanism through
which FACT, an essential histone chaperone, acts to maintain embryonic stem (ES) cell identity. We propose
FACT is regulating cis regulatory elements (CREs) by modulating chromatin structure and transcription factor
(TF) binding to regulate transcription of genes required to maintain stem cell identity. In parallel, we will capitalize
on our system biology approach of understanding how nucleosome remodeling complexes contribute to cell
identity through ncRNA regulation. To that end, we will examine the functional interactions among understudied
nucleosome remodeling complexes, including how some remodelers may compensate for loss of another or
work redundantly. Finally, we will uncover the molecular contribution of an essential epigenetic factor, BAF, in
neural differentiation focusing, in part, on the complexes role in regulating non-coding transcription.
 Over the next five years, our laboratory will define the mechanism of FACT function in ES cells, determine
the interplay between a subset of nucleosome remodelers in gene regulatory networks, and understand the
contribution of one remodeler in regulating differentiation. The proposed research is significant because it will
uncover fundamental mechanisms that choreograph the interplay of chromatin dynamics with ncRNA function,
providing a crucial step in understanding cell fate decisions."
10843175,"Project Summary. A new molecular product becomes real when chemical building blocks are united with a
chemical reaction. The status quo in drug discovery is to acquire a large number of building blocks and stitch
them together using a small number of reactions. Common building block pairs are classically matched to
reactions through pattern recognition – the amide coupling is used for amines and carboxylic acids, the Suzuki
coupling is used for bromides and boronates. In this established paradigm, building blocks are the source of
diversity. The success of this classic approach relies on the commercial availability of the building blocks, and
best introduces diversity around the periphery of the molecule. Here, we explore a new paradigm, where a small
number of building blocks are stitched together using a large number of reactions. In this new paradigm, the
reacting atoms are the source of diversity, complementing the classic approach. In the classic approach, an
amine and carboxylic acid building block would be united by the amide coupling. We explore the theoretical and
experimental development of amine–acid coupling reactions that are distinct from the amide coupling. We focus
on new amine–acid coupling reactions that forge carbon–carbon bonds. The popularity of C–C bonds in
pharmaceuticals and natural products suggests a necessity for new C–C bond-forming reactions. A key
innovation is the use of chemoinformatics to demonstrate that amines and acids are available in high chemical
diversity, typically more cost effective than organometal and organohalide building blocks and generally safe and
stable to handle. Leveraging high-throughput experimentation to identify specific combinations of catalysts and
ligands, we find that we are able to discover amine–acid C–C coupling reactions. The advent of our new amine–
acid C–C coupling reactions allows for building block repurposing of the two most abundantly available building
blocks – amines and acids – for the synthesis of the most popular atom arrangements – C–C bonds – found in
drugs. Achieving these novel amine–acid C–C couplings requires identification and optimization of new catalyst
and reagent systems that enable broad substrate scope, user-friendliness, and potentially introduction of
asymmetry. Using modern high-throughput techniques, we search for such reaction conditions in the hopes of
inventing new and impactful amine–acid coupling reactions. While C–C bonds are an area of focus, other
complexity generating reactions are also considered, along with amine–acid C–N and C–O couplings. We
showcase the significance of our approach in drug discovery through the late-stage diversification of complex
pharmaceuticals, and through the synthesis of diverse chemical libraries."

The overall objective of this project is to develop and evaluate a clinically useful predictive model of long-term
function in older patients initiating non-surgical care for symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis. Lumbar spinal
stenosis is a common cause of low back pain and its associated disability among older adults, but there is little
data on prognosis to guide clinical trial design and clinical decision making. Using a prospective, inception
cohort study design, we will identify prognostic trajectories that can be easily applied clinically and describe
each group's phenotype using baseline variables. We will then develop and estimate the performance of a
model to predict patients' 12-month physical function. We will enroll adults aged 50 years and older initiating
non-surgical care for symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis. Participants will be recruited from The Duke Spine
Clinic and UW Medicine spine clinics. Baseline characteristics and candidate predictor variables, selected a
priori, will be measured after the index visit using patient-reported information from telephone interviews and
electronic medical record data. Back-related outcomes will be measured using a phone interview at 3, 6, and
12 months after the initial visit. Healthcare and medication use during the six months after the new visit will be
measured using the electronic medical record and patient questionnaires. This design will provide the highest
level of evidence to date for the prognosis of patients with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis not receiving
surgery. A parsimonious, accurate, and clinically useful prognostic model can be used to guide participant
selection for future clinical trials, as an adjustment or modification variable in studies comparing different
treatments, and can lead to new tailored treatment approaches for individuals with symptomatic lumbar spinal
stenosis. Ultimately, this line of research has substantial potential to improve the effectiveness and value of
care for patients with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis. Tailored treatment pathways for older adults with
symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis in non-surgical settings are currently non-existent, but they have shown
great promise in other back pain populations, such as non-specific back pain in primary care settings."

The objective of the proposed Mental Health, Earlier (MHE) ALACRITY Research Center is to reduce prevalence
and burden of mental illness via earlier intervention within real-world health care delivery systems. The central
methodological challenge is equitable implementation of evidence-based mental health innovations that aligns
with the needs and resources of community-based pediatric primary care systems and the diverse communities
they serve. The Center's Methods Incubation Core (MIC) will facilitate innovation and testing of solutions to
challenges that have inhibited translation of evidence-based tools and preventive interventions within pediatric
primary care systems. Achieving the objective of the MHE Center will be realized through transdisciplinary meth-
odologic integration grounded in implementation and prevention sciences, leveraging health information tech-
nology (HIT), and using developmentally sensitive, pragmatic measurement tools and calculators that are feasi-
ble and scalable. The MIC brings together experts in critical methodologic areas to perform two foundational
functions for the MHE Center: (1) innovate and apply implementation science, HIT, and pragmatic measurement
and analytic methods to improve implementation of evidence-based interventions to detect and prevent mental
health problems at the earliest phase of the clinical sequence and (2) provide integrated and consistent meth-
odologic support across the Center's Research Projects (RPs), the Signature Project (SP), and the Pilot Projects.
The MIC specific aims are: Aim 1: INNOVATE: Serve as a hub for cross-project methodologic synergies to
advance the science of equitable implementation in pediatric learning health systems. The MIC will be at the
nexus of identifying, developing, and disseminating novel methods (e.g., the roll-out implementation optimization
design), while highlighting unique transdisciplinary advancements facilitated by the Center's collaborative struc-
ture. Aim 2: SUPPORT: Ensure methodologic support for the Center's research activities. The MIC is charged
with ensuring that the Center's projects and research activities have excellent methodologic support to carry out
their aims and for the Center as a whole to achieve its overall research and training aims. We will provide multi-
disciplinary methodologic support, pulling from investigators' expertise in implementation and behavioral science
theories, models, and frameworks; human-centered design; HIT; and measurement science. The MIC is struc-
tured as a platform for transdisciplinary expertise to coalesce around novel methodologic challenges as they are
encountered to offer practical means of keeping projects moving. Aim 3: RDoC APPLICATIONS: The MIC will
lead testing, application, and extension of RDoC principles for testing prevention implementation and intervention
mechanistic hypothesis in the context of routine care, centered on novel implementation strategies to advance
mental health promotion and the mediators and moderators of a transdiagnostic intervention targeting irritability
and self-regulation via parenting. The MIC will allocate necessary methodologic expertise and Core resources
to address emerging and anticipated challenges and opportunities in near real time."
10843629,"PROJECT SUMMARY — SIGNATURE PROJECT (SP)
Community-based pediatric primary care offers a tight net for identifying children experiencing mental health
disparities who would benefit from preventive services and support. Parenting-based interventions are effective
at reducing risk for common mental health problems in toddlers but have not been translated to primary care.
Embedding evidence-based programs in existing systems of care reduces the likelihood of mental health prob-
lems emerging. A challenge of widescale prevention efforts in primary care is systematic, unbiased methods for
identifying children at risk for mental health problems. Salient factors limiting equitable implementation of screen-
ing practices and linked parenting interventions are feasible and acceptable risk identification processes, the
cost of implementing these practices, and the need for a well-trained workforce, strategies to engage caregivers,
and accessible delivery solutions. The MHE Center's Signature Project (SP) proposes a linked mental health
risk calculator to identify toddlers, the Developmental Early Childhood Instrument for Deciding Equitably for Men-
tal Health (DECIDE4Mental Health) tool, and a telehealth and digital application-based version of the evidence-
based Family Check-Up® (FCU), called FCUOnline, that has demonstrated effects on parenting and child self-
regulation that leads to short- and long-term prevention of internalizing and externalizing problems. The SP will
be the first implementation of FCUOnline in safety-net primary care agencies with predominantly Black/African
American and Latino low-income families in an urban area. Our transdiagnostic decision tool is key to develop-
mentally reliable mental health risk determination that is feasible in routine care, because they identify risk for a
broad array of syndromes with a single screen. Using the MHE Center's novel cluster randomized Roll-Out
Implementation Optimization (ROIO) design, the SP's aims are: Aim 1: Optimize the implementation of DE-
CIDE4Mental Health in pediatric primary care linked to an evidence-based telehealth parenting interven-
tion—the Family Check-Up® (FCU) Online. Aim 1a. Identify and test strategies for equitable implementation of
DECIDE4Mental Health tool. Aim 1b. Identify and test strategies for equitable implementation and effectiveness
of the FCUOnline. The SP's implementation optimization process and outcome evaluation are guided by the RE-
AIM framework with a focus on equitable implementation. Aim 2. Evaluate the equitable implementation of
DECIDE4Mental Health and FCUOnline. We will assess equitable implementation of the SP's tools on key
clinic, clinician, and caregiver levels implementation outcomes at multiple points within the ROIO design to opti-
mize strategies directed at any signs of inequity. Aim 3. Test the effectiveness of FCUOnline at reducing
toddler behavioral vulnerability to preschool-age mental health symptoms. Experimental Therapeutic
targets are child irritability and self-regulation promoting parenting skills. The primary outcomes for deter-
mining FCUOnline effectiveness are parenting skills, internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and irritability-
related impairment. Assessments (in English or Spanish) will occur at study entry, 6- and 12-months."
10843630,"PROJECT SUMMARY — RESEARCH PROJECT 1 (RP1)
Mental health symptoms emerge as early as the preschool years, emphasizing the need for preventive
approaches that start in toddlerhood. Universal, parent-reported screening tools for toddlers in primary care can
improve early detection of mental health risk, facilitate preventive intervention, and reduce child mental health
inequities related to delayed care. For toddlers who screen at risk, multiple parenting programs for this age group
can improve behavioral control and prevent the development of mental health problems. However, families of
toddlers who screen positive (i.e., “at-risk”) can each be at a different stage in the process of problem recognition
and readiness for engagement in services—informed by their personal experiences and beliefs, cultural
background, and knowledge about development, mental health, and prevention. Furthermore, pediatric primary
are clinicians are rarely trained to discuss toddler mental health risk, and so rely primarily on their personal
perspectives and comfort levels, leaving them vulnerable to implicit bias. Effective and equitable communication
about early childhood mental health risk requires building clinician confidence to: (a) manage uncertainty in
prevention-oriented discussions about early childhood mental health; (b) employ anti-racist strategies for
minimizing bias in decisions about what and how to communicate; and (c) engage in family-centered
communication that considers families' cultural identities and experiences. Despite these challenges, there has
been little focus on how to help pediatric clinicians build confidence and competence to make decisions about
and communicate with families from diverse backgrounds about toddler mental health risk. The Mental Health
Earlier (MHE) ALACRITY Center Research Project 1 (RP1) addresses this gap through development and testing
of a telementoring program for primary care pediatric clinicians – Talking Early About Mental health for Equity
(TEAM4Equity) – to advance equitable implementation of toddler mental health risk screening in primary care.
Program development and delivery will occur in partnership with ECHO (Extension for Community Health
Outcomes) Chicago, a pioneering and widely disseminated program building workforce capacity in primary care
through case-based learning series over videoconferencing. Our goals with TEAM4Equity are to improve 1)
clinician self-efficacy for decision-making and communicating about toddler mental health risk and recommended
interventions, and thereby 2) families' trust and engagement with preventive mental health interventions. We will
achieve our goals by 1) Collaborate with pediatric clinicians and caregivers to iteratively refine the TEAM4Equity
ECHO series using human centered design methods; 2) Conduct a single-arm feasibility and acceptability test
of the TEAM4Equity curriculum- and case-based videoconferencing ECHO series; and 3) Pilot test the
TEAM4Equity ECHO series in a cluster randomized controlled trial. RP1 makes an important contribution to the
MHE Center via its emphasis on a unique implementation strategy to build pediatric clinician self-efficacy with
developmentally and culturally-informed decision-making and communication about toddlers' mental health risk."
10843631,"PROJECT SUMMARY — RESEARCH PROJECT 2 (RP2)
The American Academy of Pediatrics has endorsed primary care-based screening of mental health risk in young
children as a key step toward improving youth mental health, but most early childhood mental health risks go
undetected and unaddressed. Even when they receive screening, only 10%-25% of young children identified as
“high risk” access mental health care. The availability of transdiagnostic decision tools for risk identification is a
major advance; however, increasing uptake of post-screening mental health resources will require a community-
partnered approach that centers families' needs, concerns, and experiences with mental health systems. Such
approaches must address caregiver preferences for certain types of support (e.g., for briefer, primary care-based
resources); address caregivers' beliefs and concerns that constrain help-seeking (e.g., beliefs that mental health
interventions will not help their child); and grant agency to caregivers navigating complex support systems. Given
the outsized impact of early prevention, there is a need for accessible adjunctive interventions that empower
caregivers to increase their likelihood of seeking recommended supports after a positive screening for mental
health risk at toddler pediatric well visits. Online single-session interventions (SSIs) have shown promise in
increasing caregiver receptivity to mental health intervention and increasing linkage to intervention. For example,
a digital (online) “growth mindset” SSI (GM-SSI, developed by Project Lead Schleider) teaching that emotions
are malleable has strengthened both child mental health and caregiver support-seeking across multiple trials.
Research Project 2 (RP2) of the Mental Health, Earlier (MHE) Center seeks to adapt an online, evidence-based
GM-SSI for caregivers of young children (ages 24-30 months) and test its potential to bridge the gap between
primary care-based mental health risk screening and families' access to child mental health support. When
integrated into the Center's Roll-Out Implementation Optimization design, it will bridge the Signature Project's
early identification decision tool and referral to the Family Checkup Online intervention. First, we will use human-
centered design methods to ensure the GM-SSI is developmentally and culturally informed for early childhood
primary care, via co-design with end-users (racially/ethnically minoritized caregivers) and key informants
(pediatricians, administrative staff). Second, via usability testing, we will collect pre-, post-, and follow-up data
on mechanisms (beliefs about mental health support; agency; hopelessness) and 3-month clinical outcomes
(child mental health support access) of the GM-SSI. Third, we will use these results and conduct a pilot trial
involving 30 primary care clinics and 350 caregivers of children screened as showing moderate-or-greater mental
health risk. We expect caregivers who receive the adapted SSI (vs. the control) to report larger improvements in
agency, hopelessness, and optimism about mental health support, and higher rates of accessing child mental
health support within 6 months of risk screening. Outcomes will be examined for equity across demographic
groups (e.g., racial/ethnic groups)."
10843632,"PROJECT SUMMARY — RESEARCH PROJECT 3 (RP3)
Implementation science holds great potential to increase the reach of effective interventions. However, there has
been an underemphasis on prospective planning for and investigating of unintended consequences of imple-
mentation efforts, particularly those that center equity. This can result in the creation and/or reification of existing
inequities. Specifically, early mental health screening, identification, and intervention, while promising to improve
outcomes for children and families due to the outsized impact on lifespan mental health, has the potential for
negative unintended consequences, particularly for children and families from minoritized communities. Pro-
spectively anticipating and evaluating unintended consequences in pediatric mental health prevention is increas-
ingly recognized as ethically imperative because of the potential harm that could emerge from the implementation
of evidence-based approaches. This study seeks to prospectively and concurrently explore and evaluate the
unintended consequences that may occur with implementation of evidence-based practices for toddler mental
health screening and intervention across all the Mental Health, Earlier (MHE) Center Projects. This work is in-
formed by the Pullmann Compilation of the Ripple Effects of Implementing Children’s Mental Health Services,
Rid’s Ethical Evaluation of Risks of Public Health Programs, and the Health Equity Implementation Framework.
Foundational to our approach is the centering of the voices of our research and community partners to ensure
holistic perspectives of unintended consequences resulting from the screening, identification, and intervention
for toddler mental health risk. In Aim 1, we will conduct a “pre-mortem"" with each MHE Project team, in
which we will engage prospective hindsight to imagine the unintended consequences of each project’s imple-
mentation and define equitable reach. In addition to producing Project-specific evaluation plans, these activities
will also generate a generalizable methodological approach for future studies. In Aim 2, we will employ a multi-
method approach to evaluate equitable reach and unintended consequences across context (caregivers,
clinician, organizational [exploratory]) and across MHE projects. This cross-cutting study addresses a
prominent limitation of many implementation studies to purposively evaluate and attend to unintended conse-
quences that threaten equitable and ethical implementation of early identification and prevention of mental health
problems in pediatric primary care. The MHE Center and its individual Projects, and its innovative trial design,
provide a unique opportunity to study unintended consequences of implementation across the stages of the
mental health risk identification-to-care cascade. This project is significant because it will inform the ideal process
through which to engage in community-partnered, ethical, and equitable implementation of early mental health
identification, screening, and intervention."

The Immunology and Inflammation training program at NYU Grossman School of Medicine (NYUGSoM)
provides excellent pre-doctoral and post-doctoral training at the interface between immunology and
human disease. The program trains students and postdoctoral fellows in basic immunology as well as its
applications in host-pathogen interactions, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, and anti-tumor
immunity. Innovative courses provide trainees with a foundation in the field and training in critical
evaluation of data, and the students build on this foundation in the weekly immunology seminar series
and journal club. Trainees develop their writing and presentation skills through participation in work-in-
progress presentations, journal clubs, and an annual retreat. A critical element of training is research
experience, and the training program currently has 30 faculty who are highly productive scientists with
extensive mentoring experience. In addition, NYUGSoM is undertaking a major expansion of its
immunology research base. The first two cycles of the program supported many highly successful
trainees, and we propose to build on this success with a training program with 4 pre-doctoral and 2 post-
doctoral positions. The long-term goal of the program is to train a new cadre of rigorous and creative
researchers in the broad and interdisciplinary area of immunology and its relation to inflammatory
processes. The successful trainees will be ideally positioned to contribute to the development of novel
therapies to treat inflammatory diseases."

Only about 1% of the mammalian genome encodes for protein yet 80% is transcribed, suggesting that noncoding
RNA has many roles in gene regulation. Our research program aims to delineate those roles and the
mechanisms involved. Over the next five years, our focus will be the study of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)
that function to repress transcription. The most potent repressive lncRNA, Xist, silences transcription across one
entire X chromosome during the essential process of X-inactivation. Yet the mechanisms by which Xist and other
lncRNAs repress transcription are insufficiently understood. Indeed, at the level of RNA sequence, it is unclear
what distinguishes repressive lncRNAs from those that lack repressive activity. This same lack of clarity extends
to lncRNAs of all functional classes. Thus, it remains nearly impossible to predict the function of lncRNAs from
analyses of their sequence content, stifling progress in the field. At the same time, lncRNAs play critical roles in
health. Abnormal expression of genes that lncRNAs target for repression can drive genetic disorders such as
Angelman and Rett Syndromes, as well as cancers and autoimmunity. Moreover, uncharacterized lncRNAs are
found throughout mammalian genomes, including in regions linked to phenotypic variation and disease, hinting
that lncRNAs with therapeutic relevance remain to be discovered. Additionally, we have discovered that many
intron-containing RNAs closely resemble known repressive lncRNAs. Although introns are better known for their
roles as substrates in the context of splicing, our data raise the intriguing possibility that intronic portions of the
nascent transcriptome mediate lncRNA-like regulatory effects. Over the next five years, our research program
will reveal fundamental insights into lncRNA biology and transcriptional control that are relevant across cell types
and organisms. We expect to determine how RNA sequence and structure confer repressive function to
lncRNAs; define new connections between nascent RNAs, RNA processing, and epigenetic regulation; delineate
new mechanisms through which RNAs use RNA-binding proteins to control transcription; and identify how the
regulatory functions of lncRNAs are modulated by underlying features of the genome. Along the way, we will
develop experimental and computational approaches that will enable regulatory RNAs and their mechanisms to
be identified across biological systems. Given the centrality of gene regulation in human health and disease, we
expect our work to lead to the discovery of etiologies and therapeutic opportunities in many settings."

Dyneins are AAA+ motors responsible for minus-end-directed motility along microtubules (MTs) and play
fundamental roles in cargo transport, mitosis, and ciliary beating. Dynein is currently the focus of the motor field
as the mechanism of its movement is not well understood in comparison to plus-end-directed kinesins. Despite
rapid transport of dynein-driven cargos in cells, previous in vitro studies identified mammalian dynein as a weak
motor, exhibiting slow motility and producing lower forces than kinesin. Recently, in vitro reconstitution of the
dynein-dynactin machinery revealed that mammalian dynein is autoinhibited when not transporting cargo, and
motility is activated when dynein forms a 2.5 MDa ternary complex with its cofactor dynactin and a cargo binding
adaptor. Therefore, all of the previous in vitro work on mammalian dynein used inactive motor and their
conclusions do not reflect how active dynein-dynactin machinery transports cargos in cells.
Our future goals are to dissect the mechanism of active cytoplasmic dynein complexes and determine how
dynein activation and motility are regulated across multiple scales using single molecule imaging, optical
trapping, MD simulations, and cryoEM. Specifically, we will determine how Lis1 plays a role in the activation of
and regulation of dynein motility. We will also study dynein motility in physiologically relevant conditions and ask
whether MT-associated proteins, MAP7 and Tau, inhibit dynein motility by sterically blocking its tubulin binding
site or by excluding its MT binding via liquid-liquid demixing. We will also characterize the motility of dynein and
dynactin disease mutants to reveal the molecular mechanism of neuropathies associated with these mutations.
Finally, we will reconstitute the entire MT transport machinery using cargo adaptors identified by in vivo studies
of mitochondria, autophagosomes, and vesicle transport, but not yet characterized in vitro. Using this approach,
we will dissect how cargo adaptors regulate motors to control the bidirectional transport of these cargos.
We will also study ciliary dyneins that slide parallel array of axonemal MTs to power ciliary beating. Several
models have been proposed to explain how the sliding activity of dyneins is self-regulated to orchestrate ciliary
oscillations. Predictions that these models make about the mechanism of ciliary dyneins have not been directly
tested. Recently, a recombinant expression system was developed for Tetrahymena outer-arm dynein (OAD),
enabling us to perform in-depth structural and biophysical studies of ciliary dyneins. Unlike cytoplasmic dynein,
OAD forms a heterodimer and is not processive. Using this system, we will characterize the mechanism of OAD
motility and force generation. We will then directly test the predictions of each model by constructing in vitro
geometries that mimic dynein/MT interactions in a beating cilium. Finally, we will identify structural components
that give rise to the nonprocessive motility, curvature sensing, and self-oscillatory behavior of OAD.
The success of our research program will reveal the fundamental mechanochemistry of dynein and how it
achieves retrograde transport of intracellular cargos and drives the self-coordinated oscillations of motile cilia."

the PIs, Core Directors and Associate Directors. They will meet twice a year with an Advisory Committee
made up of distinguished scientists from within and outside the Center. This Advisory committee will review
the educational, enrichment, career development initiatives in addition to Core service usage and innovation.
Their mandate will be to provide advice about Center management, Core services, innovations and initiatives,
including educational, mentoring, funding and DEI initiatives. The overall philosophy of Center leadership is
that the Core services and enrichment activities must be constantly reevaluated to ensure that they incorporate
new scientific advances and serve the growing and changing needs of the diverse scientific community served
by the Center. In addition to quarterly feedback solicited from Center investigators, the input of 5 Committees
composed of Center investigators is designed to routinely evaluate the effectiveness of current services and to
identify new initiatives/services which will increase the scientific impact of research conducted by Center
investigators, promote collaborative research, support investigations of Early Stage Investigators (ESIs) and
expand our community by outreach efforts including fostering musculoskeletal research by those from other
disciplines and offering mentored research experiences to those from backgrounds underrepresented in
STEM.
 Sustainability is based on leveraging institutional resources whenever possible and designing user fees to
cover supply costs of the Core services, with significant subsidies provided to early stage investigators (ESIs)
who have not yet obtained independent R01-type grant support. An emphasis on mentoring, collaboration,
career development and education will permeate all Center activities, with a special focus on ESIs, members in
training and those from backgrounds underrepresented in STEM. The underlying goal of all the services and
enrichment activities is to continue to expand the number and diversity of musculoskeletal investigators and to
foster interdisciplinary and collaborative research that leads to a deeper understanding of musculoskeletal

core also performs and provides hands-on training in spatial transcriptomics using Light-Seq, a pioneering,
open-source, and inexpensive spatial transcriptomics technology. 3) The Directed Differentiation Core
(DDC) directed by Dr. April Craft, is a new core requested by Center members and the Innovation
Committee. The DDC provides hands-on training and the use of lab space, cells, equipment, and lot-tested
reagents to generate musculoskeletal lineage cells from pluripotent, or multipotent, human and mouse stem

10844193,"Project Summary/Abstract
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a devastating autoimmune disease in which autoantibodies to ubiquitous
nuclear antigens cause inflammation and tissue damage in multiple organs. The treatment of SLE has improved
considerably over the past 30 years, but these advances have relied on existing medications with insufficient
efficacy and significant toxicities. Although several new therapeutics are now available, the new drugs are still
only modestly effective. It is imperative, therefore, that advances in immunologic knowledge be applied to
improve the treatment and quality of life of SLE patients by maintaining them in a remission state. Both B cell
activation and myeloid cell activation can drive SLE onset and flare, leading to our focus on these two immune
subsets and the period prior to flare in this proposal. Our Autoimmunity Center of Excellence proposal is centered
on the hypothesis that an improved understanding of the mechanisms that regulate disease specific immune
states that are perturbed during active disease or disease flare will form the basis for appropriate patient
stratification and selection for clinical trials and will provide insights into new therapeutic targets. Autoantibody
production is central to the pathogenesis of SLE but many questions remain about the origins of the plasma cells
that produce them. It is clear that autoantibody production can precede disease onset by many years, and that
flares of SLE are often associated with a new wave of plasma cell proliferation. The Principal Project (Dr. Betty
Diamond) will address what B cell pathways are associated with the tolerance state during disease quiescence
compared with active disease and healthy controls and whether B cell selection, activation or differentiation to
plasmablasts are affected during active disease and remission. A crucial tool is a new fluorescent nuclear antigen
preparation, developed by the Diamond group that can be used to identify and isolate autoreactive B cells that
represent only a small fraction of the total B cell population. One B cell subset of particular interest in SLE is the
non-classical ABC (age-associated B cell) subset that expands and produces autoantibodies and cytokines in
response to innate stimuli and can activate T cells through antigen presenting functions. The Pilot Project (Dr.
Sun Jung Kim) will address how ABCs take up and present antigen and what metabolic state is needed for their
T cell activating function. This may suggest strategies to modulate their state to treat active disease or prevent
flares. Activated monocytes are found in the blood of patients with SLE flares. The Collaborative Project (Dr.
Anne Davidson) will study disease specific monocyte cell states by sampling blood and urine and define those
cell states that are present in active disease or increase in frequency prior to disease flares. Our proposal is
bolstered by close scientific interactions among the three lead investigators, by the availability of legacy samples
from the previous ACE cycle, by collaborations with experts in next generation sequencing methods and data
analysis and by a robust clinical infrastructure that will add clinical depth and ensure timely recruitment of patient
cohorts that will be shared by all three studies."

Washington, DC has approximately 13,000 people living with HIV (PLWH) and is one of the HIV “hotspots” in
the US that collectively contribute to 50% of new HIV diagnoses. As we strive to end the HIV epidemic, the
ability to characterize persons who are newly diagnosed with HIV, effectively direct treatment efforts for HIV
and its co-occurring conditions, and use novel prevention tools to avert further transmissions, are of critical
importance. The DC Cohort, a longitudinal cohort study of over 10,000 PLWH receiving care at 15 clinical sites
in DC, is uniquely positioned to help end the HIV epidemic. The Cohort was launched in 2011 with the goal of
bending the trajectory of the HIV epidemic in DC by improving the quality of care. The Cohort engages
academic and community-based clinics, links to DC Health Department (DOH) databases, and provides near
real-time performance feedback to clinics on HIV outcomes using a data visualization Clinical Dashboard. All of
this is achieved through automated data extraction and harmonization of electronic medical records data from
varied clinical settings and all age groups. The Cohort provides a representative, population-level and
scientifically productive research resource that does not exist in most urban high prevalence cities. Building off
the Cohort’s infrastructure and achievements, we will expand this robust population-level data repository to
comprehensively and longitudinally track outcomes among PLWH in a high prevalence city. We will incorporate
new data sources into the Cohort including administrative, service, pharmacy, additional co-morbidity and
patient-reported outcomes data. Access to multi-level data will enhance the monitoring of HIV and co-
morbidities outcomes. Next, we propose to use the Cohort to monitor the impact and effectiveness of Ending
the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiatives in DC and contribute lessons learned to national EHE efforts. The
Dashboard will monitor key EHE indicators: retention in care; viral suppression (VS); availability, initiation and
efficacy of new ARV therapeutics; and reductions in health disparities. With this tool, local HIV providers and
the DC DOH can support those at greatest risk for suboptimal outcomes. Finally, we will use the Cohort to
develop pioneering interventions to improve the quality of care among PLWH. We will partner with the DC
Center for AIDS Research, local and national HIV investigators, and community stakeholders to identify and
develop clinical, epidemiologic, socio-behavioral, basic science, and implementation science interventions to
improve care. We will use the Cohort infrastructure to identify potential participants and clinical sites for these
studies in support of NIH-funded and other research proposals. The goals of the Cohort align with OAR, NIAID,
and EHE priorities which focus on reducing health disparities, achieving VS, monitoring quality of care, and
improving the management of HIV-related clinical outcomes. The DC Cohort is an unparalleled clinical,
research, and public health resource which enables us to monitor care in a high prevalence city. Lessons
learned will produce generalizable knowledge that can be applied in other urban hotspots across the US."

Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ngo) is an obligate human bacterial pathogen that causes the sexually transmitted
infection gonorrhea. Due to increasing rates of gonorrhea and increased antibiotic resistance, vaccines and new
therapeutics are urgently needed. A promising strategy is targeting nutrient metal acquisition systems since they
are usually conserved, expressed during infection, and essential for bacterial survival in vivo. Ngo undermines
host metal restriction mechanisms by expressing outer membrane transporters to acquire essential metals from
human metal-sequestering proteins such zinc from calprotectin and psoriasin and iron from lactoferrin and
transferrin. However, many gene products that support Ngo growth in metal-limiting conditions remain
uncharacterized. We found that the product of the ngo1049 gene is highly expressed in Ngo grown under zinc-
limiting conditions. Ngo1049 is conserved among pathogenic Neisseria, and bioinformatic analysis predicts that
Ngo1049 is a metal-binding transferase localized in the periplasm. A Zur binding motif was identified upstream
of ngo1049, suggesting expression is regulated by Zur (zinc uptake regulator), which represses expression in
high zinc concentrations. ngo1049 transcripts are highly induced during Ngo infection of human endocervical
cells, indicating a potential role for Ngo1049 in Ngo pathogenesis. Based on these findings, I hypothesize
Ngo1049 is a Zur-regulated protein that facilitates zinc acquisition in metal-limited conditions at inflamed
epithelial surfaces. To test this hypothesis, in this F31-Diversity submission I propose to determine the
localization and regulation mechanism(s) of Ngo1049. Second, I will examine the contribution of Ngo1049 to zinc
acquisition in metal-limiting conditions. Lastly, I will define how Ngo1049 enables Ngo survival at inflamed
mucosal surfaces after exposure to epithelial cells and human immune cells that contain metal chelating proteins.
By defining this new member of the Ngo metal regulon, my work will potentially point to new therapies for this
antibiotic-resistant bacterium. Through its combination of bacterial physiology and genetics, biochemistry, and
cellular microbiology, as well as the professional development opportunities available to me during my graduate
training, this project will provide me with the background and expertise to pursue a career as the leader of an
academic research laboratory in host-pathogen interactions."
10843843,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The ability for cells to detect and respond to metabolic cues is critical to maintaining homeostasis, and
perturbations in the sensing mechanisms that respond to oscillations in metabolic flux are the root cause of many
diseases, including sepsis, autoimmunity, cancer, and diabetes. There is mounting evidence that protein post-
translational modifications (PTMs) are the critical sensors for these metabolic fluctuations and are often
dysregulated in disease. Currently, we have a fundamental gap in our understanding of the composition,
abundance, and enzymatic control of PTMs and how they are altered in disease.
 My laboratory focuses on the identification and characterization of PTMs and how they are regulated in
both health and disease. To accomplish this goal, we have developed sensitive methods to identify and quantify
global changes in PTMs across a broad spectrum of biological samples. Using this approach, we have identified
a novel lysine PTM that is derived from a glycolytic by-product. These PTMs are elevated when glyoxalase 2
(GLO2) is inhibited, resulting in reduced glycolytic output and disrupted one-carbon metabolism. Our primary
goal is to establish the therapeutic efficacy of a GLO2 inhibition strategy for the treatment of metabolic disorders.
My research program is dedicated to understanding four fundamental questions: 1) How does GLO2 control
one-carbon metabolism and cellular redox? GLO2 knockout cells have reduced glutathione and increased
oxidative stress. We will quantify the role of GLO2 in the regulation of de novo glutathione synthesis. In addition,
the role of GLO2 in the regulation of antioxidant responses will be evaluated in a cellular model for oxidative
stress and inflammatory signaling. 2) How are LactoylLys modifications regulated? We will employ
quantitative proteomics using CRISPR-Cas9 knockout cell lines of candidate proteins to identify enzymatic
regulators of LactoylLys modifications in cells. 3) Is GLO2 a viable target for the treatment of glycolysis-
dependent disease states? A xenograft model will be employed using GLO2 knockout cell lines to quantify
proliferation and metabolic regulation in vivo. This will determine the therapeutic feasibility of targeting GLO2 for
the treatment of disease. 4) Are LactoylLys modifications functional histone marks? We have identified
histones as targets for modification by LactoylLys modifications in unstimulated cells. The presence of these
PTMs basally suggests a putative role in transcriptional regulation. We will use proteomics to identify site-specific
modifications and putative ‘reader’ domains for LactoylLys modifications in cells.
 Our primary goal is to establish the role of GLO2 and LactoylLys modifications in cell metabolism and
chromatin biology. This project will address a fundamental gap in our basic understanding of how cell metabolism
is regulated. Understanding how these PTMs regulate homeostasis is a critical first step to understanding their
role in disease. Due to the far-reaching implications of this project and the broad applications for the treatment
of highly glycolytic disease states, this research program is an ideal fit for the ESI MIRA Award."

Racial disparities in the incidence and treatment of end-stage kidney disease are well-documented and largely

primarily driven by structural racism (SR). Non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic persons of any race, and American
Indian or Alaska Natives (AIAN) are a) at higher risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) throughout their life
course; b) more likely to progress from CKD to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD); c) less likely to be referred for
kidney transplantation; d) less likely to obtain a living donor kidney transplant (LDKT); e) experience higher
mortality hazards on the transplant waiting list and post-transplant; and f) experience higher rates of post-
transplant graft failure. The major exception to this rule is the higher survival rate of Black and Hispanic ESKD
patients on dialysis. For all other outcomes, the consistency with which highly similar disparities are observed
across these disparate processes suggests that deeper mechanisms are at work — i.e., SR. To assess the hidden
forces of SR underlying consistent disparities in ESKD, we will analyze a very large health survey linked to
longitudinal Medicare claims, geospatial information, and mortality outcomes. Our approach to measuring SR
will be multidimensional, capturing local racial/ethnic inequalities in economic, educational, judicial, political,
and residential outcomes as well as health care affordability, contact, proximity, and quality. Furthermore, to
fully reflect the contribution of divergent medical treatments to racial/ethnic disparities in ESKD patient
outcomes, we will measure ESKD patients’ treatments over time, then identify the most important treatment
trajectories for racial/ethnic disparities. In our Aim 1 analysis, we hypothesize that non-Hispanic Black,
Hispanic, and AIAN individuals will have higher risk of ESKD development, and that SR will significantly
explain these disparities. We will test this hypothesis by analyzing restricted Medicare claims and geospatial
data linked to the National Health Interview Study (NHIS; 1994-present; N=941,492 Medicare-linkage-eligible
respondents). In our Aim 2 analysis, we hypothesize that non-Hispanic Black, and AIAN respondents will be
less likely to receive optimal treatment trajectories and more likely to receive suboptimal treatment trajectories
than non-Hispanic Whites. We will construct treatment trajectories using sequence analysis techniques, and
assess racial/ethnic disparities in treatment trajectories in the United States Renal Data System dataset
(USRDS; 1997-2018; N=2,335,340). In our Aim 3 analyses, we investigate whether racial/ethnic ESKD patient
survival advantages compared to non-Hispanic Whites are modified by SR and treatment trajectories. We
hypothesize that SR and treatment trajectories both modify racial/ethnic disparities in ESKD patient
outcomes, but that treatment trajectories will offer the greatest explanatory power due to their more proximate
relationship to patient outcomes. We will test this hypothesis by assessing how well each characteristic
statistically explains racial/ethnic disparities in ESKD patient mortality. Throughout the research process we
will work with two established community advisory boards to generate novel ideas for analyses, results
interpretation, and specific proposed interventions, and refine the proposed interventions for future testing
with input from the board and ESKD health care professionals."

Dendritic spines are mushroom-shaped postsynaptic compartments that host intracellular
signaling cascades important for synaptic plasticity and, thereby, learning and memory. Signaling
events in spines involve a network composed of hundreds of proteins interacting with each other
extensively. Synaptic plasticity is typically induced by Ca2+ elevation in spines, which activates a
variety of signaling pathways. This leads to changes in the actin cytoskeleton and membrane
dynamics, which in turn causes structural and functional changes of the spine. Recent studies
have demonstrated that the activities of these proteins have a variety of spatiotemporal patterns,
which orchestrate signaling activity in different subcellular compartments at different time scales.
To better understand the operational principles of this network and the mechanisms underlying
plasticity, we will develop tools to optically measure and manipulate signaling activity in neurons
in both brain slices and in awake, behaving animals during plasticity. In particular, we aim to
develop innovative technology to image and measure endogenous proteins by combining
advanced imaging techniques, new optogenetic tools and genome-editing technology. Using
these tools, we will determine time windows of signaling activity mediated by endogenous
proteins, and elucidate how intracellular signaling mediates synaptic, circuit and behavioral
plasticity. This will thus lead to a better understanding of how information is processed at different
time scales and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying learning and
memory."

Chromosomes are the repositories of our genetic material. We consider them to be ""living, breathing objects""

with even spacing along the chromosomes. We analyze this patterning process by 4D long timescale
visualization in our new C.elegans platform and by cytogenetic studies in the fungus Sordaria. We are probing
our new mechanical model and our discovered inter-homolog structure/DNA bridges, concomitantly analyzing
new-found players and identifying more. For pairing, with our new low SNR spot detection algorithm and FROS
tags in budding yeast, we probe partner searching and homology identification. In Sordaria, our first-ever
comprehensive screen of meiotic long noncoding RNAs will identify species involved in patterning and/or
pairing. Other studies investigate the evolution of meiosis from mitosis and evolution of stable autopolyploidy.
 Mitotic chromosomes start in a diffuse but spatially ordered state (G1), but ultimately evolve into
compact, side-by-side sister chromatids ready for segregation. We are pursuing our discovery of inter-sister
structure/DNA bridges and their emergence via axial torsional stress by quantitative modeling. Using live cell
imaging of mammalian chromosomes, including our new 4D long timescale platform for fluorescent speckle
microscopy, we are exploring our finding that metaphase chromosomes are folded, not coiled, and will ask
when/how G1 chromosomes acquire their disposition, with/without our proposed compaction/expansion cycles.
 E.coli chromosomes also undergo global compaction/expansion cycles, as we discovered. Now, by
high throughput 4D imaging of cells growing in agarose grooves, and of membrane-enclosed L-forms, we are
investigating the (supercoiling-dependent) mechanism of these cycles; their roles for sister segregation and
cell division; and the roles of nucleoid/membrane interactions in both aspects. We are also working to
reconstitute nucleoid cycles in vitro, and are asking if cycles also occur in other bacteria.
 For many of the above studies, chromosomes can be viewed as mechanical objects, subject to
deforming forces (stresses) that drive local and global movement, abrupt changes or, via stress redistribution,
spatial patterning. To directly detect and analyze such effects, we are developing ZnS-Mn mechano-
luminescent nanocrystals as a non-invasive in vivo stress sensor. Once developed, this tool will be applied to
detection of waves and/or other, yet-to-be imagined, stress patterns in mammalian chromosomes.
 Our unique studies will provide novel entry points into problems of infertility and birth defects (meiosis),
genetic instability and cancer (mitotic cells) and antibiotic resistance (E.coli L-forms)."

This resubmission application, “Safety/toxicology, ADME and CMC activities to support the assessment of the
mGlu2 PAM SBP-9330 in a Phase 2 clinical study in smokers”, is in response to PAR-22-202 and represents the
continuation of our current work funded through 07/31/2023 by U01 DA051077 “Clinical development of an mGlu2
positive allosteric modulator to treat nicotine addiction”. Cigarette smoking remains one of the leading causes of
death and disease worldwide. Only three types of medications for smoking cessation have been approved by
the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (bupropion, varenicline, and nicotine replacement
therapy), all of which have poor efficacy and tolerability. Positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the
metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 2 (mGlu2) decrease nicotine self-administration and cue-induced
reinstatement of nicotine seeking in animal models, providing support for mGlu2 as a valid target for the treatment
of nicotine addiction. Our investigational drug, the small molecule mGlu2 PAM SBP-9330 (characterized during
prior grant U01 DA041731), has recently been evaluated in healthy nonsmokers and smokers in a placebo-
controlled, randomized, and double-blind Phase 1 clinical study (NCT04948827). To date, the data for the healthy
nonsmokers have been unblinded and analyzed, revealing that SBP-9330 was well tolerated, with no serious
adverse events or safety concerns. Human pharmacokinetic data revealed that plasma exposures were nearly
dose-proportional, accumulated approximately 2-fold over 14 days of dosing, and were sufficiently high for
potential efficacy. These promising data support continuation of the clinical development of SBP-9330.The
studies proposed in this grant application are required by the FDA before we can dose SBP-9330 for longer
duration in tobacco smokers in a Phase 2 study and beyond. To this end, our Specific Aims are: (1) Perform the
preclinical absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) studies needed to support the Phase 2
clinical development of SBP-9330 in smokers; (2) Perform the preclinical toxicology studies needed to support
Phase 2 clinical development of SBP-9330 in smokers; and (3) Perform the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and
Controls (CMC) activities needed to support Phase 2 clinical development in smokers. To achieve these Specific
Aims, we have retained the same highly experienced and qualified multidisciplinary team of investigators that
has collaborated productively during the previous grant (U01 DA041731) and the currently active grant (U01
DA051077). We have also compiled an extensive data package to support the further clinical development of
SBP-9330. Achievement of the milestones in this proposal will provide the additional data and drug substance
needed to advance SBP-9330 into a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical study in smokers. Our team has the depth
and breadth of expertise and experience to execute the proposed research plan, as evidenced by the complete
and timely achievement of the milestones for both U01 DA041731 and U01 DA051077 in the past six years."
10830238,"Viral infections have more severe consequences in individuals who have been exposed to cigarette smoke (CS)
than in those not exposed to CS. Acute exacerbations of COPD contributes toward rapid lung function decline.
Surprisingly, the mechanisms that underlie the exaggerated virus-induced responses in CS-exposed individuals
have not been adequately addressed. Our studies demonstrated that viruses cause increased levels of
inflammation, tissue destruction and lung fibrosis in CS exposed mice. We first reported adverse effects of CS
exposure were eliminated by null mutations of mitochondrial antiviral signaling molecule (MAVS), a key adapter
molecule that is bound to the mitochondrial outer membrane and essential for antiviral signaling. To further define
the mechanisms of these responses, on the premise that CS causes alteration of MAVS-mediated signaling, we
have focused on the dysregulation of MAVS-mediated signaling and its regulatory mechanisms in CS-exposed
and CS + virus exposed mice.
 Our studies highlight the following novel insights: (1) CS exposure leads to persistent macrophage
inflammation and increased fibrotic lung changes after influenza virus (Flu); (2) Lung macrophages show
increased MAVS levels which were associated with excessive inflammatory, injury and fibrotic responses during
CS+Flu; (3) Ex vivo lung-derived fibroblasts from CS+Flu have increased proliferation, expression of alpha-
smooth muscle actin stained stress fibers, growth factor expression with pro-fibrotic and pro-proliferative
transcriptomic signature; (4) The prion-like multimeric aggregation of MAVS, a key event in MAVS-mediated
antiviral signaling, is markedly enhanced in mouse lungs exposed to CS+Flu; (5) Lungs from COPD patients
have increased MAVS aggregation; (6) Inflammasomes activation, inflammatory and tissue damage responses
are exaggerated in CS+Flu lungs and involves MAVS; and (7) Phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN)-
induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), an important regulator of mitochondrial health, plays a critical inhibitory role
in regulating MAVS-mediated inflammasomes and pathology.
 Based on these observations, we hypothesize that CS-induced dysregulation of MAVS homeostasis on
mitochondria has a critical functional role in the exaggerated pulmonary inflammation and tissue damage
responses observed in the lungs during viral infection. In Aim 1, we will characterize the dysregulation of
homeostatic regulation of MAVS on mitochondria, the MAVS prion-like aggregation and MAVS- and PINK1-
mediated signaling after CS and influenza virus co-exposure. In Aim 2, we will define the consequences of
PINK1-mediated regulation of MAVS aggregation on pathological pulmonary outcomes in smoke exacerbated
influenza pathology and PINK1 augmentation as a possible therapeutic approach. In Aim 3, we will characterize
MAVS aggregation pathway in patients with smoking exposure and respiratory viral infection.
 These proposed studies will provide new insights into how MAVS regulates macrophage-fibroblast
interactions in CS exposure and virus infected lungs with the hope of developing novel, pathogenesis-based
therapies to improve patient outcomes in diseases such as acute exacerbations of COPD."

10834884,"Adipose tissue has important implications for metabolism and general health. It is now well established that, rather than being a passive tissue for energy storage, as it was once perceived, adipose is a dynamic tissue that responds to changing physiological needs and systemic signals as well as secretes a variety of potent hormones with metabolic implications. The primary cell type within adipose tissue is the adipocyte and more recent advances have elucidated that there is heterogeneity in types of adipocytes, including divergent functional properties. Using cellular energetics to classify types of adipocytes defines two broad categories: adipocytes that store energy (‘white’ adipocytes) and adipocytes that disperse energy (‘brown’ adipocytes). Perhaps most intriguingly, more than one type of adipocyte can reside within a single adipose depot; in particular, within subcutaneous adipose depots in rodents, which are primarily white, there are also adipocytes that have properties of brown adipocytes, referred to as brown-in-white (‘brite’) or ‘beige’ adipocytes. Furthermore, the number of these adipocytes is dynamic, responding to changes in the systemic signals and environments. As the number of individuals with obesity continues to rise, the potential implications of adipocytes that disperse energy has generated enthusiasm for elucidating this biology in detail with the expectation that this knowledge will provide a foundation for the development of novel therapeutic approaches, in addition to advancing our understanding of cell and molecular biology in general. Yet, there is a knowledge gap in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that direct this important process. There is an additional knowledge gap in our understanding of how physiological systemic signals converge on these mechanistic pathways. Using a conditional deletion mouse model, we identified Klf15 as a potent regulator of the generation of beige adipocytes. We will use state-of-the-art molecular and cell biology approaches to expose the mechanisms by which Klf15 regulates this process"
10834886,"PROJECT SUMMARY
ERK (Extracellular signal Regulated Kinase) signaling is critical for female fertility and normal embryonic
morphogenesis. Two key events that ERK signaling regulates to control female fertility are (a) progression of
female meiosis I and (b) resumption of oocyte meiosis after prolonged arrest (also called oocyte meiotic
maturation). Stereotypical execution of meiosis I requires that homologous chromosomes pair, align, form
physical connections, exchange genetic information and segregate homologs into gametes. Mis-regulation of
any of these steps results in failures in chromosome segregation causing severe developmental disorders, e.g.,
the Down’s syndrome. We find that loss of erk signaling results in failure of chromosomes to maintain synapsis
causing embryonic lethality. In addition to meiosis I progression, ERK activation is essential for oocyte
development and resumption after prolonged arrest in meiosis I. Oocytes arrest in meiosis I for decades in
humans, an event that is critical for reproductive fitness of the species. Meiosis I is then resumed as the oocyte
matures and the process of oocyte meiotic resumption or maturation is coordinated through hormonal signaling
and ERK activation. Failure of oocytes to either undergo arrest or fail in meiotic maturation results in female
sterility or birth defects. Inappropriate ERK signaling results in defects in oocyte meiotic maturation causing
sterility or birth defects. Determining the proteins that ERK phosphorylates and regulates to mediate these two
events that control female fertility and embryonic morphogenesis will guide not only our understanding of female
reproduction but also provide effective measures to modulate the pathway for interventions. We identified two
proteins RbAp46 and RbAp48 as ERK substrates that regulate chromosome dynamics during meiosis I and
oocyte meiotic maturation respectively. RbAp46/RbAp48 are paralogous proteins that function as histone
chaperones in the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and Nucelosome Remodeling Complex (NuRD) in
worms and mammals to regulate epigenetic marks and transcriptional silencing, this is the first description of (i)
their regulation by ERK signaling and (ii) their function in regulating female meiosis I and oocyte maturation. The
goal of this proposal is to understand the genetic and molecular basis of these functions."

 UT Health San Antonio (UTHSA), St. Mary’s University (StMU), and Our Lady of the Lake University (OLLU)
developed the San Antonio Biomedical Education and Research (SABER) postdoctoral training program 4
years ago. SABER combines mentored training in state-of-the-art research with innovative pedagogic teaching
methods and guided teaching experiences. UTHSA, StMU, and OLLU are all Hispanic-Serving Institutions
(HSIs), a direct reflection of the regional population; San Antonio is the 7th largest city in the United States with
the largest Hispanic population in a Hispanic-majority city. UTHSA is also the only Tier-One research
university in South Texas and has a strong culture of educational excellence. Many alumni occupy faculty
positions at local institutions that predominantly serve Hispanic undergraduate students. The unique training
environments at UTHSA, StMU and OLLU promote faculty and trainee sensitivity to the needs of a large and
rapidly expanding population of Hispanic students. Hispanics accounted for half of the country’s growth in the
last decade and college enrollment of Hispanics is at an all-time high. However, Hispanics are
underrepresented at all levels of the scientific community. SABER has been highly successful in achieving the
overarching goal of the IRACDA program which is to prepare “a diverse and accomplished pool of scholars for
academic careers that closes the gap between the aspirations and achievements of undergraduates in our
region”. Seventeen (17) postdoctoral fellows were recruited into the SABER program; 10 were female, 8 were
from underrepresented groups and 10 were doctorally-prepared outside UTHSA. Moreover, 4 out of 5 SABER
alumni advanced into highly competitive faculty positions. The skills and knowledge gained in the SABER
infrastructure have been leveraged and integrated into the standard research training environment at UTHSA.
SABER positively impacted the scientific curricula at OLLU and StMU, increased research opportunities for
undergraduates and fostered faculty research. The programmatic goals of this successful training program are
to build on its achievements and amplify its impact with the following Objectives: 1) Expand the recruitment of
highly qualified SABER postdoctoral trainees. 2) Provide exemplary research, teacher, and professional
training for Scholars interested in academic careers at either primarily undergraduate institutions (PUI) or
research-intensive institutions (RII). 3) Build undergraduate research, foster research collaborations and
professional development of faculty as well as enhance the implementation of impactful research-based
science curricula using evidence-based teaching strategies at our Partner Institutions. 4) Expand the linkages
within SABER to regional academic institutions. Successful completion of these objectives will continue to
benefit all participating and regional academic institutions, and enhance the collective biomedical research
environment and academic community in South Texas."
10834996,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There are over 18 million Latinos under the age of 18 in the US, and they make up one-fourth of the total youth
population. There is consistent and rigorous evidence that Latino youth have historically had the worst patterns
of health care access and utilization of any group of youth, even after controlling for variables such as
insurance and family income. Access to care is even worse for the over 50% of Latino youth who have
immigrant parents. These disparities are likely the result of multiple levels of youth and family, community,
policy and societal factors. There is a dearth of evidence, however, on both the individual influence and the
joint influence of these levels. California is an ideal state in which to study the complexities of access to care
for Latino youth because it has the largest Latino and immigrant populations in the country with considerable
variability in family citizenship and documentation compositions. State and national health surveys do not
commonly measure the many dimensions of family citizenship and documentation statuses and health care
eligibility, and these surveys generally have limited measures of health care access and utilization at the youth-
and family-levels. The California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) is the largest annual representative statewide
health survey in the country and collects data on youth and parent citizenship and documentation statuses,
which allows for the unique opportunity to examine the effects of variabilities in family citizenship and
documentation statuses on health care access and utilization for youth. We plan to conduct a follow-up study
of 1,000 Latino youth and their families in the 2021 and 2022 CHIS waves. Our approach will allow us to
combine baseline CHIS data with newly collected data from follow-up interviews and county-level data to
examine disparities in youth's access to and utilization of health care. We will also determine how disparities
vary by youth, parent and sibling citizenship and documentation compositions and the extent to which youth
and family, community, policy and societal factors influence them. Using the NIMHD Research Framework and
Warnecke et al.'s model for population health and health disparities, we will address 4 specific aims in the
context of families' citizenship and documentation status compositions: 1) estimating the disparities in access
to and utilization of health care for Latino youth according to youth- and family-level factors; 2) understanding
the processes and facilitators that increase the likelihood that Latino youth access and use services; 3)
identifying how parental trust in health systems and institutions influence the determinants of health care
access and utilization for Latino youth; and 4) understanding how variations in county-level policy and societal
contexts influence health services use for Latino youth. The project will provide critical information on how the
effects of multiple levels of influence affect access and utilization of care for Latino youth and will offer
evidence to guide policy and practice interventions to improve access to care for Latino youth."

Illegal use of cocaine and other drugs is a worldwide health problem. The National Institute on Drug Abuse
estimates the total costs of drug abuse and addiction due to use of tobacco, alcohol and illegal drugs at $820
billion a year, making substance abuse the most costly public health problem in the nation. Illicit drug use alone
accounts for $193 billion in health care, productivity loss, crime, incarceration, and drug enforcement. In
humans, susceptibility to the effects of cocaine and other drugs has a strong genetic component, but little
progress has been made in identifying the underlying variants and genes, in part due to difficulty in obtaining
sufficiently large sample sizes because of criminalization of substance abuse; variation in drug exposure,
including simultaneous exposure to multiple drugs, alcohol and nicotine; and comorbidity with other
neuropsychiatric disorders. These problems can be mitigated using model organisms, such as Drosophila
melanogaster. In addition to benefits of low rearing costs, small size and a short generation interval, Drosophila
has a wealth of publically available genetic resources. Importantly, many effects of psychostimulants on people
are replicated in flies. Approximately 67% of fly genes have human orthologs, and therefore insights gained
from Drosophila have translational potential. During the past period of support, we have used the D.
melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel of inbred wild-derived fly strains with fully sequenced genomes, and
outbred advanced intercross populations (AIPs) derived from DGRP lines, to perform genome wide association
(GWA) analyses of drug consumption behaviors and gene expression. These analyses showed that variants
associated with drug consumption phenotypes were largely located in non-coding genomic regions, and
presumably exert their phenotypic effects via modulation of gene regulation. We derived gene regulatory
networks from naturally occurring genetic variation in gene expression and constructed an atlas of gene
expression changes in the Drosophila brain following cocaine exposure at single cell resolution. The challenge
now is to understand how variants act jointly to affect variation in drug preference, and to determine the
underlying molecular networks using systems genetics analyses. Here, we propose to use 1200 new DGRP
lines to map naturally occurring variants and genes associated with cocaine preference with greatly increased
power and precision than our previous studies, perform a systems genetic analysis to infer causal regulatory
networks associated with cocaine preference, and use germline gene editing to prove causality of the genetic
associations with cocaine preference and gene regulatory networks. Information obtained from these studies
can serve as a blueprint for subsequent translational studies in mammalian systems and human populations
based on orthology and evolutionary conservation of fundamental biological processes, and expand the
genetic framework associated with variation in human drug susceptibility beyond the narrow range of candidate
genes examined to date."

In this renewal application, we describe an enhanced educational framework for the training, nurturing, and
support of talented University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) faculty scholars poised to embark on research careers in
women’s health across the lifespan. We have built our program on an unparalleled foundation in reproductive
sciences and women’s health research led by Magee-Womens Research Institute (MWRI). Located at the
center of Pitt’s campus, MWRI is immediately adjacent to Magee-Womens Hospital of the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), one of the nation’s most robust integrated healthcare systems. Our 71
primary MWRI researchers are fully engaged in basic, translational, clinical, health services, and community-
oriented research, supported by Pitt’s six Health Sciences and Engineering Schools. With MWRI as the
programmatic hub of BIRCWH@Pitt, we have markedly strengthened our women’s health network and created
new and exciting investigative nodes within Pitt’s Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI). We
embarked on new initiatives to support and enhance training on social and moral determinants of health in
diverse populations, developed new educational opportunities, strengthened inclusive research within CTSI,
with a vanguard emphasis on women’s health across the lifespan. We have deepened our training in the
incorporation of sex and gender as biological variables and expanded our special enrichment tools, designed
to spark each scholar’s imagination in new inquires and career paths. We have developed innovative tools that
better connect the promise of scientific discoveries with people and communities. Our novel model of
community partnership brings researchers and community members together as allies in the scientific pursuit.
We have taken our engagement of underrepresented minorities to a higher level, at both the trainee and
Advisory Committee level. Together, our innovative platforms enable us to focus on our long-term objectives of
education, intellectual stimulation, hands-on training, intense career development toward academic
independence, promotion of new synergies, and a full realization of collaborative, dynamic, and meaningful
engagement. To accommodate an expected heterogeneity in scholars’ academic backgrounds and career
goals, we have crafted individually tailored development plans of 2–5 years, adjusted to accommodate the
expertise and training of the anticipated five or six scholars. A team of mentors with varied yet complementary
skills is fitted to support each scholar. Resources garnered through our program are shared with other trainees
at MWRI, across Pitt’s Health Sciences Schools, and at the Latinx-abundant Ponce Health Sciences University
in Puerto Rico. Together, BIRCWH@Pitt emphasizes imaginative, inclusive thinking, cross-fertilization, and
collaboration that bridges basic and clinical sciences and serves to propel our scholars to successful careers in
impactful women’s health research."

Human germline cells are essential for human reproduction as only these cells are capable of differentiating
into gametes and transmitting DNA from parent to child. The pioneering cells of the human germline begin to
form during prenatal life when a small number of embryonic cells are set aside around the time of embryo
implantation and gastrulation in a process known as human primordial germ cell (hPGC) specification. This
critical event in human germline cell development has a tremendous impact on an individual's future
reproductive health as a failure in hPGC specification causes certain infertility. In this competitive renewal, the
goal is to increase our fundamental knowledge on the cell and molecular basis of hPGC specification. Based
on experimental results in the previous funding period, we aim to use human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)
and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and the differentiation of hPGC-like cells (hPGCLCs) to
achieve this goal. The overall hypothesis is that non-rodent and human-specific molecular events have
evolved to regulate hPGC specification. Given that the focus of this grant is largely on regions of the genome
that are uniquely human, this project is perfectly suited to the use of human cell-based models. In aim 1, the
hypothesis to be addressed is that TFAP2C-bound human-specific retrotransposons regulate hPGC
specification. In aim 2, the hypothesis to be addressed is that the expression of TFAP2C bound
retrotransposons are regulated by targeted changes to the epigenome during hPGCLC differentiation. In the
third aim, we will evaluate the relationship between TFAP2C and SOX17 in hPGC specification, with the
hypothesis that TFAP2C functions upstream of SOX17 in a lineage primed hPGC progenitor to regulate
specification of hPGCs. In summary, this competitive renewal builds upon success from the first funding
period to contribute essential knowledge on the identification of new loci in the human genome that have
evolved to regulate the specification and identity of hPGCs."

Candidate. Dr. Puja Chebrolu is a physician-scientist who has spent the past five years conducting research
on HIV and diabetes in India. She has conducted longitudinal research, developed strong scientific
collaborations with Indian scientists, trained an Indian research team, and authored 10 publications. She has
documented that HIV increases the risk of gestational diabetes (GDM). She hypothesizes that HIV will also
increase the risk of prediabetes (preDM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) development postpartum.
Career Development Plan. Dr. Chebrolu's immediate and long-term goals are the following:
1) Increase her understanding of HIV-associated diabetes epidemiology and pathogenesis.
2) Increase her skills in advanced biostatistics for longitudinal data
3) Obtain training in the conduct of clinical trials
4) Develop professional skills including leadership and mentorship
Dr. Chebrolu will develop these skills through coursework and implementation of her longitudinal study on time
course and predictors of progression to postpartum preDM and T2DM in women living with HIV and GDM.
Environment. The proposed research and training will take place at Weill Cornell Medicine (USA) and at
Byramjee Jeejeebhoy Government Medical College (India). Dr. Chebrolu's mentors have expertise that
encompass her goals. They have worked with her and each other previously.
Research. Over
data
two-thirds of women who develop GDM will progress to T2DM within 10 years.
suggests that HIV doubles the risk of GDM
Dr. Chebrolu's
, and is associated with increased risk of progression to T2DM.
The impact of HIV on postpartum progression to preDM and T2DM is not known. Preliminary data suggests
that South Asian women progress to T2DM faster than obese populations due to low baseline pancreatic beta
cell mass. HIV increases beta cell stress through multiple mechanisms and may further accelerate the rate of
progression to T2DM. Understanding
progression
its
the impact of HIV on the time course and pathophysiology of T2DM
will help inform the timing and type of interventions to prevent or delay progression to T2DM and
devastating sequelae.
Aim 1: Estimate the time to progression to postpartum prediabetes and T2DM in 180 women with a history of
GDM (60 women with HIV and 120 women without HIV). We will test for prediabetes and T2DM at 5 timepoints
over 2 years postpartum. This aim will test the hypothesis that hazard of progression to prediabetes or T2DM
will be significantly higher in women with GDM and HIV compared to women with GDM and without HIV.
Aim 2: Determine the effect of HIV on longitudinal beta cell function in women with a history GDM. The primary
hypothesis is that women with HIV and GDM will have a greater rate of decline in pancreatic beta cell function
over 2 years postpartum compared to women with GDM and without HIV."

Peripheral neuropathies are the most frequent neurological complications associated with HIV, within which
HIV sensory neuropathy (HIV-SN) is the most common form, affecting nearly half of HIV/AIDS patients with the
prevalence ranging from 1.2 – 69.4%. HIV-SN frequently manifests with hard-to-manage pain and is often
under-diagnosed and/or under-treated, yet, the large variation in prevalence does not allow for detection of
significant differences in prevalence between HAART-exposed vs. HAART-non-exposed individuals. There is
no specific FDA-approved treatment for HIV-SN. Tat, trans-activator of transcription, a regulatory protein
among the first proteins expressed following HIV infection, is a key activator of HIV transcription and can affect
both HIV infected cells and non-infected neighboring cells via its secretion by infected cells. Although human
studies are lacking, recent animal studies using two models of doxycycline-inducible HIV-1 Tat transgenic
(iTat) mice from our lab and others provided convincing evidence that HIV Tat contributes to the development
of HIV-SN. Therefore, in this proposal, we will further investigate the underlying mechanisms of Tat-associated
SN. Our preliminary study identified potential regulation of Tat of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway.
Given the widely accepted involvement of TLR pathway in neuropathic pain and surprising lack of studies
exploring the role of TLR pathway in HIV-SN, we will focus on TLR pathway in Tat-associated SN in this study.
We will take advantage of bioinformatic tools to identify FDA-approved drugs without significant interactions
with existing antiretroviral drugs that could potentially reverse Tat-induced changes in TLR pathway, and then
test their effectiveness in treating Tat-associated SN in vivo. Altogether, we hypothesize that TLR signaling
pathway is involved in the development of HIV-Tat-associated SN and it is possible to identify potential
treatment for HIV-SN by examining existing drugs via a combined bioinformatics and pre-clinical model
approach. This will be tested through 2 Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine the contribution of Tollip (a key
regulator of TLR pathway)-regulated TLR pathways in HIV Tat-associated SN using genetically modified
animal models in combination with behavioral and physiological tests. Aim 2 will identify potential drugs for
HIV-SN by targeting TLR pathway via a combined bioinformatics and pre-clinical model approach. If
successful, we will fill in the knowledge gaps regarding Tat-associated SN and TLRs’ role in HIV-SN. Our
comprehensive combination drug discovery strategy will help identify potential drugs for HIV-SN, which can be
further tested in other animal models before clinical assessment. Throughout the process, we will prioritize
drug candidates that are mechanistically-sound, and potentially easily accessible to all patients."
10835980,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The “pillars of aging” hypothesis entails that chronic unresolved inflammation, coupled with metabolic
dysfunction and macromolecular damage are among the key mechanisms that impairs cellular renewal and
regenerative processes that contribute to aging and chronic diseases. Inflammation is a protective mechanism
that has evolved to protect against pathogens and tissue injury that enables a host to survive life-threatening
challenges by restoration of homeostasis. How then does a protective response like inflammation become
chronic, drive aging and serve as a trigger of chronic disease? In absence of overt infections in aging,
alterations in the gut microbiota (dysbiosis) or potential translocation of microbiota derived PAMPs to liver,
mesenteric and omental adipose tissue could contribute to the mechanism of age-related inflammation. In line
with this possibility, recent studies have demonstrated profound changes in the microbiome associated with
aging and suggest that the microbiome may play a causal role in certain aspects of inflammaging. We recently
discovered that aging is associated with formation of tertiary lymphoid structures, called Fat-associated
lymphoid clusters (FALCs), in the visceral adipose tissue. The FALCs, unlike lymph nodes are disorganized
non-encapsulated non-classical lymphoid tissues associated to adipocytes contain T cells, B cell and
macrophages. Moreover, we found that B cells expand with age in the FALCs and display a unique
transcriptional profile reminiscent of antigen-experienced B cells. Based on our original findings, the central
hypothesis of this application is that translocation of gut microbes to visceral adipose tissue results in FALC
formation and age-related inflammation leading to metabolic dysfunction. We will test the mechanism of how
preventing the translocation of microbiota protects against FALC formation and inflammaging."
10835981,"PROJECT SUMMARY
About 250,000 anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries occur annually in the United States and are primarily
treated with a surgical reconstruction (ACLR). However, for at least 1 in 3 young adults with an ACLR, the injury
and surgery are pivotal life events that lead to chronic pain, diminished long-term quality of life, and an increased
risk for osteoarthritis (OA). The 1st year post-ACLR is critical to a patient’s long-term outcomes as there is
evidence that levels of pain and quality of life experienced at 1 year post-ACLR will remain unchanged for up to
10 years. Additionally, at 1 year post-ACLR, ~33% of young adults present with knee structural pathologies.
Unfortunately, there are no evidence-based strategies to identify people during the 1st year post-ACLR who are
at risk for chronic symptoms or structural pathology. Hence, we cannot identify susceptible populations and lack
critical insights into which modifiable risk factors could decrease their risk and prevent lifelong disability.
Potentially modifiable risk factors that are common throughout the 1st year post-ACLR are alterations in walking
biomechanics and insufficient levels of physical activity. Since poor symptoms and pre-radiographic structural
pathology are risk factors for the development of knee OA, understanding modifiable risk factors that relate to
poor symptomatic and structural outcomes during the 1st year post-ACLR is needed for future studies to identify
therapies that prevent OA. The objective of this study is to determine how longitudinal changes in PA and walking
biomechanics assessed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-ACLR relate to poor symptomatic or structural outcomes
during the 1st year post-ACLR. This will be the first study that applies the following outcomes to young adults at
multiple visits during the 1st year post-ACLR: 1) classification criteria for early OA symptoms, 2) clinically
accessible whole-knee ultrasound scoring system to detect multiple structural pathologies. PA will be assessed
with research-grade accelerometers to quantify steps per day and weekly minutes of moderate to vigorous PA
during a 7-day period following each study visit. Walking biomechanics will be assessed in a motion capture
laboratory to quantify vertical ground reaction force and internal knee adduction moment. My central hypothesis
is that participants with a moderate change in PA and walking biomechanics post-ACLR will be less likely to
have poor symptomatic and structural outcomes during the 1st year when compared to people with a rapid
increase or no change in PA and walking biomechanics. The expected outcome of this work is to identify: 1) at-
risk patients post-ACLR who are the ideal participants for clinical trials aimed at preventing poor symptomatic
and structural outcomes, and 2) when PA or walking biomechanics need to be targeted during the 1st year post-
ACLR. This proposal will also provide the PI with the training and mentoring to develop a novel skill set in whole-
knee ultrasound imaging, device-based PA monitoring, longitudinal data analyses, and clinical trial design. This
training and mentoring will directly lead to an R34 clinical trial planning grant to develop a clinical trial using gait
retraining or PA promotion to prevent poor symptomatic or structural outcomes in high-risk patients post-ACLR."
10835909,"ABSTRACT
While considerable evidence demonstrates that CD8+ TILs reactive to mutated or non-mutated tumor antigens
play an important role in anti-tumor immunity, expanding evidence indicates that bona fide tumor-reactive T
cells comprise only a minor fraction of all TILs in many human tumors, indicating that most CD8+ TILs have
undefined specificity. Based on this long-standing question, we examined the hypothesis that a substantial
fraction of TILs may represent CD8+ ""memory-phenotype"" T cells (CD8-MP cells), a unique population of cells
of unknown antigen specificity that comprise 5-10% of CD8+ T cells in unprimed mice, exhibit common
hallmarks of prior antigen experience, and have the capacity to rapidly expand and produce IFN-γ during an
immune response. In preliminary work, we found that CD8-MP cells make substantial contributions to the
immune infiltrate of oncogene-driven prostate tumors, and express high densities of the PD-1 inhibitory
receptor. Given these unique insights, we embarked on parallel studies aimed at further elucidating the
fundamental biology of CD8-MP cells, using a clonal approach to define the developmental trajectories of
these cells. Our new data reveal that the differentiation of many CD8-MP clones is triggered by recognition of
self-ligands in the thymus via a reproducible, orchestrated process, challenging current thought suggesting that
CD8-MP cells differentiate in the periphery in response to homeostatic signals. In Aim 1, we will define the
function of CD8-MP cells in anti-tumor immunity, testing the hypothesis that self-ligand recognition drives the
early entry of CD8-MP cells into developing tumors, and that CD8-MP cells enhance anti-tumor immunity by
catalyzing broader immune cell infiltration. In addition, we will identify novel markers that can be used to
identify intratumoral CD8-MP cells, thereby enabling the broader study of CD8-MP cells in murine cancer
models and human cancer patients. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms that
direct CD8-MP differentiation, testing the hypothesis that CD8-MP differentiation is a two-step process
triggered by TCR-dependent recognition of self-ligands presented by classical dendritic cells in the thymus. We
will also utilize a unique T cell antigen discovery assay to identify natural self-peptides recognized by CD8-MP
cells, thereby opening new areas of inquiry that were previously inaccessible. Ultimately, defining the function
of intratumoral CD8-MP cells and the blueprints of CD8-MP differentiation in mice is expected to open new
avenues for the study and manipulation of these cells in humans."
10835910,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major global health problem despite of
effective HBV vaccine, affecting 240 million people worldwide and 1.25 million Americans. HBV
is a leading cause of liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC). Prophylactic HBV vaccine is effective to prevent new HBV infection but does
not offer therapeutic benefit to the hundreds of million people already infected with HBV. Current
antiviral drugs consisting of interferon and nucleoside analogues are not curative of hepatitis B.
The World Health Organization has called for the elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health
threat by 2030. The biggest challenge for a cure of hepatitis B is how to eliminate HBV covalently
closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which is the molecular basis for persistent viral replication. Thus,
there is an urgent need to discover and develop new classes of more efficacious antiviral drugs
for curing hepatitis B. The lack of robust cell culture and small animal models of HBV propagation
is a major barrier towards finding a cure for hepatitis B. Recently, we have developed a robust
HBV cell culture system. More significantly, we have discovered that human apolipoprotein E
(apoE) is enriched on the HBV envelope and promotes HBV infection and production. Our
preliminary studies also found that the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and several core
proteins of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are important for HBV infection. We
hypothesize that the LDLR family proteins and HSPGs serve as cell surface receptors promoting
HBV infection. Our overall goal is to determine the roles and underlying molecular mechanism
of the LDLR family proteins and HSPGs in HBV infection in vitro and in vivo. This objective will be
addressed by three specific aims: 1) to determine the importance and molecular mechanism of
the LDLR family proteins in HBV infection; 2) to define the role and molecular basis of HSPGs in
HBV infection; and 3) to determine the physiological importance of LDLR in HBV infection in vivo
using humanized mice and a new transgenic HBV mouse model. The successful completion of
this application will fill a knowledge gap about new HBV attachment receptors and provide novel
targets and transgenic HBV mouse model for discovery and development of new therapeutics
towards a cure of chronic hepatitis B."
10836020,"With effective ART, HIV infected persons can achieve a near normal life span but have increasing incidence
of comorbidities and co-infections that occur earlier, are more frequent than the general population.
Underlying inflammation is considered to be a major factor for comorbidities, but less well appreciated is the
associated immune deficiency that persist even after durable virologic control, putting people living with HIV
(PWH) at greater risk for influenza, for which flu vaccinations are recommended. Besides decreasing risk for
influenza infection, flu vaccines can serve as probes for testing host immune competence an approach used
in this proposal and in a previous project (AI108472) for assessing immunity in PWH and we could classify
participants as vaccine responders (VR) and vaccine non-responders (VNR). We observed that aging and
HIV had a negative effect on vaccine response. In studying mechanisms of immune defects in VNR, we
identified quantitative and qualitative defects in peripheral T follicular helper cells (pTfh), which are a subset
of CD4 T cells that are essential for vaccine-induced antibody (Ab) responses. The pTfh displayed a
skewed polarization away from a favorable IL-21 secreting phenotype towards a detrimental IL-2 secreting
Th1 phenotype, coupled with abundance of inflammatory markers, resulting in failure of pTfh to provide B
cells with the helper signals required for Ab secretion. Our central hypothesis is that skewed polarization of
pTfh away from a favorable IL-21 secreting phenotype towards one of IL-2 and inflammation is detrimental,
worsens with age or HIV but is amenable to change by ex-vivo and in-vivo manipulation. We will recruit HIV
negative and virally suppressed HIV+ populations to address key questions on Ab response following
seasonal influenza vaccination. The project has 3 aims: Aim 1 will investigate cell-intrinsic properties of pTfh
cells that influence their function in the context of age, HIV infection and the generation of memory B cells.
Aim 2 will investigate VNR to define mechanism of pTfh dysfunction via study of cellular and molecular
interactions affecting pTfh function and will test in-vitro interventions to reverse the pTfh dysfunction. Aim 3
will test whether administering high dose flu vaccine improves immune response in VNR from all groups
and will investigate the immune mechanisms affected. In this project we will evaluate immune cell
populations of interest using a combination of technologies including multi-parameter flow cytometry, single
cell RNA sequencing, repertoire sequencing, monoclonal Ab generation and cell co- cultures to gain high
resolution datasets. Our approach will obtain a snapshot of immune perturbation of pTfh cells in aging and
HIV infection. In vitro studies with purified cell subsets will allow for mechanistic evaluation of the immune
system. These studies are feasible, given our expertise in the technologies described, access to desired
population and resources for bioinformatics and data integration. We expect to provide novel insights into
immune perturbations that will help in strategizing vaccine approaches in aging populations."

SUMMARY
The Data Management Core aims to provide comprehensive data management and statistical support for the
ICEMR program, establishing a centralized data management system for laboratory and field activities to collect
and archive data and specimens from all study sites. It will collaborate with investigators and field leaders on
study design, protocol development, training, and biostatistical analyses while maintaining rigorous standard
operating procedures and data quality assurance processes to ensure uniformity, timely reporting, and secure
data and specimen archiving. The Core has been critical to the success of the existing Southeast Asia ICEMR
program, and this proposal will leverage shared resources and qualified personnel to reduce costs and increase
efficiency. Benefiting from the ongoing ICEMR, our investigators have established data management SOPs. The
proposed ICEMR Data Management Systems (DMS) will be based on these SOPs, with additional hardware
and software acquisition. It will integrate with the existing infrastructure of partner institutions, maximizing the
scientific potential of data and proliferating the FAIR-sharing principle throughout the malaria research
community. The specific aims are: (1) developing a centralized and standardized data acquisition and
management system through an electronic data capture framework for all ICEMR activities; (2) providing
biostatistical support and training for conducting rigorous biostatistical analyses that address research questions
across projects."
10836378,"JMJD3 (KDM6B) is a chromatin regulator with roles central to normal development as well as a wide range of
human diseases including cancer and human neurological disorders. For instance, mutations in JMJD3 are
autosomal recessive for familial intellectual disability, and de novo JMJD3 mutations are associated with
autism spectrum disorder (ASD). An important next step to understanding genetic causes of complex diseases
is to study disease-associated genes in mouse models. While it is known that JMJD3 is important to certain
aspects of neural cell development, whether JMJD3 deficiency can actually cause cognitive dysfunction has
not been known. Preliminary Studies indicate that JMJD3 is critical for the development of the mouse
hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). In the DG, granule neurons are generated throughout life from a population
of neural stem cells (NSCs). Defective DG neurogenesis impairs many hippocampal-dependent behaviors and
has been associated with cognitive deficits including that of intellectual disability and ASD. Without Jmjd3,
NSCs failed to become established in the adult DG, and granule neuron production was severely decreased
and abnormal. In these mice, hippocampal-dependent learning was defective. Heterozygous deletion of
Jmjd3 also resulted in abnormal postnatal DG development, indicating that this process is sensitive to gene
dosage. Aim 1 is to determine the role of Jmjd3 in DG neurogenesis. In vivo experiments will test the
hypothesis that Jmjd3 regulates the postnatal expansion and establishment of the DG NSC population, and
that even reduced Jmjd3 gene dosage causes cognitive dysfunction. Single cell RNA sequencing analysis will
provide molecular insights into the observed phenotype and help guide mechanistic studies of Aim 2. Aim 2 is
to determine the mechanisms by which JMJD3 regulates gene expression. JMJD3 has demethylase activity for
histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), which is a chromatin modification associated with
transcriptional repression. To investigate demethylase-dependent and potential demethylase-independent
activities of JMJD3, we have developed innovative CRISPR-based technologies to recruit JMJD3 proteins to
the genome. By developing a novel, easy-to-use method for mapping lamina-associated domains (LADs) – a
repressive nuclear compartment – we have also found that JMJD3 in NSCs is enriched at the genomic LAD
“borders,” which are genomic regions enriched for transcriptional regulatory elements. Thus, we propose
investigating the role of JMJD3 in regulating this aspect of higher-order chromatin structure. The proposed
neurodevelopmental and behavioral analyses combined with mechanistic studies is expected to provide a
scientific framework in which to begin understanding how human JMJD3 mutations can cause disease. The
studies of JMJD3 mechanism is also expected to be important to the broader field of chromatin-based
epigenetics as well as nuclear compartment-associated genome organization – an emerging area of research."
10836381,"Project Summary
 Epigenetic mechanisms, in particular the ones mediated by Histone modifications, have emerged as an
essential layer of gene expression control mechanism. In the skin, several Histone modifications such as
H3K27me3 and Histone deacetylase such as HDAC1/2/3 have been studied. These elegant studies have
not only provided novel insights into important functions of epigenetic mechanisms in the skin but also
established skin as an excellent model system to study epigenetic mechanisms in a spatiotemporally well-
defined tissue. However, our understanding of epigenetic mechanisms in the skin is incomplete. The
functions of numerous Histone marks and their associated modifying enzymes are unknown. Among them,
Histone 4 Lysine16 acetylation (H4K16Ac) is particularly notable for its key role in regulating chromatin
compaction. Structural and biophysical studies indicate that H4K16Ac plays an essential role in transcription
activation by influencing both nucleosome structure and interaction with chromatin-binding proteins.
H4K16Ac is catalyzed by the MYST-family lysine acetyltransferase MOF (also known as KAT8), which is
broadly conserved in fly, mouse and human. The function of MOF and its catalyzed H4K16Ac mark is first
studied in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, where H4K16Ac mark is found to coat the male X-
chromosome and elevate transcription by two-fold tomediate sex dosage compensation. However, the
function of MOF and H4K16Ac is not limited to X-chromosome genes for dosage compensation. MOF and
H4K16Ac have been shown to control many genes involved in the regulation of embryonic stem cells, liver
development, pericyte development among many others in mouse and human. The overarching goal of this
application is to determine the role of MOF and H4K16Ac mediated transcriptional control in epidermal
development. During our preliminary study, we have discovered that genetic deletion of MOF causes severe
defects in epidermal adhesion, differentiation and morphogenesis. In thisapplication, we will elucidate
molecular mechanisms and cellular functions of MOF/H4K16Ac during epidermal development. We propose
to 1) investigate the role of MOF in epidermal development; 2) Determine the mechanism of MOF in
governing ciliogenesis and mitochondrial functions; and 3) Elucidate the epigenetic mechanism of MOF-
mediated gene expression control. Combining our expertise in mouse genetics, transcriptional and
epigenetic regulation, epithelial biology, genomics and computational biology, we will provide genetic,
genomic and molecular insights into a critical epigenetic mechanism governing mammalian skin
development."
10836478,"To avoid post-operative language impairments after surgery for drug-resistant epilepsy, electrical cortical
stimulation mapping (ESM) is widely relied upon to localize language cortex, but ESM often elicits after-
discharges (ADs), seizures, involuntary movements, and pain, which can limit mapping and impact patient
safety. Furthermore, ESM is time-consuming and usually produces all-or-none results, providing limited insight
into the function of stimulated sites. Finally, up to 30% of patients can have language dysfunction after resections
that are guided by ESM. These limitations have motivated an alternative mapping method based on task-related
power changes in high-gamma frequencies (≈50-200 Hz), which are highly correlated with neuronal population
firing rate changes. Although high-gamma mapping (HGM) overcomes the aforementioned limitations of ESM,
its clinical validation has been limited to ESM-HGM comparisons in small case series with significant variations
in technique across centers, yielding inconsistent results, with unexplained discrepancies between methods.
Moreover, neither HGM nor ESM have been prospectively validated for predicting post-operative language
impairments with either subdural electrocorticography (ECoG) or stereo-EEG (sEEG, increasingly a safer
alternative to ECoG). The overall objective of this study is to use a small consortium of three large academic
epilepsy surgery centers to demonstrate the diagnostic validity and safety of iEEG HGM for both ECoG and
sEEG in a prospective series of 221 patients, using an innovative browser-based bedside HGM system to
standardize methods and share data across centers. This study will test the hypothesis that HGM can accurately
predict post-surgical language outcomes but requires a different framework for interpretation than that used for
ESM. First, using traditional methods for interpreting HGM results, we will test the concordance between HGM
and ESM, and compare their safety and feasibility. Based on previous studies, we predict that HGM will be a
good, but imperfect, predictor of ESM results. However, we predict that due to ESM-related seizures and
differences in mapping duration, HGM will be safer and better tolerated by patients. Second, we will test models
that attempt to explain and reconcile HGM false negatives and false positives with respect to ESM, and we will
test whether these models, incorporating both functional activation (HGM) and effective connectivity (measured
with cortico-cortical evoked potentials, or CCEPs) can better predict ESM results. Third, we will develop and
test models for prediction of post-operative language outcomes, based on the anatomical extent and volume of
cortical resection with respect to HGM and ESM results, using voxel-lesion-symptom matching (VLSM). Since
clinical decisions are currently based on ESM and clinicians will be blinded to HGM, we predict that the incidence
of language deficits will be significantly higher when HGM+ electrodes are resected. This study will have a direct
and profound impact on the clinical practice of language mapping for neurosurgical procures, while contributing
valuable insights into the structure and dynamics of human language networks."

Embryos and organs are shaped by complex collective cell movements involving the coordinated action
of thousands of cells over space and time. Impairments in collective cell motion underlie many
structural birth defects, the most common of which is the failure to close the neural tube leading to
spina bifida, exencephaly, or most severely craniorachischisis. One of the key challenges in
developmental biology and tissue engineering is understanding the molecular mechanisms by which
cells coordinate their behaviors across thousands of cells to generate large-scale changes in tissue
forms through local changes in subcellular organization. The planar cell polarity pathway (PCP) has
emerged as a key regulator that organizes individual cell behaviors into large-scale collective cell
movements, and is essential for the proper formation of most organ systems in vertebrates. Given the
diversity of structures whose morphogenesis relies on PCP, a central challenge is to define a common,
unifying set of molecular principals through which PCP acts. Specifically, the molecular links between
PCP components and their downstream effectors are poorly defined. Moreover, we do not understand
how polarity within individual cells is coordinated into collective, tissue-scale behaviors. Defining these
molecular links in detail and connecting them to higher order patterns of collective cell behavior is thus
crucial to our basic understanding of tissue morphogenesis.
 The murine epidermis displays striking spatial and directional patterns, and is an ideal model
system to approach these questions. Using newly developed live imaging capabilities, we recently
discovered two novel collective cell movements during formation of epithelial placodes in the
mammalian skin. These movements bear resemblance to the behaviors that underlie embryonic germ
layer formation and gastrulation, suggesting that deeply conserved mechanisms underlie the
morphogenesis of very diverse structures. We propose to use the power of the murine epidermis to
gain a molecular understanding of these Wnt and PCP-dependent collective cell movements. Specific
Aim 1 will define the mechanisms of PCP-mediated force generation and symmetry breaking that drive
collective cell motion. Specific Aim 2 will elucidate how patterns of differential cell adhesion promote
epithelial motility and prevent cell mixing to compartmentalize collective epithelial movements. Specific
Aim 3 will decipher the mechanisms driving epithelial rearrangements during periodic pattern formation.
Our findings will define how local, intercellular interactions generate the large-scale collective
movements that occur during organogenesis and reveal how structural birth defects arise when these
processes go awry."

Preterm birth remains a significant cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Intra-amniotic infection and
inflammation are important triggers for early preterm birth, which is associated with fetal injury mediated by
cytokines and other inflammatory mediators in the amniotic fluid and fetus. The objective of this proposal is
to establish the efficacy and safety of a novel selective allosteric interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) inhibitor
(Rytvela) as an antenatal therapeutic strategy to prevent fetal injury and PTB. In pregnant mice, we have
strong evidence that Rytvela is a potent suppressor of preterm birth and fetal injury induced by either
lipopolysaccharide or lipotechoic acid. To enable translation of these discoveries to human pregnancy, we
propose to test the efficacy and determine pharmacokinetics of Rytvela in a pregnant nonhuman primate model
of preterm labor induced by Group B Streptococcus (GBS), a clinically important bacterium that colonizes the
vagina and can cause preterm labor and neonatal sepsis. Our unique chronically catheterized nonhuman primate
model has the greatest relevance to human pregnancy of any animal model and allows sampling in normally
inaccessible compartments (amniotic fluid, maternal and fetal blood) multiple times without disrupting the
pregnancy. New preliminary studies added to this resubmission demonstrate: 1) inhibition of preterm birth by
Rytvela for at least 7 days (clinically significant endpoint), 2) determination of Rytvela pharmacokinetics in a rat
model, 3) ability to quantify Rytvela using mass spectrometry in plasma for pharmacokinetics studies, and 3)
incorporation of novel technology (Digital Spatial Profiling) to study immune responses at the maternal-fetal
interface. In Aim 1, we will determine Rytvela pharmacokinetics in our NHP model and establish if IL-1 inhibition
by Rytvela delays the onset of GBS-induced preterm labor. Aim 2 will determine if IL-1 inhibition by Rytvela can
ameliorate inflammatory injury to the placenta, fetal lung and brain using three high-throughput multiplexed
analyses: 1) multidimensional flow cytometry to quantitate cell populations, 2) Digital Spatial Profiling to
interrogate immunologic protein expression and pathway activation in discrete tissues (amnion, chorion, decidua)
of the placental chorioamniotic membranes, and 3) single cell RNA-Seq for transcriptomic profiling of regulatory
gene networks within single cells in placental tissues. These experiments represent a natural progression of
preliminary studies in multiple animal models and are essential to determining whether IL-1 is a viable molecular
target for the prevention of preterm birth and fetal protection."
10836419,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The resistance of PDAC to multiple agents, has been linked in part to its unique tumor microenvironment
(TME), which is characterized by a desmoplastic stroma composed of dense collagen-rich extracellular matrix
(ECM), abundant and diverse populations of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and resultant tumor cell
hypoxia. PDAC’s fibrotic stroma contributes to poor drug delivery, and deprived infiltration and function of anti-
tumor immune cells. These three aspects have been linked to PDAC resistance to both chemo- and
immunotherapy. However, it is not clear how the PDAC-associated desmoplasia and fibrosis might impact
resistance to RT. Historical studies have focused on radation therapy (RT) as a direct mechanism to damage
proliferating tumor cells leading to the accumulation of double-strand DNA breaks and cell death. It is also
appreciated that RT can prime anti-tumor immunity by releasing tumor-derived antigens and danger signals,
and that this likely plays a critical role in RT efficacy in multiple cancer types. However, it is unclear if these
immune priming functions of RT are intact in a highly fibrotic and immunosupressive cancers like PDAC.
Previous work from our lab demonstrated that inhibition of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK), which is hyper
activated in PDAC, reduced tumor-associated fibrosis and thus improves responses to chemo- and checkpoint
immunotherapies14,15. These studies have moved to clinical trials with promising early results. However, our
recent data suggest FAK can synergize even more effectively with RT plus T cell checkpoint combinations.
Based on these data, we hypothesize that fibrotic stroma contributes to PDAC resistance to RT and RT-
induction of tumor immunity. To test this we will:
Aim 1. Determine the mechanism(s) by which fibrosis impairs RT efficacy and how FAK inhibition overcomes
this.
Aim 2: Determine if FAK inhibition enhances RT-induced anti-tumor immunity and disease control in locally
advanced PDAC patients.
Aim 3: Determine the mechanism(s) by which inhibition of FAK signaling improves RT-induced checkpoint
immunotherapy response.
Impact: Studying how fibrosis negatively impacts RT efficacy in PDAC will further our understanding of how to
integrate a stromal targeted agents into current RT regimens with the ultimate goal of improving efficacy of RT."
10835620,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 This application aims to examine the combined analgesic and anti-craving effects of delta-9-
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) in individuals with co-occurring opioid use disorder (OUD)
and chronic pain undergoing opioid agonist therapy. Chronic pain affects up to 60% of people with OUD,
leading to greater morbidity and mortality. Yet, pain is overlooked in OUD treatment due to the lack of effective
therapies addressing both conditions. Hence, there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches.
 THC has been shown to mitigate pain, while CBD reduces cue-induced opioid craving. Some evidence
also suggests that CBD may counterbalance THC’s undesired effects. However, the combined effects of THC
and CBD on individuals with co-occurring OUD and chronic pain remain unknown. Studying this population is
crucial, as the co-occurrence of pain and OUD causes unique neuroadaptations, clinical trajectories, and
poorer outcomes. To close this critical knowledge gap, we propose a human laboratory study to characterize
the combined therapeutic effects of THC and CBD among people with co-occurring OUD and chronic pain who
are undergoing opioid agonist therapy. The study will investigate the combined effects of THC and CBD on two
important triggers of non-medical opioid use: pain sensitivity and cue-induced opioid craving, assessed using
multimodal quantitative sensory testing (QST) and a well-validated visual probe task that involves the
presentation participant-matched opioid cues (i.e., heroin paraphernalia), respectively. Three groups of 40
participants will be randomized to single doses of oral THC (5 mg, 10 mg) and CBD (400 mg, 800 mg, 1200
mg), across four test sessions separated by three days each. The study will have 3x4 design, with THC dose
as a between-subject factor and CBD dose as a within-subject factor. Participants will meet DSM-5 criteria for
OUD, have chronic non-cancer low back pain for ≥ 3 months, and will be receiving stable doses of methadone
(40-120 mg/day). This study will have a significant impact for this under-researched population, by determining
the combined effects of THC/CBD for relieving pain sensitivity and cue-induced opioid craving, two key
treatment targets (Aim 1); and determining the abuse potential and cognitive/psychomotor effects of combined
THC/CBD, administered with opioid agonist maintenance (Aim 2). This study will also investigate if sex
influences the responses to THC/CBD; the combined effects of effects of THC/CBD on central sensitization;
and potential drug interactions, indexed by plasma opioid, THC, and CBD levels (Exploratory Aims).
 This application will advance the understanding of THC/CBD combinations as non-opioid therapeutics,
supporting new drug applications for co-occurring OUD and chronic pain. Finally, our model for assessing both
OUD and pain treatment targets will establish a benchmark to evaluate novel therapies, addressing NIH's
priorities and informing patients, healthcare professionals, and policy stakeholders amidst the opioid crisis."

10845534,"ABSTRACT
About 15% of American couples experience infertility (time-to-pregnancy >12 months) and more than 20% of
couples experience spontaneous abortion (SAB, pregnancy loss <20 weeks of gestation). Fertility treatment is
costly and inaccessible to most Americans, particularly people of color and low-income individuals. Among those
with access to treatment, fertility treatment has relatively low success rates and is associated with adverse
perinatal outcomes. There are also large racial/ethnic disparities in treatment success rates. As infertility and
SAB exact an emotional and financial toll on affected couples, identifying modifiable risk factors for these
outcomes in both partners is an important public health goal. With previous support from the NICHD, we designed
a web-based prospective cohort study to recruit, follow, and collect comprehensive data on couples attempting
pregnancy. Some of our strongest findings to date pertain to poor sleep quality and stress in both partners. To
build on this work, we are submitting a renewal application (R01-HD086742) to evaluate the influence of
understudied sleep- and stress-related exposures on subfertility and SAB risk, explore putative mechanisms of
effect, and examine the extent to which these factors explain existing race/ethnic disparities in subfertility and
SAB. Pregnancy Study Online (PRESTO) is a web-based preconception cohort study in North America that has
enrolled more than 16,000 females and nearly 4,000 male partners during the preconception period, with 20%
of PRESTO participants identifying as Black, Indigenous, or People of Color (BIPOC). In this renewal application,
we propose to enroll an additional 8,000 females to enhance power for more detailed analyses of sleep using
the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, selected stressors (e.g., childhood adversity, discrimination, financial
hardship, COVID-related factors), and risk of subfertility and SAB. We also propose to collect and analyze more
objective exposure data using sleep actigraphy (Fitbit Inspire 2) and stress biomarkers (hair cortisol and salivary
alpha-amylase) in a subset of new participants. We will enroll an additional 2,000 male partners to enhance
power for examining male exposures and joint effects in both partners. To ensure power for key hypotheses
(e.g., reproductive effects of racial discrimination), we will oversample BIPOC participants. This renewal
application builds on our previous work indicating that stress and sleep quality are important determinants of
reproductive health. Our expanded focus on understudied stressors—in populations that are underrepresented
in reproductive and perinatal research (e.g., males and BIPOC)—is novel and of high public health importance.
Preconception enrollment minimizes misclassification, selection bias, and reverse causation, and captures early
SABs (<8 weeks of gestation), a priority area for NICHD. The cohort’s prospective design, cost-efficient web-
based infrastructure for participant recruitment and follow-up, geographic and racial/ethnic heterogeneity, and
comprehensive collection of confounder data in both partners are added strengths. Results will generate data
that can inform public health interventions to reduce the population burden of subfertility and SAB."

In the US, sexual and gender minority (SGM) older adults are disproportionately at risk for Alzheimer’s disease
and related dementias (AD/ADRD) and more likely to rely on long-term services and supports (LTSS) than
their cisgender, heterosexual peers. Without training in culturally responsive care of the LTSS workforce, SGM
residents are vulnerable to receiving inappropriate and/or inferior care contributing to poorer quality of life and
health outcomes. To address this, some states have recently mandated training of the LTSS workforce in the
culturally responsive care of SGM older adults. There are two major barriers to this approach being successful.
First, we lack research on LTSS policies governing SGM with AD/ADRD care (in states where cultural care
training is not mandated), which would inform whether such state legislation is needed. Second, there are no
scalable, sustainable, evidence-based training programs to train the LTSS workforce in SGM with AD/ADRD
culturally responsive care. This application is focused on the Training to Serve curriculum, which has trained
over 12,000 LTSS workers in 12 states. This acceptable, feasible, and promising curriculum employs a
multilevel approach to train management and frontline LTSS staff in culturally responsive care to SGM with
AD/ADRD. But, it has not been rigorously evaluated and relies solely on in person instruction. This mixed
methods and comparative effectiveness study has three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will conduct a
comprehensive policy analysis of 362 nursing homes and 362 assisted living facilities in Minnesota to assess
the number and proportion of agencies that have explicit SGM affirmative policies in human resources,
marketing, training, governance; anti-discrimination policies guiding culturally responsive care, and resident
sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data collection. These findings will inform Aim 2 curriculum. In
Aim 2, to make Training to Serve more scalable nationally and with high fidelity, we will design and develop an
asynchronous online version and pilot it with 30 LTSS management and 30 staff. In Aim 3, to assess the
effects of training, we will conduct a 3-arm, management/staff stratified, group randomized, controlled trial of
the in-person training versus an online curriculum versus a waitlist control group (in 62 LTSS agencies, with
310 management and 450 staff per arm). At the individual level, we will assess management and staff
knowledge, attitudes, and skills providing care to SGM clients. At the agency level, at six months follow-up, we
predict agencies who receive training will have more SGM explicit policies, more SGM welcoming
environments, SOGI data collection at intake, and staff with significantly greater knowledge, comfort, and skills
in providing SGM with AD/ADRD culturally responsive care."

10845637,"Two causal mechanisms of neurodegeneration that are found in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related
diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-frontotemporal dementia (ALS-FTD) are re-initiation of the mitotic
cell-cycle in neurons, and impaired nucleocytoplasmic trafficking resulting from disruptions in the nuclear
envelope (NE) and nuclear pore complex (NPC). Deeper insight into how these abnormalities arise would clarify
approaches to design effective treatments for these diseases; however, very little is known about the initiating
mechanisms involved. This application will test the hypothesis that neuronal quiescence is maintained
throughout life via active mechanisms that inhibit the mitotic cell-cycle and that re-initiation of the cell-cycle leads
to NE/NPC disassembly, a normal occurrence in mitotic cells. This hypothesis is based on our study of the six-transmembrane enzyme GDE2 (Glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase 2; GDPD5), which cleaves the GPI-(Glycosylphosphatidylinositol)-anchor that tethers some proteins to the plasma membrane. GDE2 is a potent
inhibitor of the mitotic cell-cycle and induces the differentiation of mitotic progenitors into post-mitotic neurons in
the developing nervous system. We discovered that in adult mice lacking GDE2 (Gde2 KO), cortical neurons
show evidence of cell-cycle re-entry, suggesting that GDE2 is required to preserve neurons in a quiescent state.
Strikingly, Gde2 KO neurons that have re-entered the cell-cycle show abnormal organization of the NE, aberrant
distribution of NPC proteins and impaired nucleocytoplasmic transport, raising the possibility that cell-cycle re-initiation and NE/NPC breakdown are linked. Consistent with this idea, genetic reduction of cyclin D, a critical
regulator of the G1/S transition, suppresses nucleocytoplasmic transport-dependent neurodegeneration in a
Drosophila model of c9ORF72 ALS-FTD. Notably, Gde2 KO mice display age-progressive neurodegeneration
and GDE2 distribution and function is disrupted in AD patient neurons. These observations suggest that
maintenance of neuronal quiescence is an active process and that failure of this process re-initiates the cell-cycle, triggers NE/NPC breakdown and induces neurodegeneration. Aim 1 will determine if GDE2 encodes a
new pathway that maintains neuronal quiescence and will determine if neuronal cell-cycle re-entry signals
NE/NPC breakdown in neurons. Preliminary RNAseq, analysis of Wnt-reporter mice in Gde2 KOs, and genetic
studies in Drosophila identify aberrant activation of canonical Wnt signaling as a candidate pathway that induces
neuronal cell-cycle re-entry, NE/NPC breakdown and neurodegeneration. Aim 2 will utilize mouse and
Drosophila models to test this hypothesis. Studies in Aim 3 will determine links between GDE2 dysfunction,
neuronal cell-cycle re-entry and NE/NPC breakdown in disease using Drosophila models of AD and ADRD,
human postmortem tissue and iPS human neurons. These studies will provide new molecular insight into cross-disease triggers of neurodegeneration important in human AD and ADRDs."

11080815,"Project Summary / Abstract: This application is for TABA funds as a supplement to the
following phase I project.
COPD is the fourth leading global killer, in part, because of the failure of frontline medicine to
detect the disease. Poor early detection leads to unfavorable outcomes and high healthcare
costs. Tele-stethoscope* or “TS” is novel technology that allows acoustic data captured from
ordinary mobile phones to perform robust analysis of hemodynamics and pneumodynamics.
TS is intended to be used in primary care particularly in Tele-health and before scheduled
physical examination. Its purpose is to alert primary care physicians to the need for physical
examination and possibly referral. In these situations, there are no other comparable testing
options.
TS has three important innovations. First, is a clinical use innovation which brings remote,
impromptu patient evaluation to anyone with a smartphone. Customer discovery has validated
both a workflow and reimbursement strategy consistent with commercial success. Further,
FDA guidance suggests viability of agency clearance. Second is TS’s novel approach to
making AI algorithms. TS uses acoustic data, captured by OEM phone microphones, into
rigorous, physics-based features that describe organ hemodynamics and pneumodynamics.
The features or independent variables are then used to create binary classification models
with logistic regression. By relying on physics, TS never has to use neural networks or
overfitting strategies that have raised concerns about data intensity, model stability, regulatory
transparency and unknown reliability. The third innovation is that, by relying on passive
acoustic data, TS classifies organ function by observing organ dynamics directly rather than
from forced air capacity. TS uses many ideas from physics that were not available until fairly
recently. By relying on dynamics, TS offers a novel approach to forced air that may eventually
be additive to our understanding of respiratory conditions even in PFT labs.
This will be the third large scale human study that demonstrates classification of cardio -
pulmonary functionality. It follows a published study on COVID detection as well as soon to
be published study on the ability of TS to reproduce echocardiogram estimates of ejection
fraction. Analysis of stethoscope recordings suggests that the COPD diagnostic will rely on
a combination of right heart side hemodynamics and low frequency lung pneumodynamics. A
significant body of research is presented which validates the use of mobile phones as an
auscultation device with the ability to detect and diagnosis COPD.
The Aim of this study is to develop, evaluate, and test an algorithm that allows ordinary mobile
phones to detect COPD. Our hypothesis is that TS technology can detect COPD by matching
phone acoustic recordings to diagnosis. Diagnosis will be determined by a physician after
considering gold standard testing. Performance of the models will be evaluated by using
common statistical approaches such as area under the receiver operating curve AUC,
sensitivity, specificity, accuracy. The research will have 3 milestones based on recruitment of
30, 60 and 100 patients respectively.
Our approach is based on recruitment from patients assigned to a hospital PFT lab so that
recordings and gold standard testing are done concurrently. Our team consists of a broad
range of talent including the inventor of TS, pulmonology expertise, the research director of
emergency medicine for the hospital running the tests, statistical expertise, and project

10845645,"Racial and ethnic minorities with chronic illness suffer disproportionately from infectious diseases. Analysis
of COVID-19 and influenza data suggest multiple determinants of vaccination inequities among non-Hispanic
whites and other racial/ethnic groups. These include manifestations of structural racism such as poor access to
care and lack of cultural, language, and literacy-appropriate factual information to promote awareness of and
motivation to partake in protective vaccination behaviors. Integrated within health and community systems
alike, community health worker (CHW) interventions are an effective strategy to simultaneously address
structural and social determinants of health in multiple settings.
 Building on a long-standing partnership between RAND, Clinical Directors Network (CDN), and local
community groups and leaders, we propose a study to tailor, implement and evaluate a community health
worker (CHW intervention) to increase vaccination acceptance and vaccination rates for COVID-19 (primary
outcome) and influenza (secondary outcome) among individuals with chronic illness who receive their primary
care in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). Tailoring of the CHW intervention will be grounded on the
Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, Behavior (COM-B) theoretical behavioral model and in partnership with a
Community Advisory Board (CAB) composed of patients and representatives from local community
organizations. We propose a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine the efficacy of the CHW-VB
(Community Health Worker Intervention to enhance Vaccination Behaviors) intervention to improve
vaccine acceptance, uptake, and implementation among racial/ethnic minority adults with any of 7 chronic
conditions (asthma, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, depression, anxiety disorder, or PTSD).
 The study has 4 aims over 5 years: 1) tailor the CHW intervention based on formative research (Aim 1:
Year 1); 2) conduct the RCT to test the efficacy of CHW-VB (Aim 2: Years 2-4); 3) understand the effects of
CHW-VB and examine measures of capability, motivation, and opportunity as mediators and demographic
characteristics and chronic medical/mental conditions as moderators (Aim 3: Years 3-4); and, 5) assess
contextual factors affecting implementation and sustainability (Aim 4: Year 5). Our community-based
participatory research approach is anchored in partnership with the CAB in all stages of the research, through
regular meetings for the formative assessment, co-designing the adaptation of the intervention, troubleshooting
any implementation hurdles, and actively participating in the interpretation and dissemination of the results.
 FHQCs employ CHWs as part of the lifeline of health care services delivered to mostly non-white and
under/uninsured patients with chronic illnesses. Community engagement is also a core value for FQHCs who
are governed by individuals and community-based agencies from the impoverished communities they serve.
The CHW-VB intervention, if efficacious, has a high potential for scalability and sustainability in this setting."

Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is one of the fastest-growing chronic diseases globally and causes disability, amplified
healthcare costs, and mortality. T2D disproportionately afflicts ethnic minorities in the United States (US).
Puerto Ricans (PR) have among the highest T2D rates in the U.S. While unhealthy lifestyle behaviors are
known contributors to this disparity, the sociocultural environment of PR may be an equally important and
understudied component of the excess T2D. Here, we introduce two cohorts: The Boston Puerto Rican Health
Study (BPRHS) and Puerto Rico Observational Study of Psychosocial, Environmental, and Chronic Disease
Trends (PROSPECT) as complementary cohorts of adults living in the northeast US (MPR) and Puerto Rico
(IPR), providing a unique opportunity to understand T2D-related disparities in an at-risk group with different
social and environmental settings. Evidence suggests that social factors affect health via epigenomic
modifications. However, the related biological pathways are unknown. The study of epigenomic variation within
minority populations exposed to different adverse and protective social factors offers a unique opportunity to
characterize how environmental exposures and other social stressors interact with genes to influence T2D risk.
Our central hypotheses are that 1) MPR are exposed to more adverse social factors and live in less protective
social environments than IPR, and 2) this results in DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles consistent with higher
T2D risk. We will test these hypotheses in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses via the following aims: (1)
To determine variations in DNAm and their association with T2D prevalence, incidence, and metabolic
biomarkers known to contribute to T2D burden in MPR vs. IPR. To achieve this goal and subsequent aims, we
will measure ~850K DNAm in paired BPRHS blood samples (n=600 visit (v)1 and n=600 v3) and 600 samples
from PROSPECT (v1). (2) To characterize cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between genome-wide
DNAm and specific social stressors (i.e., adverse childhood or life events, discrimination), and protective social
factors (i.e., social support, coping, resiliency, community connection), along with behavioral factors (healthy
diet, physical activity and adequate sleep); and to describe their relationships with metabolic and physiological
pathways relevant to risk and control of T2D. (3) To quantify associations between social and behavioral
stressors and biological age acceleration in the BPRHS (V1 and V3; ~6 y follow-up) and PROSPECT (V1)
cohorts, using DNAm data from Aim 1. Defining mechanisms by which DNAm modifications and associated
pathways relate to T2D risk will support the development of innovative strategies in public health to cope with
environmental and social stressors to subsequently prevent T2D and related health disparities in vulnerable
populations. This proposal will leverage and expand existing resources and established collaborative expertise."
10845657,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Phosphoinositide signaling lipids are key regulators of endomembrane trafficking and are critical for synaptic
function and plasticity. Notably, many synapse-specific trafficking pathways are highly similar to cognate
pathways in non-neuronal cells. The specialized trafficking at synapses is largely achieved via modest
alterations to generic trafficking pathways. Due to the high demand of traffic at synapses, very minor mutations
in these pathways specifically impact the nervous system and underlie a wide range of neurological disorders.
 PIKfyve and its regulatory proteins Vac14 and Fig4 control the cellular levels of the low abundance
signaling lipids phosphatidylinositol (3,5)-bis phosphate (PI3,5P2) and phosphatidylinositol 5- phosphate
(PI5P). Studies from us and others revealed that minor mutations in this pathway are associated with several
neurological disorders. Insights into roles of PI(3,5)P2 in neurons came from our discovery that PIKfyve plays
essential roles in synaptic function and plasticity, and acts in part via controlling the surface levels of AMPA-
type glutamate receptors (AMPARs). PIKfyve downregulation results in enhanced recycling and surface levels
of AMPAR, although the underlying molecular mechanism(s) are unknown. Paradoxically, our new studies in
non-neuronal cells, reveal that PIKfyve has a direct positive role in the control of the SNX17 recycling pathway.
Notably, both the SNX17 and SNX27 pathways emerge from the same microdomains on endosomes. This
places PIKfyve on endosomes that actively recycle both SNX17-dependent and SNX27-dependent cargoes.
Importantly AMPAR surface levels are controlled in part via SNX27-dependent recycling. Aim 1 of this proposal
seeks to determine whether PIKfyve controls AMPAR surface levels via negative regulation of SNX27-
dependent recycling.
 Importantly, our new studies raise the possibility that dysregulation of SNX17 during PIKfyve inhibition,
may also contribute to the observed synaptic defects. Mutations in proteins that function with SNX17 underlie
some neurological diseases, but surprisingly, there are no published studies to establish whether SNX17
recycling is critical for synaptic function. The current project will test the hypothesis that PIKfyve differentially
regulates distinct recycling pathways that emerge from the same endosomes. To address this hypothesis we
will 1) Determine mechanisms whereby PIKfyve regulates AMPAR recycling; 2) Determine roles of the SNX17-
Retriever pathway in neurons and whether similar to non-neuronal cells, PIKfyve is a regulator of this pathway."
10845536,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Up to eighty percent of clinic visit information is forgotten by patients immediately post visit. This is a significant
barrier to self-management, especially in older adults with multimorbidity leading to poor health outcomes.
After visit summaries (AVS) can improve recall, yet concerns exist about their layout, accuracy and low patient
uptake. A new strategy to augment the AVS is to share visit recordings with patients. When patients receive an
audio recording of the visit, 71% listen and 68% share it with a caregiver, resulting in greater recall. Despite
growing interest, there is limited research on the impact of recording and sharing clinic visits of patient self-
management ability, health outcomes or healthcare utilization of older adults. The objective of this proposal is
to conduct a multisite trial evaluating the impact of adding an audio recording of clinic visits (AUDIO) to usual
care in older adults with multimorbidity, including diabetes, compared to AVS alone (Usual Care; UC). The
specific aims are: Aim 1 Conduct a three-site trial in primary care where older patients with multimorbidity
including diabetes (n=336) will be randomized to receive an audio recording as well as AVS (AUDIO) versus
AVS alone (UC) for all scheduled clinic visits over 12 months; patients will be assessed at baseline, 1 week, 6
months and 12 months; Aim 2 Identify factors that impact the implementation and sustainable use of visit audio
recordings. Applicants Hypothesize (Main Effect) that: compared to those receiving UC, patients randomized to
also receive audio recordings (AUDIO) of clinic visits will report a greater self-management ability (Primary
Outcome), with improved quality of life, medication adherence, and satisfaction (Secondary Outcomes) at 12
months. Applicants will explore the impact of AUDIO on general medical regimen adherence, diabetes quality
of care indicators, healthcare utilization and clinician practice behavior. They will also explore potential
moderators of AUDIO, asking whether its impact on self-management is greater for individuals at highest risk
of poor self-management including those with less caregiver support, moderate to severe depression, lower
health literacy, and high disease burden. In Aim 2, applicants will interview patients, caregivers, clinicians, and
clinic staff to identify barriers and facilitators to the implementation and sustainable use of recordings using the
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). The research is innovative: i) it seeks to shift
current clinical practice where visit information is provided via AVS, by adding recordings; ii) the routine
provision of visit recordings over time moves beyond prior studies focused on one-off recordings of specialty
care visits; and iii) a trial in real-world settings of patients with multimorbidity, who are often excluded from
trials, is novel and has greater external validity. Results are expected to have a major positive impact as they
will increase clinical understanding of the impact and implementation of audio recording on the significant
challenge of improving patient self-management in the face of the public health burden of multimorbidity."

We aim to develop a gene therapy for limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (LGMD2A), an autosomal recessive
(AR) muscle wasting disorder due to mutations in CAPN3. LGMD2A is considered to be the most prevalent of
the AR LGMDs and yet there is currently no treatment for patients, who are usually wheelchair dependent a
decade after diagnosis. We and others have shown that overexpression of CAPN3 can be accomplished in
skeletal muscle without toxicity; a finding which makes the feasibility of gene therapy for LGMD2A a realistic
goal; however, LGMD2A is unique from most other LGMDs and this fact warrants careful development of gene
therapy vectors. One consideration is that CAPN3 cannot be expressed in the heart, due to cardiac toxicity,
which is not the case with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and other LGMDs. Although a few pre-clinical, proof of
concept studies have successfully accomplished AAV-Capn3 overexpression in mice, there has not been a
systematic optimization of any gene therapy construct for humans with LGMD2A, especially one that considers
the relative skeletal muscle vs cardiac gene expression issues. Furthermore, because LGMD2A preferentially
impacts slow fibers, it is critical that the therapeutic construct that is ultimately carried into clinical trials is
optimized for slow fiber expression. Because each patient can only be dosed one time, it is imperative that the
construct used for gene delivery is ideal. In this application, we will use an iterative and systematic approach to
optimize these vectors. We have assembled an expert, collaborative team with deep experience in the area of
regulatory cassettes, AAV vector development and LGMD2A pathogenesis and calpainopathy animal models.
The team will work together to generate and test the safety and efficacy of a series of AAV vectors to develop a
treatment for LGMD2A. These vectors will be optimized for slow fiber expression while avoiding cardiac toxicity.
One team member, Dr. Hauschka, is largely credited with creating the vast majority of regulatory cassettes being
used in the current AAV-gene therapy trials for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Dr. Chamberlain designed and
optimized the first micro and mini dystrophins, which formed the basis for all constructs currently in gene therapy
clinical trials for DMD. Drs. Spencer and Kramerova generated numerous mouse models that have led to the
identification of outcome measures useful for testing therapeutic interventions for LGMD2A. Dr. Cannon, is an
internationally known muscle physiologist who will carry out physiological assessments of contractile function.
The team will apply their extensive and cumulative knowledge of LGMD2A, AAV vectors, regulatory cassettes
and mouse muscle testing to create this gene therapy for LGMD2A."

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric cancer and, despite advances in treatment, it
is still one of the leading causes of childhood death in the United States (US), and survivors face significant
lifelong treatment-related morbidities. Children of Latino ethnicity have the highest and fastest-increasing risk of
ALL in the US, and have lower survival than non-Latino whites; however, this ethnic disparity in incidence and
outcome is not fully understood. Elucidating the increased risk of ALL in Latino children may reveal novel insights
in the etiology of ALL in both Latino and non-Latino populations, and may highlight potential avenues for disease
prevention. We hypothesize that germline genetic variation plays an essential role in the increased ALL risk in
Latinos, that this risk is imparted via Native American ancestry, and that ALL risk alleles were selected in Native
Americans during European colonization of the Americas due to their beneficial effects on immune response to
new infections. We have assembled the largest ever case-control set of childhood ALL in Latinos, including over
5,400 cases and 27,000 controls from three independent studies in California, plus studies in Texas, Children’s
Oncology Group/St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, and Guatemala. In our first aim, we will perform three
complementary approaches to discover novel common risk loci associated with childhood ALL: i) a genome-
wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis, ii) admixture mapping to capitalize on the recently admixed
nature of Latino genomes, and iii) a transcriptome-wide association study to identify novel loci and to pinpoint
causal genes at known and novel risk regions. In our second aim, we will characterize the genetic variants in
terms of their association with local Native American ancestry and whether they exhibit evidence of directional
natural selection on the Native American branch of the human population tree. We will also characterize the
aggregate effects of common variants on childhood ALL risk and how this varies by ethnicity, via comprehensive
modeling of polygenic risk scores (PRS) for ALL in Latinos and in non-Latino whites. Finally, we will incorporate
our genetic findings into epidemiologic analyses, by accounting for common (PRS) genetic variants in ALL risk
models for immune-related risk factors in Latinos and non-Latino whites, including cesarean delivery and in utero
cytomegalovirus infection, both of which have shown stronger effects on ALL risk in Latinos and are potentially
modifiable risk factors. The results of this study will shed light on the etiology of childhood ALL in general and of
the increased risk of ALL in Latino children, which will help to alleviate this ethnic disparity and may inform future
approaches for childhood leukemia prevention."
10837778,"Cholesterol is highly abundant in the brain and essential for its higher order functions. Cholesterol cannot cross
the blood-brain barrier; hence in situ biosynthesis provides the brain with all the necessary cholesterol, whereas
cholesterol 24-hydroxylation removes the majority of cholesterol excess. Cholesterol 24-hydroxylation is
catalyzed by cytochrome P450 46A1 (CYP46A1), a neuron-specific enzyme, which maintains cholesterol
homeostasis in the central nervous system by balancing local cholesterol biosynthesis. Studies by others utilizing
genetic modulation of CYP46A1 activity in mice provided strong evidence that CYP46A1 could be a therapeutic
target for Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s diseases as well as medical conditions accompanied by seizures. Our
structure and function research indicated that CYP46A1 activity could be modulated pharmacologically by some
FDA-approved drugs. We focused on efavirenz (EFV), an anti-HIV drug, and found that in normal mice, EFV
activated CYP46A1 at 0.1 mg/kg body weight dose, which is ~100-times lower than that given to HIV-positive
individuals. Yet at higher doses, EFV inhibited the enzyme. We established that there is an allosteric site for EFV
on the CYP46A1 surface, which is away from the enzyme active site located inside the protein molecule. We
proposed that when EFV only binds to the CYP46A1 allosteric site, it likely activates the enzyme, yet when EFV
interacts with both the allosteric and active sites, it probably inhibits CYP46A1 because of the competition with
cholesterol (the substrate) for the active site. We then tested EFV on 5XFAD mice (an Alzheimer’s model) in the
two treatment paradigms using the CYP46A1 activating EFV dose. The levels of the amyloid b peptide in the
whole brain were decreased and unchanged when the treatment started before and after the amyloid b
deposition, respectively. Nevertheless, both treatment paradigms improved animal performance in behavioral
tests. We started a clinical trial of EFV in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, which is currently on-going. In this
application, we capitalize on our most recent results. Specifically, we used different omics and other approaches
and identified the genes, proteins, pathways, and processes affected by EFV in the amyloid b-decreasing
paradigm of drug treatment. Also, we discovered that in vitro, some of the EFV metabolites produced during
hepatic drug clearance were even stronger CYP46A1 activators than EFV and did not inhibit the P450 at high
concentrations. Thus, it is possible that not only EFV but also some of its metabolites activate CYP46A1 in vivo.
Accordingly, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1) to map a general mechanism underlying the multiple
brain effects of CYP46A1 activity modulation; and 2) to begin to develop the next generation of CYP46A1
activators. Aim 1 will provide insight into how one enzyme can affect multiple brain cellular events. Aim 2 may
lead to compounds which activate CYP46A1 in vivo without the undesired P450 inhibition at high doses.
Collectively, the data obtained will significantly advance our understanding of CYP46A1 and cholesterol
homeostasis in the brain and will be used for developing a disease-modifying treatment for Alzheimer’s disease."

Age-related loss of muscle mass, or sarcopenia, is a hallmark of aging that affects up to 20% of those over 65
and up to 50% of those over 80, for which there are no pharmacological treatments. We recently discovered that
the enzyme Glutamate Carboxypeptidase II (GCPII), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of N-acetylaspartylglutamate
(NAAG) to glutamate, is highly upregulated in activated macrophages infiltrating muscle during aging, and that
inhibiting the elevated GCPII activity with the inhibitor 2-PMPA (IC50 = 0.3nM) dramatically delays neuromuscular
junction (NMJ) denervation, and muscle function and volume loss. Unfortunately, 2-PMPA is not clinically
developable. It is highly polar, with negligible oral bioavailability (F<2%), a short half-life (<30m), and is active
only with high systemic (IP) doses. Given its significant clinical potential, we propose to address these limitations
by utilizing hydroxyl-dendrimers to facilitate its sustained and targeted delivery. Hydroxyl-dendrimers have shown
promise as targeted delivery systems due to their size (~4-10 nm) and surface attributes. They are rapidly cleared
from circulation under normal conditions but are selectively engulfed and retained by activated and phagocytic
immune cells under injury or inflammatory conditions. This is a very translational approach, as targeted
dendrimer delivery has been demonstrated to be efficacious in multiple animal models and recently shown to
reduce inflammation and mortality in a Ph2 clinical trial in hospitalized patients with severe Covid-19
(NCT04458298). We have assembled a highly experienced team with extensive expertise in neuromuscular
disorders and aging (Hoke), dendrimer nanoparticles (Kannan), and animal pharmacology, pharmacokinetics,
and clinical translation (Slusher). Together we plan to develop dendrimer-2PMPA (D-2PMPA) for age-related
sarcopenia by implementing the following aims: AIM 1. Synthesize and characterize generation 4 (G4) and
generation 6 (G6) D-2PMPA conjugates. AIM 2. Assess D-2PMPA (G4 and G6) pharmacokinetics, target
engagement, and biodistribution in aged mice. AIM 3. Evaluate the efficacy (behavioral, electrophysiological,
and histological) and tolerability of the selected D-2PMPA conjugate in aged mice. Successful execution of these
aims will result in a D-2PMPA conjugate ready for IND-enabling studies to support future clinical studies to
combat age-related sarcopenia."

Visual information travels along feedforward connections from the primary visual cortex (V1) through a hierarchy
of cortical areas. In turn, the visual cortex receives a dense network of feedback (FB) connections from higher-
order cortical areas. FB connections have been implicated in several forms of top-down influences, such as
attention, expectation, and context dependent visual processing, but the specific contributions of FB connections
to visual perception have remained mysterious. The goal of this proposal is to uncover how FB from the second
visual cortical area (V2) to primary visual cortex (V1) affects visual perception and neural response properties of
V1 neurons in primates. This goal will be achieved by targeting optogenetic inactivation to the axons of FB
connections in awake behaving marmosets performing visual tasks. Candidate’s previous studies in
anesthetized marmosets have shown that V2 FB affects receptive field (RF) size, surround suppression and
response gain of V1 neurons. To test how these neural level effects manifest in perception, FB connections
projecting from V2 to V1 will be optogenetically inactivated in awake marmoset monkeys performing visual tasks.
The proposed project builds directly upon the candidate’s existing training in optogenetics, electrophysiology and
psychophysics, but provides significant new training in using awake behaving marmosets. Advances in genome
editing tools and success in transgene germline transmission in marmosets have positioned the marmoset as
an important model system for neuroscience. Therefore, new training in awake behaving marmoset research will
provide a strong foundation for transitioning to independence, and a skill set that will position the candidate
ahead of the competition in the use of genetically engineered marmosets in neuroscience."

10829461,"Atrial fibrillation, the most common heart-rhythm disorder, increases the risk of ischemic stroke by 3- to
5-fold. Anticoagulant therapy has been proven to prevent 60-80% of ischemic strokes that would otherwise
occur from atrial fibrillation. Patients with a history of intracerebral hemorrhage have been excluded from
clinical trials of anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation. Whether to use anticoagulation in these
patients represents a major knowledge gap and clinical dilemma. Many clinicians fear that the proven benefit of
anticoagulation in preventing ischemic stroke will be offset by an increase in hemorrhagic stroke. Preliminary
data from multicenter studies indicate that, in patients with atrial fibrillation and recent intracerebral
hemorrhage, anticoagulation is associated with a decreased risk of ischemic stroke and overall mortality with
no offsetting increase in the burden of recurrent hemorrhagic stroke. These pilot data also suggest that
anticoagulation is associated with better long-term functional outcomes. Although these data are compelling,
they are observational findings and subject to confounding and bias. In clinical practice, about one-third of
patients with intracerebral hemorrhage and atrial fibrillation receive anticoagulation and the remainder receive
antiplatelet therapy such as aspirin. Current clinical guidelines call for randomized, blinded clinical trials to
provide high-quality evidence to determine the best treatment. The argument for a clinical trial is made more
compelling by the advent of apixaban, a relatively new oral anticoagulant drug, which was found to have similar
bleeding risks as aspirin in a recent head-to-head trial. This application is for a multicenter, double-blinded,
randomized clinical trial of apixaban versus aspirin in patients with atrial fibrillation and a recent intracerebral
hemorrhage. Seven hundred patients will be recruited and followed for 1 to 3 years at 125 sites in NINDS
StrokeNet. The aim of the study will be to test the hypothesis that apixaban improves outcomes compared to
aspirin. The primary outcome will be any stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) or death. This composite outcome
addresses both efficacy and safety, and represents a clinically meaningful endpoint often used in stroke
prevention trials. The secondary endpoint will be functional status, as measured by the modified Rankin Scale
score. This secondary endpoint will be used to test the hypothesis that apixaban not only reduces stroke
recurrence but also the severity of any strokes that do occur. If confirmed, this novel finding would provide an
important patient-centered context for the primary trial results. This proposal offers an opportunity to improve
the outcomes of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage by focusing on their brain health both in the acute
setting and over the long term. The impact of this study is that its successful completion, regardless of the
direction of its results, would immediately guide clinical care and set the stage for future trials of antithrombotic
therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation and other types of bleeding."

 This NIH K08 proposal, describes a five-year career development program in epilepsy genetics research.
Through this program, Dr. Khoshkhoo will receive training in human genetics, the experimental and analytic
aspects of next generation sequencing, and single cell genomics. This new skillset will complement Dr.
Khoshkhoo’s prior research and clinical training, and ideally position him to transition to an independent
investigator position studying the functional and molecular mechanisms of genetic variants in epilepsy.
 The institutional resources available through Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), Boston Children’s
Hospital (BCH), and Harvard Medical School (HMS) are world class and they provide the ideal environment to
foster the career developmental of young physician-scientists. Dr. Khoshkhoo’s mentor for this proposal, Dr.
Christopher Walsh (a Professor of Neurology at HMS and HHMI Investigator at BCH), is a leader in genetics
and genomics of human neurologic diseases. Dr. Walsh has a long track record for mentoring other trainees to
successful careers in biomedical research. In addition, Dr. Khoshkhoo has assembled a group of collaborators
with complementary expertise, and an Advisory Committee with extensive experience in mentoring physician-
scientists to develop independent research programs.
 The primary scientific objective of this proposal is to identify the role of pathogenic post-zygotic (somatic)
mutations (variants) in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), and to characterize the cell-type specific and
transcriptional mechanisms through which these variants contribute to the development of epilepsy. Dr.
Khoshkhoo provides pilot data indicating that a subset of sporadic TLE cases harbor likely pathogenic somatic
variants, which supports his central hypothesis that genetic and transcriptional dysregulation caused by
somatic variants plays a key role in TLE pathogenesis. This proposal will systemically examine surgical TLE
resections for the presence of these somatic variants and investigate their cellular and transcriptional
mechanisms.
 To achieve these objectives, a combination of ultra-deep gene panel sequencing, Parallel RNA and DNA
analysis after Deep sequencing (PRDD-seq), and single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) will be
employed. These state of the art strategies will aim to: (1) identify pathogenic somatic variants in surgically
resected hippocampal tissue from TLE patients and post-mortem neurotypical individuals; (2) determine the
cell-type(s) of mutant cells in TLE cases with known pathogenic somatic variants; and (3) examine the
downstream gene expression changes caused by these variants in TLE. These studies will not only help
establish somatic variants as a novel mechanism for TLE pathogenesis, but also investigate their cellular and
molecular mechanisms in situ. Overall, this proposal introduces a new conceptual and experimental framework
for studying TLE and the findings may have immediate diagnostic and treatment implications."

 Transmission of human schistosome parasites depends on availability of suitable aquatic snail
intermediate hosts. If no schistosome-transmitting snails are present, or snails no longer support schistosome
development, there will be no schistosomiasis. Developing snail-targeted genetic control programs has long
been advocated, but hampered by the lack of necessary genetic knowledge and effective germline manipulation
tools. The objective of this project is to exploit our recently developed genetic and genomic resources, in
combination with application of emerging powerful technologies, to address fundamental mechanisms of
schistosome resistance of snails in two snail-schistosome systems, Biomphalaria spp.–Schistosoma mansoni
and Bulinus spp.–S. haematobium, which are involved in transmission of intestinal and urogenital
schistosomiasis, respectively. The two snail-schistosome systems are responsible for approximately 99% of
human schistosomiasis transmission in the world. We propose to employ two new snail models, Bi. glabrata–
S. mansoni and Bu. truncatus–S. haematobium to represent the two systems for the study. In Aim 1, we will
apply whole genome sequencing (WGS) to scan single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of individual
recombination inbred lines (RILs) to generate high-resolution genetic maps of schistosome resistance in juvenile
and adult Bi. glabrata, the best-studied snail model of schistosomiasis. The RILs have been bred from our new
model that consists of two homozygous lines of Bi. glabrata, one fully susceptible to, and the other completely
resistant to, S. mansoni, the most important causative agent of intestinal schistosomiasis. In Aim 2, we will
employ RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to investigate differential expression and allelic variation of genome-wide
genes using our newly developed genetic resources (i.e., RIL snails and their two homozygous parent snails).
A comprehensive analysis of RNAseq data coupled with genes identified in the fine resistance loci will lead to
accurate identification of small number of resistance candidates, which will be used for subsequent studies,
including genetic variation of resistance genes in natural populations in endemic areas proposed in this aim. In
Aim 3, we will use a combined approach of functional and comparative genomics to identify syntenic regions
between Bi. glabrata and Bu. truncatus and reveal the genomic basis of schistosome resistance in Bu. truncatus,
an intermediate host of S. haematobium. Paradoxically, S. haematobium, despite being the most abundant of
all schistosome species infecting people, has received very little attention with respect to its interactions with its
bulinid snail hosts. In Aim 4, we will utilize RNAi (RNA interference) and CRISPR (clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeats) to functionally verify the candidate genes affecting snail compatibility to
S. mansoni or S. haematobium. This study will lead to a much deeper understanding of schistosome resistance
in Bi. glabrata, provide the first molecular insight into the genomic basis underpinning competence of bulinid
snails to schistosome, and help develop more effective and novel methods for controlling schistosomiasis."

In this project, we will investigate the cellular and molecular events that allow cochlear glia to shape and sustain
auditory circuits for a lifetime of hearing. Like the other glia of the peripheral nervous system, cochlear glia
develop from the neural crest, a highly migratory and plastic population of progenitors that produce neurons and
connective tissue as well as satellite glia and Schwann cells. Despite their common origin with other peripheral
glia, the glia that ultimately populate the cochlea take on some unique properties that are essential for the sense
of hearing, such as the ability to myelinate spiral ganglion neuron (SGNs) cell bodies. In addition, cochlear glia
provide crucial trophic support for the highly active SGNs and also clear away excess ions and transmitter that
could otherwise be damaging. Finally, whereas glial precursors generally migrate along axons, in the cochlea,
the glial precursors migrate ahead of the SGN neurites and appear to facilitate efficient formation of orderly radial
bundles along the tonotopic axis. Our overall goal is to learn how cochlear glia acquire these properties. Based
on data from our lab and others, we hypothesize that the transcription factors Gata2 and Gata3 act separately
in developing glia and SGNs to coordinate interactions needed for cochlear wiring and function. In support of
this idea, we found that Gata2 is expressed by cochlear glia but not by glia of the somatosensory system.
Additionally, previous analysis of Gata2 mutant mice revealed hearing deficits and SGN loss that could be due
to unrecognized effects on the glia. On the other hand, we observed that Gata3 mutant SGNs extend their
neurites as if they are unable to interact with the glia, resulting in disorderly wiring that mimics what occurs when
glia are depleted from the developing cochlea. We will follow up on these observations by using molecular
genetic approaches in the mouse to characterize glial organization and its effects on SGN neurite outgrowth
(Aim 1), to determine the role of Gata2 in cochlear glia development (Aim 2), and to compare GATA-dependent
programs of gene expression in SGNs and glia (Aim 3). For Aim 1, we will use genetic and viral approaches to
visualize glia and disrupt their ability to interact with developing SGN neurites, as assessed in fixed tissue and
by time-lapse imaging. For Aim 2, we will delete Gata2 from cochlear glia and assess effects on cochlear wiring,
on glial differentiation and function, on SGN survival, and on auditory function, as assessed by recording ABRs
and DPOAEs. For Aim 3, we will perform scRNA-sequencing of embryonic Gata2 and Gata3 mutant cochleas,
both to identify downstream genes that may mediate neuron-glia interactions and to learn how neurons and glia
are affected by each other during development. Together, these studies will advance our knowledge of cochlear
glia development and function, with direct implications for hearing loss, including that associated with Gata2
(Emberger Syndrome) and Gata3 (HDR Syndrome) mutations in humans."
10829360,"Project Abstract
Low-income US renters face a severe affordable housing crisis that likely has adverse effects on population
health. The current affordable housing shortage is likely to have particularly significant implications for the
health of adults living with behaviorally managed chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes
requires complex and resource intensive daily management that is highly sensitive to social conditions such as
housing. Furthermore, the rising prevalence of type 2 diabetes and diabetes related complications are
unequally borne by low-income adults and racial minorities; two populations that are at greater risk of housing
challenges. Rental assistance, provided by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is a
primary source of affordable housing for low-income households. However, due to supply constraints, fewer
than 1 in 4 eligible households receive this resource and waiting lists average 26 months nationally. Access to
rental assistance may improve diabetes self-management and control by reducing housing costs that can
compete with diabetes-related expenses and by providing stability that allows individuals to establish and
maintain consistent self-management routines. Furthermore, the unmet need for rental assistance creates a
unique opportunity to study the effects of affordable housing on health through rigorous approaches that
compare waitlisted and rent-assisted individuals. The primary goals of this study are to estimate the effects of
rental assistance on biological and behavioral indicators of diabetes self-management and control, and to
examine the processes through which these effects occur. Our project has three aims: 1) To estimate the
effects of rental assistance on type 2 diabetes self-management and control using a unique linkage of HUD
administrative data and a nationally representative health survey. 2) To examine how transitions from rental
assistance waiting lists into rent-assisted housing are associated with changes in diabetes self-management
and control in a longitudinal cohort of adults with type 2 diabetes 3) To examine how experiences of waiting for
and obtaining rental assistance shape diabetes behaviors and outcomes using qualitative interviews conducted
with a sub-sample of aim 2 participants. Findings will inform whether and how rental assistance and other
housing interventions can be leveraged to improve diabetes outcomes and to reduce diabetes disparities.
Furthermore, by identifying processes that connect housing to health, findings will inform clinical and
behavioral interventions to improve diabetes outcomes for inadequately housed adults, even in the absence of
expanded housing access. Beyond diabetes, findings will serve as a model for understanding relationships
between affordable housing access and chronic disease management behaviors more broadly."
10829370,"We recently identified a novel airway epithelial structure, the hillock, in the murine trachea and we
present evidence that similar structures occur in the human airway epithelium. Airway epithelial
hillocks are stratified epithelial structures with multiple layers of cells that are distinct from the
classic pseudostratified epithelium that lines most of the airway lumen. They possess novel
polyploid luminal epithelial cells, but completely lack ciliated cells. We now show that these
stratified hillock epithelial structures resist multiple forms of airway injury. We hypothesize that the
stratified structure of hillock cells results in a protective barrier, in analogy to the protective function
of the stratified epidermal cells that lie atop epidermal basal cells. Furthermore, we show that
hillocks contain a unique population of basal stem cells marked by Cytokeratin 13 (KRT13).
These basal cells are characterized by a very high baseline rate of turnover and are capable of
rapidly migrating over denuded airway epithelium. We hypothesize that the diffuse distribution of
injury-resistant airway hillocks facilitates disseminated migration of stem cells that have resisted
severe injury. We show preliminary evidence that hillock basal stem cells, which are the first
highly defined subset of airway basal cells in the murine trachea, are plastic and can produce
normal pseudostratified epithelium after damage to recreate a normal epithelium. Finally, we show
that murine hillocks increase in size and number with age. Interestingly, both smoking-induced
squamous metaplasia and vitamin A-deficiency induced squamous metaplasia have both been
associated with stratified KRT13+ epithelium suggesting they may originate from hillock-like cells.
In this grant application, we first propose to define the lineage and plasticity of hillocks during
homeostasis and after injury using 2 distinct genetic driver lines that are designed to specifically
label hillocks and even more specifically hillock basal cells. We will also determine the functional
significance of hillocks during epithelial homeostasis and after injury repair using diphtheria toxin-
mediated ablation in combination with models of airway injury, with special attention focused on
assessing the role of hillock polyploid cells. Using a combination of an explant model of murine
tracheal regeneration, 2-photon live imaging, and the chemical and genetic modulation of a
human hillock culture system, we will dissect the molecular mechanisms of hillock differentiation
and hillock-mediated injury repair with a focus on the specific role of retinoic acid signaling and
the association of hillocks to squamous metaplasia."
10834879,"Rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is typically generic and inefficient; most patients receive the
same contents and dosage of rehabilitation regardless of their individual needs, preferences, or expectations.
This generic treatment paradigm will be unsustainable in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) as the
demand for TKA surgery and postoperative care increase exponentially in the near future. Without new
strategies to improve the efficiency of TKA rehabilitation, organizations like the VHA will struggle to meet and
pay for this surging demand, and Veterans may be denied timely access to the postoperative care they need
for optimal recovery. We have developed an innovative new clinical decision support (CDS) tool to optimize
efficiency in TKA rehabilitation. Using the actual recovery data of similar historical patients, the tool can predict
the recovery trajectory for new patients after TKA. This allows clinicians to (1) allocate rehabilitation resources
based upon individual need, (2) identify Veterans at risk for suboptimal outcomes early after surgery, (3) tailor
treatment strategies to Veterans’ unique goals and clinical presentation, and (4) monitor Veterans’ recovery
relative to expected throughout postoperative rehabilitation. In this project, we propose to expand the CDS
tool’s capabilities by establishing utilization guidelines based upon individual Veteran’s predicted recovery (Aim
1). These guidelines will be established by expert consensus in a three round Delphi process. Subsequently,
we will test the CDS tool’s impact on Veteran’s functional recovery and rehabilitation utilization in four VHA
outpatient physical therapy clinics using a pre-post design (Aim 2). We will compare patient-reported function
(Lower Extremity Functional Scale) and physical therapy visit utilization between cohorts of Veterans treated
with and without the CDS tool. Additionally, we will gather data from participating VHA clinicians and Veterans
regarding the translation of our tool into clinical practice to assess its readiness for dissemination throughout
the VHA (Aim 3). This will include qualitative data from participant focus groups and quantitative process data
regarding the tool’s utilization. Ultimately, we expect this study will serve as a template for expanding our tool’s
capabilities into numerous VHA populations in rehabilitation and beyond."
10834880,"Anticipated Impacts on Veteran’s Healthcare: Chronic pain is a critical obstacle to the rehabilitation and
recovery of Veterans with serious mental illness (SMI; schizophrenia spectrum and bipolar disorders). The
Veteran Health Administration (VHA) has made treatment of chronic pain, especially nonpharmacological
approaches, a high priority and initiated a nationwide dissemination of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Chronic
Pain (CBT-CP) – an evidence-based psychotherapy – across the VHA system. However, CBT-CP has not been
scientifically tested in SMI populations and is largely not provided to Veterans with chronic pain and co-occurring
SMI, a group with some of the highest rates of chronic pain and associated negative functional outcomes. This
study will: 1) test the feasibility and acceptability of CBT-CP for improving pain-related functional outcomes in
Veterans with SMI; 2) examine the feasibility of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to capture real-world
experiences of and relationships among pain, mental health symptoms; and 3) evaluate Veteran experiences
with CBT-CP to inform whether CBT-CP requires tailoring to optimize its use with Veterans with SMI and co-
occurring chronic musculoskeletal pain.
Project Background: Chronic pain is one of the most common physical health diagnoses among individuals
with SMI.1-3 Individuals with SMI and chronic pain report worse mental and physical health functioning relative to
people with other mental or physical health conditions. 4-8 Despite knowing about high rates of chronic pain
among individuals with SMI; little research has been conducted to further understand the complex relation
between pain and psychiatric symptoms and consider the usefulness or appropriateness of current treatment
approaches. What is known is problematic; Veterans with SMI are largely not provided options for
nonpharmacological pain management strategies, including CBT-CP, and are more likely to be prescribed pain
medications that pose unique risks to this population. 9-13
Project Objectives: The proposed CDA-2 research will address research and clinical gaps by better assessing
relations among chronic pain, psychiatric symptoms, and related functional impairment; and testing the feasibility
and acceptability of CBT-CP in Veterans with SMI. The first step of this research will focus on completing a small
randomized controlled trial of CBT-CP to examine feasibility and acceptability and explore changes to functioning
and quality life in 45 Veterans randomized to CBT-CP (n=30) relative to a Health & Wellness intervention (n=15).
We will assess rates of recruitment, initial intervention engagement, and session attendance (feasibility); assess
Veteran satisfaction with CBT-CP (acceptability); and preliminarily explore response to CBT-CP. The second step
will use EMA to collect real-time data (three times daily for one week) on Veterans’ pain, SMI symptoms, and their
impact on functioning using an automated telephone survey. Data will be used to better understand the complex
relationships between these variables. The final step of this research will involve conducting a process evaluation
to consider ways to optimize CBT-CP for future clinical trials to improve functional recovery for Veterans with
SMI and chronic pain. This evaluation will synthesize information from: 1) CBT-CP interventionist notes; 2) EMA
data; and 3) qualitative interviews with a subset of Veterans in the CBT- CP condition (n=15) to learn about their
experiences with CBT-CP, including barriers and facilitators to treatment engagement.
Project Methods: This project will include: 1) completing a randomized control trial (RCT) with 45 Veteran
participants, monitoring fidelity, feasibility, and acceptability; 2) developing and implementing phone-based EMA
to assess temporal relationships among chronic pain, mental health symptoms, and related functioning; and 3)
studying Veterans’ experiences of CBT-CP through qualitative interviews. We will measure functional outcomes
during the EMA and at RCT baseline, post-treatment and 3-month follow-up through self-report questionnaires."

Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) that reside within the non-lymphoid tissues provide superior immunity
against a variety of pathogens including influenza virus infection compared to the circulating memory T
cells.
Currently,
the molecular and metabolic mechanisms regulating CD8 TRM programming, maintenance
and functions in the tissue are incompletely understood. Unravelling novel mechanisms by which lung
protective TRM responses are regulated following influenza infection may aid the design of future influenza
therapeutics and/or influenza vaccines. The long-term objective of this grant is to investigate the molecular
mechanisms regulating the development of protective CD8 T cell immunity in the respiratory tract during
influenza infection.
We recently have identified the transcription factor, Bhlhe40, plays a central role in regulating the fitness
and function of influenza-specific CD8 TRM. In this application, we hypothesize that non-canonical TGFbR
signaling, through TAK1/Gadd45b-dependent pathway, facilitates Bhlhe40 expression and TRM
mitochondrial health, thereby promoting the maintenance and protective functions of TRM against influenza
infection. Three specific Aims are proposed: Aim 1: To determine the underlying mechanisms by which
Bhlhe40 promotes protective TRM responses following influenza infection. Aim 2: To elucidate the roles of
non-canonical TGFBR signaling, mediated through TAK1-Gadd45b pathway, in regulating TRM development
and/or maintenance. Aim 3: To define the roles of mitochondrial fitness, modulated by TAK1-Gadd45b-
Bhlhe40 pathway, in regulating TRM responses and protective function.
Each year, influenza virus infects 5–10% of adults and 20–30% of children, killing as many as 500,000
people globally. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating the formation and/or
maintenance of lung protective TRM responses following influenza infection and/or immunization may aid the
design of future influenza therapeutics and novel influenza vaccines."
10834973,"Veterans of the Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn
(OEF/OIF/OND) era are a unique population facing unprecedented obstacles; over 30% struggle with
polytrauma, often a combination of traumatic brain injury (TBI), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and
psychological distress.1,2 The resulting physical and psychosocial disabilities contribute to poor reintegration,
characterized by high unemployment,3,4 deeply internalized stigma,5,6 and poor health status.7,8 These
disabilities are also significant contributors to food insecurity; being able to access/make use of food in
sufficient quantities to meet one’s perceived nutritional needs.9 Research is nascent, but preliminary data
suggest that over 25% of OEF/OIF/OND Veterans are food insecure.10 Historically viewed as an economic
concern, food insecurity is now understood to be influenced by a range of psychosocial determinants.11,12
Specifically, in the context of rehabilitation and recovery, there is an emerging understanding of nutrition as
a multifactorial concept, one which encompasses the physical, psychosocial, and environmental factors that
shape one’s relationship with food. Even as the International Classification of Functioning (ICF) prioritizes
physical functions, (e.g. self-feeding), researchers have called for rehabilitation services to expand their
approach beyond physical mobility or dexterity13,14 Nevertheless, the constructs that comprise food security,
heretofore termed “nutritional functioning”, have yet to be operationalized or systematically measured.
 The VHA’s Polytrauma System of Care provides rehabilitation services to thousands of Veterans.15 In
addition, since 2014, the Integrative Health Coordinating Center has led the implementation of the Whole
Health model of care,16 which offers integrative health (IH) modalities for polytraumatic injuries.17 Importantly,
within the Whole Health model, “Food and Drink” are core elements. Given this, both IH and polytrauma
settings are ideal locations for operationalizing and creating a measure of “nutritional functioning,” one that can
be used to evaluate injured Veterans’ use of and access to food, identify ‘gaps’ in for intervention, and serve as
an outcome for randomized clinical trials.
 To operationalize nutritional functioning in OEF/OIF/ONF Veterans with polytrauma, and to develop a
measure which encapsulates this concept, and can be validated in clinical settings, I propose to:
Aim 1: Conduct qualitative interviews to further operationalize the components of nutritional functioning in
OEF/OIF/OND Veterans with a history of polytrauma. Use the ICF framework to assess potential additional
components, and associated barriers/facilitators to nutritional functioning. Interview VHA providers to assess
perceptions regarding nutritional functioning.
Aim 2: Develop and pilot a measure of nutritional functioning using components operationalized in Aim 1. Use
expert panel input to evaluate content validity and clinical utility, and pilot the measure in a sample of
OEF/OIF/OND Veterans with polytrauma. Combine exploratory factor and Rasch model analyses to evaluate
dimensionality, scale appropriateness, and item level characteristics to inform measure refinements.
Aim 3: Conduct a validation study of the refined measure of nutritional functioning in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans
with and without polytrauma enrolled in IH and/or polytrauma rehabilitation services. Evaluate psychometric
properties - reliability, validity (construct, known-groups and convergent validity) and Rasch measurement
statistics to refine the measure further, and to develop it for future use as an outcome measure of nutritional
functioning among those with polytrauma.
 This proposal addresses the RR&D goal of maximizing functional recovery by focusing on applied
physical rehabilitation and psychological recovery. I will accomplish the proposed aims by seeking training
in nutritional methods in interdisciplinary settings, measure development, and intervention design."
10836439,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Breathing is an essential motor function for terrestrial life. Developmental and genetic disorders that
disrupt breathing, such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and Rett syndrome, often have fatal
consequences. This is likely due to the impaired development of neural circuits that control breathing. While
diaphragm muscle contractions, the driving force for inspiration in mammals, are controlled solely by motor
neurons (MNs) located in the phrenic motor column (PMC), respiration is regulated by complex neural circuitry
in the hindbrain. Despite the critical importance of these circuits, the molecular mechanisms that underlie their
connectivity are largely unknown.
 Our lab has shown that Hox5 transcription factors (TFs) drive phrenic MN connectivity and regulate the
expression of phrenic-specific cell adhesion molecules. My preliminary data indicate that Hox5 expression varies
across hindbrain respiratory nuclei, perhaps acting to confer subtype-specific characteristics required for
connectivity. In this proposal, I will investigate the function of Hox5 TFs and their downstream effectors in
establishing respiratory circuit connectivity.
In Aim 1, I will assess how Hox5 gene expression in respiratory premotor neurons underlies specific connectivity
between respiratory populations required for proper circuit function.
In Aim 2, I will use genetic manipulations to determine how select cell adhesion molecules act downstream of
Hox5 TFs to control respiratory connectivity and function.
 I have developed an integrative methodology combining genetic models, RNA-sequencing, retrograde
viral tracing, and electrophysiology to address these questions. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that
underlie respiratory circuit development could lead to improved treatment options for those suffering from
developmental or genetic diseases that affect breathing."

 Almost 10% of pregnancies world-wide were reported to have prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) (Popova,
Lange, Probst, Gmel, & Rehm, 2017). In the United States a conservative estimate of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum
Disorders (FASD) in first-grade children was 1-5% (May et al., 2018). These numbers are expected to increase,
given the slight but steady rise in alcohol use among pregnant women (Denny, Acero, Terplan, & Kim, 2020).
NIAAA established the Collaborative Initiative on the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) to inform and
develop effective interventions and treatment approaches for FASD through a highly integrated, multidisciplinary
research program involving basic scientists and clinical investigators. Central to the success of CIFASD is strong
central coordination provided through the Administrative Resource and a Data Coordination Resource (DCR).
 As part of CIFASD5, the DCR will collaborate with all projects and resources within the consortium to provide
support and management with respect to data collection, storage and sharing. Based on this central role, the
DCR will coordinate the efforts of the CIFASD5 investigators conducting human subjects research to meet the
requirement of depositing data into the NIAAA Data Archive (NDA) and will serve as the primary contact with
NDA in the biannual transfer of data to the NDA. The DCR will be responsible for ensuring data sharing in
CIFASD5 conforms with NIH Policy. In addition, the DCR will support the efforts of the Administrative Resource
in tracking progress of CIFASD5. To meet these goals, the DCR proposes the following specific aims:
1. Create a Data Coordination Resource (DCR) database for CIFASD5.
2. Serve as the CIFASD5 point of contact for the NIAAA Data Archive.
3. Expand the functionality of the DCR database.
4. Support the distribution of archived CIFASD data.
5. Maintain an online registry of consented CIFASD research participants available for recruitment
 into other projects."
10836565,"Project Summary/Abstract
The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is a multidisciplinary, international
consortium of research projects and resources charged with improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of
FASD. The Administrative Core/Resource (AdminC) of CIFASD has led this consortium since it was first
established in 2003 and plays a critical leadership role in coordinating research efforts and ensuring progress
toward consortium goals. CIFASD consists of multiple collaborative components including three resource U24s
(AdminC, Diagnostic-Telemedicine, and Data Coordination), eight clinical and/or translational U01 projects, and
two exploratory UH2 projects. One goal of CIFASD is to improve identification of individuals affected by prenatal
alcohol exposure (PAE). This will be accomplished by assessing biomarkers of exposure or effects, such as
immune, HPA, and miRNA profiles. In addition, CIFASD is implementing novel tools, such as 3D facial and
neurobehavioral screening to improve identification of FASD remotely through eHealth, providing more universal
accessibility. A focus on telemedicine provides access to dysmorphology evaluations in more diverse and remote
populations. CIFASD continues to study the effects of PAE on the whole body across the lifespan. Previous
results from CIFASD suggest that PAE may be a risk factor for numerous health issues (e.g., hypertension and
diabetes). By using interrelated clinical and preclinical research approaches, health outcomes and markers will
be examined at several ages. CIFASD continues work on interventions to mitigate the damaging effects of PAE
including a trial on tDCS, and expansions of eHealth initiatives to provide interventions to assist affected
individuals and their families. To improve prevention of maternal alcohol consumption and reduce risk for FASD,
a hybrid prevention strategy will be investigated. Implementation is a new focus of CIFASD; as unless tools
created in CIFASD are utilized clinically, their potential won’t be fully realized. Collectively, CIFASD projects will
move the FASD field forward, improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment and with the technology available
in eHealth serve a wide population. The Specific Aims of the AdminC are: 1) Provide scientific and administrative
direction, leadership, and oversight; 2) Facilitate communication among the projects and result dissemination;
3) Assist with data management; 4) Provide annual progress evaluations, and 5) Support projects by providing
outreach, eHealth, and implementation science resources and services. The AdminC supports the interactive
framework of CIFASD by regular communications with all members through monthly and biannual meetings;
leading the Steering Committee in the establishment and implementation of CIFASD priorities and policies;
supporting the Science Advisory Board’s evaluations of progress on each component and the overall mission of
CIFASD; serving as the liaison between the consortium’s project scientists and its NIAAA advisors; and
supporting outreach, eHealth, and implementation efforts."

10841561,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The human body is a complex ecosystem supporting symbiotic relationships with thousands of microbial species
that are integral to the health and metabolism of their hosts. Exploration of these interactions has led to countless
insights into areas such as microbial metabolism and community dynamics. With this growing body of knowledge,
the opportunity now exists to capitalize on our increasingly sophisticated understanding of the human microbiota
by expanding our efforts beyond discovery and characterization, toward engineering. Commensal microbes are
already perfectly suited for safe and effective colonization of various physiological niches; what remains is to
take advantage of their incredible genomic plasticity and ability to function as robust biochemical factories. This
proposal aims to develop human commensal microbes as vehicles for delivery of therapeutic compounds to
targeted body sites, an endeavor that requires a multifaceted and synergistic engineering approach. Specifically,
we aim to engineer gut bacteria to produce and secrete targeted biological therapeutics such as antibody
fragments in situ, with the goal of addressing multiple critical issues in human health. Antibodies offer a less toxic
alternative to standard, non-specific treatments such as broad-spectrum antibiotics and chemotherapeutics. Due
to their exquisite specificity, antibodies are capable of selective action, such as inhibiting the growth of pathogenic
microbes without disturbing the native microbial community, and abolishing tumors without damaging healthy
tissue. The use of antibody therapeutics to efficiently treat a broad range of infection and disease, however, is
hindered by two major obstacles: (1) the cost to produce and administer them can be prohibitively expensive,
especially in the case of bacterial infectious disease and (2) standard intravenous delivery is inefficient for
gastrointestinal therapy while oral administration of therapeutic antibodies yields poor results. We will therefore
engineer a system in which therapeutic antibody fragments are produced by human commensal microbes
residing in the gut, providing continuous on-site delivery of targeted treatments for gastrointestinal infections and
disease. This approach addresses key issues in antibiotic specificity, toxicity, and resistance, while establishing
the groundwork for further development of biological therapeutics at lower cost and greater convenience."
10841669,"Lowering TGs to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) is an active area of drug development. New
drugs under development target TG genes in the lipoprotein lipase (LPL). The status quo is that: (1) we know
little about potential beneficial and detrimental effects of long-term inhibition (or activation) of these target TG
genes; (2) most TG-lowering drugs in development focus on the LPL pathway--we need to identify new TG
targets in other pathways; (3) TG drug development currently targets one gene at a time and neglects agents
that affect many genes simultaneously. We propose to fill the knowledge gaps as follows.
 (1) TG levels are associated with many diseases and TG genes regulate many biological processes;
thus, long-term targeting of TG genes may have pleiotropic effects other than reducing CHD. Traditional post-
marketing approaches to identify such effects require a long time. The effects of long-term inhibition of TG
genes can be defined rapidly by studying individuals with genetically determined variation in gene function--a
Mendelian randomization approach. In Aim 1 we will define clinical phenotypes other than CHD associated
with genetically determined variation of TG gene function by using (a) known functional variants, (b) imputed
gene expression, and (c) a gene-specific genetic risk score (GRS) as proxies of long-term effect of drugs
targeting TG genes (LPL, APOC2, APOC3, ANGPTL3, and ANGPTL4) and testing their association with
~1,600 clinical phenotypes extracted from EHRs in BioVU (~130,000) and eMERGE (~100,000).
 (2) Identifying novel genes associated with TG levels will facilitate the development of TG-lowering drugs.
The high genetic diversity in people of African ancestry (AAs) enhances our ability to identify variants with large
effect size. A strategy of combining sequencing and extreme-tail sampling (studying people at the extremes of a
quantitative trait) led to the development of PCSK9 inhibitors to lower LDL-C. In Aim 2, we will apply extreme-
tail sampling and exome sequencing in AAs to identify new therapeutic targets for lowering TGs.
 (3) In addition to targeting one gene at a time, there is increasing interest in using the transcriptome for
drug development by searching for drugs that reverse the transcriptomic signature associated with a disease.
However, the measured transcriptome is affected by the disease itself and associated diseases and therapies.
In contrast, the genetic component of the transcriptome is not confounded in this way and is more likely to
represent a causal signal. In Aim 3, we will impute the genetically determined component of the TG
transcriptome (i.e., the virtual transcriptome). By searching drug perturbation databases, we will identify
repurposing drug candidates that reverse the TG virtual transcriptomic signature. The candidates identified will
be validated by characterizing their effects on measured TGs in large EHRs (BioVU and eMERGE).
 These studies will have potential high impact by identifying: 1) new uses and new adverse effects of
TG-lowering drugs in development; 2) new genetic targets for TG lowering; 3) existing drugs that lower TGs."

Fungal natural products (NPs) have been a preeminent source of medicine and played pivotal roles as
pharmaceuticals for the treatment of human diseases. The rapid expansion of fungal genome sequences
and the development of bioinformatics tools have enabled the identification of thousands of fungal NP
biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), thus providing an unprecedented opportunity to discover new fungal
NPs. However, the discovery of new bioactive fungal NPs remains challenging, due to difficulties in
prioritizing BGCs and genetic manipulations in fungi. In this proposal, we expect to build pipelines to
rapidly discover novel bioactive fungal natural products that can serve as the next generation of drug
candidates for the treatment of human diseases; to do this, we will apply the CRISPR Cas genome editing
technologies and dedicate these tools to the biosynthesis of fungal natural products. To achieve the
research goal, our first direction will focus on identifying and characterizing rarely discovered
ribosomally synthesized and post‐translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) from fungal origins. Due to
RiPPs’ unique biosynthetic machinery, complex chemical characteristics, and important pharmacological
properties, bacterial RiPPs have drawn strong interest from both academia and the pharmaceutical
industry. However, only a handful of RiPPs have been identified from fungi, even though fungi is known
to be a profilic producer of NPs. By characterizing novel biosynthetic enzymes of known RiPPs and new
fungal BGCs identified by bioinformatics analysis, we expect to greatly broaden and deepen our
understanding of the biosynthesis of fungal RiPPs and expand the repertoire of novel fungal RiPP NPs.
Our second direction will focus on expanding and applying CRISPR‐based genome engineering toolkits to
characterize biosynthetic gene clusters from filamentous fungi. CRISPR‐Cas tools have been successfully
demonstrated to be feasible in fungal species but are rarely applied in the investigation of fungal NP
biosynthesis. We will develop complementary sets of CRISPR‐Cas tools for manipulating fungal
biosynthetic gene clusters in both native and heterologous expression hosts. By doing so, we expect to
develop a full set of CRISPR gene‐editing toolkits to rapidly carry out genetic manipulations to study
natural product biosynthesis in filamentous fungi. Together, the two research directions and
collaborative research endeavors through BGC characterization, genetic tool advancement, and new
bioinformatics algorithm development will build a complete pipeline to significantly increase the
repertoire of fungal NPs and analogs, especially fungal RiPPs, making these molecules valuable drug
candidates for human therapeutics."

Duke University and North Carolina Central University (NCCU), a historically Black institution, are applying for
competitive renewal of our BIRCWH program. The Duke/NCCU BIRCWH is a strong, vibrant program that has
the leadership and institutional commitment required for continued success. Our partnership, now in its 20th
year, provides the foundation for a program that encompasses interdisciplinary research, structured mentoring,
and individualized career development for junior faculty, with three major goals: (1) Develop highly skilled,
innovative researchers who use interdisciplinary approaches to investigate women’s health and sex/gender
influences across the lifespan; (2) Foster diversity in women’s health research and advance health disparities
research affecting women’s health by identifying and recruiting scholars from diverse backgrounds and (3)
Enable and equip BIRCWH scholars to lead interdisciplinary teams of scientists, and to become the mentors
and leaders of the future. We have supported 24 BIRCWH scholars from a wide range of personal, scientific,
and academic backgrounds, and 21% have been from groups underrepresented in medicine (URiM). We plan
to continue to support three junior faculty members at a time, including one from a URiM group. Drawing on the
breadth and depth of expertise at our two universities, we have the capacity to advance the career
development of scholars interested in basic, clinical, or health services research across a broad range of
fields. Taking advantage of synergy between our expert advisors, supportive leadership, and experienced
BIRCWH mentors (27 disciplines, 46% women, 25% URiM), our scholars learn to integrate approaches to focus
on women’s health and sex/gender differences in human disease. Scholars’ interdisciplinary mentoring teams
invariably include a mentor from our core group of nationally known senior investigators from Duke and NCCU,
with others added to maximize interdisciplinary expertise and collaborations. Our program spans two to five
years, depending on each scholar’s career development needs, and consists of intense, hands-on research;
didactic course work; and training in grant writing, health disparities, team science, SABV and RCR. Each
scholar's progress is monitored by the Leadership Team and the Internal Advisory Committee (IAC). The
program is assessed and advised by the IAC and an External Advisory Committee. At the completion of the
program, scholars will have published results in peer-reviewed journals, obtained funding as a PI, and
become leaders and mentors themselves. Our alumni scholars have been promoted to full Professor (32%),
obtained federal funding (68%) and advanced into leadership positions including academic Vice Chairs, Vice
Deans, Associate Vice Provost, and Associate Vice President for Research. External evaluations of our
program and scholars are performed by an independent evaluator in the Duke Social Science Research
Institute. As our track record shows, the Duke/NCCU BIRCWH program is achieving its goal to increase the
size and influence of a diverse pool of highly trained women’s health researchers who are poised to address the
nation’s biomedical, behavioral, and clinical needs."
10843096,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of this proposal is to understand the upstream molecular mechanisms underlying the spread of tau-
mediated neurofibrillary tangle pathology within the highly integrated cholinergic nucleus basalis-default mode
network (Ch4-DMN) connectome during the transition from no cognitive impairment (NCI) to mild cognitive
impairment (MCI). We recently showed that toxic tau oligomer accumulation within Ch4 subfields follows a
caudal-to-rostral gradient during disease progression. Our new pilot data show that tau oligomer accumulation
within DMN hubs begins in the precuneus (PreC), which is innervated by the caudal Ch4 subfields, before
spreading to the frontal cortex (FC), which is innervated by the rostral Ch4 subfields. Hence, the spatiotemporal
pattern of tangle evolution within the DMN may mirror the topography of tau pathology observed in innervating
Ch4 subfields, suggesting a pathological spread of neurodegeneration within Ch4-DMN circuits. Aim 1 will test
this hypothesis by interrogating DMN tissue categorized as low pathology (LP)-NCI, high pathology (HP)-NCI,
MCI, or Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with site-specific tau pretangle antibodies, unbiased stereology, and optical
density methods. The molecular mechanisms driving tau pathology within the Ch4-DMN connectome are
unknown and may provide key insights into novel disease-modifying targets. Our previous gene expression
profiling of Ch4 neurons revealed alterations in tau metabolic pathways in MCI, including increased expression
of tau kinases, decreased expression of tau phosphatases, and skewing of the ratio of 3-repeat to 4-repeat tau
isoforms. One potential regulatory pathway causing these changes may involve small non-coding microRNAs
(miRNAs), which control mRNA stability. Pilot miRNA sequencing revealed multiple miRNAs dysregulated in
MCI and AD that target tau metabolism. In particular, miR-298 was significantly upregulated in AD, whereas miR-
298 overexpression in human mixed brain cultures reduced the levels of higher molecular-weight tau monomers,
suggesting miR-298 influences tau isoform composition. Therefore, Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that miRNAs
targeting tau metabolic mRNAs are dysregulated within the DMN connectome in HP-NCI and MCI by using laser
capture microdissection of pretangle-bearing DMN cortical neurons, followed by miRNA sequencing,
bioinformatics, target mRNA analysis, and validation studies. Aim 3 will then use a host of stringent miRNA-
mRNA interaction and expression assays, tau biochemical, and neuronal morphometric and functional analyses
to test the hypothesis that candidate miRNAs identified in Aim 2 will mechanistically interact with tau and tau
metabolic pathway mRNAs to impact tau pathology in human mixed brain cultures. We will also explore miRNAs
related to cholinergic, RNA splicing, synaptic, amyloid, and inflammatory pathways in collaboration with Projects
3 and 4. Altogether, these project aims will identify select miRNA pathways as critical upstream regulators of tau
metabolism related to the pathological aggregation and circuit-based spread of tau pathology within the Ch4-
DMN connectome prior to MCI, thus revealing novel potential targets for therapy."
10843097,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite the fact that by the year 2050 older people at risk for cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
are predicted to reach 13 million, treatment approaches are woefully lacking. Although cholinergic dysfunction is
a mainstay of AD, and cholinesterase inhibitors remain the drugs of choice for the management of mild to
moderate AD, it does not prevent disease onset or modify its progression. Our goal is to elucidate the earliest
molecular and cellular events underlying the selective neuronal vulnerability of the cholinergic basal forebrain
(CBF) memory and executive function interactome in order to provide new and improved CBF interventions, to
be used in combination with drugs that target other AD hallmarks, (e.g., tau and amyloid) during the preclinical
stage of the disease. In AD, the magnitude of CBF neuron and volume loss and neurofibrillary tangle (NFT)
formation displays a rostrocaudal pattern with greatest neurodegeneration in the posterior followed by the
intermediate and then the anterior subfield, the least affected cholinergic (Ch4) subgroup. The Ch4 subfields
were recently recognized as a as a critical subcortical regulatory node of the default mode network (DMN),
which displays circuit-driven AD pathology associated with episodic memory and executive function deficits
early in AD. CBF degeneration is not only manifested by specific post-translational tau modifications, but by a
confluence of intracellular events that occur prior to the onset of clinical symptoms. We recently provided novel
evidence that presplicing U1 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) aggregate and are associated with
NFTs in sporadic and familial AD, but not other neurologic diseases. We now report that defects in presplicing
proteins are involved in CBF neuronal degeneration during the earliest preclinical stages of AD. Project 3 will
translate information derived from a uniquely human condition, preclinical AD. Notwithstanding the conceptually
and technically inventive approaches employed (i.e., oligomeric tau and presplicing antibodies, single
population microarray and RNA sequencing approaches), studying the role(s) that presplicing plays in NFT
evolution within vulnerable CBF neurons using clinically and neuropathological well-characterized same from
preclinical, MCI and AD cases from the Rush Religious Orders Study (RROS) is highly innovative. Project 3 is
posited to lay the groundwork for a wide range of potential interventions via transcriptionally aided drug design
and suggest novel biomarkers for early AD diagnosis."

Defining mechanisms that underlie brain resilience to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the discordance between
normal cognition and substantial AD pathology, which occurs in preclinical AD, will provide insights into novel
therapeutic targets to prevent dementia. To address this concept, we propose to investigate alterations in
neurotransmitter systems and synaptic proteins within the default mode network (DMN), a cortical connectome
involving the precuneus (PreC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and frontal cortex (FC), which is prone to
amyloid pathology and functional connectivity changes in preclinical and prodromal [mild cognitive impairment,
(MCI)]. Project 4 demonstrated a loss of synapses within DMN regions in early AD, but not in MCI compared
to subject with no cognitive impairment (NCI). In contrast, we observed upregulated cholinergic activity in FC,
but not in the PreC compared to glutamatergic denervation in both regions in MCI. This suggests that a DMN
region-specific cholinergic neuroplasticity response, may contribute to brain resilience. Whether similar
mechanism(s) occur in preclinical AD is of key importance for drug target discovery. Neuropsychological and
neuropathological evaluation of Rush Religious Order Study subjects provides a unique opportunity to
investigate compensatory synaptic and neurotransmitter responses associated with resilience in conjunction
with AD pathology in NCI with low (LP-NCI) or high (HP-NCI) pathology, MCI and AD. Aim 1A will use confocal
immunofluorescence microscopy with unbiased stereology to determine whether different neurochemically-
defined synaptic terminals within the DMN conectome are resilient or vulnerable in HP-NCI, MCI, and AD
relative to LP-NC. We will correlate these findings with cognitive test scores across groups. Aim 1B will use a
novel liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) targeted proteomic assay to determine
whether different synaptic proteins within the DMN interactome are resilient or vulnerable in same cases. Aim
2 will determine whether AD neuropathology in the DMN interactome moderates the relationship between
synaptic and cognitive measures, by quantifying Tau and amyloid concentrations and pathology in the DMN in
the same Aim 1 cases. Aim 3 will examine whether markers of neuroinflammation moderate the relationship
between synaptic loss and cognition in the DMN using the same Aim 1 and Aim 2 cases. The translational
value of Project 4 is highlighted by our use of in vitro binding assays with tritiated ligands for Tau and amyloid
PET imaging, in the same brain regions analyzed for quantitative biochemistry of Tau, amyloid and synaptic
markers. The proposed studies will provide pivotal data needed to understand the mechanisms underlying
circuit-specific resilience or vulnerability to AD pathology in the preclinical stage of the disease and provide
insight into potential new drug therapies."
10841232,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bladder cancer is responsible for 80,000 cancer diagnoses and 20,000 deaths annually in the US. Approximately
one-fourth of bladder cancer patients will be diagnosed with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), an
aggressive but potentially curable disease state. In the US, the most common treatment for MIBC is bladder
removal (i.e., radical cystectomy), but a bladder-sparing approach using concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT)
is associated with similar disease outcomes and improved quality-of-life. MIBCs harbor numerous recurrent
genetic alterations, including frequent alterations in DNA repair pathway genes, particularly nucleotide excision
repair (NER; ~15% of tumors) and homologous recombination repair (HRR; ~10% of tumors), and we and others
have shown that NER and HRR deficiency confers unique biological properties and therapeutic sensitivities. In
the past two years, two antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have been approved for treatment of chemotherapy-
refractory metastatic bladder cancer: enfortumab vedotin (EV) combines a nectin-4 targeting antibody with the
microtubule poison vedotin whereas sacituzumab govitecan (SG) combines a trop-2 targeting antibody with the
type I topoisomerase inhibitor govitecan. Multiple EV and SG clinical trials are now on-going in multiple bladder
cancer settings; however, the interaction of ADCs with RT in bladder cancer has not been investigated. Our
central hypothesis is that radiation upregulates nectin-4 and trop-2 expression on bladder cancer cells, and
therefore that combining EV or SG with radiation is a compelling synthetic combination strategy for MIBC
treatment. Our hypothesis is supported by preliminary data from a bladder cancer cell line demonstrating
radiation-induced increase in nectin-4 and trop-2 expression as well as synergistic cell killing when EV or SG is
combined with radiation. However, comprehensive analysis across preclinical models that represent the
molecular diversity of MIBC is currently lacking. The overall goal of the proposed work is to investigate the impact
of radiation on expression of nectin-4 and trop-2 in bladder tumors and to define the activity of EV and SG with
radiation across molecularly annotated human MIBC preclinical models. In Aim 1, we will measure radiation
dose- and time-dependent changes in nectin-4 and trop-2 at the gene and protein levels across bladder cancer
cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models. We will also test the combined effect of EV plus RT and SG plus
RT on cellular properties and tumor response in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 2, we will test the impact of NER and
HRR deficiency on sensitivity to EV- and SG-based treatments using a suite of isogenic cellular systems available
in our lab. Given the known mechanisms of vedotin and govitecan, we expect NER and HRR deficiency to
increase sensitivity to SG- but not EV-based radiation combinations. Together, we expect these studies to reveal
a novel and compelling synthetic combination strategy using ADCs with RT to effectively target bladder tumors.
We believe these studies will directly inform the design of novel clinical trials testing EV- and SG-radiation
combinations that could improve bladder-sparing treatment for MIBC."

20%/yr)(2). As hunting is a roughly $26 billion (per annum) industry(1), CWD represents an enormous potential
health and economic threat. The commonalities among vCJD and cervid CWD, including the presence of
hematogenous infectivity(34,47), are remarkable. Antemortem detection and surveillance of human, and
animal, prion disease has been hindered by the combination of low prion concentrations and abundant

specific and highly sensitive in vitro assays to detect blood-borne prions(9-11). In this competing renewal we will
quantitate the temporal distribution and specific blood cell phenotypes critical to prionemia in serially-collected
human and cervid blood samples.
The translational impact of the results of these studies will:
 a) improve human blood transfusion safety,
 b) provide a better means to assess and monitor developing prion therapeutics,
 c) largely eliminate the risks of human consumption of cervid prions,
 d) provide greater understanding of the prevalence and consequences of CWD to the cervid hunting and

 The UCSF Core Center for Musculoskeletal Biology and Medicine (CCMBM) is an interdisciplinary
consortium of basic and clinical scientists dedicated to understanding the biology and pathophysiology of
musculoskeletal disease. The goal is to stimulate and support cross-cutting collaborations and promote
efficient access to research resources amongst existing, premier research programs at UCSF in order
to accelerate translational research in musculoskeletal science. A fundamental challenge for bench-to-
bedside translational research is the need to validate in humans the findings from small animal models. The
hallmark of CCMBM success has been in helping investigators overcome this obstacle by connecting
researchers who study disease biology with experts who develop advanced human imaging tools and methods,
scientists who analyze vast archives of clinical and genomic data, and practitioners who actively treat patients.
The CCMBM has three cores: 1) Skeletal Biology and Biomechanics Core; 2) Imaging Core; and 3)
Epidemiology, Bioinformatics and Study Design Core. These cores provide research support and technical
training, as well as a venue for new collaborations and an entry point for new members. The Center also fosters
scientific exchange through an Enrichment Program; the curriculum includes seminars featuring local and visiting
scientists, an annual full-day retreat, and a symposium with a rotating topic relevant to our theme of Translational
Discovery in Musculoskeletal Biology and Medicine. A vital component of the Center is its Pilot/Feasibility grant
program, which nearly triples the CCMBM investment of seed funding for junior investigators in musculoskeletal
research. A Tools and Technology grant program provides funds to Center members to use and customize
specialized research services and analytical approaches, available in the UCSF CTSI and other outstanding
Centers, for musculoskeletal research. Finally, with a new University of California systemwide UC STRETCH
initiative, the CCMBM is poised to extend access to these resources and cultivate a diverse workforce of
musculoskeletal scientists. The funding base for the CCMBM is robust, support from UCSF is strong, and
opportunities for interactions within and outside the Center are numerous. The object of the Center is to make
optimum use of all available resources to catalyze translational discovery in musculoskeletal health and disease."

Over vertebrate evolution, the development of the myelin sheath has contributed to the expansion of the central
nervous system and the emergence of complex brain function. Cumulative evidence indicates that the level of
myelination and its positioning over the axon may be dependent on the class identity of myelinated neurons. A
canonical example is the difference between L5 projection neurons, with extensive and uniform myelination, and
the L2/3 callosal projection neurons, with lower and more diverse patterns of myelination, including “intermittent”
profiles, where myelin tracts are separated by long unmyelinated regions rather than short nodes of Ranvier.
Little is known about the mechanistic principles underlying cellular interaction between myelinating
oligodendrocytes (OL) and axons of distinct neuronal classes in the CNS. Yet this knowledge is fundamental to
understanding the cellular and developmental biology of myelination and regeneration. Focusing on the
neocortex, we propose to answer fundamental questions regarding the mechanisms that control neuron-type
specific myelination, and test hypotheses on how “attractive” and “repulsive” cues expressed by neuronal
subtypes dynamically regulate their interactions with OLs. Here, we will 1) use molecular profiling of
oligodendrocytes and cortical neuron subtypes across different cortical layers to map differences in their
transcriptome, and use this data to generate a molecular interactome of candidates for genes mediating neuron-
OL communication that may regulate neuron-subtype-specific myelination. We will 2) employ a screen to identify
candidates able to induce or repress myelination (Aim 1). We will then 3) investigate membrane protein
composition of myelinated and unmyelinated axonal segments of a specific neuronal class at subcellular
resolution to understand the regulation of myelin positioning along the axon; and further 4) study whether long
unmyelinated regions are differentially enriched for functionally-relevant structures such as synapses, gap
junctions, and axonal branches (Aim 2). It has been reported that increased neuronal activity promotes
myelination, which in turn stabilizes axon structure and neural circuit connectivity. Disrupted myelination can
contribute to many debilitating neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia, and
promoting oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination is an important therapeutic goal. We will investigate
the molecular mechanisms that control cell-type specific adaptive remodeling of myelin and its regeneration after
demyelination (Aim 3). In summary, the work proposed here aims to inform a conceptual framework for how
different classes of neurons and oligodendrocytes interact to achieve differential myelination, mechanisms that
will be critical in understanding the role of myelin in circuit function and dysfunction."

The incorporation of halogen atoms (F-, Cl-, Br-, I-) in small organic molecules plays a significant role in
modulating their physical properties and biological activities while providing a synthetic handle for additional
chemical modification. The regioselective and enantioselective installation of halogens in a strictly
chemosynthetic manner is technically challenging and frequently utilizes toxic reagents and generates
undesirable byproducts. In contrast, Nature has developed efficient enzymatic strategies to incorporate aqueous
halide ions into organic scaffolds with negligible waste production. This proposal focuses on the exploration of a
unique family of halogenating enzymes, specifically the bacterial site-specific vanadium dependent
haloperoxidases (VHPOs), that use a coordinated vanadate ion (VO43-) and co-substrate hydrogen peroxide to
oxidize aqueous halide ions and install them in a regio- and stereospecific manner on organic substrates. Despite
their involvement in constructing multiple bioactive natural product scaffolds and catalyzing chemically diverse
and useful reactions without additional cofactors or coenzymes, only a small fraction of the hundreds of site-
specific VHPO homologs have been rigorously characterized. The exploration of this poorly defined chemical
and biochemical space is what intellectually drives this proposal. Using interdisciplinary chemical, biochemical,
and genomic techniques, we aim to better understand bacterial site-specific VHPO enzymology through three
independent, yet interrelated objectives. The first involves the genomic identification and categorization of novel
VHPO homologs available within publicly available repositories. Improved representation of microbial site-
specific halogenases will permit us to correlate genomic sequences to biochemical reactivities with the ultimate
intention of predicting chemistries directly from bioinformatic signatures. The second objective involves
understanding the roles of uncharacterized VHPOs within bacterial secondary metabolism and chemical ecology.
The majority of known bacterial site-specific homologs catalyze chemically unique reactions in natural product
biosynthetic pathways; these biochemistries are critical for establishing the bioactivities of their cognate products.
We propose that novel VHPO reactivities and diverse substrate scaffolds remain to be discovered, and that the
use of homologous genes as biosynthetic ‘hooks’ will facilitate the genome-based identification of new secondary
metabolites. Finally, we aim to define the structural determinants of halide and organic substrate specificity for
synthetic applications, either within their native substrates or expanded to novel scaffolds. These objectives will
simultaneously improve our understanding of VHPO halogenation enzymology at the substrate and
macromolecular level and will facilitate biocatalytic efforts to apply these site-specific microbial halogenases
towards chemically useful transformations."

10843275,"ABSTRACT
Cancer immunotherapies represent a powerful and newly emergent therapeutic paradigm, both because of their durable
clinical responses and applicability to a wide variety of tumors. Immune checkpoint therapies block inhibitory receptors
on T cells in order to augment anti-tumor immune responses. Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is a critical inhibitory
checkpoint for T cells. The identification and clearance of malignant cells can be brought about by antibodies which block
PD-1. Despite the success of these antibodies, most patients do not respond to PD-1 blockade, and many experience
immune-related adverse events. New studies indicate that some 5-10% of patients demonstrate accelerated cancer
progression after anti-PD-1 treatment, in contrast to predicted responses based on current mechanistic models. With both
the potential successes and failures of PD-1 being so significant, the need to understand PD-1 signaling is evidently very
urgent, both for explaining the mechanism of clinical responses and for developing therapeutics that go beyond simply
interfering with ligand binding. We have developed a new method to analyze mass spectrometry data and discovered
novel effectors of PD-1 signaling. Most excitingly, we have identified multiple candidates, including the kinase VRK2 which
we intend to investigate further. The overarching goal of this proposal is to study PD-1-associated kinases in order to
better define novel signaling pathways and to uncover T cell-intrinsic mechanisms which contribute to resistance to PD-1
blockade. In the first aim, we will discover the molecular mechanism by which VRK2 controls PD-1 signaling in T cells. We
will perform structure-function analyses to test the hypothesis that VRK2’s enzymatic domain is required for mediating
specific PD-1 functions and utilize biochemical and imaging approaches to uncover the contribution made by VRK2
interactions with MAPK8IP1 and MAP3K7 towards PD-1 signaling. In the second aim we will test the hypothesis that VRK2
is required for PD-1 inhibition of cellular functions in vivo. We will utilize VRK2 KO mice to uncover the mechanism by
which VRK2 supports tumor growth in vivo in the context of PD-1 blockade and resistance. Given the large impact of PD-
1 on public health, the proposed work is incredibly significant."

This Administrative Core will mediate three functions. As part of the first function, it will help
coordinate the Principal Project, the Collaborative Project and the Pilot Project. At a fixed time
on the first Monday of every month the project coordinator and the Investigators and
Coinvestigators of the three projects will meet face-to- face or by Zoom at Massachusetts
General Hospital to chart progress and coordinate studies and sample collection. These
meetings will expand on ongoing regular monthly meetings currently being held. A second goal
of this Core will be to make available tools of Human Immunology research to other
investigators at MGH studying autoimmune disorders other than lgG4-Related Disease
including Next Gen sequencing for repertoire, expertise with investigating immune cells and
tissues in depth, cell storage and profiling techniques. The ACE program coordinator will
regularly inform the broader MGH community of the time and location of the monthly meetings
and an hour will be set aside by the Principal Investigator to meet clinicians and other
investigators at the MGH who seek to interact. These interactions will also facilitate some of the
studies of the Principal Project on the causes of IgG4-related disease. The third goal of this
Core and its coordinator will be to generate a portal for interaction with
other ACEs and to share information on Immune repertoires, microbial community
characteristics and chromatin data with other groups working across the country on
autoimmunity, not necessarily restricted to other ACEs."
10843847,"Project Summary/Abstract
Ectodomain shedding is a fundamental process in biology that enables a cell to change the membrane protein
topology, affecting cell adhesion and signal transduction pathways. Accordingly, the enzymes that function in
ectodomain shedding are vital to human health and dysregulated in disease pathogenesis. Despite the
importance of these enzymes in human health, the molecular and atomic details that govern zymogen
maturation, activation, substrate selectivity, macromolecular inhibition and subcellular compartmentalization are
limited to a few examples. The long-term goal of my research program is to study the mechanistic details
of membrane tethered enzymes, revealing the universal concepts in ectodomain shedding that underpin
enzyme function and the unique properties that position an enzyme into a biological niche. Initially, we
are prioritizing the study of the a disintegrin and metalloproteinase family, specifically ADAM17, to launch my
research program as a new principal investigator.
ADAMs are complex multidomain type1 transmembrane enzyme that have essential functions in development,
fertilization and immunity. ADAM17 is credited to process over 80 different protein substrates and have essential
functions in immunity, skin morphogenesis and development of heart valve formation. All ADAMs are initially
translated as a zymogen, bound by a prodomain that functions to control enzyme latency. ADAM17 zymogen
maturation and transport through the cell is dependent on an interaction with a family of inactive rhomboid
proteins, iRhom1 and -2. Appropriately, iRhoms are positioned as vital regulators of ADAM17 activity. Despite
ADAM17s well characterized roles in development and homeostasis, significant shortcomings persist in
understanding the molecular events that regulate enzyme activity, such as zymogen maturation, enzyme
activation and association with regulatory proteins. To address these knowledge gaps, my research program will
bring new innovative approaches to the field and leverage my experience in structural and cell biology to
characterize the atomic details that regulate ADAM17 activity. Specifically, we will determine the atomic details
of the ADAM prodomain and uncover the properties that lead to enzyme specificity and inhibition. In addition,
we propose to use X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy to reveal the mechanistic details into ADAM17
activation and recognition by the accessory proteins, iRhom1 and 2. Finally, we will use an unbiased proteomic
mass spectroscopy approach to specifically evaluate the ADAM17-iRhom complex during enzyme activation in
addition to identifying the subcellular compartment and activity modulating proteins in regulating ADAM17
activity. In the next five years, we aim to develop a unified model for ADAM17 regulation and construct the
foundation to expand our efforts to include additional membrane tethered proteases and families that function in
ectodomain shedding."
10843848,"PROJECT SUMMARY
African-American women across the US experience alarmingly higher rates of maternal mortality than
their white counterparts. Factors associated with social determinants of health (SDoH), including
education, housing, transportation, and nutrition are recognized as potentially contributiing to this
disparity in maternal health outcomes, along with clinical risk factors including hypertension and heart
disease. However, the complex associations among these factors, along with the causal role they play in
increased risk for maternal mortality, are not well understood, nor are there comprehensive health care
interventions that take these combined factors into account to provide decision and communication
support for patients, providers, and community support workers. The Analytics and Machine-learning
for Maternal-health Interventions (AMMI) initiative, a collaborative effort from researchers at UNC-
Chapel Hill, Duke, and Wake Forest, aims to address these gaps by developing a machine learning-
enhanced health technology framework to reduce downstream risk of maternal mortality in African-
American women. By integrating data across the three institutions that includes both clinical and SDoH
factors, and by building machine learning applications grounded in this data, AMMI’s goals are to: 1)
clarify and track contributions of biological, clinical, and SDoH factors toward specific maternal
morbidities associated with eventual mortality, 2) conduct efficient and accurate risk predictions to
determine whether patients fall into defined target risk groups, and 3) translate these risk predictions
into interventions appropriate for providers, patients, and community support organizations. A key
focus of the initiative is to create an advanced technology infrastructure supporting connectivity and
communication among these three types of stakeholders, with the goal of building trust and awareness
based on automatically curated decision support aids and ultimately mitigating patient risk. To this end,
Aim 1, focused on establishing system requirements, begins with the formation of a stakeholder group
that brings together patient, provider, and community support organization representatives to engage
in design and evaluation with AMMI researchers throughout the project. Aim 2 focuses on systems
development, including the creation of 1) a custom-built clinical and SDoH data mart, 2) clinical decision
support software using machine learning algorithms, and 3) three user-facing apps aimed at providers,
patients and community support personnel, and AMMI researchers. Aim 3 focuses on pilot-level
deployment of the system, integrating the AMMI apps through Epic to provide informational
interventions to providers, patients, and community support personnel. Aim 4 engages stakeholders in
formative and summative evaluation during and after the deployment phase (Aim 3), including both
testing of the software function and measurement of the impact of AMMI interventions on end users."

 This is the second renewal of Mount Sinai's Jointly Sponsored Institutional Predoctoral T32 Training
Program in Neuroscience. The objective of the Training Program is to provide rigorous, broad-based,
individualized and multidisciplinary training to Year 1 and 2 predoctoral students in basic, translational and
clinical neuroscience research, thereby enhancing the ability of our trainees to acquire critical skillsets
necessary for high-quality doctoral dissertation research and a productive and impactful career in the science-
related workforce. To accomplish this, the Training Program leverages the intimate association between the
Mount Sinai Hospital and Health System, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Mount Sinai's
Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, physically embedded together under one leadership, to expose
trainees to the enormous breadth of basic, translational and clinical scientific approaches and model systems
represented by an outstanding training faculty, ranging from structure/function analysis of individual synapses,
to computational modeling of gene, protein and connectivity networks in healthy and diseased brains, to
behavioral, electrophysiological and imaging studies of a variety of organisms, including humans. Mount Sinai
has undergone an enormous expansion in basic and clinical research infrastructure, neuroscience faculty
recruitment and a 3-fold increase in applications to the Neuroscience PhD program. Thus, seven training slots
per year are requested. Our trainees participate in an integrated program of Core courses (spanning genes,
molecules, cells, synapses, circuits, systems, behaviors and brain pathophysiology) and includes a course with
direct patient contact. Courses are team-taught by an exceptional faculty using different teaching styles,
including flipped classrooms and other approaches. Additional first-year courses include Responsible Conduct
in Research, Rigor and Reproducibiity, an intensive Biostatistics course (with a parallel lab in R-programming)
a Journal Club/WIP and research rotations. By the end of the first year, trainees select a thesis lab, and during
their second year, commence dissertation research while taking at least two Advanced Electives from a large
number of courses offered across the Institution. This allows each trainee to customize their coursework to
their particular research and training goal needs. Trainees in our program also benefit from numerous activities
that enhance their research experience, including science theme-based Clubs, seminars, career development
opportunities, teaching and peer-mentoring activities, an annual retreat and other cohesion-building events.
This Neuroscience Training Program T32 is essential to Mount Sinai's mission of providing fundamental
neuroscience research training to our students, and serves as the principal research training, mentoring and
financial engine driving specifically early-stage predoctoral students seeking a PhD in Neuroscience."
10843946,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
As of 2020, 37.7 million patients are living with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Combination
antiretroviral therapies (cARTs) are used to treat HIV-1 infected patients, but the effectiveness of these cARTs
is threatened by viral drug resistance mutations most frequently caused by patient non-adherence to daily dosing
regimens. Potent antivirals with long-acting potential are urgently needed to prevent drug resistance mutations.
Islatravir (4’-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2’-deoxyadenosine), often referred to as EFdA, is a highly potent long-acting HIV-
1 nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) translocation inhibitor currently in phase III clinical trials. In these clinical
trials, EFdA is administered in combination with other HIV-1 antivirals including non-nucleoside RT inhibitors.
Interestingly, non-nucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI) treatment, which include Doravirine, Etravirine, Rilpivirine, or
Elsulfavirine, leads to the RT F227C mutation, which remarkably makes HIV-1 more susceptible to EFdA.
However, why a mutation located at the distant non-nucleoside RT inhibitor pocket would cause RT to become
hypersensitive to EFdA, a compound that binds at the polymerase active site is not understood. Studies are
needed to understand the mechanism of RTF227C hypersensitivity to EFdA and how this mutation affects HIV-1
susceptibility to various RT antivirals. I hypothesize that the F227C mutation at the NNRTI binding pocket
structurally alters the polymerase active site, causing hypersensitivity to EFdA. To test this hypothesis, I will first
determine the structural basis of RTF227C hypersensitivity to EFdA using X-ray crystallography (Aim 1). Second,
I will determine the biochemical basis of RTF227C hypersensitivity to EFdA through a battery of biochemical
assays. These assays will test how the F227C mutation impacts EFdA-triphosphate incorporation, the ability of
RT to unblock EFdA-terminated primers, and the ability of RT to translocate along the nucleic acid (Aim 2).
Finally, I will determine how the F227C mutation affects HIV-1 susceptibility to various EFdA and RT inhibitor
combinations through biochemical and cell-based assays (Aim 3). I will take full advantage of our lab’s
background in RT biology and role in the development of EFdA, as it provides the necessary environment,
equipment, and streamlined protocols to complete these proposed experiments and contribute to my training.
These planned studies will not only advance the understanding of how RT drug resistance mutations impart
hypersensitivity to EFdA but will also aid in the development of optimized combinations with EFdA for the
treatment of HIV-1."

Little is known about how novel multicellular developmental programs arise in evolution, largely because
multicellularity arose deep in the past and early steps have been lost to extinction. The PI has circumvented this
constraint by creating a new model system, using directed evolution to directly study the origin of multicellularity
and development. The proposed research will help resolve two major knowledge gaps in the field of
developmental biology: 1) How does development evolve de novo? 2) What are the long-term evolutionary
consequences of development? After thousands of generations of directed evolution, the PI has observed the
evolution of autonomous cell type specification in snowflake yeast, his model system of early multicellularity.
Specifically, snowflake yeast form multicellular groups that are far more mechanically tough by adaptively
differentiating into two cell types, in which cells deep in the cluster interior change their budding angle by 90
degrees and interlock neighboring cellular branches. In this model system (and in most simple multicellular
organisms), a cell’s age provides key information about its location, allowing temporal changes in gene
expression to drive spatial patterns of cellular differentiation. Preliminary data suggests that the chaperone
protein Hsp90 has been co-opted to act as an age (and thus location)-dependent developmental switch,
regulating the transition between cell types. The proposed research will further examine the evolution of this
novel developmental mechanism, and will contextualize these wet-lab experiments with both 3D biophysical
simulations and evolutionary models, allowing the PI to derive general principles from these experimental
results. The proposed research will also examine how stochastic cellular behaviors can be co-opted for symmetry
breaking, allowing snowflake yeast to evolve more complex multicellular structures. Finally, the proposed
research will examine the evolutionary consequences of development: namely, how cellular differentiation can
entrench a lineage into a multicellular state. This work will examine how cellular differentiation strips cells of
their evolutionary autonomy by limiting the potential for reversion to unicellularity. Development would thus
have a doubly-profound impact on an organism’s evolutionary dynamics: opening new avenues for increased
multicellular complexity while closing off opportunities for ancestral, unicellular behaviors."

The ability of skeletal muscle to grow and respond to injury and disease largely depends on a population of 
myogenic stem cells, called satellite cells. In developing or injured muscle, satellite cells are highly-­activated 
and proliferative. Some daughter cells then undergo a complex program of differentiation that is necessary to 
establish or maintain muscle health and function. Perturbations of mechanisms that regulate satellite cell 
proliferation or differentiation can lead to loss of normal muscle function and, in some cases, reduce lifespan.  
 
We have discovered that the protein Klotho regulates satellite cell development in young, healthy muscle. As 
we explored the mechanisms through which Klotho affects satellite cells, we learned that Klotho reduces 
expression of an enzyme, Jmjd3, that activates genes by removing a silencing mark from lysine 27 on histone 
3 (H3K27). In addition, the Klotho-­induced reductions in Jmjd3 are associated with increased H3K27 
methylation and reduced expression of Wnt-­related genes that regulate myogenesis. Together, the 
observations suggest a novel mechanism through which myogenesis is regulated, involving signaling through a 
Klotho/Jmjd3/Wnt-­mediated pathway. Furthermore, the potential biological importance of the pathway is 
emphasized by our findings that the targeted deletion of Jmjd3 in satellite cells produced reductions in Wnt 
signaling, defects in myogenesis and death in neonatal mice. 
 
The central hypothesis of our proposed investigation is that signaling through the Klotho/Jmjd3/Wnt pathway 
plays an important role in myogenesis by regulating satellite cell numbers and differentiation. Furthermore, we 
propose that this pathway is conserved throughout life, beginning with the first appearance of satellite cells at 
the fetal muscle fiber surface and continuing into adulthood, when satellite cells are activated by injury or 
disease.  We propose to test that hypothesis through the following Specific Aims. 
 
Aim 1. Determine the effects of modulating Klotho and Jmjd3 on post-­natal muscle growth and differentiation.  
Aim 2. Determine the effects of modulating Klotho and Jmjd3 on muscle regeneration following acute injury.  
Aim 3. Determine the function of satellite cell Jmjd3 in late, fetal, muscle development.  
 
The proposed experiments will establish the importance of a novel mechanism that regulates satellite cell 
development and response to muscle injury. We believe that the outcomes of this investigation will deepen our

10843854,"ABSTRACT
Within their lifetime, over 30% of people living with diabetes will develop a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU), many of
which will never heal and may require amputation. Removable cast walkers (RCWs) are commonly prescribed
to offload (treat) DFUs. However, adherence with RCWs is low, which is a serious concern given that low
adherence predicts poor DFU healing. There is an urgent need to address factors that hinder adherent use
of RCWs to promote DFU healing. Our long-term goal is to optimize offloading adherence (OA), and
subsequent DFU healing outcomes, by considering not only how much the device offloads the DFU, but also
how much the device’s design impacts the patients’ experiences with the device. The objective of this proposal
is to provide pilot/feasibility data to inform a definitive randomized controlled trial (RCT) that will evaluate the
impact of existing RCW designs on OA and DFU healing and, secondarily, will facilitate development of a
predictive model to guide patient-specific prescription of offloading devices. Our working hypothesis is that
healing outcomes with a given RCW will be predicted by objective, biomechanical markers of RCW usability
(e.g., measures of stability) and by RCW-induced changes in patient-reported factors, with the predictive
relationship mediated by the effect of these measures on OA. We will consider three specific aims to achieve
the objective and provide evidence to support our hypothesis and our ability to conduct a larger follow-up
RCT: Aim 1: To examine the feasibility of conducting an RCT to evaluate the effects of RCW form on OA and
DFU healing; Aim 2: To collect preliminary data to quantify the effect of RCW form on biomechanical markers
of usability and patient-reported adherence factors in individuals with active DFU; and Aim 3: To collect
preliminary data to evaluate the strength of associations between OA and both biomechanical markers of
usability and patient-reported adherence factors. Across two study centers, participants will be randomized
to use one-of-two RCW designs for four weeks in conjunction with weekly standard-of-care treatment.
Throughout treatment, OA will be monitored using a novel dual accelerometer method and DFU healing will
be quantified via planimetric wound area measurements. At the start of treatment participants will complete a
series of surveys to assess patient-reported factors (e.g., depression). Patients will repeat surveys at the end
of treatment and also perform several tests within a motion capture lab to assess aspects of RCW usability
(e.g., stability & energetic costs of walking). The contribution of this work will be significant as it represents
the next step in a continuum of research expected to improve DFU healing rates and reduce DFU
complications including amputation, their associated medical costs and negative impact on well-being. The
proposed study is innovative as it challenges current practice and guidelines by taking a patient-centered
approach to DFU healing, which considers an offloading devices’ impact on the patient experience, rather
than solely considering the devices’ functional offloading capacity."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that adversely affects cognition and daily
functioning in older adults. Functional MRI is a non-invasive and widely available neuroimaging tool that can be
used to identify early manifestations of AD, which can then be used as a complimentary biomarker to enrich
clinical trials with those patients most likely to decline. Recent investigations have suggested that the core brain
abnormalities in AD may not arise from structural or even functional connectivity, but rather the timing of brain
activity. Abnormal brain timing is an intuitive mechanism for decreased cognitive flexibility, and may serve as a
biomarker for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. The purpose of this study is to investigate how changes
in the temporal duration of functional connectivity are related to MCI and AD. The specific aims are: 1)
Characterize the temporal aspects of functional connectivity in cognitively intact individuals and those with
cognitive impairment (MCI and AD); 2) Examine the evolution of sustained and lag-based connectivity in
individuals with cognitive impairment and establish which biological and cognitive factors predict change; and 3)
Evaluate the predictive performance of sustained and lag-based connectivity as a biomarker for cognitive
impairment. This proposal is designed to facilitate the career development of Dr. Jace King in acquiring the
necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a lead investigator in brain related
dysfunction associated with MCI and AD. To excel as an independent researcher, Dr. King will obtain research
skills in the following areas: 1) neuropsychological, neurobiological and clinical manifestations of AD; 2)
longitudinal study design and analysis; and 3) advanced statistical methods involved in machine learning with
an emphasis on how these tools can be used to conduct behavioral phenotyping. This research will be conducted
at the University of Utah and supported by a multidisciplinary mentorship team with collaborative experience but
distinct expertise. Dr. Duff (primary mentor) is an expert in the neuropsychological assessment of MCI and AD.
Dr. Foster (co-mentor) is an expert in the diagnosis and treatment of AD. Dr. Minoshima (co-mentor) is
internationally known for his discovery of early signs of AD and dissemination of diagnostic statistical mapping
technology. Dr. Phillips (co-mentor) has expertise in machine learning and advanced statistics. Dr. Zielinski’s
(co-mentor) expertise are in multimodal MRI analysis and longitudinal study design. Complimenting this team is
a dedicated team of consultants with expertise in AD diagnosis and treatment, advanced statistical modeling,
and advanced fMRI data analysis. Successful completion of this award will provide the applicant with the
background and training necessary to pursue an R01 application to investigate longitudinal brain function in
aging populations. The proposed research makes significant contributions to the field as it has the potential to
provide novel insights in the cognitive neural mechanisms underlying AD, which will aid in the implementation of
targeted intervention and prevention efforts."
10843857,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common childhood brain tumor arising from the cerebellum. Many factors
influence the proliferation, differentiation, and migration of cerebellar granular neuronal precursor (GNP). Among
them, MDM2 is a major nexus between tumor suppressor TP53 and hedgehog (Hh) signaling in GNPs and
promotes MB tumor growth and metastasis. In addition, PI3K and BRD4 signaling also play key roles in MB cell
growth, cancer stem cell (CSC) proliferation, and tumorigenesis. Further, MB treatment is challenging due to the
development of chemoresistance, inefficient drug transport across the blood brain barrier (BBB) and drug
induced neurotoxicity. Hh inhibitors are effective initially to treat SHH-MB, but their repeated use develops
chemoresistance due to mutations in smoothened (SMO) but can be overcome by modulating GLI, which is
downstream of SMO. In our preliminary studies, we synthesized a series of potent BRD4/PI3K dual inhibitors
by modifying structure of parent compound SF2523. One of the compounds 8-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin-
6-yl)-2-morpholino-4H-chromen-4one (abbreviated as MDP5) was found highly potent. We then determined X-
ray crystal structures of the recombinant BD1 and BD2 domains from BRD2 in complex with MDP5. While MDP5
showed higher potency in DOAY cells compared to SF2523 (12.6 µM), IC50 values for MDP5 and SF2523 were
similar potency on HD-MB03 MB (MYC amplified) cells. MDP5 decreased the target downstream proteins like
p-AKT, MYCN, Cyclin D1, and increased the degradation of MYCN protein indicated by p-MYCN (ser 54). We
also discovered a small molecule JW-475A which is a potent dual MDM2 and XIAP inhibitor. MDP5 and JW-
475A (a dual MDM2 and XIAP inhibitor) effectively inhibited the proliferation of MB cells in a dose dependent
manner, with significantly higher cell killing when these drugs were used in combination. Treatment of MB cells
with the combination of these two drugs significantly decreased the colony formation capacity compared to
individual drugs. We prepared PEG-DSPE based lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) with 4.9±0.1% and 4.8±0.1% loading
for MDP5 and JW-475A. BBB penetrating targeted LNPs were prepared by surface decorating with rabies virus
glycoprotein (RVG) peptide-peptide. Our hypothesis is that inhibition of BRD4/PI3K and MDM2/XIAP
simultaneously using MDP5 and JW-475A represents a promising strategy to inhibit MB tumor in vivo. Further,
we will use RVG-PEG-DSPE LNPs to encapsulate MDP5 and JW-475A, which have poor drug transport across
the BBB. Our specific aims are to i) Synthesize novel MDP5 derivatives as dual function BRD4/PI3K inhibitors
and characterize in vitro activity; ii) Evaluate anti-cancer efficacy of JW-475A in combination with MDP5 in vitro.;
iii) Formulate MDP5 and JW-475A into LNPs decorated with RVG peptide and determine their biodistribution,
therapeutic efficacy, and systemic/organ toxicity in in SHH and MYC driven cells and PDX-based orthotopic and
transgenic SmoA1 MB mouse models. Long-term significance. Successful completion of this project will
provide a platform technology for treating brain tumors using this innovative LNP-based combination therapy."
10843956,"Project Summary – Iodine Catalyzed Cross-Coupling Reactions
The proposed research aims to discover and develop economical, environmentally- and user-friendly iodine
catalyzed cross-coupling reactions for the synthesis of key chemical bonds (carbon-nitrogen and carbon-
carbon bonds), functional groups (amides, imides and ketones) and frameworks (nitrogen-containing
heterocycles such as pyrrole). Despite the great interest and efforts devoted in cross-coupling reactions,
examples of iodine catalyzed cross-coupling still remain scarce compared to the number of protocols mediated
by transition metal catalysts. The proposal is grounded in our preliminary results that acyl radical species are
readily generated from aldehyde substrates in the presence of an iodine/potassium persulfate catalyst system,
which participate in coupling reactions with a variety of chemical compounds containing nitrogen nucleophiles.
Upon the completion of the proposed work, three specific aims will be accomplished: 1) a facile iodine
catalyzed carbon-nitrogen bond formation protocol for the preparation of amides and imides will be developed;
2) an iodine catalyzed carbon-carbon bond formation reaction via radical addition mechanism will be
developed; 3) a carbon-carbon bond formation reaction via an iodine and first-row late transition metal co-
catalyzed cross-coupling mechanism will be developed. The new methods are expected to serve the critical
needs of synthetic and medicinal chemists in preparation of the corresponding chemical bonds and
frameworks for novel therapeutics. A thorough investigation of the proposed iodine catalysis mechanism will be
conducted, which is expected to yield a comprehensive understanding of the proposed iodine catalysis and
serve as a template for future study in the field. In addition, the proposal will improve and strengthen the
infrastructure of research and education at Queens College. It will not only provide research opportunities to
the many underrepresented minority students among the Queens College undergraduates, but also will help
nurture the young generation of scientists who are interested in pursuing a research career in the STEM
disciplines.

As previous NNLM All of Us pilot program awardees, the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Iowa
bring a unique understanding of the complexity of the program, quality and experienced personnel, and
existing professional relationships with NNLM, the All of Us Ecosystem, public libraries, and community
organizations. Together, these two institutions will create a dynamic and collaborative research environment,
provide high-quality innovative program deliverables, and implement innovative workflows, mechanisms, and
initiatives to grow the NNLM All of Us Program. The NAPC will continue to build on the work of the NNLM All of
Us pilot by using data-informed methods and tools to identify new opportunities to reach diverse communities
and organizations with little previous engagement. We will increase capacity, programming, and engagement
opportunities around health, digital, and research literacy. We will continue to assess and support the training
and education needs of the All of Us consortium and advance the science of engagement, community-based
participatory research, and human-centered design through training, publications, presentations, and other
modes of dissemination so that others can incorporate NAPC best practices into their training and community
engagement programs.
The NAPC has three overarching aims to accomplish the goals of the NNLM All of Us Program:
1. Increase All of Us learning options for a wide variety of audiences in cooperation with community partners,
 NNLM, the All of Us Consortium Training Board, and the All of Us Ecosystem.
2. Raise awareness of and interest in All of Us.
3. Build capacity to improve the public’s knowledge, resources, and skills to make informed decisions about

The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on the Neurobiology of Cognition has been a flagship meeting for
this highly interdisciplinary field since its inception in 2010. The 2024 convocation will be the seventh meeting
in the series. The conference will be preceded by the Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on the Neurobiology of
Cognition topic, geared toward graduate students and postdoc attendees. The conference brings together
leading experts with early-career scientists and trainees for a weeklong experience characterized by both
cutting-edge research presentations and relaxed interactions. The subtitle, and therefore focus of the 2024
Neurobiology of Cognition GRC is “Exploring the Mechanisms of Cognition: Insights from Neuroscience and
Computation”. Broad topics to be covered include attention, memory, decision-making, perception, and action.
Introduced to the itinerary this year are three new sessions: one topic devoted to the impact of emotion on
cognition, another focused on social communication among primates, and a third on computational models of
cognition. In addition, GRC speakers are encouraged to present and emphasize cutting-edge laboratory
techniques. Twenty-eight invited speakers will join approximately 120 trainees for the weeklong conference.
The GRC format fosters camaraderie by assuming all attendees will participate for the entire week, and invited
speakers will remain for the entire conference, with exemptions reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The 9 GRC
sessions begin with the first session Sunday evening, and two per day Monday – Thursday, with daily meals
held together and free time in the afternoon, so there is ample time for recreational activities and informal
scientific discourse. The structure of this meeting helps to break down career rank barriers, and this can be
particularly beneficial for female trainees and trainees from under-represented backgrounds. The organizers of
the GRC and GRS will make extensive efforts to select speakers who represent a diversity of perspectives.

Around 18,000 Americans suffer new spinal cord injuries (SCI) each year. Primary and secondary damages
caused by SCI permanently impair sensory and motor functions, which require long-term therapeutic,
rehabilitative, and psychological interventions. Thus, developing therapies to treat or reverse SCI is a pressing
need in regenerative medicine. In contrast to mammals, teleost fish naturally regenerate functional neural tissue
and reverse paralysis after complete spinal cord transection. Although innate spinal cord repair in zebrafish has
fascinated scientists for decades, the contribution of glial cells to this elevated regenerative capacity is vastly
understudied. Following SCI, adult zebrafish initiate a glial bridge that reconnects the severed spinal cord and
supports functional neural repair. Pro-regenerative glial bridging distinguishes the zebrafish spinal cord and
occurs without the detrimental outcomes of reactive gliosis elicited by the mammalian spinal cord. We propose
that zebrafish glia orchestrate a series of transient, pro-regenerative responses that enable spinal cord repair. In
this proposal, we will 1) determine the early injury responses that initiate glial bridging, 2) identify glial bridging
mechanisms that are specific to zebrafish bridging glia and absent in mammalian glia, and 3) uncover the cellular
and molecular mechanisms that direct glial bridge disassembly after regeneration is complete. This study will
provide a mechanistic understanding of glial cell biology during zebrafish spinal cord regeneration, and will guide
approaches for manipulating glial cells to promote spinal cord repair in mammals."
10828746,"G-RISE at Ponce Health Sciences University (PHSU G-RISE): The overall goals of the PHSU
G-RISE program are to increase the competitiveness of underrepresented Hispanic students
graduating from the Biomedical Sciences PhD Program at PHSU in Puerto Rico and to increase
the number of highly qualified underrepresented students who advance to postdoctoral positions
and diverse research-related careers. To achieve these goals, we will build upon the very
successful training program created under the previous R25-RISE funding mechanism which had
a positive impact on the training of our PhD students and on the entire PHSU community. Under
the prior R25-RISE Program the PhD completion rate increased from 73% to 90% of R25-RISE
trainees, the average time to graduation decreased from 6.2 to 5.6 years, and 64% of R25-RISE
trainees continued with postdoctoral training after graduating. Of the 56 R25-RISE trainees
supported 21 obtained independent fellowships, 31 already graduated with a PhD and 8 have
secured faculty positions. The proposed PHSU G-RISE application will build upon those
successes and adapt to several important lessons learned. It will provide the organizational
structure and extensive mentoring necessary to ensure trainees have a sense of belonging and
scientific identity while empowering them to prepare for and overcome obstacles in their scientific
careers. The program proposes to accomplish these goals through enhancement of the
academic, research, personal, and professional competence of our underrepresented minority
students to better prepare them for diverse careers in the biomedical sciences. The specific
measurable objectives of the PHSU G-RISE program are to provide: (1) professional, operational,
and technical research skills training for PHSU G-RISE trainees; (2) communication skills training
for PHSU G-RISE trainees; (3) team building/networking opportunities for PHSU G-RISE trainees;
and (4) increase the PhD completion rate while reducing time-to-degree. Each of these objectives
will be pursued with an experience-based balance of continuing activities that were highly
effective as well as a strategic set of new training components that were developed to address
the emerging needs of our trainees. The PHSU G-RISE program will work in concert with the
existing PHSU-Moffitt Cancer Center Partnership and RCMI programs to significantly impact the
overall research program by providing a better trained student workforce to conduct the funded
research projects and provide the momentum to create new research initiatives."
10830319,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY:
Urinary tract infection (UTI): i) is caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) in over 80% of
uncomplicated cases in the United States; ii) primarily affects otherwise healthy females (the lifetime
prevalence of UTI in women is 50%); iii) is associated with significant morbidity and economic impact; iv) can
become chronically recurrent (20-30% of women diagnosed with a UTI will experience a recurrent UTI (rUTI)
in the following months, with some suffering six or more per year). Over 1 million women in the US are referred
to urologists each year because of rUTIs and treatment difficulties, which are rising due to the rapid spread of
antibiotic resistance in UPEC. Further, 60% of rUTIs are due to the same strain of E. coli that caused the initial
infection, arguing that there exist host-associated reservoirs that are recalcitrant to antibiotic treatment and can
seed rUTIs. The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is an important reservoir for E. coli in humans. At the time of UTI,
the causal E. coli strain is often the predominant E. coli strain in the GIT, which can persist there even after
antibiotic therapy. The healthy GIT microbiota (the collection of microorganisms in the GIT) is a key mediator of
homeostasis with the host immune system and can prevent colonization by bacterial pathogens. Ironically,
antibiotic treatments meant to clear pathogens can also disrupt the GIT microbiota and expose individuals to
an increased risk of colonization by pathogens. This proposal seeks to transform UTI research by investigating
the unexplored gut-bladder axis. Goals include elucidating the interplay between UPEC, the GIT microbiota,
UPEC pathogenesis and rUTI susceptibility, much of which was previously not technologically feasible. High-
resolution longitudinal analyses of the GIT microbiota from rUTI patients have revealed: i) striking differential
patterns of UPEC colonization, persistence, and displacement in the GIT; and ii) differences in the GIT
microbiota structure of rUTI patients and healthy controls. Further, rUTI patients had an elevated inflammation
status, even at baseline. These data have led to the hypothesis that the altered GIT microbiota of women with
frequent rUTI may be conducive for UPEC persistence and blooming in the GIT, predisposing to the seeding of
UPEC into the bladder to cause rUTIs. We will study the impact of UPEC reservoirs in the GIT and an altered
microbiota on mucosal and systemic immunologic changes and the susceptibility and/or host response to
rUTIs. This proposal will use clinical samples from rUTI sufferers and healthy controls, newly developed
genomic and transcriptomic technologies, and conventional and humanized gnotobiotic mouse models to: Aim
1) unveil factors critical for UPEC colonization of the GIT and the establishment of a reservoir capable of
seeding rUTI; Aim 2) elucidate the effects of dysbiotic GIT microbiota found in rUTI patients on host immune
functions and UTI susceptibility; and Aim 3) determine the role of the microbiota in controlling UPEC
colonization of the GIT These studies will transform the development of antibiotic-sparing therapeutics urgently
needed to treat and prevent rUTI."

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a degenerative disease, which affects the central nervous system (CNS). While most
neurodegenerative diseases affect older populations, the onset of MS generally occurs early in life. There is no
cure for MS. Currently used drugs have severe side effects. Past attempts to develop cell therapies to treat MS
have met with limited success. The major challenges in developing cell therapies include invasive isolation
techniques, limited growth and differentiation potential, as well as genetic instability of adult mesenchymal stem
cells (MSCs). We have isolated and differentiated highly proliferative and primitive (p) MSCs into neural stem
cells (NSCs). In our preliminary studies, transplantation of NSCs significantly reversed the clinical symptoms
when transplanted at an early stage of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in a mouse model.
These findings are very promising and provide a strong “proof of concept” for cell-based treatment of MS. Since
we saw substantial improvement in EAE disease with a single cell dose, we hypothesize that multiple doses
of NSCs will be more effective in ameliorating chronic EAE disease symptoms and promoting functional
recovery. We envision that this innovative approach using NSCs will enhanced the potency of cell therapy as
proposed in this study. The specific aims are: 1. To determine the therapeutic effects of repeated doses of
NSCs on chronic EAE in mice. We hypothesize that similar to repeated use of drugs, repeated cell therapy
treatments will be more efficacious. This hypothesis will be tested by injecting GFP-labeled NSCs in 3 doses to
counter chronic EAE induced by MOG immunization in mice. Changes in the disease symptoms and progression
will be monitored by performing neurobehavioral, neurological motor function, mechanical threshold response
and cold response analyses to assess the effect of cell therapy on the disease progression and remission. 2. To
investigate CNS pathology at cellular and molecular levels in NSC transplanted EAE mice. We
hypothesized that NSC treatments will reduce inflammation and restore CNS function. Histopathological analysis
of the CNS will be performed to access immune cell infiltrates. Composition of cell infiltrates will be assessed by
immunohistochemical analysis of CNS sections. Levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines will be carried to
assess the immunomodulatory properties of transplanted NSCs. NSCs are also likely to help in mitigating the
imbalance of immune regulatory cells, reduce astrogliosis, and improve myelination. This will be investigated
using appropriate cellular and molecular techniques. NSCs also express high level of neurotrophic factors, their
role in neuroprotection will be explored. The effect of NSCs on the global gene expression in the CNS of EAE
mice will be examined by RNA-seq and validated by qRT-PCR analysis. RNA-seq analysis should help in
determining the signaling pathways involved in potential functional recovery of damaged CNS in EAE mice. The
results of this research will provide fundamental insights into EAE and also help in developing cell therapies not
only for MS but also for other neurodegenerative diseases."

Advances in molecular profiling technologies have enabled the identification of ever-increasing numbers of
disease biomarkers, each raising the potential for more precise, and possibly even patient-specific, diagnoses.
Current methods of quantifying protein biomarkers, however, are slow and laborious, often require large
quantities of biopsied tissues, and ultimately fail to provide a complete, intact quantification of functional protein
activity. To address these limitations, we have developed an innovative activity dependent proximity ligation
platform (ADPL), with the ultimate goal of obtaining multiplexed, ultrasensitive quantification of protein activity
directly in complex biological samples. In the context of cancer specimens, we hypothesize that defining a
molecular profile based on protein activity – the end result of biologic signaling – can more precisely and
accurately inform diagnoses and treatment regimes, allowing early intervention and improving clinical outcomes.
This proposal outlines the advanced development and validation of two reliable, high-resolution ADPL-based
platforms, with the power to alternately visualize and quantify dozens of active enzymes simultaneously from
tumor tissue, cells and biofluids. Our current knowledge and expertise in the use of this integrated platform will
be leveraged in the service of the following aims: 1) development of novel chemoproteomic probes for
multiplexed, family-wide activity mapping of cancer-relevant enzymes, including kinases; 2) advanced
development of on-tissue Exchange-ADPL and on-chip single-cell ADPL (scADPL) platforms for simultaneous,
high resolution visualization and quantification of a panel of active enzymes in situ; and 3) applying these
technologies to breast cancer tissues and cells to create accurate and precise activity signatures and identify
potential correlations between these signatures and clinical outcomes. To accomplish these aims we will develop
new chemical proteomic molecular probes, validate a panel of ADPL reagents for cancer-associated enzyme
biomarkers, and perform rigorous, metric-driven benchmarking analyses in cell lines and tumor tissues.
Completion of this project will validate ADPL platforms for use in diverse cancers, provide the first single-cell
activity profiles of breast tumors, and provide novel correlations between breast cancer tumor activity signatures,
disease severity and response to therapy."
10834917,"The primary goal of this proposal is to test and develop a novel application of therapeutic hypothermia for
veterans receiving cochlear implantation (CI) with an aim to preserve residual hearing and sensitive neural
structures against surgical trauma and improve hearing outcomes post-implantation. Increasing residual hearing
in veterans post-CI will likely improve their speech recognition outcomes, improve speech perception in quiet,
and overall, patient benefit and usage of these devices. An increasing number of patients, that include our
veterans, have some level of residual hearing at the time of implantation and can benefit from bimodal electro-
acoustic devices. Surviving hair cell activity and as a result a functioning organ of Corti and neural substrate has
recently been linked to speech perception outcomes. However, trauma during implantation leads to inflammation
and oxidative stress that can exacerbate residual hearing loss. Successful translation of therapeutic interventions
to limit pathophysiology of the injury have yet to be achieved. The present work aims to develop application(s)
of localized, therapeutic hypothermia for protection of hair cells and neural substrate following CI in compromised
cochleae as a result of noise and blast exposures in veterans. The specific aims are motivated by a gap in
knowledge currently of the pathophysiology of CI in compromised cochleae, its relation to poor outcomes in
veterans, and our preliminary data showing that localized, mild hypothermia delivered to the cochlea is effective
and safe therapeutic intervention for preserving residual hearing after implantation. The results from this project
can be further extended to other inner and middle ear surgeries in veterans, surgeries that also carry a risk of
residual hearing loss."

This proposal seeks to advance our understanding and treatment of coronary microvascular disease (CMD)
through the development of new imaging methods and their use investigating underlying cellular and molecular
disease mechanisms (in mouse models), and in the evaluation of pharmacological therapy (in mice and
humans). CMD is defined as impaired endothelial-independent coronary microvascular reactivity and is
assessed noninvasively by quantitative myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) imaging using rest and adenosine
PET or MRI. While increasingly recognized, the mechanisms that cause CMD are incompletely understood
and there are no established therapies. Using preclinical MRI, we have shown that mice fed a high fat high
sucrose diet (HFHSD) develop CMD, and also develop increased epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a reservoir
of lipids and inflammatory cells and mediators that shares a microcirculation with the myocardium. Our
preliminary data show the remarkable finding that iNOS-/- mice are completely protected from HFHSD-induced
CMD. As iNOS is strongly associated with M1-polarized macrophages, and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) are
key triggers of M1 macrophage polarization, we hypothesize that EAT SFAs trigger M1 macrophage
polarization, increase proinflammatory mediators and iNOS, and lead to coronary microvascular oxidative
stress and CMD. MRI is well suited to investigate this system, as MRI can quantify adenosine MPR,
myocardial oxidative stress (preclinical), and adipose tissue volume and fatty acid composition. The latter
method (MRI of fatty acid composition) has yet to be applied to EAT or accelerated for efficient use in a cardiac
MRI protocol. Lastly, SGLT2 inhibitors, known to have beneficial clinical effects on cardiovascular disease,
have shown promise in a preclinical study of CMD; however, the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on CMD and other
parameters and the mechanisms of action remain unknown in both mice and human patients. In our project,
specific aim 1 is to develop and validate accelerated fatty acid composition (FAC) MRI of epicardial adipose
tissue. Specific aim 2 is to use genetically-modified mice to test the hypotheses that (a) an anti-inflammatory
fatty acid composition reduces CMD and (b) iNOS expressed by macrophages plays a central role in CMD due
to HFHSD. And, specific aim 3 is to test the hypothesis, in mice and humans, that SGLT2 inhibition reduces
CMD, and to link the mechanism to EAT and iNOS. The successful completion of these aims will (a) develop
broadly applicable MRI methods for FAC imaging of EAT, (b) use imaging to advance our understanding of the
cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying CMD, and (c) demonstrate the efficacy and mechanisms of
SGLT2 inhibition for the treatment of CMD."
10835891,"Project Summary Abstract
 There is a critical lack of information regarding how radiology residents develop interpretive skills for
screening mammography. Consequently, little is known how to avert or correct errors in perception and
cognition. The majority of radiology residents have only the required minimum 12 weeks of breast imaging
training. Yet, the majority of mammograms in the United States are interpreted by general radiologists, not
board-certified breast imagers. The negative impact on patient care by not filling this gap in education is
continued missed cancers and unnecessary additional imaging and biopsies. The long-term goal of this project
is to reduce interpretive errors in breast imaging for improved patient outcomes by providing objective tools
and resources to improve trainee education.
 The overall objectives of this proposal are to understand cognitive and perceptual skill development in a
specialized simulation system by bringing together experts in radiology, computer science, educational
psychology, and psychology. In residency there is no opportunity for residents to interpret mammographic
studies independently from attending radiologists. Thus, offering no opportunity to ‘practice’ their skills. Our
education system needs improvement. This project will implement a specialized simulation system with
sequential evaluation of radiology resident performance in screening mammography providing objective
measures and feedback to trainees. The central hypothesis of this project is that a systemized simulation
screening mammography system within residency training will aid in identifying critical cognitive and perceptual
errors that negatively impact patient care and outcomes. This hypothesis will be tested by three specific aims:
1) Use machine learning tools to develop congruent case sets for consecutive simulation sessions. 2) Assess
the impact of sequential simulation training and examine predictors of individual differences in learning
trajectories, by a) assess interpretive skills of radiology residents and fellows in the breast screening simulation
system, b) assess real-time perception skills with eye tracking in simulation sessions, and c) assess the
resident’s fundamental cognitive and perceptual abilities as well as personality traits. 3) Assess and quantify
the effects of sequential simulation training.
 This research proposal is innovative, in that it provides sequential opportunities for radiology residents
to independently interpret screening mammograms in a specialized simulation system that will obtain
information about the development of interpretive and perceptive skills over time during real-world practice.
This research proposal is significant because simulation training is effective at taking high-risk stakes skills and
putting them in a low risk encounters to assess and improve performance. Improving the preparation of
radiology residents to interpret screening mammograms will have far reaching impact on women’s health and
overall public health."

 Although the cardiac ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation has a wide adoption rate, it also has a high
recurrence of arrhythmia primarily due to the creation of suboptimal lesions. The procedure is also associated
with complications including cardiac perforation, tamponade, atrio-esophageal fistulas and thrombus. Repeated
and prolonged X-ray exposure for the clinician can also lead to enhanced risk of cancer. A fluoroless approach
using intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is becoming a more widely adopted imaging option due to the
absence of ionizing radiation and the possibility of real-time monitoring of the created lesions. However, the ICE-
guided approach suffers from significant shortcomings, which include poor dexterity of the ICE catheter, difficulty
in simultaneously manipulating the ICE and ablation catheters, unintuitive image orientation and noisy image
quality. There is therefore an unmet need to overcome these shortcomings of the ICE-guided approach to enable
better lesion creation and reduced complications associated with the cardiac ablation procedure. The long-term
goal of this research is to develop robotic technologies, control and machine learning algorithms to enable ICE-
guided cardiac ablation procedures. The objective is to develop a novel robotic manipulator, a steerable ICE
catheter, and machine learning and control algorithms to manipulate the ICE catheter and monitor the created
lesions in real-time. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that the robot-assisted steerable ICE
catheter with the catheter tracking algorithms will enable simultaneous manipulation of the ICE and ablation
catheters. Further, the machine learning algorithms to monitor therapy will reduce the risk of complications, while
ensuring the creation of necrotic lesions, thereby reducing the recurrence of AF. In this proposal, we plan to
pursue the following specific aims: 1) Design, develop, and model a steerable 3D ICE catheter with enhanced
dexterity. 2) Design and develop a robotic manipulator and associated control algorithms to allow for precise
manipulation of the ICE catheter. 3) Develop machine-learning and vision-based algorithms integrated with a
navigation system for tracking the ablation catheter, and monitoring therapy. 4) Validate the robotic ICE system
in heart phantom and porcine models. The proposed research is significant since it will allow for better therapeutic
outcomes by reducing recurrence rates and complications associated with cardiac ablation, and avoiding
exposure of the patient and clinical care team to X-ray radiation. The proposed research is innovative in that it
builds on state-of-the-art robotics technology, machine learning and vision algorithms to enable fluoroless ICE-
guided cardiac ablation procedures."
10835984,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this project is to identify epigenetic pathways underlying the effects of social
connectedness on aging-related morbidity and mortality. We propose to examine the potential
pathogenic and protective consequences of individuals’ habitual patterns of interaction with
members of their egocentric, or personal, social networks (i.e., their social signatures). Meta-
analyses have identified beneficial effects of social connectedness on all-cause mortality that are
robust and larger in magnitude than the adverse effects associated with smoking, alcohol
consumption, sedentary lifestyle, and obesity. However, the biological processes underlying
these patterns have received insufficient empirical study relative to behavioral mechanisms, and
little attention has focused on longer-term physiological or pathogenic mechanisms. To address
these gaps, we examine the implications of social signatures for DNA methylation (DNAm), a
biomarker of accelerated biological aging and an early predictor of later-life onset of diabetes,
cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, dementia, and other complex diseases. We leverage a
large, omnibus health survey, the Person to Person (P2P) Health Interview Study (N≈3,050),
administered face-to-face to a stratified household probability sample. As part of this effort, DNA
was extracted from saliva samples (n≈2,600) for future analysis. We address the following specific
aims: Aim 1 examines associations between social signatures and DNA methylation-based
profiles, including epigenetic age acceleration and polyepigenetic scores. Aim 2 assesses
whether social signatures attenuate documented associations between early life, mid-life, and
chronic exposures to stressful conditions and DNA methylation-based profiles. Aim 3 explores
associations between social signatures and targeted DNA methylation sites documented to affect
risk for obesity, inflammation, Alzheimer’s disease, and other specific complex diseases
associated with aging. The proposed study is interdisciplinary, combines leading-edge methods
from the social and biomedical sciences, and leverages considerable existing data and research
infrastructure. By increasing our understanding of the specific biological pathways underlying the
effects of social connectedness that unfold over the life course, this study could help identify novel
targets for earlier social or biological intervention in aging-related complex diseases."
10835988,"The drug development process and FDA-approved prescribing generally assume that patients are
sufficiently stable and similar enough to justify population-based dosing for a given group that is usually
unchanged during therapy. Unfortunately, there is a huge body of evidence that dosing according to this
“one size fits all” paradigm results in wide variation in plasma drug concentrations between individuals
and even within the same individual over time, all of which can compromise clinical outcomes. Population
pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) models can control for this variability by providing
clinicians with tools to adjust doses accordingly, a process that has come to be known as Model-Informed
Precision Dosing (MIPD). However, MIPD has been better able to control for inter-individual variation
rather than interoccasion variation (IOV) within an individual over time. MIPD methods exist to track IOV
in the past, but not to account for possible future IOV. In this project we will address IOV in three novel
approaches. Our first aim uses our unique Virtual Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (VPICU) dataset with >400
clinical variables obtained from ~20,000 unstable, critically ill children in our hospital since 2009. We will
build recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to predict changes in renal function within individuals, which is
relevant to the control of renally excreted drugs. While models exist to predict renal failure, this will be
the first application of RNNs to predict creatinine clearance in children. There are >100,000 serum
creatinine measurements to validate this work. Our second aim is to account for changing PK-PD in
models that cannot be linked to a specific covariate like renal function. To do this, will incorporate
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to capture changes in model parameters over time. Unique to our
work, we will apply SDEs in the setting of our long history of non-parametric PK-PD modeling, which
makes no assumptions about underlying probability distributions for parameter values in a model and is
particularly good at describing and controlling unusual patients, perfect for a critically ill population. We
will use >40,000 vancomycin doses and >5,000 plasma concentrations in VPICU to test our algorithms. Our
third aim is two-fold. First, we will again use RNNs to predict outcomes of VPICU patients with
Staphylococcal bloodstream infections treated with vancomycin. We will compare RNNs that include
vancomycin exposure estimated with IOV and without IOV. The second part is to use our in vitro hollow
fiber infection model (HFIM) to directly assess the effect of vancomycin IOV on both methicillin-resistant
and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus in our laboratory. The HFIM can reproduce pediatric
PK to measure antibacterial kill and emergence of less susceptible or persister organisms over days to
weeks. Our inclusion of IOV in the HFIM is completely novel. We will deliver software tools to clinicians
to control IOV and understand the magnitude relevant to outcomes of anti-Staphylococcal therapy."
10835992,"Project Summary
DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are a particularly toxic form of DNA damage. Even a single DSB can lead to
cell death. Our cells use a number of intricate repair pathways to repair DSBs. For the majority of breaks that
occur in our cells a pathway known as non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is used to effectively “glue” the
broken strands back together. Alternatively, a strand at each DNA end is “chewed back” in a process known as
resection which generates single-stranded DNA overhangs. Multiple pathways act on these overhangs
including homologous recombination (HR) and microhomology mediated end joining (MMEJ). HR is an intricate
mechanism which uses a sister chromatid to direct repair in a high-fidelity manner while MMEJ is a mutagenic
pathway whose mechanism more closely resembles NHEJ. Proper selection of these repair pathways is critical
for human health as misuse is correlated with gross chromosomal changes that can result in cancer. Often
cancer cells are deficient in DNA repair pathways which allows them to rapidly acquire traits not normally
associated with healthy cells. These repair deficiencies also make them vulnerable to targeted cancer
therapies.
 This proposal seeks to develop a better molecular understanding of how cells choose between these
different DSB repair pathways. Experiments in cells have identified a number of proteins that play a role in this
molecular decision-making process, but we lack an understanding of how these proteins work together.
Traditionally, such knowledge is gained by purifying individual proteins and combining them together to
reconstitute a biological process. However, given the sheer number of proteins, it is currently untenable to take
such an approach. We have recently validated a cell-free extract made from the eggs of the frog Xenopus
laevis as system that recapitulates DSB pathway choice. Combining this physiological biochemical system with
powerful imaging approaches to study the dynamics of DNA DSB repair proteins at the single-molecule level,
we will elucidate the molecular basis of DSB repair pathway choice. Specifically, we will work to clarify how the
NHEJ factor Ku, which antagonizes DNA end resection, is removed from DNA ends (Aim 1); and how the
MMEJ polymerase Pol θ competes with long-range resection on partially resected overhangs (Aim 2). Finally,
we will elucidate how the multi-functional Pol θ uses its diverse enzymatic activities to synapse DNA ends and
search for microhomology (Aim 3). Our studies will reveal significant new insights into DSB repair pathway
selection and regulation. These insights may enable novel ways to alter the balance between these repair
pathways which could have applications in gene editing or in therapies for cancers deficient in DSB repair."

in old mice and humans remains unclear. Therefore, there is a need to develop a standardized
microbial flora that has a manageable size and resembles natural microbiome that when
administered to old, frail individuals will rebalance their intestinal homeostasis. The goal of this
proposal is to test if this new oligoclonal collection of mouse intestinal commensals (oligo-MM),
designed by system and genome-based approaches to recapitulate complete microbiome can
help revitalize an aging immune system. In particular, we will investigate how oligo-MM microbiota
and its main component Akkermasia municiphila interacts with Cd4 T cells and discover immune
epitopes that these cells recognize from this bacteria. In Aim 1 we will investigate how specific
intestinal commensals influence activation and repertoire of CD4 T cells in old mice. In our Aim 2
we will demonstrate that A. municiphila derived antigens induce naïve CD4Foxp3- T cells
conversion to CD4Foxp3+ pTregs and substantially increase the number of these cells in old mice.
We hypothesize that the therapeutic administration of A. municiphila to old mice can improve
tolerance to intestinal microbiota and reduce immunosenescence. Overall this research will help
develop new strategies based on strictly controlled microbiota-based therapies to control intestinal
inflammation in elderly."
10836351,"Background: Antimicrobial stewardship guidelines call for a multidisciplinary team with an infectious disease
(ID) physician and ID-trained clinical pharmacist as core members. Unfortunately, there are insufficient ID-
trained specialists to staff on-site antimicrobial stewardship programs throughout VA.
Significance: This proposal is highly significant for Veterans and the goals of VA. Veterans experience many
of the risk factors associated with development of antimicrobial resistant and healthcare-associated infections.
The unprecedented effects of the novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the health of our Veterans
and on our entire healthcare system makes the demand for ID expertise even more apparent, especially in
long-term care. Also, this study directly addresses the VA MISSION ACT to improve access to care,
timeliness and quality of care, using telehealth services. Finally, this project is aligned with the priorities of
our operation partners: VA Antimicrobial Stewardship Taskforce (ASTF), the VA National Infectious Disease
Service (NIDS), VA Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) Services, and the Office of Rural Health.
Innovation and Impact: The design is innovative because we will systematically test and assess
implementation barriers to telehealth for antimicrobial stewardship, a novel approach that has not been
implemented in VA facilities, other than in our previous pilot study. Further, the Antibiotic Use Reports (AURs)
are an innovative adaptation of peer-comparison, an antibiotic stewardship strategy successful in outpatient
settings. This project will provide findings for a scalable model that could be deployed nationally to all
applicable VAMCs, continuing the role of VHA as a leader in implementing large-scale interventions focused
on prevention and management of ID and stewardship.
Specific Aims: Our goal is to implement a multidisciplinary videoconference antimicrobial stewardship team
(VAST) in VAMCs using SCAN-ECHO. Our central hypothesis is that feedback reports that quantify facility-
level antibiotic use will enhance the efficacy of VASTs to support antimicrobial stewardship. We propose a
Type 2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation design, comparing clinical effectiveness in sites that implement the
VAST alone (VAST-) to sites that implement the VAST augmented by facility-level Antibiotic Use Reports
(VAST+). Aims are: 1) Identify and test effective strategies for implementing the VAST; 2) Determine the
influence of the VAST overall and VAST+ on the care of Veterans with suspected infections; 3) Determine the
influence of the VAST overall and VAST+ on antibiotic use at each VAMC.
Methodology: We will randomize rural VAMCs that do not have ID-trained professionals on staff to implement
the VAST alone (VAST-) versus VAST + antibiotic use feedback (VAST+). Aim 1: We will assess modification
and adaptations at the intervention sites and by the infectious disease experts. Methods will include process
maps and semi-structured interviews to gather qualitative data about what key VAST members perceive as
facilitators, barriers and burden to VAST implementation. We will also evaluate costs of implementation. Aim 2:
We will evaluate the Veteran population served, clinical activities, and user perceptions of the VAST. We will
assess the concordance of clinical care with recommendations from evidence-based clinical practice
guidelines. VAST members’ perceptions of the quality and timeliness of care will be evaluated. Aim 3: The
primary outcome measure will be overall rates of antibiotic use. Secondary outcomes will be changes in the
rates of broad-spectrum antibiotic use, antibiotic starts, and length of antibiotic therapy.
Next steps/Implementation: Testing effective implementation of the VAST at additional VAMCs is an
important step toward augmenting antimicrobial stewardship in both acute- and long-term care settings. In
collaboration with VA clinical operation partners, outcomes from this trial will be used to roll-out an
implementation playbook to be used by other VAMCs, as well as non-VA settings."
10836356,"Despite recent progress in the development of molecularly-targeted therapy and immunotherapy, lung cancer is
still the leading cause of cancer death since such therapies are not applicable for more than half of lung cancer
patients. Lung adenocarcinoma is the major pathological type of lung cancer. Lung adenocarcinoma has been
further subdivided based on both genetic alterations (e.g., KRAS or EGFR mutations and ALK fusions) and
differentiation state (including histopathologic subtypes such as acinar, lepidic, papillary, solid and mucinous).
In most cases, such genetic alterations do not strictly correlate with the histopathologic subtypes of lung
adenocarcinomas. However, genetic and molecular pathways that lead to the development of invasive mucinous
adenocarcinoma of the lung (IMA) have been revealed by our team and others in the past several years (e.g.,
HNF4A pathway), suggesting that such molecular pathways can be targeted to treat IMA for which there is
currently no effective therapy. Notably, the histology of IMA resembles that of mucus-producing cancers found
in the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., pancreatic cancer), which hampers efforts to properly diagnose IMA from lung
metastases originating from other mucus-producing organs. A biomarker to distinguish IMA from lung
metastases has not been established. Our long-term goal is to identify a therapy for IMA. The objective here is
to 1) determine whether HNF4A and its downstream genes that are specifically expressed in IMA but not in
normal lung can be therapeutic targets for IMA and 2) comprehensively identify therapeutic targets and
biomarkers using novel technologies such as single-cell mRNA-seq and 3D tumoroid (organoid) culture with a
large number of IMA specimens (>200). The central hypothesis is that IMA is driven by distinct molecular
pathways that can be therapeutically targeted. The rationale is based on our previous and preliminary studies
indicating that 1) the HNF4A pathway is required for the growth of IMA and 2) such a pathway creates a specific
tumor microenvironment that influences tumor-associated cells, which presents specific therapeutic targets and
biomarkers. This hypothesis will be tested in the following specific aims: 1) determine whether HNF4A and/or
its downstream genes can be therapeutic targets for IMA, 2) analyze the heterogeneity of IMA at a single-cell
level, and 3) discover diagnostic biomarkers for IMA. The approach is innovative because it will focus on
molecular pathways that have not been explored as therapeutic targets for IMA. The proposed research will: 1)
utilize model mice for IMA (GEMM and PDX) and human specimens of IMA and lung metastases and 2)
determine whether small molecular inhibitors and therapeutic antibodies can reduce the growth of IMA. The
proposed research is significant because our team, comprised of a number of IMA researchers from several
institutes, will bring their knowledge and expertise together to develop a novel therapy for IMA."

10830444,"Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) remains a major public health problem with poorly understood 
etiology and pathophysiology. Impairment in reward processing and anhedonia are core features of 
MDD. Findings during the prior award period have shown that MDD and anhedonic phenotypes are 
characterized by functional, structural and molecular abnormalities within a CorticoStriatal 
Valuation Circuit critically implicated in value encoding and reinforcement learning. The main goal 
of the this R37 renewal is to expand this line of work in several fundamental new directions to (1) 
attain a better mechanistic understanding of MDD and anhedonia by focusing on a novel target - 
Nociceptin/Orphanin FQ Receptors - expected to yield molecular abnormalities associated with 
CorticoStriatal Valuation Circuit and stress- induced inflammatory abnormalities (Aims 1 and 2); 
and (2) identify abnormalities that map disease course (Aim 3). This will be achieved through an 
innovative integration of (1) molecular imaging techniques with a novel positron emission 
tomography (PET) NOP tracer ([11C]NOP1A) in unmedicated individuals with current or past MDD, (2) 
state-of-the-art analyses of stress-related pro-inflammatory transcription control pathways, (3) 
behavioral and functional neuroimaging markers of key depressive phenotypes, and (4) a naturalistic 
follow-up design. To differentiate between state- and trait-like markers of vulnerability, 
currently depressed individuals (MDD), remitted individuals with a history of MDD (rMDD), and 
never-depressed healthy controls will be included. Based on findings from the prior project period, 
we hypothesize that, relative to healthy controls, MDD and rMDD participants will show 
significantly higher [11C]NOP1A binding potential in brain regions critically implicated in stress 
regulation and reward processing (Hypotheses 1).
Moreover, among individuals with current or past MDD, N/OFQ abnormalities in brain regions 
implicated in stress regulation and reward processing will be associated with (1) behavioral and 
neural markers of anhedonic phenotypes; (2) lower ability to regulate stress responses; and (3) 
higher stress-related proinflammatory cytokines and transcription control pathways (Hypotheses 2). 
Finally, we expect that N/OFQ abnormalities (and associated behavioral, fMRI, hormonal, and 
inflammatory markers) will predict anhedonic symptoms and poorer general functioning at follow-up 
(Hypothesis 3). Collectively, the proposed research promises to improve our mechanistic 
understanding of stress-induced anhedonia and the pathophysiology of MDD, as well as our ability to 
identify mechanisms that prospectively predict reward deficit-related symptoms, thus opening novel 
avenues for improved treatment and prevention."
10928217,"Project Summary/Abstract
Background: Substance use disorders (SUDs), which can involve illicit drugs, prescription drugs, or alcohol,
are common and result in substantial morbidity and mortality. Unhealthy alcohol and substance use are among
the leading causes of preventable deaths in the US, are increasing, and are among the top causes of the
shortening life expectancy in the US. Screening for unhealthy substance use is recommended by the US
Preventive Services Task Force and other national groups because it can lead to improved health outcomes,
yet most primary care practices do not have a system to screen for and manage SUDs.
Objectives: (1) to determine if practice facilitation (PF) can achieve rapid implementation of patient-centered
outcomes research findings to improve screening for and management of SUDs in primary care and (2) to
compare whether learning collaboratives (LC), performance incentives (PI), or their combination can
significantly improve the implementation of screening for and management of SUDs in primary care compared
with PF alone.
Methods: The STop UNhealthy Substance Use Now trial (STUN II) is a multisite 2x2 randomized comparative
effectiveness trial that will enroll 48 primary care practices. STUN II will evaluate the comparative effectiveness
of the following strategies for the implementation of screening and evidence-based interventions for SUDs in
primary care: PF, PF plus LC, PF plus PI, and PF+LC+PI. Assessments will be conducted throughout a 12-
month intervention period and at a 12-month post-intervention follow up, to assess sustainment. In addition, a
mixed methods evaluation will assess the association between implementation effectiveness and putative
moderators (e.g., organizational readiness for change) and mediators (e.g., implementation climate).
Potential Impact: The study will produce fundamentally important evidence about the comparative
effectiveness of PF, PF plus LC, PF plus PI, and PF+LC+PI on uptake of evidence-based screening and
interventions for SUD when delivered to primary care practices. It will also generate scientific knowledge about
how contextual factors influence the effectiveness of the various approaches in promoting clinical practice and
office systems changes in primary care settings. The results will inform health systems, policymakers, and
primary care practices about optimal strategies for implementation of screening for and management of SUDs
in primary care."

that PAE and prenatal cannabinoids engender similar fetal developmental outcomes. Moreover,
recently published data shows developmental synergy between sub-teratogenic doses of

own preliminary data we plan to address two questions: Firstly, “is SAC more damaging to fetal
development than either alcohol or cannabinoids alone?”; Secondly, and importantly, “will
cannabinoid antagonists protect against effects of PAE & SAC?”. Our studies will focus on the
effects of SAC on neurogenesis and vasculogenesis, the complementary growth of vasculature
that supports fetal brain growth.
We plan to use in vivo and ex vivo mouse PAE models in combination with molecular assays and

10830295,"Abstract:
The long-term goal of this application is to characterize host-virus interaction interface as a novel drug target and
to develop inhibitors to disrupt intracellular protein-protein interactions (PPI) between the host and the virus to
curb HIV-1 replication. It has been established that perturbing IN without affecting its enzymatic activity can
inhibit late stages of HIV-1 replication such as assembly, particle production and/or particle morphogenesis.
Such class II IN mutations and allosteric inhibitors of IN (ALLINI), inhibit late events and they do so by perturbing
IN/IN multimerization, IN/host factor interaction or IN/RNA interactions. We have observed that such defects in
particle morphogenesis can also be observed in IN mutants defective for interaction with a host factor,
INI1/hSNF5, an IN-binding host factor, that is selectively incorporated into HIV-1 virions. INI1 is required for HIV-
1 late events. Expression of a minimal-IN-binding domain of INI1 (INI1183-292) termed S6, disrupts IN/INI1
interaction in vivo and potently inhibits HIV-1 particle production. Knocking down INI1 and use of INI1-/- cell lines
inhibit HIV-1 particle production. INI1-binding defective IN mutants lead to the production of morphologically
defective particles indicating that targeting IN/INI1 interaction is an effective strategy to inhibit HIV-1 particle
production. Lack of structure of INI1 and IN/INI1 complex have precluded our ability to develop inhibitors to target
this interaction. New research from our laboratory including the NMR structure of the IN-binding Repeat 1 (Rpt1)
domain of INI1, and molecular docking of IN/INI1 interaction have helped overcome this knowledge gap.
 We found that IN-binding domain of INI1, termed Rpt1, and Trans Activating Response element (TAR)
of HIV-1 genomic RNA structurally mimic each other, a novel finding. Both Rpt1 and TAR bind to same surface
of IN C-terminal domain (CTD) and compete for binding to IN with an identical IC50 value (0.005 µM).
Furthermore, INI1-interaction-defective mutants of IN cause impairment of particle morphogenesis. We
hypothesize that peptidomimetics and small molecules derived from Rpt1 have dual activity and inhibit both
IN/INI1 and IN/TAR interactions. As a proof of principle, we have developed a stapled peptide derived from
interface a-1 helix of Rpt1, that potently disrupts IN/INI1 and IN/RNA interactions, inhibits particle morphogenesis
and in vivo HIV-1 replication. In this proposal, we will characterize IN/INI1 interface as an outstanding drug target
by carrying out: i) Genetic analysis to understand the mechanism of INI1 influence on assembly/particle
production via trans-complementation and “synthethic rescue” experiments; ii) Development of a novel class of
stapled peptides and small molecules with dual activity in targeting IN/INI1 and IN/RNA interactions by SAR and
virtual-ligand screening; and determine the NMR structure of INI1-stapled peptide complexes with IN-C-terminal
domain; and iii) Understanding the mechanism by which INI1-derived stapled peptides and small molecules
inhibit HIV-1 replication and target identification by screening for viral escape mutants. These studies will
establish IN/INI1 as a novel drug target and provide new lead compounds to inhibit HIV-1 late events."
10839967,"Project Summary
General anesthetics may act as neurotoxins in the developing mammalian nervous system and cause long-term
neurobehavioral changes after exposure in infancy. Repeated exposure is particularly deleterious to the
developing nervous system, and children who undergo more than one general anesthesia before the age of 4
are at an increased risk for substantial emotional and cognitive changes. It is therefore critical that preventative
treatments be found. Studies in animal models have suggested that persistent anesthetic-induced changes such
as neurotoxicity, gliotoxicity, loss of synapses and changes in mitochondrial structure may lead to long-term
behavioral impairments. Early effects of anesthesia on mitochondria may be key to long-term impairments:
protection of mitochondria from oxidative stress caused by free radical generation from general anesthetics
eliminates subsequent cognitive impairment in adulthood in rodents. We have established a nonhuman primate
model of early anesthetic exposure. In a previous award, we showed that infant rhesus monkeys that received
multiple exposures of to the inhalation anesthetic sevoflurane, commonly used in pediatric anesthesia, showed
long-term changes in socioemotional and cognitive development when tested later in development. In this new
proposal, we will use that model to test the hypothesis that neonatal anesthesia exposure is associated with
long-term changes in synaptic and mitochondrial structure in the primate brain, and that protection of
mitochondria from oxidative stress at the time of anesthesia exposure mitigates or prevents subsequent changes
in cognitive and socioemotional development. Specifically, in Aim 1 of this project, mitochondrial and synaptic
structure in adulthood will be examined at the electron microscopic level in tissue prepared and banked from
those subjects from the previous award. For Aim 2, infant rhesus macaques will be exposed to sevoflurane (3
exposures in the six weeks of life) in the presence of R(+)pramipexole, a mitochondrial protectant, or treated
with vehicle and will be followed behaviorally for 2 years to assess sparing of neurobehavioral changes in the
treated group. We will determine whether R(+)pramipexole treatment also protects against synaptic and
mitochondrial changes in these monkeys. Together, results from these studies can provide a causal link between
anesthetic exposure, mitochondrial dysfunction, and altered emotional and cognitive behavior in monkeys. They
will also provide a first step towards improved anesthetic protocols and preventative treatments that will allow
children to undergo safe surgery while minimizing unintended long-term effects on the brain and behavior."
10839968,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Post-translational modification by ubiquitin is an essential mechanism to alter protein function in
eukaryotes. Ubiquitin, a 76 amino acid protein, is attached to specific proteins via a cascade of ubiquitin
activating enzyme E1, conjugating enzyme E2, and ubiquitin ligase E3. Ubiquitination plays an essential
role in a broad aspect of cellular processes, including transcription, DNA repair, signal transduction,
autophagy, cell cycle, immune response, and membrane trafficking. Aberration in the ubiquitination
system leads to a number of human diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases and cancers. Within
the ubiquitination cascade, E3s primarily dictate the specificity of the ubiquitination system and thus are
often the focal points of research and attractive therapeutic targets. The Nedd4 family E3s are an essential
family of HECT-type E3s, members of which contain an N-terminal C2 domain followed by 2-4 WW
domains and the C-terminal HECT domain. Nedd4 E3s recognize substrates carrying a “PPxY” motif
through their WW domains. However, most substrates lack such a motif but engage with the ligase through
“PPxY” motif-containing adaptors. We recently discovered that in yeast, the ubiquitin E3 ligase adaptor
protein Art1 is primed with di-ubiquitination and the attachment of the di-Ub chain to a specific lysine
residue in Art1 is warranted for its full activity. In this proposal, we plan to investigate the physiological
function of adaptor di-ubiquitination and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the modular
ubiquitination platform form with Nedd4 E3 ligase and di-ubiquitinated adaptors. Specifically, we will
pursue the following aims: Aim 1: To investigate the mechanism of Nedd4 E3 adaptor di-ubiquitination.
Aim 2: To determine the role of di-ubiquitinated adaptor-E3 complexes in substrate ubiquitination. Aim 3:
To elucidate the molecular architecture of di-ubiquitinated adaptors with the Nedd4 E3 ligases. Uncovering
the physiological role of Need4 E3 adaptors di-ubiquitination will be of critical importance to understand
the molecular basis of how E3 adaptors specifically recognize substrate proteins and efficiently present
the substrates for ubiquitination by HECT E3 ligases. We expect the successful implementation of this
proposal will not only make significant contributions to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms
underlying the Nedd4 E3 ligase/adaptor mediated ubiquitination, but also shed light on the mechanism of
protein quality control governed by targeted ubiquitination."
10839969,"Brain chronic inflammation is a hallmark of the aging process, and promotes the progression of many brain
diseases. Compelling evidence shows that healthy edible plants have important physiological roles for normal
brain function and can prevent neuroinflammatory processes. However, mechanistic studies in the brain have
primarily focused on single or individual factors from edible plants, which most likely do not represent the results
generated from multiple factors that are provided in a healthy diet consumed daily.
Recently, a tiny nanoparticle called an exosome-like nanoparticle (ELN) has been isolated from a number of
edible plants. ELNs consists of lipids, proteins, and RNAs. We have demonstrated that ELNs, like prebiotics,
are taken up by intestinal bacteria, resulting in inhibition of mouse colitis. However, whether these edible plant-
derived nanoparticles have a direct effect on the brain is not clear.
In this study, we will provide cellular and molecular insight into how ELNs modulate neuroimmune function via a
gut-brain axis by targeting microglial cells that benefits the brain. Indispensable to this proposal is the use of a
mouse aging model to investigate mechanistic details that will facilitate developing ELNs as a potential new class
of prebiotic to target specific components involved in brain inflammation. Based on these findings it is tempting
to speculate that the clinical profile of at least some brain anti-inflammation therapeutics can be improved by
interventions relying on one or more edible plant-derived ELNs. This finding urgently awaits experimental
confirmation, which is what we proposed to investigate in this proposal. From a clinical application standpoint
and as proof-of-concept, in this study, our hypothesis is that multiple factors carried by garlic ELNs (GaELN)
target to microglial cells simultaneously to inhibit brain inflammation in aged mice. This will be tested in
a mouse aging model that mimics human aging process. The plan to test our hypothesis is outlined in three
specific aims. Our proposed studies will determine: (1) Determine and evaluate if garlic ELN (GaELN)
phosphatidic acid (PA) stimulated BASP1 domain(s) that binds to calmodulin (CaM) prevents c-MYC mediated
brain inflammation in aged mice; (2) Evaluate whether GaELN nc-sRNA21 contributes to inhibition of brain
inflammation by enhancing the transporting of c-MYC-nick into exosomes in a Rab11a dependent manner; and
(3) Evaluate whether GaELN induces a switch to secretion of CYLD+exosomes with immune tolerant cargos.
Upon accomplishing this proposed study, the study will lead to identification of new therapeutic targets and
potential ELN based interventions for treating brain inflammation. In addition, findings will provide a foundation
to further study whether oral administration of customized ELNs isolated from different plants will have a
synergistic/additive effect on prevention or treatment of chronic inflammatory brain related diseases. Therefore,
this study is a highly translational study aimed at finding new therapeutic targets for brain inflammation."

Cognitive effort is subjectively costly. It can cause people to discount valuable goals and avoid thoughtful planning and careful deliberation. Effort avoidance can thus be problematic, especially in disorders like depression and schizophrenia where excessive cost sensitivity undermines cognitive motivation. To address cost sensitivity, we first need to understand what the brain treats as costly. Traditional indices, like lateral frontal functional magnetic resonance imaging signals, and parietal alpha desynchronization in electroencephalography data, track cognitive load to a point, but often plateau or decline, even when subjective effort continues to rise. This project will examine a promising candidate mechanism underlying the experience of subjective cognitive effort: divergence from criticality. Criticality characterizes cortical dynamics at rest, and prior studies have shown that brains become increasingly sub-critical under the very conditions known to increase subjective effort: increasing working memory load, fatigue, sleep deprivation, novelty, and cognitive aging. In the Applicant’s K99 training phase, they found that brain dynamics diverge from a critical point, the harder that tasks become. Most importantly, however, people whos’ brains diverge the most from that critical point experience tasks as more subjectively effortful than people whos’ brains more closely approximate criticality. It is hypothesized that proximity to a critical point depends on the balance of cortical excitatory versus inhibitory signaling. Consistent with this hypothesis, the Applicant also found that artificially perturbing cortical excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation also pushes brains farther away from a critical point and increases subjective effort on a subsequent cognitive task. The direction of the effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation was surprising, however, opening doors to new hypotheses about the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation on brain function from the perspective of critical dynamics. This project will test the hypothesis that the cortical excitatory inhibitory balance regulates how closely to a critical state the brain operates, and thereby how sensitive people are to effort costs. In so doing, the project will also re-examine the effects of common transcranial magnetic stimulation protocols on cortical excitability with respect to critical, sub-critical, and super-critical dynamics. Thus, Aim 1 will combine electroencephalography and transcranial magnetic stimulation to test hypothesized mechanisms which may underlie cognitive effort, working memory, and cognitive motivation and also re-assess longstanding assumptions about the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation on cortical plasticity."
10839816,"Abstract - Our laboratories have focused on understanding how the EGF receptor (EGFR) and its signaling
partner, the GTP-binding/protein crosslinking enzyme tranglutaminase-2 (TGase-2), contribute to
aggressive cancers, and discovered that TGase-2 enhances EGFR signaling by blocking its degradation by
c-Cbl. The goals of CA201402 were then to examine whether TGase-2 provides a similar protective effect
for the EGFR oncogenic variant, EGFRvIII, in glioma stem cells (GSCs), and if these proteins are important
for the actions of their extracellular vesicles (EVs). Our efforts have resulted in a number of new discoveries,
which form the basis of this renewal application. These include the finding that TGase-2 function is coupled
to its ability to adopt two distinct conformational states, a GTP-bound closed state that protects EGFRs from
Cbl-catalyzed degradation, and a protein crosslinking-competent open-state that binds to large EVs, called
microvesicles (MVs), and is necessary for their ability to influence the tumor microenvironment and stimulate
angiogenesis. However, when TGase-2 is induced to adopt an open state within cancer cells, it causes cell
death. Although we found that EGFRvIII does not require TGase-2 to protect it from Cbl-catalyzed
ubiquitylation, we discovered EGFRvIII expression is coupled to glutamine metabolism which is elevated in
aggressive cancer cells. Moreover, we found aggressive cancer cells generate large numbers of small EVs
(exosomes) that contain the immune checkpoint ligand, PD-L1, and the cell survival protein Survivin, due to
their elevated glutamine metabolism and their down-regulation of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), an NAD+-dependent
deacetylase. We will now set out to understand the consequences of these discoveries for the growth and
survival of GSCs, through the efforts of two laboratories with complimentary expertise in cancer cell signaling
(Cerione) and translational studies of GSCs (Nakano), as follows: 1) Determine how to exploit the open-
state conformation of TGase-2 to inhibit cancer cell viability. We will establish how open-state TGase-2
causes cancer cells to undergo cell death and develop methods to stabilize that state as a potential
therapeutic strategy. 2) Understand how EGFRvIII expression in aggressive GSCs is coupled to glutamine
metabolism. We will determine why inhibiting glutamine metabolism markedly affects the cellular levels of
EGFRvIII expression, and whether EGFRvIII expression and signaling stimulate the production of MVs
containing this oncogenic variant and TGase-2. 3) Understand the connection between the expression of
EGFRvIII and TGase-2 in aggressive GSCs and the shedding of large numbers of exosomes with unique
protein cargo. We will establish whether down-regulation of SIRT1 in GSCs, and signaling pathways
involving EGFRvIII and/or TGase-2, are responsible for their ability to produce large numbers of exosomes
enriched in PD-L1 and Survivin. These studies will provide new insights into the development of aggressive
cancers such as high-grade gliomas as well as highlight novel therapeutic targets for aggressive disease."

10839941,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Growing evidence links transposable/repetitive element (RE) transcripts with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but
the underlying mechanisms and disease relevance are unclear. In this project, we will test the hypothesis that
the mechanism linking RE with AD is an age-dependent, global RE transcript increase that causes age/AD-
related neuroinflammation. Our rationale is that: 1) aging is the key risk factor for AD; 2) RE transcripts derived
from structural/retroviral sequences in the genome accumulate progressively with aging; 3) RE transcripts are
prone to form double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and/or complementary DNA (cDNA), both of which can cause
neuroinflammation (a major driver of brain aging/AD that precedes pathology); 4) aging and AD are also
linked with impairments in epigenetic control (e.g., hypo-methylation, which could facilitate RE transcription)
and quality control systems like autophagy that degrade RE transcripts (which could potentiate RE-derived
cDNA/dsRNA accumulation). Emerging data even suggest that RE-derived dsRNAs/cDNAs could spread via
extracellular vesicles (EVs), a potential non-cell-autonomous explanation for the pathology observed in AD.
These observations suggest a model that is highly consistent with the age-dependence of AD, in which global,
age-related RE transcript increases lead to RE-derived dsRNAs/cDNAs that drive neuroinflammation and AD.
In support of this idea, our preliminary data show that RE transcripts are hypomethylated in AD patients and
correlate with neuroinflammation prior to pathology, and that inhibiting RE transcript buildup in human
astrocytes/neurons may reduce inflammation. We also find evidence of RE in circulating EVs from AD patients.
Based on these observations, we propose to (Aim 1) determine if age- rather than pathology-related RE
transcript dysregulation links RE with AD by performing a large bioinformatics analysis of existing RNA-seq
data, probing for RE in human/AD brains, and profiling global methylation (whole-genome bisulfite sequencing)
in the same brains, as well as in samples from >100 subjects from a longitudinal study on brain aging,
neuroinflammation and AD. In parallel (Aim 2), we will use patient-derived astrocytes and neurons to test the
efficacy of clinically translatable treatments (e.g., methylation/autophagy activators) that reduce RE-derived
dsRNAs and cDNAs for inhibiting age/AD-related neuroinflammation, and we will identify RE that may cause
neuroinflammation by binding to cellular dsRNA and cDNA sensors (PKR and cGAS). Finally (Aim 3), we will
determine if RE transcripts induce aged/AD-like neuroinflammation and accumulate in EVs in young astrocytes
and neurons, and whether these EV-borne RE transcripts cause inflammation/toxicity in other cells. We also
will use existing samples (as described above) to determine if RE in EVs are related to markers of systemic
inflammation, neuroinflammation and AD in humans. These studies are specifically designed to extend on our
ongoing, NIA-funded pilot projects, generate multi-omics data on RE in aging/AD, and to provide a platform for
future diagnostics or therapeutics in this context."

Prenatal alcohol exposure continues to present a serious and global public health problem. It is estimated that
2-5% of live births in the U.S. are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, and the consequences on the
exposed child include a range of physical, neuropathological, and behavioral effects referred to as fetal alcohol
spectrum disorders (FASD). This application requests funding for partial support of the 2020-2024 Fetal
Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Study Group (FASDSG) meetings, which are held annually as a satellite
conference preceding the Research Society on Alcoholism (RSA) meeting. The goal of the meeting is to move
the field forward and, ultimately, to identify ways to better recognize, prevent and treat FASD. The FASDSG is
the premier scientific organization in the U.S. that focuses on FASD and the annual meeting provides a unique
opportunity for a broad range of researchers, including basic, medical, clinical, and social scientists, to meet
and discuss how we can achieve these goals. Thus, the FASDSG meeting creates interdisciplinary integration
among basic science, human, clinical, and epidemiological FASD-related research efforts and progress.
Participants of the meeting provide updates on new research, discuss and debate issues in the field, and
interact and form scientific collaborations. Partial support from NIH has been critical for supporting high quality
speakers who are leaders in their field, including areas outside of alcohol research, to present at the FASDSG
meeting. Outside expertise stimulates novel ideas and approaches that may be applicable to FASD research.
This support has also been essential to grow the cadre of young scientists entering the alcohol field, by
providing travel awards for the brightest and most promising students and junior investigators. Stimulating
interest among new investigators is key to maintaining progress in the field. Specifically, this application
requests continued funding for travel and registration fees for young investigators (students and postdoctoral
fellows), as well as meeting-related expenses, such as fees for invited plenary speakers. Additionally, this
application requests support for the FASDSG website, which provides a mode of communication both within
the FASDSG and with the public. Overall, the FASDSG meeting fosters progress in the FASD research field by
providing a critical venue for communication and collaboration among FASD researchers."
10845639,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mental disorders are among the leading causes of disability and morbidity worldwide—conditions that are
compounded by a vast treatment gap where an estimated 70% of people who need mental health care go without
adequate or any treatment at all. In Brazil, despite having a comprehensive network of publicly-funded, free,
community-based mental health treatment, it is estimated that only 26% of people with psychiatric conditions
successfully connect to community-based care. The remaining seek treatment only under emergency or crisis
conditions, contributing to overcrowding in emergency departments, long waiting periods for psychiatric beds,
psychiatric boarding, poorer overall quality of care, and an overreliance on a hospital system that is already
overburdened (and increasingly so due to COVID-19). This problem has increasingly and disproportionately
affected people with a serious mental illness (SMI) who are poor and non-white. Goals of recovery and rebuilding
a meaningful life in the community become overshadowed by those of stabilization and symptom management.
Contributing factors to this mental health treatment gap are plenty (i.e., stigma and discrimination, workforce
shortages, economic disparities, lack of timely follow-up and engagement, discontinuous and fragmented
linkages between care settings), yet solutions are scarce. The proposed project uses a participatory research
and adaptation design that involves stakeholders, including persons living with SMI, family members, clinicians,
community services staff and administrators, throughout all stages of project development and implementation.
We hypothesize that the successful adaptation and implementation of an evidence-based model of peer support
to Brazilian culture, will contribute to enhanced levels of engagement, improved continuity of care, and
improvements in quality of life and wellbeing among persons living with SMI in Brazil. To this end, we propose
the following specific aims: 1) To work with local stakeholders in Campinas, Brazil on the cultural adaptation of
an evidence-based peer intervention targeting connections with a peer as a mediator of engagement in post-
acute mental and physical healthcare; 2) To employ an experimental therapeutics approach in determining the
degree to which multi-level targets are engaged in the pathway improved outcomes through a pilot clinical trial;
3) To assess the feasibility, acceptability, safety, tolerability, and potential for dissemination of the adapted peer
intervention at multiple levels. After this study, we will have established the feasibility, acceptability, safety and
tolerability, of adapting a low-cost, culturally-responsive, evidence-based intervention to improve quality of care
of people with SMI who access community mental health treatment. Moreover, through a Yale-University of
Campinas partnership, we will foster international collaboration as a strategy to develop an innovative technology
that would be ready for an implementation and effectiveness trial (R01) in poor communities in Latin countries.
Finally, the adaptation strategy developed in this proposal can be used in other LMICs to adapt EBPs."
10845640,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Social connectedness is critical for promoting healthy aging, including delaying the onset
of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Developing and maintaining social relationships relies on
social cognitive function – the process by which people understand, store, and apply
information about others. However, healthy aging and AD are associated with declines in
social cognitive function. Identifying the mechanisms underlying this decline is essential
for ultimately improving the clinical course of AD. Neuroscience is uniquely suited to
identify these mechanisms because the brain regions underlying social behavior have
been well-characterized. However, the limited work in this domain has fallen short in
elucidating how brain activation relates to older adults’ social cognitive deficits. One
reason for this might be its reliance on relatively narrow measures of brain activation and
impoverished stimuli, which neglect the dynamic nature of brain function and of social
interactions. The current proposal addresses these gaps by applying cutting-edge
methods from the field of network neuroscience to social cognitive aging to examine how
age-related changes in brain networks – collections of brain regions that communicate
disproportionately more with each other – affect social cognitive function. Using this
novel social network neuroscience framework will ultimately transform our understanding
of the mechanisms by which healthy aging and AD disrupt social cognitive function. In
Aim 1, we compare traditional approaches of focusing on activation in specific brain
regions to a brain networks approach in order to determine which better relates to social
cognitive deficits (e.g., theory of mind; the ability to infer others’ mental states). Aim 2
explores whether older adults’ less stable brain networks predict their theory of mind
deficits. An exploratory goal of this aim is to determine whether dynamic (more
naturalistic) stimuli provide greater insight into age-related social cognitive deficits than
traditional, static stimuli. Finally, Aim 3 challenges current assumptions that older adults’
social cognitive deficits are limited to how their brains engage during tasks. Specifically,
we examine whether older adults’ baseline brain network structure (during resting state)
predicts their subsequent task performance, and extend this question to an AD sample.
The proposed study combines cutting-edge network neuroscience methods with social
cognitive aging to advance our understanding of healthy aging and AD. Ultimately, this
project will help identify novel targets for intervention to slow the progression of AD."

Functional rhodopsin (Rho) composed of apoprotein opsin and covalently bound 11-cis-retinal chromophore is
required for normal phototransduction and vision. Inherited mutations compromise proper folding, binding of
11-cis-retinal, and stability of Rho, leading to retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a progressive degenerative eye
disease that causes blindness. Currently, there are no treatment options available to combat RP. Retinal-
based pharmacological chaperones and non-retinal small molecules, including flavonoids, can stabilize certain
Rho mutants in vitro. However, effective and safe therapy for RP has yet to be established. Dietary flavonoids
have been reported to show beneficial effects in ocular impairments. Our preliminary studies showed that
common flavonoid quercetin could stabilize pathogenic Rho, improve its folding, membrane integration, and
retinal binding. We also found that quercetin inhibits stress-induced cellular responses related to pathogenic
mutants triggering Bax-mediated apoptosis with beneficial consequences to retinal health.
Here we propose to study, the therapeutic potential of quercetin and its combinations with retinal analogs, and
novel small molecule Bax inhibitor to rescue RP pathology. First, we will evaluate quercetin positive effects on
RP mutants independently of the genetic background in vitro. Then, we will assess their ability to revert the RP
phenotype in vivo in mouse models of RP. To understand the underlying molecular mechanism of Rho
mutant’s stabilization offered by quercetin we will perform structural studies to delineate the architecture of
quercetin-Rho complexes by applying crystallographic and hybrid mass-spectrometry techniques. In addition,
we will search for more effective compounds stabilizing Rho mutants by high-throughput screening of
flavonoid-related compound libraries, which then will be validated with systematic biochemical and biophysical
analyses (Aim 1). Second, we will examine the role of quercetin as an adjuvant for the specific retinal analogs
stably accommodating the retinal-binding pocket. Some of these retinals improve the folding of the P23H
pathogenic Rho mutant. We will examine the potential corrective effect of new locked retinal and backbone-
modified retinal analogs for P23H Rho and determine if the binding of these retinals could be enhanced by
quercetin to gain a greater therapeutic effect in RP (Aim 2). Third, we will study the cellular processes in RP.
To gain a better understanding of RP pathology we will look for molecular targets activated by cellular stress
signals in RP and assess if quercetin can modulate these cellular processes to revert the disease phenotype
(Aim 3). At first, we will examine the effect of quercetin on Bax-mediated apoptosis to learn if its effect is
related to direct or indirect inhibition of Bax, or both. In these studies, we will also use a novel bioavailable
small molecule Bax inhibitor. We will determine the effectiveness of this new Bax inhibitor and its combination
with quercetin against Rho-related RP. Altogether, the knowledge gained from this study will pave the way to
design an effective therapeutic remedy to prevent or slow down RP pathology."

plays a key role. This proposal targets restoration of retinal function using engineered MSC-EVs containing
function-specific miRNA. Compared to MSCs, their EVs are non-immunogenic, non-tumorigenic, and modifiable
for specific delivery modes. These characteristics render them ideal biomimetic agents fitting precision-based
medicine. Our studies indicate that EVs can rescue retinal cells that have been acutely subjected to hypoxia or
ischemia, the key mechanism that starts cells dying in CRAO. We also found that hypoxic preconditioning of
MSCs resulted in EVs (H-EVs) with enhanced cytoprotective properties including anti-apoptosis and anti-inflam-
mation. A number of miRNAs overexpressed in the H-EVs have cytoprotective properties in retinal cells.
 Our central hypothesis is that targeted EV-specific expression of miR-424/other key miRNAs in MSC-EVs
will re-capitulate the anti-apoptosis and anti-inflammatory actions of H-EVs. We designate such EVs as Func-

miRNA and its role in anti-inflammatory actions of MSC-EVs in retina; and (3) Can MSC-EVs be enhanced for

424 (FEE-424) and 146b (FEE-146b). We will evaluate the mechanisms of action of the FEEs, and their candi-
dacy for generation of FEEs in retinal ganglion cells, microglia, Muller cells, and retinal vascular endothelial cells
using loss and gain of function studies in models of simulated ischemia in vitro. These results will serve as a
proof-of-principle model for development of FEEs for amelioration of cell damage in the retina. In Aim 2, FEEs
containing miR-424 and -146b will be used to test specific targeting of anti-apoptotic and inflammatory mecha-
nisms in a rodent model of CRAO. Overall, the proposed studies are expected to provide transformative results
whereby MSC-EVs are modified and delivered for retinal protective action after the ischemic event to treat CRAO.
 Innovations are cell-free therapy of retinal diseases, EV miR-mediated application-specificity, and direct
determination of the impact of EVs on specific cells involved in retinal ischemic injury. Translational significance
is the high likelihood of impacting novel molecular therapy. Underlying basic research significance is that the
studies will enable vertical advancement of the field by determining mechanisms of actions of EVs in the retina."

RESIDENTS APPROACHING END OF LIFE
The candidate’s long-term career objective is to make a sustained impact as a geriatric palliative care research
leader by mentoring promising, multidisciplinary investigators in aging research. The candidate’s professional
life has been dedicated to the conduct of patient-oriented research in geriatric pharmacoepidemiology for
nursing home and hospice patients, focusing specifically on the topic of deprescribing. Establishing the
evidence for the risks and benefits of prescribing and deprescribing decisions, and identifying which patients
will receive the greatest benefit from deprescribing based on a shift from curative to symptom-oriented care, is
challenging. Institutionalized frail older adults are a particularly vulnerable population because of their high
burden of polypharmacy, risk of medication-related adverse events, limited life expectancy, and lack of
randomized controlled trial data for medication efficacy. Training a multidisciplinary group of junior investigators
is key to building the deprescribing evidence base. Studies are needed that can ultimately inform the design of
tools that identify when nursing home residents are entering the final stages of their life and the development of
interventions to optimize medication use when that happens. Thus, the objectives of this K24 are: 1. To
enhance the candidate’s capacity to effectively mentor a multidisciplinary group of mentees in patient-oriented
research, and 2. To expand the candidate’s clinical research program in geriatric palliative care and
deprescribing in directions that create new and innovative opportunities for mentees, including qualitative
methods for mixed-methods studies. This will be accomplished by: i. recruitment of promising mentees from
varied disciplines committed to aging research, ii. individual mentorship of these trainees in their research
activities and career development, and iii. didactic sessions and formal coursework for mentees. The
candidate’s research brings together expertise in geriatrics and aging research, palliative medicine and
hospice care, and pharmacoepidemiology. The candidate’s research program about nursing home residents
and hospice enrollees grows out funding from the National Institutes of Health, the Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality, the American Cancer Society and the Donoghue Foundation. These studies have
contributed to the creation of rich data resources that will be used by mentees, including a nationwide dataset
of all nursing home residents from 2011-2016 that links the Minimum Data Set 3.0 to Medicare Part D data,
Certification and Survey Provider Enhanced Reporting data, Area Resource Files and Medicare Hospice
Utilization Public Use Files. Resources supporting training, development, and execution of the proposed

The treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI) by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is
the defining success amongst therapeutics aimed to manipulate the microbiome with cure rates typically
exceeding 80% of recipients. This success has facilitated numerous clinical trials yielding important insights
that have advanced clinical care including the quantification of the durable stability of frozen fecal slurries that
enabled stool biobanks, the studies of fecal slurry administration that compared efficacies across
administration routes of oral, colonoscopic, and nasogastric, and the application of FMT in other conditions
including ulcerative colitis where it appears to have modest efficacy. However, the use of complex fecal slurries
as a therapy is a challenge due to our inability to completely determine the safety of a product that varies with
each FMT donor, including some that have transmitted opportunistic pathogens that led to serious adverse
events. The scaling of FMT is also a challenge, as the drug material is sourced from individual human
donations that are finite in supply and labor intensive to process into the final product. We propose to
administer live biotherapeutic products (LBP) as an alternative to FMT. We have isolated the strains for this
LBP from known-successful FMT donors allowing us to compare (Aim 1) the clinical response and (Aim 2) the
microbial engraftment of the FMT with that of the LBP. The LBP was specifically designed to contain prevalent
human gut microbes that have engrafted in a majority of recipients and that are not associated with severe
adverse events in prior FMT studies. The results from this pilot and feasibility clinical trial (60 subjects, N=30
FMT and N=30 LBP) will provide important safety data, clinical insights, and basic science results to advance
the potential of LBPs as novel therapeutics."

will leverage and expand upon a unique panel database consisting of five rounds of survey and qualitative data
collected from rural women between 2006 and 2018 as part of the project Men's Migrations and Women's

qualitative data collection three years apart. The new data will focus on material, instrumental, and socio-
emotional support exchanges between panel participants and their children, relatives, in-laws, and non-
relatives and on panel participants' life satisfaction, happiness, self-efficacy, depression, anxiety, and related
psychosocial outcomes. The analyses of the dynamics of social interactions and exchanges and of their

existing panel data on participants' marital and reproductive trajectories, experience of husband's labor
migration, history of co-residence with children and investment in their health and education, as well as
changes in women's physical health and economic conditions, to elicit longer-term processes that shape the

The proposed studies will examine mechanisms by which morbidity and mortality are greater in older burn
patients. Regardless of age, most burn patients do not die from primary injuries but rather from complications,
such as pneumonia and multiple organ failure (MOF). Clinical and experimental evidence reveal that healthy
aged subjects are in an elevated basal inflammatory state, referred to as “inflamm-aging,” which can slow the
immune system's response to invading pathogens. We and others believe that inflamm-aging is caused by
translocation of bacterial products from the intestinal lumen and that continuous exposure to these products
triggers the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6. In addition, shifts in
the intestinal microbiota in the aged can promote systemic inflammation and these shifts are much more
dramatic after burns. Novel preliminary data in our clinically-relevant mouse model of burn injury confirm that
aged burn-injured mice have heightened circulating levels of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), a
greater breach in intestinal epithelial barrier integrity, and more dramatic dysbiosis of the fecal microbiome
relative to their young counterparts. Moreover, we know from our recent work on burn patients that advanced
age upregulates pro-inflammatory mediators in the lungs and blood, which parallels our mouse studies. From
these observations, we hypothesize that, relative to young, older subjects who sustain a burn injury have
greater 1) breach in the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier and 2) shift in the intestinal microbiome,
leading to excessive systemic inflammation and damage to critical organs, like the lung. To test the concept of
the post-burn “gut-lung axis,” in Aim 1, we will examine intestinal barrier integrity in burn-injured young and
aged mice over time using blood-borne and fecal biomarkers of intestinal damage and determine if restoring
the intestinal barrier reduces inflammation and improves function of distant organs, including the lung. In Aim
2, we will examine levels of a subset of gut and lung antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), determine the extent of
fecal microbiome dysbiosis, and investigate whether modulating AMP levels restores normal intestinal and
pulmonary parameters in young and aged burned mice. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will study burn patients
longitudinally to determine if the superimposed impact of burn injury with advanced age alters intestinal barrier
integrity and fecal microbiota to a greater extent than seen in younger subjects with equivalent size burns.
Moreover, we will see if there is a relationship between intestinal dysregulation and systemic/pulmonary
inflammation by assessing blood-borne and fecal biomarkers of intestinal damage and microbial dysbiosis and
determine if these biomarkers can be used to predict acute hypoxic respiratory failure and poor immune
response following pulmonary infections. These studies will expand our understanding of how advanced age
alters the gut in the context of burn injury and its systemic implications. Our work may also lead to the
development of novel therapies for the treatment of patients with burns and other forms of trauma."

Title: Targeting androgen receptor nuclear localization in prostate cancer
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and second leading cause of cancer death in
American men. More effective therapies for PCa are urgently needed. The androgen receptor (AR) is a key
therapeutic target for PCa. AR appears to be overexpressed, stabilized, and nuclear-localized in castration-
resistant PCa (CRPC). AR nuclear localization is necessary for its function as a transcription factor. We have
developed a high-throughput screen and identified two closely related pyrroloimidazoles, CPPI and EPPI,
which can inhibit AR nuclear localization in CRPC. These small molecules inhibited all tested AR-positive
prostate cancer cells, including enzalutamide-resistant CRPC. Further studies suggested that these small
molecules can directly bind to AR and enhance AR ubiquitination and degradation in the nucleus, acting as
nuclear AR degraders (NARDs). Since CRPC is associated with increased AR level and stability, inhibition or
even partial inhibition of AR level may slow down the progression to CRPC. Here, we hypothesize that NARD
can inhibit CRPC and prostate cancer progression to castration resistance. Also, NARD may enhance the
efficacy of other AR targeting agents because resistance to AR targeting agents is also associated with
increased AR expression. To explore the therapeutic potential of NARD, 3 specific aims are proposed. Aim 1
will determine the mechanisms by which CPPI inhibits AR nuclear localization in CRPC cells. Aim 2 will
evaluate potential synergies of CPPI with other AR-targeting approaches. Aim 3 will synthesize and
characterize novel analogues of CPPI with the goal to identify new lead NARD compounds with submicromolar
potency and high specificity for AR-positive PCa cells. Success of the proposed project may lead a strategy to
slow down the progression of prostate cancer to castration resistance and to an alternative approach to
PROTAC AR degraders, which are being actively investigated as a therapeutic agent for AR-positive CRPC.
Since the mechanisms of NARD action are different from PROTAC-type AR degraders, NARD may be more
suitable than PROTAC AR degraders in certain patient populations."

key roles in both hemostasis and thrombosis. Not only do platelets adhere and aggregate to form thrombi at
the site of vascular injury, platelets also facilitate coagulation (formation of a fibrin clot). Both platelet thrombus
formation and coagulation are important contributors to the morbidity and mortality of thrombotic diseases such
as heart attack and stroke. Thus, anti-platelet drugs and anti-coagulants were developed and are clinically
used to prevent and treat thrombosis. However, current anti-platelet drugs and anti-coagulants have
deficiencies. First, anti-platelet drugs and anti-coagulants all have the major adverse effect of bleeding, which
can be life-threatening. Furthermore, anti-platelet drugs are not as effective in treating coagulation, and vice
versa, but combined use of anti-platelets and anti-coagulants greatly exacerbates bleeding risk. Thus, it would
be highly significant to develop dual anti-platelet and anti-coagulant drugs, which do not cause bleeding.
Furthermore, thrombosis can be induced by chronic and acute inflammatory conditions such as atherosclerosis
and sepsis. Conversely, thrombosis induces and exacerbates inflammation. Thus, it is also highly desirable to
develop a drug that is more potent than aspirin in anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory efficacy. The Integrin
family of adhesion receptors plays key roles in both in platelets and leukocytes. Platelet integrin aIIbb3 (GPIIb-
IIIa), upon activation by inside-out signaling stimulated by agonists, not only mediates platelet adhesion and
thrombus formation, but also transmits outside-in signals leading to thrombus expansion and occlusive
thrombosis, but is dispensable for primary hemostasis. Leukocyte b2 integrins, aLb2 and amb2, mediate
leukocyte adhesion and outside-in signaling, leading to cell migration, cytokine release, phagocytosis, etc., and
thus play critical roles in inflammation. We recently showed that outside-in signaling of integrins requires the
binding of G protein subunit Ga13 to an ExE motif conserved in the cytoplasmic domains of both b2 and b3.
Project 1 of this proposal is to investigate the mechanisms of Ga13-dependent integrin outside-in signaling.

The broad goal of this work is to understand how molecular cues orchestrate and interact with the physical
forces to drive vertebrate morphogenesis. Specifically, we focus on looping of the small intestine, a process
essential for packing of the lengthy intestine within the abdomen, that when defective leads to devastating
congenital disorders. Loops arise due to buckling of the intestinal tube as it elongates against the constraint of
its attached mesentery. The resulting loop wavelength and curvature can be predicted from a handful of
experimentally measured physical properties, comprising tissue geometry, growth rate, and stiffness. Buckling
has emerged as a core mechanism of shaping various tissues and organs in the embryo. However, the elegant
simplicity of buckling mechanics often betrays the biological complexity that engenders and constrains this
physical process. Indeed, an understanding of buckling morphogenesis that integrates physics with the
underlying molecular cues and dynamic cell behaviors is lacking in most contexts. We recently identified BMP
signaling as a key pathway controlling gut looping. With this pathway in hand, the present application exploits a
well-developed understanding of the associated mechanics to study the molecular and cell biological control of
buckling morphogenesis, as well as how forces generated during development feed back to modulate these
controls. We begin by asking how BMP-dependent acto-myosin activity in the mesentery contributes to tissue
mechanics through manipulation of extracellular matrix organization (Aim 1), focusing on the ability of this
tissue to accommodate large strains (>100%) before stiffening; this behavior, known as constitutive
nonlinearity, is a critical determinant of looping morphology, but its biological basis and morphological function
are often overlooked in development. Next, we build upon the striking observation that BMP establishes
differential growth by restricting mesentery elongation in a proliferation-independent manner (Aim 2), testing
the hypothesis that BMP regulates cell size to set up differential growth, driving buckling. Therefore, Aims 1
and 2 focus on BMP-dependent mechanisms of elastic energy storage within the mesentery. This energy
storage must be precisely balanced with energy dissipation to generate stereotyped looping. To address this,
we examine the control of proliferative growth of the mesentery (Aim 3), focusing on the Hippo signaling
pathway and how forces generated by differential growth may feedback on proliferation. These cross-
disciplinary studies combine retroviral gene misexpression, analyses of cell behavior, force and stiffness
measurements, tensile bioreactor studies, and mathematical modeling. The long term vision is to establish
mechano-molecular rules or design principles of embryogenesis, enabling a true engineering approach to
regenerative medicine, wherein stiffness, stress, and strain can be biologically programmed alongside cell type
specification to instruct the assembly of functional three dimensional tissues and organs."

Kidney disease is the 9th leading cause of death in the U.S. Because few therapies exist to prevent or slow
progression, over 700,000 patients have End Stage Renal Disease. These patients are treated with dialysis or
renal transplant, the latter resulting in markedly superior survival. However, kidney donors are limited and there
is an important unmet need for strategies that enhance renal repair or generate new nephrons for renal
replacement. Pluripotent stem cell derived organoids display key features of differentiated kidney tubules and
glomerular structures in vitro, and we have shown that they generate patterned nephrons in vivo displaying
kidney functions such as filtration and glucose uptake by the proximal tubule. To develop this technology for
renal replacement, stem cell derived tubules must be connected to host tubules for urinary output. Our recent
work in the zebrafish demonstrated that FGF signaling acts as a chemotactic signal to recruit and polarize cells
at sites of new nephron formation and canonical Wnt signaling is required for invasive cell rearrangement to
connect tubule lumens. Additional signaling pathways including non-canonical wnt signaling are also likely to
play a role in tubule interconnection. To fully explore the requirements for tubule interconnection we have
established a synergistic, three-part discovery platform comprising 1) genetic analysis of in vivo new nephron
addition in the regenerating zebrafish adult kidney, 2) in vitro 3D cell culture analysis of mammalian epithelial
fusion, and 3) in vivo stem cell-derived kidney organoid engraftment to a host mouse collecting system. We will
combine these approaches to analyze multiple steps of the tubule fusion process involving 1) recruitment of
nephron progenitor cells to target epithelia, 2) removal of intervening ECM/basement membranes, 3) patterned
collective cell invasion of target epithelia, and 4) establishment of a continuous patent new lumen to convey the
nephron filtrate. These studies will provide important new insights about an essential but understudied cellular

 Using a unique longitudinal data set and linear growth modeling analytic techniques, the
proposed research will examine relations between early and life course trajectories of adversity
and adult biobehavioral markers of aging. Animal and human studies suggest that early
exposure to adversity may negatively impact developing biological systems altering long term
structural and functional trajectories, and accelerating aging processes. The proposed research
will examine this neurotoxicity hypothesis in relation to brain neurobiology (structure, function,
connectivity) and related cognitive and epigenetic markers sensitive to adversity and aging. The
research will also examine the role of protective social relationships (especially positive early
caregiving) in moderating the adversity-related effects.
 Based in the Minnesota Longitudinal Study of Risk and Adaptation (Sroufe et al., 2005) and
drawing on methodology from the Human Connectome Project in Aging (HCP-A; Bookheimer et
al., 2019), the study addresses significant gaps in both neurobiological and behavioral
investigations of the origins of adult aging processes and the effects of adversity on
development. Unlike concurrent and retrospective studies of risk and protective influences on
aging, the proposed study employs a prospective multilevel design with a sample of individuals
assessed from birth to middle adulthood. The proposed assessments of neurobiological and
cognitive functioning will contribute to an understanding of the impact of exposure to adversity
on adult brain health (structure, function, connectivity) and age-related cognition. Specifically,
we will examine the timing and chronicity (onset and trajectory) of adversity in relation to adult
outcomes. Genetic data will permit analyses of associations between adversity, epigenetic
variation (i.e., telomere length, DNA methylation age), and concurrent neural and cognitive
functioning. The proposed work will address critical research, policy, and practice questions
regarding the effects of adverse experience on the human brain, the cognitive and
biological correlates of neurobiological change, and the potential moderating influence of
early caregiving experience on these relations, generating testable research hypotheses
and contributing to the development of targeted prevention and intervention efforts."

Over the past two decades, my laboratory has focused on the identification of novel molecular and cellular
mechanisms underlying the development, maintenance (Project 1) and human-specific evolution (Project 2) of
cortical circuits. In Project 1, we propose to study the role of novel molecular effectors regulating the function of
the two most abundant organelles in neurons: the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. We discovered that
these two organelles are morphologically and functionally very different in axons and dendrites. Even more
recently, we identified a novel tethering protein Pdzd8 mediating specialized contacts between these two
organelles. ER-mitochondria contacts (ERMCs) are emerging as unique biochemical and physiological signaling
platforms in most cells and we discovered that in dendrites of pyramidal neurons, ERMCs play critical roles in
regulating synaptically-evoked Ca2+ dynamics (Hirabayashi et al., Science 2017). We are now proposing to use
an array of new techniques to determine the role of Pdzd8-dependent ER-mitochondria coupling on dendritic
integration, synaptic plasticity and their impact on the emergence of feature selectivity in CA1 PNs.
Since 2010, we have also initiated a new paradigm to provide insights into one of the most challenging questions
in Neuroscience: ‘what makes the human brain unique?’. In particular, our work tackled whether or not the
uniqueness of the human cortical circuits has molecular and physiological determinants at the synaptic level. In
Project 2, we propose to continue the new paradigm we implemented starting to tackle this question, by studying
the role of human-specific gene duplications (HSGDs) as potential genetic modifiers of circuit development and
function. The first example of such an HSGD acting as a human-specific modifier of synaptic development and
cortical circuit architecture came from our study on SRGAP2A and its human-specific paralog SRGAP2C.
Humanization of SRGAP2C expression in mouse cortical pyramidal neurons phenocopies a partial loss of
function of SRGAP2A and leads to the emergence of phenotypic traits characterizing human cortical circuits,
protracted period of E and I synaptic maturation and increased density of both types of synapses. Our most
recent results demonstrate that SRGAP2C increases specifically the formation of cortico-cortical synapses onto
layer 2/3 PNs, increased reliability of sensory coding and improved behavioral performance in tasks involving
sensory discrimination (Schmidt et al. bioRxiv (2020); Nature in press). We propose to explore other aspects of
SRGAP2A functions and how humanization of SRGAP2C modulates them, including their role in microglial cells
where both are expressed and in synaptic plasticity within adult cortical circuits. We will also extend this paradigm
to other human-specific gene duplications as potential modifiers of cortical circuit development, limiting our scope
to 4 other genes expressed in maturing and adult postmitotic neurons in the mouse and human cortex. Our
projects will tackle with unprecedented relevance the relationship between genes, circuit architecture,
circuit function and behavior in the framework of human cortical circuit evolution."

 While cardiovascular disease remains a significant burden in the U.S., effects are particularly pronounced in
people with mental disorders such as bipolar disorder (BD). Medical complications and early mortality in those
with BD and hypertension is often associated with poor medication adherence and sub -optimal engagement in
care. However, medication non-adherence among such individuals and its negative impact on both
cardiovascular and mental health is a potentially modifiable problem of critical public health importance. The
proposed study, written in response to PA-18-722: Improving Patient Adherence to Treatment and Prevention
Regimens to Promote Health, will evaluate the effects of a personalized patient-centered adherence m-Health
intervention called Individualized Texting for Adherence Building-Cardiovascular; iTAB-CV (iTAB-CV) on
adherence to antihypertensive medications and systolic blood pressure in people with BD.
 In common with many individuals with mood symptoms, BD patients have cognitive and functional
impairment that need adherence approaches that go above and beyond standard education. Effective
approaches should help engagement in care for both physical and mental health. iTAB-CV is delivered on a
mobile phone via Short Message Service (SMS) and is based on a modified version of the Attitude -Social
Influence-Efficacy (ASE) model to target both intentional and non-intentional non-adherence. To change and
sustain adherence in this and similar populations, one must address attitudes, self-efficacy, and prospective
memory deficits to form the habit of medication taking. In a pilot trial of iTAB-CV, participants were highly
engaged, with 100% retention over 3 months and showed significant improvement in adherence, reduction in
systolic blood pressure (SBP), and improved psychiatric symptoms. This project will be conducted as a 12-month
prospective 2-stage randomized controlled trial comparing iTAB-CV + Self-Monitoring of blood pressure, mood,
and medication taking (n=100) to Self-Monitoring alone (n=100). The primary outcome is adherence to
antihypertension medication as measured by the self-reported Tablets Routine Questionnaire (TRQ) and
validated with objective automated pill caps (eCAP) and systolic blood pressure while secondary outcomes
include adherence to psychiatric medication and psychiatric symptoms. iTAB-CV participants will be re-
randomized to low and high frequency booster sessions to explore whether dose (frequency of text) moderates
longer-term outcome, to investigate habit strength as a mediator of adherence and identify variables that
enhance or impede adherence. We will also employ an advisory board made up of key stakeholders including
patients, family members, providers, and administrative staff who can help inform how the intervention might fit
into existing clinical workflows. iTAB-CV has potential to advance care for people with poorly controlled
hypertension and mental health comorbidity. The practical, m-Health delivery format will enhance suitability for
broad scale-up in future hybrid implementation-effectiveness trials."

While many questions remain regarding specific rates for HIV PEP preventable transmissions related to the
real world challenges of HIV seroconversion and measuring risk, we do know that: 1) among people who
experience a known exposure, HIV PEP is effective and potentially cost saving if initiated in a timely manner
and completed fully; 2) patients who have been offered, accepted, and even completed HIV PEP continue to
report confusion and inaccurate information regarding its use; and 3) in many contexts decision aids have been
demonstrated to improve patient reported knowledge regarding decision making, decrease decisional conflict,
and improve patient-provider communication. Given these gaps, the long-term goal of this work is to develop,
refine, and validate a technology-delivered decision aid to assist providers in better understanding and
effectively implementing HIV PEP in practice, and assist patients to better understand the decision they are
making when provided with HIV PEP as an option so that they may more successfully 1) make the decision,
and 2) complete the entire 28-day course of medication when they decide to initiate HIV PEP.
The proposed decision aid leverages a known clinical opportunity to engage patients who are at risk for
seroconversion in initiation of HIV PEP. By creating an internet-delivered multimedia tool that: 1) removes
provider biases regarding what qualifies as an HIV risk from the discussion process; 2) slows the process of
information sharing and decision making down and presents information in short, repeatable pieces; and 3)
incorporates an opportunity for patients to reflect on key aspects that have been shown to impact decision
making and adherence (e.g. social support/stigma, HIV risk perception, cost/access, side effects) prior to
making the decision we anticipate that patients will have less decisional conflict, feel more confident about their
decision, and for patients who initiate HIV PEP, be more able to complete the entire regimen.
Lastly, the proposal includes relationship building via a community advisory board to support all steps of
decision aid development and subsequent testing. Principles of design justice (e.g. adopting co-design
methods, developing specific mechanisms for accountability, centering the needs of marginalized users) will be
used to partner with this group of patient and health care providers to design specific aspects of intervention
content, and plan details of the future efficacy testing study."

we received 44 eligible applicants for 5 vacancies. Of the 5 admitted, 40% were from underrepresented groups
proving we attract diverse, high quality candidates. Three Associate Directors with expertise in public health,
biostatistics, drug development, molecular biology, and health services research will work with the PD/PI to
ensure robust leadership and an interdisciplinary focus for all program activities. Scholars will be guided by 2
or more of our 20 Mentors, working in 4 inter-professional teams built from existing collaborations in areas of
strength on our campus: Reproductive Health, Aging, Infectious Diseases, and Health Disparities/Hispanic
Health. UTMB offers unique opportunities in Hispanic Health research, and all Scholars will be encouraged to
interact with this team. Three Mentors from MD Anderson or Baylor College of Medicine, who have long-term
collaborations with our program, will offer Scholars additional mentoring, collaboration, and networking
opportunities. Our Mentors all have extensive publication records in women’s health, external funding as PI
(average of $1.37 million per year) and strong mentoring histories. They have a long history of co-publishing
with each other and their mentees, demonstrating effective use of team science. Our expanded Resource Lab

including Specific Aims development meetings. Experiential learning includes individual instruction in writing
and career development interactions with senior leaders on campus. We have added training in bioinformatics,
sex and gender research, and a requirement for Scholars to mentor biomedical students to prepare Scholars
for advanced academic roles. An external review of Scholars, Directors, Mentors, Resource Lab, and program

The central theme of this project is dioxygen activation for C-H/C-C bond functionalization, which is fundamental for
aerobic life. Molecular oxygen is a powerful oxidant, but the reaction with ground-state singlet molecules is kinetically
unfavorable due to the spin-forbidden nature. To harness the oxidizing power of oxygen and circumvent the unregulated
production of reactive oxidative species, metalloenzymes are frequently employed by aerobic organisms to activate oxygen
and manipulate biomolecules. Heme and non-heme iron enzymes are two of the most ubiquitous and potent natural catalysts.
Representative systems have been well characterized with near-complete mechanistic delineation. However, catalytic
pathways of iron-dependent oxygenases with less common ligand sets lack description, and studies emphasizing an
individual system do not often consider the intrinsic differences between heme and non-heme coordination. A holistic
picture to systematically compare these two systems regarding oxygen activation and reactivity is deficient in the field. This
project desires to fill the knowledge gap by investigating how the ligand sets contribute to reaction outcomes and why a
particular system exploits one coordination over the other for a specific reaction. An apparent challenge of direct comparison
is the massive variability between systems: the selection of ligand donors, active site environment, substrate-binding mode,
and overall protein scaffold. To simplify the coordination environment for an unbiased comparison, two unique
multifunctional oxygenases are chosen, each with an iron center ligated only by nitrogen-donors. One is a His-ligated heme-
dependent enzyme responsible for pyrrolnitrin production, promoting remarkable rearrangement of a tryptophan derivative.
The other is a non-heme iron-dependent enzyme crucial for the visual cycle, which catalyzes oxidative alkene cleavage and
isomerization using a 4-His ligated ferrous iron. The catalytic mechanisms and structure-function correlations of both
enzymes are poorly understood and the ligand sets are rarely found to mediate oxygenation reactions. Over the five-year
funding period, we will comparatively investigate the heme and non-heme systems to decode how the atypical ligand sets
promote the unusual biotransformations and how oxygen activation is tuned by the presence or absence of a porphyrin ring.
Ultimately, the proposed research will leverage the understanding of iron-oxygen chemistry, inspire the design of
biomimetic complexes and engineered biocatalysts, and advance the potential for biomedical treatments for fungal infection
and impaired vision."

O-GlcNAc is a single N-acetylglucosamine coupled to serine and threonine residues of nuclear and cytoplasmic
proteins. Analogous to phosphorylation, O-GlcNAc signaling is dynamic, rapidly added and removed from
proteins in a site-specific manner in response to cellular perturbations and extracellular cues. Because both
modifications occur on the same residues it is hypothesized that there is a functional crosstalk between O-
GlcNAc and phosphorylation, where one may affect deposition or removal the other. Unlike phosphorylation,
however, which is catalyzed by over 500 kinases and roughly 300 phosphatases, the mammalian genome only
encodes a single O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and a single hydrolase (OGA). While many kinases recognize
specific amino acid sequences in their substrates, the determinants guiding OGT are unclear and likely manifold.
This intracellular glycosylation is implicated in nearly every cellular process from gene expression and signal
transduction to cell division and differentiation. Despite the ubiquitous nature of this post-translational
modification in health and disease, the specific functions of OGT and the basic principles of O-GlcNAc signaling
remain almost entirely elusive. This gap in our knowledge has been largely due to the major lack of tools and
technologies available to study O-GlcNAc signaling or perturb the essential OGT.
Here, we aim to uncover the basic principles of OGT and O-GlcNAc signaling, and their role in transcriptional
regulation of cellular differentiation. We have recently developed a highly sensitive and specific enrichment
reagent to analyze O-GlcNAc-modified peptides from cells and tissues by mass spectrometry. Using these new
anti-O-GlcNAc antibodies we will elucidate the global, site-specific temporal dynamics of O-GlcNAc signaling
during the transition from totipotency to naïve and primed pluripotency. Combined with phosphoprotemic profiling
of the same samples, we will monitor for crosstalk between these two post-translational modifications. To gain
insight into how OGT targets its diverse array of substrates, we will deconvolute the extensive OGT interactome
employing chemical crosslinking and biochemical fractionation, followed by mass spectrometric analysis. To
explore how OGT uses adaptor proteins to targets substrates, we will use an innovative approach, degrading
specific OGT interacting proteins and assessing changes in downstream O-GlcNAc signaling using our new
quantitative glycoproteomic approach. Integrating these two research programs, we will create a holistic, high-
resolution understanding of the principles of O-GlcNAc signaling. The MIRA mechanism will not only enable the
investigation of basic O-GlcNAc biology, but will provide the flexibility to conduct data-driven follow-up, functional
analyses of dynamic O-GlcNAc/crosstalk sites and distinct OGT complexes, and their role in transcriptional
regulation of some of the earliest development decisions."
10838500,"As patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) live to adulthood, the chronic impact of sustained hemolytic anemia
and episodic vaso-occlusive events take their toll, with the progressive development of cardiopulmonary organ
dysfunction. This culminates in the development of pulmonary hypertension, left ventricular diastolic heart
disease, dysrhythmia, chronic kidney disease and sudden death, all major cardiovascular complications of
SCD for which there are no approved or consensus therapies. The risk of having pulmonary hypertension and
diastolic heart disease can be non-invasively assessed by laboratory tests (NT-proBNP) and Doppler-
echocardiography (estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure). A recent meta-analysis of approximately
6000 patients with SCD demonstrated that patients with elevated tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV), which
is an Doppler-echocardiographic measurement that estimates the pulmonary artery systolic pressure, walked
an estimated 30.4 meters less in a 6 minute walk test than those without elevated TRV, and elevated TRV was
associated with high mortality (hazard ratio of 4.9). In two large registry cohorts of adult patients with SCD, we
found that approximately 20% of the adult SCD population have high values for both biomarkers, defined as a
TRV ≥ 2.5 meters per second AND a NT-proBNP ≥ 160 pg/mL, and that the 12-month mortality rate is 7.9% in
this group as compared to 0.5% in patients with normal TRV or NT-proBNP values, with a risk ratio for
hospitalization of 1.6. This suggests that a simple screening profile of TRV and NT-proBNP can identify about
20% of patients with SCD at the highest risk of death and hospitalization. Given the increased mortality and
early loss of functional capacity associated with cardiovascular disease in SCD adults, it is important to test
effective therapeutic interventions in such patients. Red blood cell transfusions are administered by either
simple or exchange transfusion, the latter removes the patients blood and replaces it with transfused red blood
cells. Exchange transfusions have proven effective for acute treatment of almost all SCD complications,
including severe acute chest syndrome, stroke, splenic or hepatic sequestration, and multi-organ failure, and
are also used chronically for stroke prevention and recurrent acute chest syndrome. In this study we
hypothesize that monthly exchange transfusion will limit disease progression, improve exercise capacity, and
prevent interval episodes of vaso-occlusive painful crisis and the acute chest syndrome that acutely increases
pulmonary pressures and cause right heart failure. We propose to perform a clinical trial to evaluate the effects
of automated exchange blood transfusion on patient morbidity and mortality, compared to standard of care
among 150 adult high risk SCD patients. The trial will leverage existing coordinating center infrastructure at
the University of Pittsburgh and will involve 22 experienced clinical sites. Despite the safety and wide utilization
of erythrocytapheresis in adult patients with SCD, there is no consensus or quality efficacy data on its use to
improve outcomes in our aging high-risk SCD patients with progressive end-organ dysfunction."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overarching goal of the Johns Hopkins BIRCWH program (JH-BIRCWH) is to develop highly qualified,
independent investigators who will conduct innovative and significant women's health and sex and gender
differences research. The program represents a successful and robust collaboration of the Johns Hopkins
Schools of Medicine, Nursing, and Public Health. In our first period of support, we recruited 10 Scholars, all
outstanding junior investigators from diverse disciplines, including 5 under-represented minorities. The success
of the program is illustrated by their success: 100% (5/5) JH-BIRCWH alumni secured new external federal
and/or foundation research funding. Because of JH-BIRCWH mentorship and career development, these
Scholars continue to develop as independent investigators and leaders in innovative, interdisciplinary research.
Scholars broaden their understanding through the lens of a life course perspective with particular attention to
research on the health needs of diverse and high-risk populations. During this next proposed period of support,
our JH-BIRCWH program is well positioned for sustained success. Consistent with the Office of Research on
Women's Health (ORWH) strategic plan (2019-2023), we will continue to recruit highly motivated junior faculty
scholars, with priority given to investigators from groups underrepresented in research. We will build on the
established foundation of our learner-centered and competency-based approach to interdisciplinary career
development. A critical resource for the JH-BIRCWH program is the cadre of highly experienced,
internationally recognized faculty who are active in research related to women's health or sex/gender
differences, and who are committed to supporting and sponsoring Scholars. The three core strength areas of
the JH-BIRCWH program are: 1) diseases specific to women (e.g. women's cancer and reproductive biology);
2) sex and gender differences in disease expression (e.g. immunology, neuroscience, cardiovascular and
genetics); and 3) social determinants of women's health and disparities (e.g. violence against women, trauma,
addictions and poverty). In this next proposed period of support, the JH-BIRCWH will annually support 3
scholars plus 2 additional scholars supported by institutional matching funds. Scholars will receive expert
mentoring from a multidisciplinary team along with funding, and access to institutional resources. They will be
well prepared to lead interdisciplinary teams to improve women's health by advancing our understanding of sex
and gender differences and health concerns unique to, more prevalent, or with differential consequences in
women."

The 2024 Gordon Research Conference on Sensory Transduction in Microorganisms to be held in Ventura CA
in January 2024 will explore recent advances in understanding signal transduction in bacteria, especially in
pathogenic bacteria. Focus will be placed on bacteria-host interactions, chemosensory mechanisms and
pathways, two-component regulatory systems, second messenger signaling, metabolic signaling in microbial
communities including biofilms and microbiomes, bacterial defense systems, and bacterial stress responses,
including the coordination of subcellular processes. The roles of these systems with respect to pathogenesis,
antimicrobial resistance, and bioengineering will be central themes. All these critical areas will be addressed
through cutting-edge applications of molecular genetics, cell biology, biochemistry, and chemical biology as
well as structural, imaging, biophysical, and computational approaches. Data from high-resolution experiments
will be paired with modeling to understand and predict the behavior of complex macromolecular assemblies
and signaling circuitry. Invited speakers will include both established and early-stage investigators using a wide
array of approaches. In addition, short talks will be chosen from the abstracts to give additional early-career
scientists a chance to speak and to round on the program. Participants will benefit from the Conference’s open,
collegial atmosphere that provides multiple opportunities to engage in scientific discussion, promote scientific
rigor, and foster interdisciplinary collaboration. New, innovative efforts will be used to increase participation of
scientists from historically under-represented backgrounds, and multiple efforts will be taken to make
participants feel welcome and valued. For the sixth time, a Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) for postdocs and
graduate students will precede the GRC. The GRS provides a supportive environment for young scientists to
present their work, make connections, and receive advice by leaders in the field. The STIM community has
long supported junior scientists, and we view the success of the GRS as a necessity to continue on this
mission. The GRS will help us not only nurture the development of early stage investigators, but also promote
diversity within our community. The GRS will help junior scientists gain the confidence and skills to become
full-fledged GRC participants. The well-integrated STIM GRC/GRS will direct established investigators to the
most important questions confronting our field and will encourage young scientists to apply their recent training
to the exciting new areas of microbiology."

Funding is requested for the registration fees and travel costs of invited speakers and discussion leaders as well
as registration fee support for graduate students, postdocs, and early/mid- career scientists with an emphasis
on women and underrepresented minorities to attend the 2024 11th Symposium on Hemostasis at the University
of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill. The theme of the 2024 Symposium will be coagulation and platelet
biology at the intersection of health and disease. The program is designed to bring together experts to present
their most recent cutting-edge findings centered on defining novel mechanisms and innovative therapeutic
advances in hemostasis and thrombosis. Indeed, recent data suggest that coagulation proteins and platelets are
tied to numerous pathological processes through mechanisms both dependent and independent of their
traditional roles in hemostasis and thrombosis. Our invited speakers will present their latest and emerging work
across a spectrum of basic science and clinical topics where coagulation proteins and platelets play a functional
role, including cardiovascular disease, aging, cancer, infection and immunity, as well as tissue remodeling and
regeneration. Priority will be placed on highlighting both the role these proteins play as disease modifiers, as
well as the utility of employing or targeting these factors for diagnosis and therapy. Indeed, a major goal for the
2024 Symposium on Hemostasis is highlighting the translation of basic research findings into the clinical practice.
In addition to invited speakers and discussion leaders, attendees will be selected by invitation and from
applications submitted online. They will be chosen to represent a diverse spectrum of research, with a strong
emphasis on equity of opportunity and inclusion of individuals across all demographic metrics. Additional efforts
will be committed to recruit women and trainees of underrepresented groups as speakers in the ‘Hot Topics’
session and as poster presenters. An intended strength of this meeting will be the interaction and networking of
young scientists in the field with the discussion leaders and the speakers. Collectively, the specific aims for the
2024 11th Symposium on Hemostasis are to: (i) provide an environment that facilitates lively and open
discussions between early career, mid-career, and established scientists that fuels the process of scientific
discovery in the hemostasis and thrombosis community; (ii) provide a platform of support for the careers of junior
scientists, including predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees, to ensure growth of the field; (iii) promote collaborative
and interdisciplinary scientific research that opens channels of long-term interaction and networking that
enhances diversity in the field; and (iv) raise the professional development of under-represented groups in the
hemostasis and thrombosis community. Through these specific aims the 11th Symposium on Hemostasis will
reveal the next chapter of discovery and innovation for hemostasis and thrombosis research while helping to
establish and build on the collaborative relationships necessary to push the field forward."
10828161,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Meharry Medical College and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai are proposing to co‐host a
five‐year, in‐person, conference series on the Exposome across the Life Course with an environmental
justice lens. This five‐year, conference series will examine the science behind environmental justice.
Year one will promote the use of a child exposome and environmental justice lens in research on child
health and development with a long‐term goal of advancing health equity and environmental justice.
Childhood is a time of rapid growth and differentiation biologically and is radically different than adult
biology and behavior. If the timing of a toxic exposure corresponds to a life stage during which growth is
particularly rapid, the potential impact of that exposure is multiplied by offsetting the developmental
trajectory of the child. For example, low level lead poisoning is most common at age 2‐3 years because
of hand to mouth behavior that is normal at this age. In addition, this age is also the peak of synaptic
pruning in the developing brain, a process by which environmental inputs shape a child's life long
synaptic network of neurons that drive neurocognition and neurobehavior. Children's unique age‐
related patterns of exposure and their developmentally defined windows of susceptibility magnify the
long-term health impacts of environmental injustice. Effectively promoting child health and reducing
disparities in personal and population‐health outcomes requires an understanding of the pathways
through which environmental exposures lead to the onset, progression, and outcomes of disease and
population level disparities. While we cannot do much to change our genes, emerging research shows
that identifying and managing environmental hazards offers the best hope for prevention and improving
population health. This conference will address subsequent life stages (adolescence, young adulthood
(including pregnancy, middle age, and older adulthood) in subsequent years."
10828713,"Project Summary
Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. In the past few years, an average of around 18.1 million new
cases of cancer (per year) were diagnosed. Physicians often decide which treatment to give a patient with the
goals of prolonging overall survival, preventing recurrence, and minimizing complications. Generally,
Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are used to determine the efficacy of one therapy versus another therapy
but are untenable in many situations due to ethical and financial constraints. Recent work has leveraged
observational data to develop machine learning models that capture the progression of chronic diseases such
as Cystic Fibrosis and Parkinson’s. However, using machine learning to determine treatment efficacy and
predict important clinical endpoints, such as overall survival (OS) or progression free survival (PFS), in cancer
has not been well studied. This gap in knowledge is due to a lack of benchmark cancer datasets, limited
sample sizes for rare cancers, and challenges specific to cancer management, such as tumor heterogeneity
within patients leading to differential treatment response. In spite of these challenges, recent methodological
improvements in machine learning, such as the use of inductive biases and auxiliary data to improve prediction
in data-scarce settings as well as improved treatment effect estimation methods, present an opportunity to test
the promise of machine learning in the cancer setting. Therefore, the overarching goal of the proposed
work is to develop methods that will enable training of machine learning models that capture the signal
in longitudinal, observational cancer data and ultimately improve prediction of clinical endpoints as
well as estimation of cancer treatment effects. As a case study and evaluation bed for my development of
these methods, I will focus on multiple myeloma, an incurable plasma cell cancer. Aim 1 of this proposal will
focus on improving prediction of survival endpoints and depth of treatment response. I will train a latent
variable model with a novel learning algorithm that will leverage auxiliary longitudinal data to improve the
power of the model, enabling better prediction of clinical endpoints. Aim 2 will tackle the related, yet distinct,
question of treatment effect estimation, particularly with respect to different combination chemotherapies.
Meta-learner models will be used to estimate average and conditional average treatment effects. A sensitivity
analysis framework with clinically-interpretable sensitive parameters will be used to assess reliability of the
estimates. Finally, aim 3 will provide a machine learning decision support tool to augment physician decision
making in cancer management. A user study will be conducted with the tool to determine if it improves
physician assessment of patients. This proposal provides a general methodological framework that can be
applied to any cancer dataset and improves understanding of how to effectively use machine learning models
trained on observational data to improve care of cancer patients."
10828715,"Project Summary: Center for Engineering Endometriosis Care (CEEC)
The high prevalence, diversity of morphological and symptomatic presentations, array of potential etiological
explanations, and variable response to existing interventions suggest that different subgroups of
endometriosis patients with mechanistic bases of disease may exist. These factors, combined with the weak
links to genetic predisposition, make the entire spectrum of the human condition challenging to model in
animals. The majority of endometriosis research approaches questions as ""diseased"" or ""control"", with
stratification among clinical status of patients according to ASRM stages. The overarching goal the CEEC is to
reframe the way the clinical and basic science researchers together approach the complex landscape
of endometriosis: first, by creating a new framework for defining clinical cohorts, based on presumed distinct
biological mechanisms among different patient groups, for corresponding basic science studies; and second,
by developing and implementing new computational systems biology, tissue engineering, and organ-on-chip
models designed to address specific scientific questions arising from the mechanistic groupings of patients.
The average age of patients in published studies on endometriosis is above 30 - more than twice the
age of onset for many patients. Endocrine, metabolic, and immune systems are, on average, very different in
16 and 32 year olds; the physiology of lesions very likely is, also. We know little about the interplay between
systemic host factors and the drugs we now use to treat lesions on the physiology of the lesions. Why is the
disease invasive in some patients, and not others? Here, we propose to classify patient cohorts into 4 distinct
subgroups that differ by systemic physiology {ages 16-21 and ages 32-42) and lesion physiology {superficial
only, persistent; or invasive +/- superficial). This scheme allows us to construct an engineering landscape of in
vitro lesion microenvironments, according to the features of the lesion physical microenvironment and systemic
microenvironment, and a corresponding parameter space in which the magnitudes of cues are varied. Three
projects allow us to develop correlations between patient clinical phenotypes and in vitro models::
Project 1: Parsing Effects of Donor Source and Lesion Microenvironment on Lesion Phenotypes in Vitro
Project 2: Dissecting macrophage signal integration and function in endometriosis
Project 3: Correlates of a holistic in vivo cellular and molecular signature with clinical phenotypes
These projects will draw from a Biospecimen Coordinating Core. At the completion of this work, we will have
new tools, new insights into how existing hormone therapies work in patients, and hopefully a new language for
communication between clinicians and basic scientists in the trenches of endometriosis research. We will also
have a substantial impact on education of the next generation of endometriosis researchers, and patient
awareness of research efforts, through the activities of the education and outreach program."

10847492,"Abstract:
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) associated diseases remain a huge burden in human health. As an
orally transmitted pathogen, EBV infection causes infectious mononucleosis and ~200,000
cases of various cancers, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma that occurs in a space
immediately adjacent to the oral cavity, some B cell malignancies, and ~10% of gastric cancer.
In HIV infected people, EBV causes oral hairy leukoplakia of tongue. To understand the
molecular mechanisms through which EBV contributes to disease development,
EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines are used as a model system. EBV nuclear antigen
leader protein (EBNALP) is essential for EBV to transform naïve B lymphocytes. Most of its
known functions are linked to EBV transcription activator EBNA2. However, EBNALP binds to
many enhancer and promoter sites independent of EBNA2. Perturbations of these EBNALP
sites with CRISPRi significantly decreased these enhancers’ linked gene expression. Little is
known about how EBNALP exerts its EBNA2 independent functions. It is also not known how
EBNALP is tethered to the enhancer/promoter sites and how they affect transcription.
Therefore, we hypothesize that EBNALP exploits host transcription programs to gain
access to host enhancers/promoters, and contributes to EBV transformation through
EBNA2-independent mechanisms. During my mentored period, I will address the
fundamental question of how EBNALP binds to DNA. We will use CRISPR-based assays to
identify host proteins essential for EBNALP enhancer activation. I will first focus on
sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs). Chromatin immune precipitation (ChIP) based
assays will be used to test the effects of knockout on EBNALP DNA binding. During my R00
phase, I will perform research independently and distinguish my work from my mentor’s by
studying different aspects of EBNALP. I will focus my studies on characterizing the enhancer
protein complexes assembled by EBNALP onto the enhancers to regulate transcription
activity. I will focus on transcription cofactors, basal transcription factors, and histone
modifying enzymes. Understanding the mechanisms through which EBNALP binds to DNA
and regulates gene transcription may provide promising targets for treating EBV-associated
diseases."

Of the more than 400 children annually receiving a heart transplant, the likelihood that the child dies within five
years (25%) is equivalent to the potential that the child lives >20 years post-transplant. The success of the
transplant, and thus long-term survival of the child, is well known to correlate with achieving adequate
immunosuppression to prevent rejection, especially in the period immediately following transplant. Attaining
adequate immunosuppression is complicated by several factors, many of which impact the pharmacokinetics
(PK) of the immunosuppressive agent. These factors include age of the patient, renal and hepatic function,
concomitant medications, patient genetics, and the time post-transplant. Frequent, invasive drug monitoring is
used clinically to assess how these factors impact an individual child’s PK, and in turn the dose required to
achieve and maintain adequate immunosuppression. However, this empirical “guess and check” approach often
results in the child spending substantial time receiving immunosuppressive therapy that is either ineffective or
unsafe, decreasing the longevity of the transplant organ and thus, long-term patient survival. A more desirable
approach would be to guide dosing using a precision medicine approach, wherein patient specific factors are
used a priori to predict the dose most likely to achieve adequate immunosuppression. Developing a precision
medicine platform for immunosuppression following pediatric heart transplant has the potential to not only
improve outcomes in heart transplant recipients, but across all transplant types. This proposal aims to: 1)
determine the impact of CYP3A5 genetic variation on tacrolimus concentrations in children, 2) prospectively
validate the clinical utility of a PK-guided precision medicine platform in pediatric heart transplant patients
receiving tacrolimus-based immunosuppression; and 3) identify and correlate biomarkers of transplant outcomes
and tacrolimus safety/effect with the PK of tacrolimus, in order to establish the tacrolimus concentrations required
for safe and effective immunosuppression in pediatric heart transplant recipients. The overall objective of this
study is to improve the long-term survival of children with heart transplant via optimization of the child’s
immunosuppressive therapy. Importantly, the interdisciplinary nature of this mentored research proposal will
facilitate my progress towards an independent career developing precision medicine tools to improve health
outcomes in children."

Rheumatology at The University Pennsylvania and The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia along with The
University of Pennsylvania Biomedical Graduate Studies program, the Medical Scientist Training Program, and
the Graduate Medical Education programs of the Adult and Pediatric Rheumatology Divisions. The Program
offers a rich and diverse mentored environment for training in basic lab investigation, translational research,
clinical epidemiology, and bioinformatics and spans Immunology, Muscle and Bone Biology, and Clinical
Rheumatology knowledge domains. Our multi-disciplinary cohort of trainers come from the School of Medicine,
the Veterinary School, the Dental School, the School of Arts and Sciences, and the Wistar Institute and represent
multiple Departments and Divisions. Training is requested for 3 pre-doctoral and 3 post-doctoral positions. Pre-
doctoral trainees are recruited from students enrolled in The University of Pennsylvania’s highly competitive PhD
and MD/PhD programs in Biomedical Graduate Studies, and must complete rigorous didactic coursework as
well as careful thesis committee evaluation. Post-doctoral trainees are selected from the already highly
competitive and select pool of clinical fellows from both the Adult and Pediatric Rheumatology fellowship
programs as well as PhD scientists within the participating Schools investigating aspects of Rheumatic Disease.
Typical appointments are for 2 years, pending appropriate progress by the trainee. All trainees benefit from a
robust environment of colloquia, seminars, retreats, and lectures, and expected to contribute to this environment
through their own presentations and publications. Trainees are assessed using an Individualized Development
Plan that is reviewed by the trainee, mentor, and the PIs of this Program. The Program itself is continuously
evaluated by direct feedback from trainees and mentors, through annual review by an Internal Advisory Board
and an external consultant, and by self-study techniques. As a measure of success, this Program has
successfully trained a number of investigators now running their own independent NIH funded research

10829899,"Abstract: This renewal continues our optimization of regulatory T cell (Treg) therapy for creating transplant
tolerance to prevent graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). Our first-in-human phase I CD4 thymic Treg (tTreg) and CD4
inducible Treg (iTreg) trials that showed reduction but not elimination of GVHD. Importantly, relapse rates were
not improved and decreasing GVHD but not relapse is an insufficient outcome. In this renewal, we will build
on our exciting finding that Tregs can acquire super-suppressor function and by incorporating an anti-CD19 scFv
CAR (CAR19) increase their potency of killing. In other studies, we developed highly suppressive CAR19 CD8
iTregs that have an intrinsic killing mechanism. Comparing the relative efficacy of these cell types, alone or in
combination, will allow us to initiate clinical trials using one product simultaneously suppress GVHD and
paradoxically kill lymphoma, solving the 2 major alloHCT limitations. A commonality in the diverse
approaches and Treg subsets that acquire super-suppressor function is the presence of a striking metabolic
effects. We discovered that targeting selected cell surface or intracellular proteins led to mitochondria fusion,
high oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and super-suppressor Tregs. Polar metabolite analytics pointed to
key KEGG pathways [serine-glycine-one carbon network], linked by methionine and folate cycles, trans-
sulfuration for glutathione, and alanine-aspartate-L-glutamate. A net result is one-carbon (1C) methyl, formyl, or
methyl group transfer for biosynthesis, control of gene expression and damaging redox reactions. CAR19
expressing CD4 tTregs and human CD8 iTregs that are highly suppressive and cytolytic to hCD19+ targets will
be studied in GVHD/GVL models. Notably, whereas activated CAR19 CTLs can cause severe cytokine release
syndrome (CRS), our preliminary data indicate that CAR19 CD4 tTregs produce low inflammatory cytokines and
do not cause CRS. Aim 1A tests the hypothesis that metabolic reprogramming of Tregs depends on purine
synthesis, mitochondria fusion and OXPHOS, and glutathione for redox balance. Aim 1B exploits Tregs
with 4-1BB vs CD28 and CD2) signaling domains that affect metabolic reprogramming and Treg
persistence for optimal GVHD/GVL. Aim 2 is focused on the killing mechanisms that these Treg subsets use
to lyse targets. Toward that end, we recently discovered CTL supramolecular attack particles (SMAPs) as a new
mechanism for more sustained killing. SMAPs are cytotoxic core-shell particles that contain granzyme B and
perforin and are secreted after triggering the immunological synapse (IS), the contact signaling point for T cells
and APC. Identifying integrated IS signals for SMAP release will provide insights into Treg killing mechanisms,
aiding Aim 1. Supported lipid bilayers simulating the IS will assess CD2 as an IS signal integrator/amplifier of
killing by analyzing dual CAR Tregs. Our central hypotheses are that Tregs reprogrammed in aim 1 for 1C-,
purine- and glutathione- metabolism have enhanced suppression and SMAP release, triggered by CD2
integrated and amplified IS signals and optimal GVHD/GVL."

The ability of public safety personnel to identify cannabis impaired driving has lagged behind the
dramatic shifts in legal access to cannabis in the U.S. and other countries. Reducing the risk
related to cannabis impaired driving will depend on accurate methods to detect impairment and
evidence-informed guidance on how dose, route of administration, and temporal factors are
associated with impairment. We will leverage our operational driving simulator laboratory to test
innovative devices for accuracy and predictive value in identifying impairment from cannabis
use. We will test portable devices that measure psychomotor performance (on a tablet) and
oculomotor performance (in a goggle-based instrument). Using an efficient, within-subjects
design, performance on these devices will be compared to driving simulator measures obtained
before and after self-administered cannabis by occasional and daily cannabis users. We will
also examine the pharmacokinetic profile of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) and its metabolites in
relation to pharmacodynamic measurements of psychomotor function. We will conduct 3 phases
of research over 5 years. In phase 1 we will collect standard venous and innovative (100 µL)
capillary blood samples before and after cannabis use among a cohort of cannabis users with
varied cannabis use histories (n=30) to examine the pharmacokinetic profile of blood
cannabinoids over time. In Phase 2, we will recruit a cohort of cannabis users to complete
assessments before and after smoking cannabis to examine the predictive value of established
psychomotor tests, ocular tests, and blood cannabinoid profiles against validated benchmarks of
driving simulator performance. A subgroup of non-using control subjects will be enrolled to
adjust for learning effects (total n=120). In Phase 3 we will use a similar approach to test the
effect of edible cannabis products on impairment (n=90). These innovative technologies are
highly portable and have the promise to offer an objective assessment of impairment due to
cannabis and other psychoactive drugs at or near the roadside or at the workplace. Successful
completion of our study will provide public health and safety officials, medical and recreational
cannabis users, health care providers, employers and the judicial system with novel information
regarding cannabis use and driving safety."

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major driver of mortality and a financial challenge for healthcare in
the United States. Treatment options are scarce, indirect and not sufficient, whilst CKD is growing into
one of the largest unmet medical needs of our time.
Once the kidney is injured, progression of the disease is dependent on the degree of fibrosis, which
can differ from patient to patient. We and others have made the unique observation that the soluble
form of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is a risk factor for incident and prevalent
kidney diseases across the spectrum of CKD. suPAR is a three finger toxin that is produced by
immature myeloid cells in the bone marrow and circulates in the plasma to regulate integrin function
in the kidney. Elevated suPAR levels or the presence of certain suPAR isoforms are causally
involved in CKD by mediating injury to both glomerular podocytes and proximal tubular cells through
specific interactions with β integrins. Building on our published and novel preliminary observations
that suPAR-mediated integrin activation drives fibrotic programs in the kidney, we plan to investigate
the consequences of suPAR interactions with distinct β integrins in different nephron segments and
explore its role in promoting both glomerular and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Three independent aims
are being proposed: First, we will determine the molecular mechanisms that translate suPAR-αvβ3
integrin signaling into podocyte injuries and glomerular sclerosis using surface plasmon resonance
assays, cultured cell experiments and suPAR transgenic mouse models. Second, we will determine
the molecular mechanisms that drive suPAR-αvβ6 integrin signaling in tubular injuries and
tubulointerstitial fibrosis by genetically modifying the tubular integrin function. Third, we will
investigate therapeutic modalities using peptide based blocking strategies for uPAR and its
associated fibrotic pathways. Experiments outlined in this proposal will allow us to separate different
steps in the suPAR cascade of kidney fibrosis and define best options to intervene. As such, insights
from this grant will provide a basis for preventive and treatment strategies to combat suPAR mediated
fibrosis and CKD."

11159357,"The goal of the Adjuvant Comparison and Characterization (ACC) program is to support side-by-side comparison of adjuvants in combination with clinically relevant vaccine/antigen platforms, and to establish both systemic and tissue-specific immunological profiles (“immune fingerprints”) of adjuvants that work through different mechanisms. A major challenge for HIV vaccine development is learning how to induce robust and durable antibody responses that protect against mucosal infection. A critical step on the path to overcoming this challenge are developing adjuvants that appropriately stimulate robust and durable immune responses. The goal of this project is to assess the impact of 3 different adjuvants on enhancing the magnitude and durability of neutralizing antibody responses against HIV Env."
10834976,"Abstract:
Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death in children, with an estimated 1 million children
affected, and more than 200,000 deaths in children yearly due to TB. HIV coinfection has been
estimated to contribute to more than 35% of TB-related deaths in children in Africa, making the
collision of the HIV and TB epidemics one of the most lethal to date. Both HIV infection as well as
HIV-exposure in utero, among HIV-exposed but uninfected (HEU) children, have been linked to
higher risks for the development of TB among young children. Failures to prevent TB disease and
devastation has been attributed to the lack of an effective vaccine as well as our inability to
diagnose children under the age of 5 due to the difficulty in obtaining sputum and the
paucibacillary nature of the disease in young children. Thus, an inexpensive biomarker-based
diagnostic test tailored for pediatric TB using non-sputum samples that could be used at
the point of care in resource-limited settings could profoundly improve TB treatment and
prevent deaths in children, especially in those under 5 years of age. While Mtb-specific
antibody titer-based diagnostics have performed poorly in the past, due to the inability of
accurately distinguishing between active TB disease from latent TB infection (LTBI), recent data
from our group has shown that Mtb-specific antibody glycosylation shifts significantly across
disease states. Moreover, this antigen-specific antibody glycosylation approach reliably classifies
individuals into active and latent disease states across HIV infection status, across geographies
and can even distinguish recent Typhoid infection among children in endemic areas. Based on
these observations, a simple binding-based assay was developed that can rapidly, sensitively,
and specifically detect changes in Mtb-specific antibody glycosylation from a small sample volume
offering an opportunity for the first time to develop an antigen-specific antibody glycosylation
diagnostic for pediatric TB from a microliter-scale sample. Given that HIV+, HEU, or
unexposed children may target distinct Mtb antigens, here we have assembled a multi-disciplinary
team and program termed FASTER-Kids (Fc Antibody Signatures for TubERculosis in children)
that will: 1) Define the landscape of Mtb-specific antibody glycosylation responses that distinguish
children with TB, 2) Develop a point-of-care test that will rapidly capture these specific antibody
responses and glycosylation changes from microliters of blood. Ultimately, this collaborative
structure will enable the iterative improvement and development of this simple, rapid, inexpensive
diagnostic to manage TB infection in young children."

Although untreated HIV/AIDS infections are fatal, humans nevertheless have an array of powerful innate antiviral responses
that help suppress replication and exert strong selective pressures on the virus during transmission and during viral rebound
following ART interruption. These observations suggest that innate immune responses could be of therapeutic value if we
can understand them better and discover ways to strengthen them. To infect a cell, HIV-1 must run a gauntlet of such innate
immune sensors and restrictions. Studies in Project 2, Cellular Defenses Against HIV, will reconstitute and characterize the
mechanisms of cellular innate immune sensing and restriction of HIV-1 that occur during the first half of the viral life cycle.
Studies in Aim 1 (SERINC Structure, Mechanism, and Antiviral Activity) will build on our recent cryoEM structure of
hSERINC3, and our discoveries that restricting SERINCs are nonspecific phospholipid scramblases and that loss of
phosphatidyl serine (PS) asymmetry elicits antiviral effects. We hypothesize that SERINCs inhibit HIV-1 entry by altering
the natural asymmetry of the virion lipid bilayer. We propose to determine how SERINCs flip lipids, and to test whether
SERINCs exert their antiviral activities by altering PS distribution and disrupting Env conformations.
Studies in Aim 2 (HIV-1 Recognition and Innate Signaling) will leverage our ability to reconstitute cGAS innate immune
sensing of replicating HIV cores in vitro and our discovery that HIV-1 capsid inhibitors can promote innate signaling in
infected myeloid cells. We now propose to determine: 1) how viral core structure and stability affect cGAS-mediated
detection of reverse transcription, 2) how capsid-binding factors such as PQBP1 contribute to cGAS sensing in myeloid
cells, 3) whether and how CA inhibitors can promote cGAS detection of HIV-1, 4) how cell-specific factors regulate cGAS
activity, and 5) how the resulting downstream responses restrict HIV-1 infection.
Studies in Aim 3 (TRIM Restrictions) will follow from our observation that TRIM5 proteins form hexagonal cages around
incoming HIV-1 capsids. Experiments in this Aim are designed to fill fundamental gaps in our understanding of the viral
inhibition and signaling processes that follow this initial TRIM5 recognition step, and to discover how host cofactors
facilitate or modulate TRIM5 restriction.
Studies in Aim 4 (Reconstitution of Other Restrictions) will build on our ability to reconstitute SAMHD1 and APOBEC3G
restriction of replicating HIV-1 cores in vitro, and we now propose to reconstitute MxB restriction. These reconstituted
reactions will be used to fill gaps in our understanding of restriction mechanisms, cofactors, and regulation, and to examine

Dynamics, will characterize HIV-1 proviral silencing and reactivation over a wide range of resolution scales, from living
animals to high-resolution structural studies, and will develop new methods aimed at protecting animals from enveloped
viral infections and designing new biologics delivery systems.
Studies in Aim 1 (In Situ Architecture of Virus Reactivation) will examine, across multiple size and resolution scales,
viruses and associated cells at sites of HIV/SIV rebound in animal models. Specifically, we will: 1) locate and image
reactivating virus and associated cells, and 2) define the transcription profiles of infected and neighboring cells at rebound
sites.
Studies in Aim 2 (Proviral Silencing and Reactivation) seek a molecular and structural understanding of how HIV-1
silencing is established and maintained. To this end, we will determine structures, interactions, and mechanisms important
for latency, with a focus on the H3K9-specific methylase SETDB1, and on HUSH, which localizes on H3K9me3 and
collaborates with SETDB1 to promote the spread of H3K9me3 and heterochromatin.
Studies in Aim 3 (RetroCHMP3 Blocks to Viral Dissemination) will build on our recent discovery of retroCHMP3 proteins,
which are naturally-occurring factors that potently inhibit release of enveloped viruses that use the ESCRT pathway for
budding, including HIV-1. Our goals are to optimize retroCHMP3 potency in mouse cells lines by increasing protein
stability, expression, and restriction activity, and then create transgenic mice that express the optimal constructs and test for
broad resistance to enveloped viruses.
Studies in Aim 4 (Virus-Inspired Designed Delivery Systems) will generate new virus-inspired technology platforms for
intercellular delivery that are simple, robust, and controllable by taking advantage of: 1) recent developments in
computational protein design, 2) our previous successes in harnessing the principles of HIV-1 assembly to develop
nanoparticles that can direct their own self-assembly and bud from cells, and 3) our new advances for incorporating

10836574,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) comprise a range of effects from prenatal alcohol exposure
(PAE) including neurological abnormalities, cognitive and behavioral impairments, growth retardation,
and craniofacial anomalies. Very few treatments have been investigated despite the tremendous
public health burden posed by FASD. Cognition is a natural target for intervention because deficits
contribute to problems with adaptive functioning, social skills, and independent living. A decade of
research suggests that cognitive training has beneficial effects on functional brain networks -
mediating cognition in a variety of neurodevelopmental and mental health conditions. We believe it
can improve cognitive performance in individuals with FASD. The primary objective of our existing
line of neuromodulation research and the proposed RCT is to leverage the ability of tDCS to enhance
cortical excitability and neural plasticity in order to maximize the cognitive training benefits in children
and adolescents with FASD.
 Recently we carried out a pilot randomized controlled trial of tDCS-augmented cognitive
training to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of this approach in children with FASD (Boroda,
Krueger, et al., 2020). We showed that the intervention was safe and well-tolerated in this population.
Further, despite applying a relatively low-dose of tDCS and cognitive training, we found that the group
receiving active-tDCS demonstrated greater improvements on an attention task than a group
receiving sham-tDCS. These promising pilot results merit replication in a larger clinical trial.
 We propose a fully-powered randomized controlled trial of 60 (at completion) children and
adolescents with FASD who will receive cognitive training in combination with tDCS. We hypothesize
that, in conjunction with cognitive training, five initial sessions of active tDCS will produce a
significantly greater improvement in sustained attention (CPT) than sham tDCS. We also
hypothesize that, in conjunction with cognitive training, a total of ten sessions of active tDCS will
produce a significantly greater improvement in sustained attention (CPT) than five sessions of active
tDCS. We also aim to establish the long-term durability of neurocognitive improvements and
associated behavioral changes resulting from tDCS and cognitive training. Finally, we plan to use
pre-intervention and post-intervention resting-state fMRI data to show functional network changes
related to the intervention and to quantify the relationship between dose and functional network
changes. Results of the trial will directly inform future clinical implementation of cognitive training and
tDCS as a potential neurodevelopmental intervention."
10836581,"The proposed research will study the effects of robot-mediated physical and cognitive exercise activities
 on older adult wellness, in particular when the intervention has been designed with stakeholders (e.g.,
 skilled nursing facility staff and residents) in the loop and with the ability to adapt to changes in user ability
 over longitudinal use (as measured using assessments built into the exercise activities). As the worldwide
 population of older adults grows, the need for new resources to support wellness in older adult
 communities also rises. In particular, limitations are already present in resources available to encourage
 physical activity, cognitive exercise, social connectedness, and entertainment for members of these
 communities. Thus, to ensure healthy aging opportunities for older adults, there is a critical need to (1)
 design autonomous robotic systems to support these types of needs, (2) enable these systems with the
 ability to learn and adapt over time to maintain relevance and interest, and (3) to deploy these robotic
 systems for extended periods of time in the environments of interest.
The proposed work is unique in its research team, proposed exercise activities, methods of tracking user
ability levels, and consideration of long-term deployments in real environments of interest. The PIs'
partnership with a gerontologist (as Senior Personnel) and local skilled nursing facility (as a key
collaborator) from the start of the project supports this project's ability to successfully investigate a new
robot deployment application. The proposed exercise activities, as initially prototyped in the PI's past
work, combine physical and cognitive elements to different degrees depending on the activity, thereby
encouraging more mental engagement with physical tasks than pure physical exercise would typically
yield (and vice versa). Similarly, the updating of exercises over time supports continued engagement with
the robotic system and skill improvement in ways that most current tools do not allow for. Lastly, the
planned longitudinal deployment facilitates understanding how this type of robotic system can lead to
meaningful change in wellness (e.g., physical, cognitive, and psychological well-being) for older adults.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
 The core research goal of this proposal centers on the human-centered design and long-term deployment
 of robots that can promote wellness in older adult communities (e.g., assisted living communities, skilled
 nursing facilities). In alignment with NIA interests, the project will conduct participatory robotic intervention
 design with older adult and skilled nursing facility stakeholders, perform design-build-test cycles of the
 resultant robotic intervention systems, and evaluate robotic system impact on health-related metrics."
10836582,"Substance use and substance use disorders (SUD) constitute major public health problems due to their
associated disability, comorbidity and mortality. Addressing these burdens requires cutting-edge public health

Program (SAETP) at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) in New York City was established
with the objective of training talented young scientists to become the next generation of leaders in substance
abuse epidemiology. Through competitive applications, SAETP has successfully, attracted a diverse group of
fellows that have been productive and successful during and after training. Completed SAETP fellows have
attained prestigious research positions in academic research settings and many have obtained their own
independent funding. We now propose the next 5-year renewal cycle for SAETP. SAETP exists in a very rich,
stimulating environment, offering unparalleled academic medical center resources. With its specialized training
for substance abuse epidemiology careers, SAETP is unique at CUIMC. Dr. Deborah Hasin and Dr. Silvia
Martins, SAETP MPIs, are internationally recognized substance abuse epidemiologists with extensive
successful mentoring experience. The 24 other SAETP faculty members offer interdisciplinary expertise (e.g.,
epidemiology, psychiatry, psychology, sociomedical sciences, biostatistics, nursing) and have outstanding
records of publishing, funding, collaborations, and mentoring productive and successful trainees. At any given
time in the renewal, SAETP will continue to train 4 pre-doctoral fellows for training periods of 3-5 years each,
and 4 post-doctoral fellows for training periods of 2-3 years each, a number that has worked well in the current
cycle. Fellows will be selected based on their prior accomplishments, commitment to substance abuse
epidemiology careers, and fit with the SAETP program. Recruitment efforts to enroll under-represented minority
trainees have been successful, with 33% of SAETP fellows from such groups to date (50% currently); we will
continue these recruitment efforts. SAETP will provide broad, intensive training in substance abuse
epidemiology and related areas; depth in one or more areas of specialization; cutting-edge methodological
skills, development of conceptual skills, including formulation of key research questions and testable
hypotheses, and the ability to design and conduct high-quality substance abuse epidemiology studies. Fellows
will receive mentoring and participate in many training components, e.g., weekly substance abuse
epidemiology faculty-fellow seminars, research internships, academic courses. Fellows will also receive training
in the Responsible Conduct of Research and Rigor and Reproducibility in Research. SAETP training will enable
fellows to publish papers, hone presentation skills, learn to write fundable grant proposals, and enhance
collaboration and leadership skills. This rigorous, enriched training will prepare a new generation of outstanding
researchers to address the epidemiology of substance use and SUD, which are urgent public health problems."
10836417,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Drug craving during prolonged periods of abstinence is a major factor driving repeated cycles of
drug abuse. In light of the increasing prevalence of drug abuse, it is imperative that we obtain a
clear understanding of the neural circuit plasticity and associated molecular mechanisms
underlying drug craving specifically. The ventral pallidum (VP) is the major output structure of the
mesolimbic reward circuitry and is suggested to be the final common pathway for reward and
motivational processing by relaying information from the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral
tegmental area (VTA) to the lateral habenula (LHb), VTA, and subthalamic structures. However,
little is known about the circuit level organization and function of VP neurons in drug addiction,
especially in the context of drug seeking following prolonged withdrawal. Therefore, we will
anatomically and functionally probe the neural adaptations of a molecularly-defined subset of VP
output neurons using the cocaine self-administration paradigm in mice, in order to better
understand the mechanisms underlying cocaine seeking after a prolonged period of withdrawal.
To accomplish this, we propose to study withdrawal-induced neural adaptations in specific
subcircuits originating in the VP by using multiple cutting-edge techniques including optogenetic
manipulation, in vivo monitoring of neural activity, viral-mediated tracing, ex vivo electrophysiology,
and molecular profiling methods in a mouse cocaine self-administration model of drug addiction.
Our preliminary data indicate that dopamine receptor 3 (Drd3) signaling is selectively upregulated
in the VP during withdrawal from cocaine self-administration, and that knockdown of Drd3 in the
VP, but not in the NAc, inhibits cocaine seeking behavior after prolonged withdrawal, but not
sucrose reward seeking, strongly suggesting that VP Drd3 signaling may play a major role
specifically in cocaine-induced craving and drug seeking behavior. We will first define the afferent
and efferent connections of Drd3-expressing VP neurons. Second, we will examine the circuit-
specific neural adaptations of VP Drd3 neurons and their role in cocaine seeking. Third, we will
examine how VP Drd3 neuronal activity regulates VTA dopaminergic neuronal activity and
dopamine release in NAc and VP during prolonged withdrawal from cocaine self-administration
using cutting-edge imaging techniques. The accomplishment of this project will be greatly
beneficial in providing a framework for studying drug addiction in a circuit-specific manner, as well
as in developing a strategy for the treatment of drug addiction."

 The TEAMS Center Administrative Core will serve as the essential hub for Center activities and team
members (including investigators, community partners, and trainees). This Core will provide the organizational
leadership and infrastructure to create and maintain a well-functioning center and will be charged with
coordinating the community-engaged scientific, administrative, and governance activities of the Center. It will
operate through three functional units or teams (Center and Research Operations, Community-Engaged
Research, and Training and Dissemination). The Administrative Core team brings substantive expertise in
children’s mental health effectiveness and implementation trials, evidence-based practices (EBPs) for common
children’s mental health conditions, and community academic partnership models. The Administrative Core will
apply the Center’s Team Effectiveness for Implementation Science Model to build team processes to promote
team effectiveness (i.e. a well-functioning and productive Center). The Center and Research Operations team
will coordinate the Center’s activities to optimize efficiencies and promote research progress. The Community-
Engaged Research team will facilitate the application of team effectiveness research to optimize EBP
implementation practice in key public service systems caring for children with mental health concerns. This team
will convene four “system” workgroups to advise projects, identify relevant team mechanisms and team
development interventions to promote EBP implementation in each service system (specialty mental health,
schools, pediatric healthcare, child welfare services), and priority research questions within and across systems.
It will also launch new community-partnered research through R03 pilot studies. The Training and Dissemination
team will provide training in children’s mental health team-based implementation research and practice and
broadly disseminate Center innovations. It will provide interdisciplinary and mentored training to internal Center
trainees and disseminate Center resources and trainings to national and global networks."

technology to develop tools to rapidly assess team functioning in real-world settings. Within community service
systems caring for children with mental health needs, the assessment of team effectiveness—although crucial
for improving team functioning—can be a laborious and cumbersome task. Innovations in technology related to
the automatic capturing of communication between team members can lessen the burden in assessing and
improving team effectiveness. The Methods Core will lead innovation by leveraging natural language processing
technology to develop tools to rapidly assess team functioning in real-world settings. The Methods Core
investigators have already been collaborating closely with the Administrative Core, the R01, and the R34 teams,
and Community Service System Workgroup stakeholders in selecting, adapting and shaping strategies and
approaches to implementation and improvement for children’s mental health across service system settings. The
Methods Core is a team effort led by Drs. Aarons (implementation science, mental health), Burke (team
effectiveness, team strategies), and Sklar (mental health services, evaluation) (see biosketches). The Methods
Core is organized to address four aims: Aim 1) Integrate models and strategies from team effectiveness research
and implementation science to improve children’s mental health services, Aim 2) Apply multilevel and advanced
methods and designs for team-based implementation research, and Aim 3) Lead the design and implementation
of a multi-level, longitudinal, iterative evaluation to refine the Center’s research activities, maximize the Center’s
impact and inform plans for future collaborative research."
10842291,"Project Summary – (R01 – ADHD Intervention in Schools)
The proposed project aims to integrate team-based implementation strategies to enhance implementation of the
Collaborative Life Skills Program (CLS), an established school-based intervention for children with ADHD in
grades 2-5. We will tailor three empirically-supported team development interventions, Team Charters, Team
Communication Training (Student Handoff Protocols), and Team Performance Monitoring, and integrate them
with the CLS protocol to create a team-enhanced CLS implementation protocol (CLS-T). Team Charters are a
written document developed collaboratively by the team at the outset of their work together outlining
expectations, goals, roles and responsibilities, and relevant policies and procedures for team collaborative
operations. Research shows that Team Charters strengthen affective emergent states, such as trust and
cohesion among team members, as well as cognitive emergent states, such as shared mental models. They
also strengthen team processes, such as goal specification, communication, and coordination to optimize team
effectiveness. Handoff protocols are widely used interventions for ensuring continuity in patient care and
minimizing errors in medical settings. They have also been found to improve affective (e.g., trust, cohesion) and
cognitive (e.g., shared mental models, situation awareness) emergent states among team members, enhancing
team communication and coordination. Finally, Team Performance Monitoring provides feedback to teams that
can motivate performance, provide opportunities for adaptation in the event of challenges, and prompt
communication among team members. We will conduct a Hybrid Type III cluster randomized trial in 24 schools
in two large urban school districts, to evaluate whether CLS-T implementation results in improved implementation
outcomes and child outcomes in comparison to standard CLS implementation. The specific aims are to 1)
Evaluate the effectiveness of CLS-T implementation, relative to standard CLS, on implementation outcomes; 2)
Evaluate the effectiveness of CLS-T implementation, relative to standard CLS implementation, on child
outcomes; and 3) Use mixed-methods to examine if key team-based mechanisms are engaged by CLS-T
implementation, relative to standard CLS implementation, and mediate its effects on implementation outcomes
and child outcomes."
10843216,"PROJECT SUMMARY 
Learning health system (LHS) research is a pivotal way to engage the research community with the clinical 
community to mitigate the 17-year evidence to practice gap, improve quality of care and optimize patient 
outcomes. The 3-part LHS process a) transforms data to knowledge by assembling, analyzing, and interpreting 
data; b) applies knowledge gleaned through data to improve performance by feeding the data-knowledge back 
into practice to create change; and c) gathers performance data to update and continue the learning cycle 
building on best practices. A LHS approach in rehabilitation could accelerate the testing and adoption of 
practices under real-world conditions. However, knowledge and use of LHS research methodology in medical 
rehabilitation is limited. While some LHS research resources exist, focusing predominantly on implementation 
science and bioinformatics in medical settings, these resources are fragmented and serve only selected 
institutions, investigators, or disciplines. LeaRRN will unify LHS research resources across the disciplines of 
rehabilitation. LeaRRN’s Didactic Interaction component activities will foster awareness of LHS research within 
the rehabilitation clinical and scientific communities and deliver training and networking opportunities that build 
competencies to advance LHS research. The specific aims for the Didactic Interactions component are to: 1) 
facilitate awareness of the LHS cycle to facilitate the transformation of rehabilitation care; 2) equip researchers 
and clinicians with LHS research skills; and 3) accelerate the adoption of LHS research competencies in 
rehabilitation through consultation and collaboration. We will capitalize on a multimodal education and training 
approach to enhance awareness, build competency, and accelerate adoption of a LHS approach in medical 
rehabilitation. This component will develop and disseminate didactic content linked to real-world case 
examples illustrating implementation and dissemination of knowledge to change practice within clinical 
rehabilitation contexts, and offer training workshops, symposia, and educational resources (e.g., web-based, 
print materials) to medical rehabilitation clinicians and scientists to develop and implement LHS competencies 
in a clinical context. Didactic activities will foster LHS competency development, implementation and 
collaboration between researchers and health systems by utilizing web-based resources and consultation in 
addition to in-person events and networking activities, The Didactic Interactions component will be led by Drs. 
Mary Slavin (BU) and Theresa Shireman (Brown). The Didactic Interactions team with specialized skills in 
stakeholder engagement, improvement and implementation science, health systems and health economics will 
plan activities and draw upon the extensive pool of faculty from the collaborating academic institutions to 
provide extensive and varied programming venues and consultation services."
10843218,"PROJECT SUMMARY 
A major barrier to integrating healthcare research into practice is that researchers often lack firsthand 
experience and knowledge of how healthcare organizations operate in what is becoming an increasingly 
complex and demanding environment. LeaRRN will provide formal mentored collaborative opportunities for 
rehabilitation researchers to engage with healthcare systems through a learning health systems (LHS) Scholar 
Program. The foundations of this program are our partnerships with a diverse group of eight health 
systems/organizations that represent the rehabilitation continuum of care and provide rich “laboratories” for 
hands-on experiences. The overall objective of the Mentored Collaborative Opportunities component of 
LeaRRN is to facilitate the conduct of LHS research that is driven by health system partners’ priorities. This will 
be achieved by creating productive and synergistic partnerships between rehabilitation researchers and health 
systems. This component has the following specific aims: 1) identify health system priority areas for improving 
the quality and value of rehabilitation care, by convening stakeholders and align these priorities with calls for 
LHS Scholars and pilot studies; 2) solicit and review applications for LHS Scholars; 3) facilitate productive and 
meaningful partnerships between LHS Scholars and health systems; 4) provide ongoing scientific mentoring 
for the partnerships; and 5) provide administrative oversight for the LHS Scholar Program. The LHS Scholar 
program will provide the researcher with resources and guidance to learn about the context of a health system, 
its current processes of rehabilitation care delivery and the data infrastructure to support LHS research. The 
LHS Scholar opportunity will also allow researchers to cultivate a meaningful relationship with health system 
stakeholders and begin preparatory work to conduct research on a priority topic identified by the healthcare 
system. These partnerships will be mentored by LeaRRN faculty, who will offer ongoing guidance as the 
researcher and health system formulate a plan to engage in the cycle of learning health systems research. At 
the end of the LHS Scholar year, the Scholar and health system will be well-positioned to take the work to the 
next level which may include seeking pilot study funding through the LeaRRN pilot study program or through 
other funding mechanisms. The LHS Scholar Program provides a mechanism for rehabilitation researchers 
and health systems to develop partnerships and formulate plans for addressing high-priority rehabilitation care 
issues using LHS research methods. These partnerships will produce novel insights and knowledge that will 
ultimately inform and accelerate the implementation of evidence into practice to improve the quality and value 
of rehabilitation care at the individual, system, and population level."
10843220,"PROJECT SUMMARY 
The LeaRRN Techniques Component will modify LHS research techniques and resources so that they are 
focused on the needs of rehabilitation researchers and aligned with the priorities of our LHS Innovation Hub 
partners. Our first step is to identify existing gaps in LHS research knowledge across the broad rehabilitation 
research communities and match those needs to the priorities identified by our LHS Innovation Hub partners. 
This work will guide development of resources and adaptation of techniques to improve rehabilitation research 
in real-world settings and develop a critical mass of rehabilitation researchers focused on LHS research. The 
overarching purpose of the LeaRRN Techniques Development Component is to modify available LHS research 
techniques and resources to enhance achievement of LHS research competencies in the rehabilitation 
research community. This is urgently needed because rehabilitation researchers have had little exposure to 
many LHS research core competencies in their academic training. LHS research draws on theoretical and 
applied methods from a variety of fields. While rehabilitation research training may address some LHS 
research competencies, such as asking meaningful questions, applying appropriate methods, and ethics of 
research; rehabilitation research training does not address key competency areas required for engaging and 
conducting research within LHS. For example, most rehabilitation researchers have little to no exposure to key 
competency domains such as system science, improvement and implementation science and stakeholder 
engagement. Most rehabilitation researchers are unprepared to conduct research within a real-world health 
system. The Techniques Development component has the following specific aims: 1) assess gaps in LHS 
research competencies and resource needs of the broad rehabilitation research community; 2) develop and 
modify LHS research resources and techniques to address the needs of the rehabilitation research community 
and priorities of the LHS Innovation Hub stakeholders. While we know from experience and anecdote that LHS 
competencies are lacking across rehabilitation disciplines, we do not know the extent of these gaps or how 
they differ across disciplines. We will engage a multidisciplinary expert panel to inform development of a 
survey to assess key competencies within the seven LHS research domains. The survey, distributed across 
rehabilitation research disciplines, will assess knowledge gaps and priority areas to target with didactic training. 
The survey will be re-administered in Years 3 and 5 to assess LeaRRN’s impact and guide future activities. 
Needs identified in Aim 1 will be prioritized by LHS Innovation Hub partners, and the results will be used to 
guide development of Use Case Examples and other resources that will be linked to the resources and 
activities of the Didactic component for dissemination. The work of the Techniques Development component 
will bridge the gap between content knowledge and application by identifying and prioritizing the needs of the 
rehabilitation research community and developing techniques and resources to address these needs."
10843221,"PROJECT SUMMARY 
The Pilot Studies Component identifies, supports and advances high quality, state-of-the-art proposals to 
promote awardees’ competitive applications for federally funded, priority LHS rehabilitation research. The 
specific aims of the Pilot Studies Program are to: 1) solicit, review, and fund meritorious applications essential 
for generating preliminary data to support long-term funding streams in the development and advancement of 
innovative rehabilitation practices and 2) provide early, frequent and continuous scientific and practice-driven 
mentoring and administrative oversight to pilot awardees to ensure their long-term sustainable funding. We will 
elicit and fund pilot studies from rehabilitation investigators across the country, enabling them to obtain 
preliminary data, technical skills and the guidance needed to design, evaluate and implement learning health 
systems (LHS) research projects. Selection of pilot studies for funding will emphasize projects that have high 
relevance to the LeaRRN’s theme(s) and give preference to investigators outside of the LeaRRN’s home 
institutions to broaden and deepen the network of independent researchers. The pilot grant review process will 
not only focus on the novelty and quality of the research and investigator, but also on its practical implications 
in hastening the translation of evidence into practice (i.e. significance) within the learning health system and 
the investigators’ likelihood of garnering further federal funding (i.e. sustainability). We will follow a rigorous 
stakeholder engaged process to identify questions and topics of high priority to health systems, pair the most 
promising applicants with mentors and health systems to develop proposals that target these priorities and 
solicit letters of intent. The Stakeholder engagement activities early in the project period, as well as annually 
thereafter, will deliver a list of high priority questions and topics. From this list, we will connect suitable 
researchers and learning health systems to address specific questions under a priority area and support their 
development of the pilot grant application. The LeaRRN Executive Committee will select the most meritorious 
proposals through an NIH-style, rigorous peer review. For funded pilots we will track progress through six 
month and 12 month progress reports to ensure successful launch, ensure safety and protection of human 
subjects and mediate potential challenges or pitfalls in time to redirect the project to a successful end. We will 
track all deliverables counted as presentations, publications and subsequent funding and evaluate whether the 
LHS successfully adopted or modified practice as a result of this collaboration. We have identified one pilot 
study to be funded in this first year of the award to ensure a quick and effective start to our work. Drs. Theresa 
Shireman and Linda Resnik will oversee the Pilot Studies Program. The mentored Pilot Studies Program is a 
vital testing ground for talented researchers to work directly with health systems and mentors to fine tune LHS 
rehabilitation research projects. Small, early successes strengthen skills and knowledge and will lead to better 
targeted research proposals for future innovation in rehabilitation research."
10843223,"PROJECT SUMMARY 
The Promotion of Center Expertise Component will develop and implement a variety of activities to promote 
interest in LeaRRN and LHS research in rehabilitation. The specific aims of this Component are to: 1) 
coordinate the development and dissemination of all products (manuscripts, abstracts and reports), training 
and resource materials and training opportunities to engage target audiences; 2) facilitate dissemination of 
news, announcements and findings resulting from LeaRRN activities to target audiences through Newsletters, 
press-releases and email marketing and social-media campaigns; 3) oversee the establishment of a Center 
website that highlights activities, resources and dissemination activities and is designed to provide users with 
easy access to content targeted to meet their LHS learning needs; and 4) assist in recruitment of Pilot 
applicants, LHS Scholars and in promotion activities for webinars, grand rounds, Institutes as well consultative 
services at national conferences and ensure that target audiences are engaged. This component will be led by 
Drs. Mary Slavin and Linda Resnik and will be assisted by the Program Manager at Brown University and the 
Program Assistant at BU. Dr Resnik will insure that dissemination and recruitment efforts are comprehensive 
and timely. Dr. Slavin will leverage resources within the Boston University’s College of Communications, 
including AdLAB, a faculty mentored, student run advertising agency to develop effective communication 
products. BU Productions, a professional production company located at BU, will support our webcasts and 
post-production development to yield high-quality videos to archive. The Promotion of Center Expertise 
Component will publicize LeaRRN activities and resources, and develop web-based resources (e.g., archive 
webinars, webcasts) to engage the medical rehabilitation community the LeaRRN activities and resources. 
This Component will also disseminate research and presentations resulting from activities conducted by 
LeaRRN LHS Scholars and the Pilots and Techniques Components. LeaRRN recognizes the need to increase 
the diversity of the rehabilitation research workforce and will make a concerted effort to expand our 
connections to members of the rehabilitation community that have not typically been engaged in research 
activities. Our promotion and outreach activities will target persons with disability, and those from underserved 
regions with limited opportunities to participate in our Institutes, Pilot and LHS Scholar program. A significant 
advantage of our approach is that we will be engaging frontline clinicians as an important part of the research 
endeavor. Outreach activities will ensure that LeaRRN has a sustained, powerful influence on the broader 
rehabilitation community."

will be facilitated through regular meetings of component and LHS Innovation Hub members. Successful 
collaborations across Brown University, University of Pittsburgh and Boston University will result in an 
unparalleled national LHS rehabilitation research resource. The involvement of LHS Innovation Hub health 
system partners throughout the research planning, implementation, and dissemination process will help ensure 
that LeaRRN research is valued and translated into clinical care."
10865060,"PROJECT SUMMARY
More than one third of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) develop ICU delirium, an acute, fluctuating form
of cognitive dysfunction that is associated with increased mortality, and longer ICU lengths of stay and days of
mechanical ventilation; and disproportionately increases the risk for long-term cognitive impairment. Disrupted
sleep in the ICU is thought to contribute to development of ICU delirium, however the sleep-delirium
relationship has not been rigorously investigated. Although ICU patients maintain adequate sleep duration per
24 hours, sleep architecture is severely disrupted. Namely, there is a marked decrease in rapid eye movement
(REM) sleep compared to healthy adults. Insufficient REM sleep has been associated with neurodegenerative
disease such as dementia, which has similar characteristics to ICU delirium. Less REM sleep has been
observed in patients with, compared to without ICU delirium, although the temporality is unclear. To date, few
studies have investigated sleep prior to development of ICU delirium, and no studies account for objective
baseline sleep. We propose a novel approach to address these critical gaps by leveraging a population of
thoracic surgery candidates with a planned post-operative ICU admission to enable baseline sleep evaluation.
Research: The K99 phase study will evaluate clinical and demographic predictors of percentage of days with
ICU delirium or coma (DoDC) in the acute ICU phase (days 1 up to 14) in a retrospective electronic health
record study of thoracic surgery patients (N=4,849) at the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS)
from 2015-present. As sleep is not routinely assessed in the ICU, it is not possible to evaluate sleep from
medical records. Therefore, we will first identify non-sleep predictors of ICU delirium to then be able to evaluate
if sleep indices measured in future studies explains a substantial percentage of the variance in ICU delirium not
accounted for by non-sleep predictors. The R00 phase study will evaluate the difference in mean minutes of
REM sleep per night for patients with and without ICU delirium in a prospective observational cohort study of
thoracic surgery candidates from UPHS (N=148). Sleep will be assessed using wireless
electroencephalography at baseline (pre-ICU), and post-operatively in the ICU for 3 days each. In a subset of
the R00 cohort (N=20), frequency of awakenings from sleep due to the ICU environment will be assessed.
Results from these studies will be used to inform development of future sleep-promoting interventions.
Training: To achieve overall career goals, the training plan will build upon the candidate’s background in
critical care and sleep in healthy individuals by affording her in-depth training in learning about sleep in clinical
and ICU populations, and training in ICU delirium mechanisms and development of predictive models. This
training will also include advancing her scientific dissemination skills, as well as development of the skills
needed to become a leader in the scientific community. A variety of approaches will be used to achieve these
goals including formal coursework, hands-on training, and structured one-on-one mentorship."

to divide and proliferate. We mainly f ocus on how bacteria such as E. coli achieve the daunting task of
themselves in two at the right time (once their genetic material is duplicated) and place (exactly in the
every 20 minutes. The keys to this s uccess are ancient versions of protein polymers of actin (FtsA)
tubulin (FtsZ), which our lab visualized for the first time in living bacteria over 25 years ago. Today, we
state of the art super-resolution imaging along with molecular genetics, protein biochemistry, interaction
and in vitro reconstitution, to gain more detailed insights into the structure and regulation of these
polymers and their associated proteins, which comprise the dynamic membrane-associated
 nanomachine (the divisome) that divides bacterial cells. Our early characterization of hypermorphic
of FtsA and FtsZ paved the way for a model, now strongly supported by numerous studies, that the E.
divisome initially assembles in an inactive form, then becomes activated mainly by changes in protein
and oligomeric state. Nonetheless, many f t he mechanisms that trigger and respond to these
and oligomeric changes remain unclear. In the last grant period, we used our expertise in
cellular imaging, and in vivo crosslinking to discover novel and physiologically significant protein-
interactions among essential divisome proteins and develop new tools to study their function. As a
we overturned several long-established assumptions about how FtsA, FtsZ and t heir binding partners
and function. In addition, in collaborative studies we explored the ability of FtsZ to form l iquid-liquid
condensates, which have the potential to transform how we think about the divisome and its response
stress. In this proposal, we plan to continue our investigation of the cellular implications of molecular-scale
using the E. coli divisome as the model but also expanding our studies of the divisome of Bacillus
, the predominant Gram-positive model. We will address the most pressing questions about bacterial
division, which include how protein-protein interactions and switches in protein conformation and
 tate sequentially trigger setup and assembly of the divisome; (2) how a third stage, synthesis of
division eptum, is licensed and activated; (3) how the divisome interfaces with chromosome segregation
cell wall synthesis. As we have done extensively in the past and in the last grant period, we will leverage
approaches with collaborations. Our ongoing investigation of how the simplest ells divide continues to
greater understanding of how an entire cell functions and reproduces. Having an accurate map of that
dynamic infrastructure will allow predictions to be made about how it works, and how to disrupt it.

Biological macromolecules exhibit an amazing degree of conformational heterogeneity as required for their
various functions. This heterogeneity is inherent in almost all biological macromolecules and is influenced by
interactions with ions, solutes, and other macromolecules. An understanding of the conformational properties
of macromolecules and their structure-function relationships is essential to facilitate drug discovery. To this
end, our laboratory has focused on a comprehensive research program that includes optimizing and extending
empirical atomic force fields for biological and drug-like molecules, developing novel conformational and
solute sampling methods and applying those tools in collaborative studies on systems of biological and
therapeutic relevance. Biological systems to be studied include the role of Mg2+ ions in RNA folding and on
conformational ensembles of RNA, glycan conformational properties and the role of glycoproteins in immune
response involving antibodies (Ab) and Fcγ receptors such as FcγRIIIa and FcεRIγ. Interactions between Ab Fc
and FcγRIIIa and interactions between Fcγ receptors will be investigated to reveal their contribution towards
intracellular phosphorylation and downstream signaling. Methods developments will further optimize and
extend the additive (nonpolarizable) CHARMM36 and polarizable classical Drude oscillator force fields (FF).
Work on the additive FF will involve the explicit optimization of the off-diagonal Lennard-Jones (LJ) terms to
overcome limitations in the use of combining rules. Drude FF work will involve extending the coverage of
chemical space including non-standard amino acids, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates, as well as drug-like
molecules in the context of the Drude General Force Field (DGenFF). In addition, advances in the accuracy of
the Drude FF will include improved treatment of off-diagonal LJ and non-bonded Thole shielding interactions,
improved treatment of ions in biological systems, and additional optimization of the protein and nucleic acid
parameters of the FF targeting the equilibrium between folded and unfolded states of peptides and short
oligonucleotides. This optimization will use enhanced sampling to facilitate generation of conformational
ensembles required to apply parameter reweighting approaches. Improved conformational sampling of
macromolecules will be achieved using generative deep neural nets (DNN) for the identification of reaction
coordinates in conjunction with metadynamics as well as non-equilibrium simulation methods targeting
specific degrees of freedom with emphasis on oligonucleotides and polysaccharides. Our solute sampling
approach based on the oscillating chemical potential μex Grand-Canonical Monte Carlo/Molecular Dynamics
method will be extended to large systems (> 1 million atoms) through efficient use of GPUs, improved
treatment of long-range interactions, and the use of the polarizable Drude FF. These developments will be
implemented in the site-identification of ligand competitive saturation (SILCS) method to estimate pH
dependence of ligand binding, the role of water in drug binding, and ligand koff rates."
10841235,"There is now extensive evidence that cellular senescence drives age-related bone loss and multiple other aging
co-morbidities. Characteristics of senescent cells include increased expression of p16Ink4a and p21Cip1 as well as
resistance to apoptosis. In previous work, we have systematically identified senescent cells in the bone
microenvironment and demonstrated a causal role, specifically for p16+ senescent cells, in mediating age-
related bone loss in mice. It is becoming clear, however, that p16+ cells in the bone microenvironment are a
heterogeneous population, and a better understanding of this heterogeneity is critical to developing new
approaches to target these cells and prevent age-related bone loss, along with ameliorating other aging co-
morbidities. To facilitate this, we have recently developed and validated multiparametric single-cell protein
analysis by cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) to perform a deep characterization of p16+ cells in mice. These
studies identified a specific sub-population of p16+ cells that are growth-arrested (Ki67-) and express high levels
of senescent-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) markers as well as the anti-apoptosis protein, BCL-2
(p16+/Ki67-/BCL-2+, “p16KB” cells), thus meeting all of the criteria for defining a senescent cell. Interestingly,
we also identified non-senescent p16+/Ki67+ cells that express a SASP unique from that of the p16KB cells.
These proliferating, inflammatory p16+ cells have also been identified by others in the lung using a highly
sensitive p16Ink4a reporter, yet the role of this population in aging remains unclear. Taken together, these findings
lead to the hypothesis that p16KB cells are truly senescent, while p16+/Ki67+ cells are inflammatory cycling
cells, and perhaps “pre-senescent.” However, the role of each population in driving age-related disease remains
unclear and Aim 1 proposes to characterize these populations in detail. In additional studies, we have developed
and validated a novel mouse model, p16-LOX-ATTAC, capable of temporal- and cell-specific senescent cell
clearance. Using these mice, we found that in contrast to global clearance of senescent cells using the (p16)INK-
ATTAC model, clearance specifically of senescent osteocytes only partially replicated the beneficial skeletal
effects of global senescent cell clearance, indicating an important role for other cells in the bone
microenvironment in contributing to skeletal aging. Consistent with this, our CyTOF analyses have identified a
novel p16+, highly inflammatory (SASP+) CD24high osteolineage population (negative for stem cell markers, e.g.,
Sca-1, CD200) in aged mice that, along with the late osteoblast/osteocytic cells, is robustly cleared by senolytic
interventions. These studies indicate that although osteocyte senescence clearly contributes to age-related bone
loss, p16+, CD24high osteolineage cells are also potential candidate cells that mediate skeletal aging and thus
need to be further characterized, as proposed in Aim 2. Thus, the overall goal of our application is to leverage
our novel tools and mouse models in order to better define the mechanisms driving cellular senescence in the
bone microenvironment and to characterize the key senescent cell populations that contribute to skeletal aging."

Board. The Administrative Core leverages the abundant and outstanding resources at UCSF and in the
University of California to accomplish these goals, creating synergies that benefit musculoskeletal investigators
and the scientific community more broadly. The ability of CCMBM to deliver high quality professional core
services in an innovative, responsive, and cost-effective manner benefits immensely from the UCSF Research
Resource Program, which organizes systems for the management of Core services and finances and training
for Core staff. We also plan to build on the developed UCSF-based CCMBM foundation to expand, integrate,
and support a sustainable, diverse community of MSK investigators throughout the University of California
system. As such, the activities of the Administrative Core not only support the CCMBM but are the cornerstone
for the integrated musculoskeletal ecosystem at UCSF, and increasingly at a regional level."
10843659,"SUMMARY
As musculoskeletal research advances and state-of-the-art tools evolve, investigators face new demands for
data management and analysis, and they seek resources for translating preclinical discovery to humans. The
Epidemiology, Bioinformatics, and Study Design (EBSD) Core will address those demands, thereby
enhancing research productivity. It will do this by providing unique epidemiologic resources that encourage
collaborations between basic, translational, and clinical researchers. The Core will guide researchers, make
critical connections, and support use of analytic and other consultative resources, in part through the creation of
crucial educational tools. The Core will thus ensure the rigor and reproducibility of the research conducted.
The EBSD Core will build on its achievements to date, maintaining successful programs while adding new,
innovative initiatives such as stimulating cross-cutting research on the genetics and genomics of musculoskeletal
traits. First, the core will facilitate access to and use of large osteoporosis and osteoarthritis longitudinal
databases from multicenter observational studies and randomized trials coordinated by UCSF, including rich
associated biological and imaging resources (Aim 1). With these resources, the EBSD Core will enable
researchers to test hypotheses about pathogenesis, risk factors, and the course of bone and joint disease.
Proposed expanded offerings will particularly encourage translational discovery, with data and tools for genetic
and genomic analyses of musculoskeletal traits, research on aging and muscle, and cutting-edge research using
artificial intelligence or new technologies. Second, the EBSD Core will provide individualized consultative
services to musculoskeletal researchers, as it has done for over 120 projects and proposals in the current P30
award period (Aim 2). Core directors and faculty will advise researchers through one-on-one consultations
(directly or leveraging other existing UCSF resources), through EBSD-run work-in-progress groups, and through
the embedding of an EBSD Core faculty member within a clinical department. A novel pathway for consultative
guidance will help investigators navigate resources—particularly existing UCSF bioinformatics resources, for
which demand is increasing precipitously. Third, the EBSD Core aims to educate the musculoskeletal research
community (Aim 3). The core will create an online musculoskeletal-focused wayfinding and educational tool to
equip researchers, across all research methodologies, who have diverse analytical needs ranging from spatial
proteomics to image segmentation algorithms. The core will also leverage existing UCSF educational resources,
providing guidance about formal course offerings and continuing medical education. In accomplishing these
aims, the EBSD Core will serve musculoskeletal researchers across the bench-to-bedside continuum, enhancing
productivity and stimulating collaborations to facilitate translational discovery."
10843660,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of the Imaging Core is to provide state-of-the-art, customized image acquisition, reconstruction, and
quantitative analysis for pre-clinical (tissue samples and animal models) and clinical (in vivo human)
musculoskeletal research. These will include pre-clinical and clinical: 1) acquisition and reconstruction of
MRI/MRSI, PET, SPECT, CT, DXA, and optical tomography data; 2) spatial registration of multi-modality
images; 3) extraction of quantitative information concerning biologically relevant image parameters; and 4)
evaluation of the relationships of these imaging-derived parameters to biochemistry, histology, biomechanics,
and physiology of biological systems interacting with the musculoskeletal system. Many of these procedures
are novel and require specialized knowledge of imaging physics, mathematics, and computer science.
Investigators linked to the Imaging Core have extensive experience in these imaging and quantitative analysis
techniques and will work closely with CCMBM investigators to match and/or develop the best imaging and data
processing methods to their specific research questions.
Innovation and Service: Goal is to provide unique tools utilizing novel image acquisition and image processing
technologies to support and accelerate research and investigation of musculoskeletal biology and diseases.
Aim 1: To develop, maintain, and support state-of-the-art quantitative image acquisition and reconstruction
methods for pre-clinical and human musculoskeletal tissues.
Aim 2: To develop novel image processing and quantitative analysis techniques, implement robust measures
for clinical grading of musculoskeletal images, provide software packages for post-processing, visualization,
and quantitative analysis of images, and to provide templates and training to improve access to analysis tools.
Aim 3: To provide interpretation of imaging data from single and serial imaging examinations, and assess links
to the extracted biochemical, histological, and biomechanical measures, and the relevant clinical or
experimental endpoints.
Education and Dissemination: Goal will be to promote development and adoption of state-of- the-art imaging
methodology in musculoskeletal research.
Aim 4: To enable efficient CCMBM member access to clinical and research imaging services, as well as
resources to support computational analysis of imaging data, by providing web portal access to detailed
descriptions for resources and services, current contact details, and process information.
Aim 5: To perform proactive outreach to attract new users and to provide imaging seminars, workshops, and
facilities tours that will introduce new imaging tools and new image processing capabilities to the CCMBM
community, with particular focus on supporting early-stage investigators."

The UCSF Core Center for Musculoskeletal Biology and Medicine Skeletal Biology and Biomechanics (SBB)
Core supports a large and robust research base of investigators. This diverse group of basic and clinical
investigators has made major contributions to the understanding of musculoskeletal health and disease.
However, the ongoing research efforts by these and other investigators remain insufficient to prevent the rapidly
increasing occurrence of many acquired musculoskeletal diseases in our aging population. Thus, acceleration
of research that advances the prevention and treatment of skeletal diseases is urgently needed. Solutions will
require a more systems-based approach with integrated research strategies and investigator communities. To
meet this challenge, the SBB Core facilitates musculoskeletal research at UCSF by providing integrated, cost
effective, and efficient access to rigorous musculoskeletal biology and biomechanics services. The SBB Core
serves and cultivates the musculoskeletal research community across multiple campuses and disciplines by
offering users seamless access to services, with Core sites at the two main UCSF campuses, easy digital
conferencing, and events at multiple locations. The successful implementation of the SBB Core is anticipated to
not only reduce research expenses and increase data output, rigor, and reproducibility, but also to produce
robust in-depth analyses of human samples and animal models through integration of different aspects of
musculoskeletal biology and biomechanics. The Core’s adoption of sophisticated and powerful large-scale
ensemble as well as spatially defined, cell-specific transcriptomic and proteomic profiling will streamline
quantitative analyses of musculoskeletal tissues to complement and encourage the much-needed application of
big data approaches to this field. Through training and education, the SBB Core will continue to promote the
entry of new investigators to the field, and it will foster a community of versatile musculoskeletal researchers with
a broad set of skills and critical thinking."
10841266,"This application represents a new Clinical Research Center consortium that will strengthen the Pediatric Heart
Network. Over the last seven years, Cincinnati Children’s (CCHMC) and the University of Kentucky (UK) have
built The Joint Pediatric and Adult Congenital Heart Program, a collaborative “one program, two site” model of
care within our distinctive region of the United States. The clinical program spans areas of Ohio, Kentucky,
Indiana, and West Virginia which includes a large portion of Appalachia. Our population experiences significant
health outcome disparities with the rural and remote members of our communities often most affected. Such
disparities are seen daily in our clinics and inpatient units, motivating this application. During the time our clinical
program has matured, CCHMC has been a highly productive member of the Pediatric Heart Network and the
National Heart Lung and Blood Institute’s Bench-to-Bassinet program, bringing experience that will facilitate the
integration of this consortium into the PHN. The Joint Heart Program’s large, combined clinical volume of patients
will strengthen the previously outstanding enrollment of the CCHMC site. Our current role as vascular and MRI
core lab, and single IRB for the Network, bring added value. Important to the next iteration of the PHN, the Joint
Heart Program has prioritized data science and data integration, partnering with broader institutional resources
to enable transdisciplinary research that generates new understanding of health and disease while informing
novel therapies that improve clinical outcomes for all affected patients and families. Furthermore, the Joint Heart
Program will bring diversity to the research through the following: 1) program structure with institutional partners
of different size and perspective, 2) a clinical population that is includes a rural and remote population often not
involved in such research, 3) institutional commitment, existing infrastructure, and local expertise to develop
partnerships with underrepresented and special populations in our region. The latter is enabled by extensive
community engagement resources and research outreach capacity supported by two CTSAs with an established
collaborative regional relationship. In Aim 1, we will accelerate scientific discovery and improve clinical outcomes
by leveraging our proven expertise in multicenter research, data science, and data integration including pediatric
learning health networks, clinical registries, and large translational datasets. In Aim 2, we will reduce inequity in
outcomes for CHD and childhood acquired heart diseases by fostering diversity of both research teams and
participants. In Aim 3, we will cultivate a new generation of pediatric and adult congenital researchers through a
strong transdisciplinary training platform that emphasizes diversity and inclusion within mentors and mentees.
We are eager to collaborate with the clinical centers, data coordinating center, NHLBI staff, industry partners,
and broader CHD and acquired pediatric heart disease communities to address the most important problems
facing affected children and their families."
10843959,"Project Summary/Abstract
Stiffness of the large elastic central arteries (e.g., aorta and carotids) increases with advancing
age and is a robust predictor of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) events among older
adults. The age-related increase in central artery stiffness is associated with a concomitant rise
in systolic blood pressure (BP) and pulse pressure (PP) and subsequently the development of
isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) in many older adults. Consequently, higher PP results in
greater pulsatile pressure and flow penetrating into high blood flow organs such as the brain
causing subclinical target organ damage. Sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) also increases with
advancing age and is associated with cardiovascular target organ damage including left
ventricular hypertrophy and intima-medial thickness (IMT) of peripheral conduit arteries, but it
remains unclear whether enhanced SNA modulates the age-related increase in central artery
stiffness and associated augmented carotid pressure and flow pulsatility and increased IMT.
Therefore, the objectives of this application are to 1) determine the contribution of SNA to the
age-related increase in aortic stiffness and reduced carotid compliance, and augmented carotid
pressure and flow pulsatility and IMT among older adults with ISH, and 2) determine the
effectiveness of chronic inhibition of SNA for reducing large artery stiffness, carotid pressure
and flow pulsatility and IMT among older adults with ISH. In Aim 1, we will enroll 30 older (age
60-85 years) adults (50% women/50% men) with untreated stage 1 or stage 2 ISH (systolic BP
130-159 mmHg; diastolic BP <90mmHg) in a repeated measures experimental study assessing
aortic stiffness (carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, PWV) and carotid artery compliance and
pressure pulsatility index at baseline and during -15 and -30 mmHg of lower body negative
pressure. We hypothesize that acute experimental elevations in SNA will result in transient
increases in carotid-femoral PWV and decreases in carotid compliance resulting in higher
carotid pressure and flow pulsatility. In Aim 2, we will enroll 78 healthy older men and women
(age 60-85 years) with untreated or treated ISH in a randomized, placebo-controlled double
blind study. We hypothesize that 4 weeks of chronic SNA inhibition with oral clonidine will result
in clinically meaningful decreases in aortic stiffness and increases in carotid artery compliance,
causing significant reductions in carotid pressure and flow pulsatility index and IMT. The
proposed research will fundamentally advance our understanding of the regulation of large
elastic artery stiffness by SNA among older humans with ISH, and provide valuable insight into
SNA as a novel therapeutic target among older adults with ISH for lowering CVD risk."
10843963,"Abstract
Since Ramon y Cajal, neuroscientists have speculated that even the most complex brain functions might even-
tually be understood at the level of neuronal cell types and their connections. More recently, while we have be-
gun to understand cell types and their wiring principles in cortical circuits of rodents, we are still in infancy in
understanding the circuit organization of the primate cortex at the level of cell types and their connections,
slowing progress toward a circuit-level mechanistic understanding of complex cognitive capabilities of pri-
mates. For instance, the human cortex houses two unique morphotypes, von Economo neurons (VENs) and
fork cells, which are concentrated in the cortical regions that support complex social cognitive abilities and self-
awareness. For a long time, the VENs and fork cells are believed to be unique to human and great apes, and
thus are hypothesized to be the neural correlate of consciousness and human-like complex social behaviors.
Despite their importance, their functions are deemed to be experimentally intractable given their exclusive re-
striction to hominids. A recent study, however, provides compelling evidence that these unique morphotypes
are also present in the anterior insula (AI) of macaque monkeys, providing an unprecedented opportunity for
functional characterization of these novel neurons in the laboratory. Here, by partnering with a Chinese primate
research laboratory to leverage the abundant macaque resources and lower cost of single-cell RNA-
sequencing (scRNA-seq) in China, we propose to take this opportunity to dissect out the cortical circuit of mon-
key AI and characterize these novel cell types in terms of electrophysiology, morphology, transcriptome, and
connectivity. By taking advantage of a novel set of cost-effective, high-throughput approaches, including large-
scale droplet-based scRNA-seq, Patch-seq, and multi-cell patch recordings, we aim to identify and character-
ize all the cell types that comprise monkey AI with molecular, spatial and functional annotations. Particularly,
this comprehensive interrogation of macaque cortical circuit will lead to a detailed, functional characterization
of VENs and FCs for the first time. Importantly, by complementing the strength and unique resources of two
collaborating labs in USA and in China, we expect to accomplish this otherwise infeasible, costly primate re-
search at this scale within a reasonable budget and time period, providing unprecedented knowledge and re-
source for the field to understand the emergence of human-like social intelligence and related neuropsychiatric
disorders. Particularly, identifying the specific marker genes for those novel cell types will promote the field to
develop genetically targeted tools for studying human-like social cognitive abilities in the context of behaviors.
With all information and tools available, our understanding of human intelligence, previously perceived as ex-
perimentally intractable and largely speculative, will finally gain solid ground and are ready to take off in the
near future."
10828748,"Axonal transport is essential to development and function of the nervous system. Axonal transport
relies on motor proteins (kinesins and dynein) to move protein, membrane and RNA cargos along microtubules.
It is especially important to long and often highly branched axons that requires building blocks made in the cell
body or signals received at axonal terminals to be transported for long distance. Recently studies have
identified many regulatory mechanisms, including the interactions between motor proteins with lattice-bound
microtubule associated proteins (MAPs), in different axonal regions. However, how axonal transport is
regulated to steer cargos into and out of branches is not well understood. This is an outstanding problem as
axonal branches are present throughout the nervous system. They not only define neuronal shape, but also
control synaptic connectivity and specificity, influence structural plasticity, and promote functional regeneration
after injury. The proposed study will tackle this under-studied problem by building on our long-term interest in
branch morphogenesis and cytoskeleton regulation as well as a recent discovery of a MAP in branch
development and transport regulation. Our preliminary data showed that transport at branch junctions is highly
selective as cargos are preferentially transported into growing branches. In addition, we also found that MAP7,
a MAP that is localized to branch junctions and interacts with the plus end motor kinesin-1, influences transport
behavior and branch growth. We thus hypothesize that axonal transport at branch junctions is controlled by a
selective routing mechanism that is mediated by specific motor-MAP interactions. To test this hypothesis, we
will: 1) establish a functional link between selective transport and branch growth; 2) dissect the mechanism
mediated by MAP7; and 3) establish selective routing as a common feature in axonal transport. By focusing
on an important region of the axon that has not been studied in the past, these studies will not only fill in a gap
in our understanding of axonal transport, but also provide new insights into synaptic development and function.
Given the importance of axonal transport in many neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, and the
association of MAP7 and kinesin-1 with epilepsy and ALS, our proposed studies of a basic neuronal cell
biological problem will provide new knowledge to uncover disease mechanisms, and thus are highly relevant to
the NIH mission to understand and enhance human health."
10828905,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Society is facing one of the largest public health challenges in its history - the growth of the population of
older adults and increasing morbidity due to chronic serious illness. Over the next decades, most physicians
will be caring for seriously ill older adults with physical and psychological symptom distress; progressive
functional dependence and frailty; high family support needs; and escalating health care resource use. Indeed,
the number of older adults with multiple chronic conditions is expected to increase by more than a third
between 2000 and 2030 and those with dementia will nearly double. Abundant evidence suggests that the
advanced stages of disease for most are characterized by inadequately treated physical distress; fragmented
care systems; poor communication between doctors, patients, and families; and strains on family caregivers.
 The philanthropically funded National Palliative Care Research Center (NPCRC) has served as a
collaborative mechanism for promoting interdisciplinary geriatric palliative care research since 2006. NPCRC
was established to promote and develop palliative care research across the U.S. It addressed the National
Academy of Medicine's recommendations to support a “cadre of experts whose numbers and talents are
sufficient to: a) supply leadership for scientifically-based and practically useful medical education; and b)
organize and conduct clinical, behavioral, and health services research for patients with serious and chronic
illness.” The NPCRC, in collaboration with NIA, has established priorities for palliative care research, enhanced
its evidence base, developed a new generation of researchers in palliative care, and created a national
community of scientists. NPCRC has funded 100 interdisciplinary investigators (54 in aging research) from 46
institutions and 21 states along the continuum from junior to senior faculty and engaged in a broad spectrum of
research dedicated to improving quality of life for persons living with serious illness.
 Our novel, research platform now forms the basis of our current R33 proposal to expand and enhance this
research infrastructure. We will establish a new network of geriatric palliative care research trainees through
collaboration across the palliative care focused post-doctoral programs in the U.S. For early-stage
investigators, we will lead a research technical assistance program encompassing workshops and webinars on
advanced statistical research methods, a grant writing (i.e., NIH K and R01 applications) skills workshop, and a
grant review program. We will support new initiatives in dementia and population-based research and training.
For experienced investigators, we will support the development and conduct of multisite collaborative geriatric
palliative care research by supporting networking and project start-up meetings leading to multisite studies
focusing on NIA research priorities in geriatric palliative care. Our proposal will advance research infrastructure
that has successfully leveraged the NPCRC as the collaborative vehicle for interdisciplinary partnerships for
geriatric palliative care research for trainees, junior, and experienced investigators across the U.S."
10828909,"Project Summary/Abstract
How the identical genome sequence produces diverse cell types during development remains a fundamental
question in biology. Recent technology advancements in single-cell genomics provided excellent opportunities
to study the molecular profiles during development and in disease at unprecedented resolution. However,
monitoring individual modalities from single cells at a time runs the risk of obtaining only partial pictures from the
complex regulatory network. Multi-modal single-cell genomics tools would be desired to overcome this limitation.
I recently invented a method for ultra-high-throughput joint analysis of open chromatin and transcriptome from
the same single cells (Paired-seq) and demonstrated its potential for comprehensive investigations of the cell-
type-specific regulatory programs from heterogenous brain tissues. In this K99/R00 application, I propose to
further develop a set of new single-cell multi-omics tools to study the dynamic and cell-type-specific regulatory
circuits during mammalian development. I will improve the sensitivities and coverages of Paired-seq and develop
a computational method for single-cell multi-omics analysis from the phenotypic level (Aim1). Subsequently, I
will further develop a method for high-throughput single-cell joint analysis of histone modifications/transcription
factors binding with gene expression (Paired-tag) for analysis of molecular programs from the mechanistic level
(Aim2). Finally, I will apply these technologies to study the dynamic and cell-type-specific molecular programs in
mammalian developing germ cells, and to identify and validate novel regulators during this process (Aim3).
Overall, the results from this proposal will provide new technologies for the study of epigenetic programs in
complex tissues and during development at single-cell resolution, and providing more complete views of the
gene regulatory circuits during mammalian germ cell development. My career goal is to lead an independent
research group focusing on integrating novel experimental and computational technologies to understand the
underlying principles controlling mammalian development. During the K99 phase, I will continue to receive
experimental and computational training from my postdoctoral mentor Dr. Ren and collaborators/advisory
committee at UC San Diego and the Salk Institute. The rigorous mentored support and results obtained in the
K99 phase will facilitate my transition to an independent investigator in the R00 phase and lay the foundation for
my future career."
10828917,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) represents a dominant force in bacterial evolution, however its role in shaping
the evolutionary processes in eukaryotic genomes has been a subject of intense debate. Class Bdelloidea of the
phylum Rotifera, a large invertebrate taxon comprising close to 500 described species, has so far withstood any
challenges questioning the massive amounts of HGT from non-metazoan sources reported in their genomes,
and remain the record-holders among Metazoa with regard to the proportion of foreign genes, with HGT
candidates comprising at least 8% of all coding sequences. Many of them have acquired spliceosomal introns
and occur in quartets, which is indicative of their arrival prior to whole-genome duplication over 60 million years
ago in the common ancestor of bdelloids. Others apparently represent more recent arrivals, lacking introns and
favoring subtelomeric localization, and may not reach fixation. While the ability to capture and retain foreign
genes has been the distinguishing characteristic of the bdelloid lineage since its divergence from the sister
classes, its continuous dynamics over time has not been analyzed in a systematic fashion, due to the
incompleteness of distal chromosome regions in comparison with the core genome. The ancient HGT events,
which have been maintained by purifying selection throughout the course of bdelloid evolution, can be regarded
as selectively advantageous for the entire taxon, however their molecular function cannot always be inferred on
the basis of homology alone. In this proposal, we seek to investigate both recent and ancient HGT cases, in
aggregate and individually. A glimpse into population-wide distribution of recent HGT cases in Aim 1 is expected
to uncover their short-term adaptive value in processes such as adaptation to dietary preferences or toxic
substances in changing environments and shed light on the mechanisms of their recent acquisition. An in-depth
look into taxon-wide establishment of ancient HGT events from bacteria and fungi, in Aims 2 and 3 respectively,
should clarify the value of these acquisitions for bdelloids and their footprint on their evolutionary history, by
zeroing in on molecular underpinnings of the functional role of these proteins in diverse taxa, including
pathogenic fungi where some of these genes may represent therapeutic targets."
10830310,"Project Summary
PTSD is a highly debilitating and prevalent condition. Although a number of empirically supported interventions
exist, response rates are suboptimal. One factor likely impeding treatment response is poor encoding,
consolidation, and retrieval of the learning that occurs in therapy. Individuals with PTSD exhibit deficits in a
number of cognitive domains related to learning and memory, particularly in the context of trauma-related
stimuli, and pre-treatment memory capacity has consistently been shown to predict PTSD treatment response.
Furthermore, poor memory of therapy content is common and is also associated with worse treatment
outcome. Accordingly, the present study will examine the utility of integrating a Memory Support (MS)
intervention into Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), an empirically supported and widely disseminated
treatment for PTSD. MS was designed to integrate techniques aimed at facilitating encoding, consolidation,
and retrieval of new learning into existing treatments, and has been shown to improve outcomes when
integrated into cognitive therapy for depression. The proposed study will consist of an initial treatment adaption
phase to optimize integration of MS into CPT, followed by a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing CPT
with Memory Support (CPT+MS) to CPT-alone. The primary aim of the trial will be to determine if compared
CPT+MS will lead to greater memory and learning of therapy content relative to CPT-alone (i.e. target
engagement), and to establish the acceptability and feasibility of integration of MS into CPT. Secondary aims
include a preliminary examination of treatment efficacy, as indicated by the magnitude of changes in PTSD
symptoms between conditions, and target validation, as indicated by associations between memory and
learning of therapy content and treatment response. Exploratory analyses will examine several indicators of
baseline memory-related cognitive functioning as predictors of memory and learning of therapy content,
providing preliminary data to inform future research on personalized application of MS. Results of the trial will
advance scientific knowledge about methods for optimizing memory and learning as a mechanism for
improving PTSD treatment outcomes. The proposed research and training plan will facilitate the applicant’s
development into an independent investigator using an experimental therapeutics approach to enhance PTSD
treatment outcomes. Mentorship and training will focus on: 1) mechanisms-focused clinical trial methodology;
2) application of basic learning and memory research to the assessment and improvement of memory during
therapy; 3) treatment development and enhancement; 4) advanced longitudinal data analysis; and 5)
grantsmanship and professional development. Research and training will take place at the National Center for
PTSD at the VA Boston Healthcare System, and will be supported through mentorship from an accomplished
team committed to the applicant’s professional development: Drs. Tara Galovski (primary mentor), Mieke
Verfaellie, Suzanne Pineles and Brian Smith."
10830311,"Emergency Medical Services (EMS) are an essential public resource that operates at the front lines of the
healthcare system for Americans during their most vulnerable times. More than 1.8 million children are
transported to an Emergency Department (ED) by EMS each year in the US, and approximately 90,000 need
immediate intervention and stabilization by EMS providers. However, there are significant deficiencies in the
safety and quality of care. We have found that critical pediatric patients have severe adverse safety events in
23% of calls. Children with respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation and children with cardiac arrest,
arguably two of the highest risk and complex medical conditions, experience severe adverse safety events up
to 60% of the time. Rural areas experience even greater challenges to quality pediatric prehospital care. It is
vital for our EMS system to have a high level of readiness for pediatric emergencies, though serious gaps
remain. One major gap is that there is currently no validated means to evaluate EMS agency readiness for
pediatric emergencies. Such a metric would provide vital data on the current status of our system while
empowering leaders and policymakers with information needed to guide resource allocation. Recent studies
have found that hospital-based EDs with the highest readiness scores have more than threefold lower mortality
rates for children with critical illness and trauma than the least ready EDs. Having a pediatric emergency care
coordinator has also emerged as one of the key elements of ED readiness. Recently, the first technical report
on pediatric readiness in EMS was published, which has created a starting point for scientific investigation that
will enhance policymakers' efforts. Our overall goal is to improve the delivery of safe and high-quality
prehospital care for children that maximizes outcomes. This study will expand on the previous methods used to
measure readiness in hospital-based EDs to rigorously evaluate factors that improve pediatric readiness for
EMS agencies and health outcomes for children. We will incorporate a positive deviance framework to ensure
we develop a broad understanding of readiness from the perspective of field providers. The specific health
outcomes we will evaluate include occurrence of adverse safety events during EMS care, as well as hospital
outcomes specific to the diseases we will evaluate. The EMS system is positioned to improve outcomes for
medical conditions that require immediate stabilization, such as seizures, trauma, cardiac arrest, and
respiratory failure, which are our areas of focus. The specific aims of the study are to 1) derive a score that
reflects the readiness of an EMS agency to care for critically ill children using a modified Delphi process among
subject matter experts, 2) evaluate and refine the score developed in Aim 1 using empiric real-world data and
patient outcomes including adverse safety events from both urban and rural areas, and 3) use qualitative
interviews in a positive deviance framework to identify specific agency activities and attributes among the
highest and lowest performing EMS agencies, in both urban and rural areas."
10830312,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 The overall goal of this proposal is to decipher a novel Ca2+-dependent signaling pathway that protects
the genome in human cells in the presence of DNA replication stress. Replication stress, which can cause DNA
damage and chromosomal instability, is frequently induced by both environmental agents and endogenous
factors (e.g., reactive oxygen species, aldehyde, and oncogene activation). In order to maintain genome stability
cells must protect the replication fork structure upon replication stress to avoid fork collapse and DNA damage.
Defects in fork protection can result in cell death or transformation, which can give rise to cancer, premature
ageing and other diseases. The fork protection mechanisms can also be exploited to sensitize cancer cells to
replication stress-inducing agents during cancer treatment. Despite its critical importance, exactly how
replication forks are protected after replication stress remain an outstanding question. In our effort to address
this fundamental question, we recently discovered a novel Ca2+-dependent signaling pathway that protects
stressed replication fork structure. In addition, we have established multiple components in the pathway,
including CaMKK2, AMPK and Exo1, that act downstream of intracellular Ca2+, which is elevated after replication
stress. Disruption of the pathway causes excessive fork degradation, chromosomal aberrations and
compromised cell viability. Building on this exciting finding and our extensive preliminary results, in this proposal
we describe a series of studies to further delineate this novel fork protection pathway, focusing on the key players
and molecular mechanisms that mediate Ca2+ induction and pathway activation. In Aim 1, we will define a key
ion channel responsible for Ca2+ induction in the replication stress response. Our preliminary results suggest
that TRPV2 is a major ion channel for Ca2+ induction upon replication stress. We will characterize the molecular
functions of TRPV2 in this fork protection pathway and its regulation by a novel interacting protein in the
replication stress response. Aim 2 seeks to define the direct signal for Ca2+ induction after replication stress.
Our preliminary results suggest that cytosolic self-DNA generated after replication stress has a previously
unrecognized role in triggering Ca2+ induction for fork protection. We plan to explore the sources of cytosolic
self-DNA in cells after replication stress. In addition, we will determine whether other cytosolic DNA-inducing
genetic conditions also activate the Ca2+-dependent signaling cascade. In Aim 3, we will elucidate the molecular
mechanisms of TRPV2 activation for Ca2+ induction after replication stress, focusing on the role of cytosolic DNA
sensing and signal transduction. These studies will further establish a novel fork protection signaling pathway
and provide critical insights into the interplay between replication stress, cytosolic DNA sensing and Ca2+
signaling. This project will not only expand our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of genome
maintenance, but also lay a conceptual foundation for the development of more effective cancer therapeutics
targeting the DNA replication stress response."
10830407,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Approximately 1 in 7 women experience perinatal depression (i.e., during pregnancy or the postpartum period),
making it the most common complication of childbirth. Perinatal depression is associated with long-lasting
consequences, including increased risk of suicide, impairments in parenting, and immense societal costs.
Prenatal insomnia is a robust risk factor for perinatal depression: nearly 1 in 4 women who experience prenatal
insomnia develop postpartum depression. To date, depression prevention interventions mainly focus on
pregnant women with elevated depressive symptoms or a history of depression, and no trials have investigated
whether treating prenatal insomnia prevents perinatal depression. Digital cognitive behavior therapy (CBT-I) is
safe and effective for treating prenatal insomnia and shows promise for preventing perinatal depression
relative to standard care. Further, digital CBT-I may be of particular interest for pregnant women because it
minimizes wait time, avoids burdensome traveling and scheduling requirements, and meets their preferences
for flexible delivery options. The proposed project is a blinded randomized controlled trial to evaluate the
efficacy of digital CBT-I for the prevention of depression during pregnancy and through 12 months postpartum
among 498 non-depressed women with insomnia disorder relative to a credible, clinically-relevant control
condition. Consistent with other research, sleep hygiene education will be the control condition, and will match
digital CBT-I in delivery format (digital), frequency (weekly), and number of sessions (six). The proposed
confirmatory efficacy trial addresses three specific aims: 1) To evaluate the efficacy of digital CBT-I for
preventing perinatal depression; 2) To test whether the effect of digital CBT-I on perinatal depression is
mediated through prenatal insomnia symptom improvement; 3) To test whether the effect of digital CBT-I on
perinatal depression is moderated by baseline depressive symptom severity. By focusing on a low stigma
target (i.e., prenatal insomnia) and using a scalable intervention, this approach has the potential to facilitate

perinatal depression for mothers, families, and society."
11056969,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Approximately 1 in 7 women experience perinatal depression (i.e., during pregnancy or the postpartum period),
making it the most common complication of childbirth. Perinatal depression is associated with long-lasting
consequences, including increased risk of suicide, impairments in parenting, and immense societal costs.
Prenatal insomnia is a robust risk factor for perinatal depression: nearly 1 in 4 women who experience prenatal
insomnia develop postpartum depression. To date, depression prevention interventions mainly focus on
pregnant women with elevated depressive symptoms or a history of depression, and no trials have investigated
whether treating prenatal insomnia prevents perinatal depression. Digital cognitive behavior therapy (CBT-I) is
safe and effective for treating prenatal insomnia and shows promise for preventing perinatal depression
relative to standard care. Further, digital CBT-I may be of particular interest for pregnant women because it
minimizes wait time, avoids burdensome traveling and scheduling requirements, and meets their preferences
for flexible delivery options. The proposed project is a blinded randomized controlled trial to evaluate the
efficacy of digital CBT-I for the prevention of depression during pregnancy and through 12 months postpartum
among 498 non-depressed women with insomnia disorder relative to a credible, clinically-relevant control
condition. Consistent with other research, sleep hygiene education will be the control condition, and will match
digital CBT-I in delivery format (digital), frequency (weekly), and number of sessions (six). The proposed
confirmatory efficacy trial addresses three specific aims: 1) To evaluate the efficacy of digital CBT-I for
preventing perinatal depression; 2) To test whether the effect of digital CBT-I on perinatal depression is
mediated through prenatal insomnia symptom improvement; 3) To test whether the effect of digital CBT-I on
perinatal depression is moderated by baseline depressive symptom severity. By focusing on a low stigma
target (i.e., prenatal insomnia) and using a scalable intervention, this approach has the potential to facilitate
broad dissemination. The proposed project has high public health significance for reducing the burden of
perinatal depression for mothers, families, and society."

Glaucoma, a major cause of blindness worldwide, is a significant public health concern. In the U.S., it affects
over 2.7 million people and its prevalence will rise to 7.3 million by 2050. Targeted therapies are needed to
prevent glaucoma or slow its progression. A major risk factor is high intraocular pressure (IOP), typically due to
impaired aqueous humor (AqH) outflow. However, the genes and pathways involved are poorly understood.
We have identified GLIS1, encoding the transcription factor GLIS1, as a susceptibility gene for primary open-
angle glaucoma (POAG) and showed that Glis1–/– mice have pathophysiological hallmarks of glaucoma. We
also found that Glis1 is predominantly expressed in the trabecular meshwork (TM), a key component of the
ocular drainage tissue regulating AqH outflow, and that Glis1–/– mice exhibit progressive TM degeneration,
leading to high IOP, and glaucomatous optic neuropathy—highlighting the relevance of this model for studies
of glaucoma. Our preliminary functional genomic analysis suggested that GLIS1 interacts with GLIS3 and
FOXC1, transcription factors previously implicated in elevated IOP, to regulate gene expression in TM cells.
Moreover, reduced or increased GLIS1 activity can impair the integrity of ocular drainage tissues. Using unique
mouse models, genetic and functional genomic approaches, and in vitro assays, we propose to characterize
the GLIS1-dependent transcriptional regulatory network and determine its role in homeostasis and dysfunction
of ocular drainage tissue. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that increased GLIS1 expression contributes to
POAG-associated ocular drainage tissue defects and determine whether the POAG-associated variants we
identified in GLIS1 enhancer regions increased its transcriptional activity in primary human TM cells. We will
also test whether GLIS1 overexpression in the mouse TM leads to high IOP and ocular drainage tissue defects
similar to those in POAG. Finally, we will assess the potential role of dexamethasone and TGFβ2, previously
implicated in IOP elevation, as upstream regulators of GLIS1. In Aim 2, we will test for potential genetic
interactions between Glis1 and Foxc1 and/or Glis3 in ocular drainage tissue homeostasis. We will determine
whether mice heterozygous for null alleles of both Glis1 and Foxc1 or Glis1 and Glis3 develop TM defects and
altered IOP regulation. In parallel, we will characterize the transcriptional program and molecular pathways
implicated in TM maintenance and function. These studies will provide important mechanistic insight into ocular
drainage tissue homeostasis and dysfunction and could reveal targets for therapies to manage glaucoma."
10834897,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), defined as glucose intolerance first recognized during pregnancy, is a heterogeneous condition and the most common obstetric disorder affecting ~240,000 or ~8% of U.S. pregnant women per year. Fetal exposure to GDM is linked with adverse perinatal outcomes, and higher adiposity, obesity, dysglycemia, and type 2 diabetes during childhood and adolescence. Much less is known about the impact of early postnatal factors [breastfeeding, infant diet including sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), juice, behaviors, sleep habits] on future adiposity and metabolic health of children exposed to GDM in utero, because previous studies have rarely prospectively assessed any early postnatal factors, except current breastfeeding (BF) at birth or age 3 months (Y/N). Thus, it is unknown whether these modifiable early postnatal factors exert persistent effects on future child adiposity and metabolic health independent of fetal exposure to GDM severity and maternal obesity. This represents a major gap for human studies because animal experiments found that manipulation of postnatal nutrition can ameliorate the adverse effects of fetal exposure to maternal diabetes. The Study of Women, Infant Feeding and Type 2 Diabetes after GDM (SWIFT) is a prospective cohort of 1,035 women with GDM [R01HD050625] recruited during pregnancy (within a single integrated healthcare system) and longitudinally assessed at 3 in-person research visits from 6-9 weeks post-delivery (baseline 2008-2011) and annually up to 2 y post-baseline. Each research visit included 2-h 75 g research OGTTs and assessments of maternal anthropometry, lifestyle behaviors, socio-demographics, and health status under standardized protocols. Monthly mailed surveys, phone calls, and 3 in-person study visits prospectively assessed early postnatal factors [breastfeeding duration and intensity, infant diet including sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), fruit juice, sleep habits and temperament]. The study also obtained GDM severity measures (3-h 100 g OGTT, GDM treatment, gestational age at diagnosis), perinatal outcomes, and additional clinical data (mother/child weight, height, diabetes diagnoses, health outcomes) from electronic health records (EHR). SWIFT research data have been supplemented by EHR data since its inception and updated annually during follow up since baseline with excellent cohort retention through 2 y post-baseline and beyond (78% are KP members in 2019). The proposed SWIFT Child Study efficiently leverages the currently funded [R01DK118409] 4th in-person research visit at 10 y post-baseline in SWIFT women (Fall 2019-2022). This represents a time-sensitive opportunity to conduct concurrent research visits in their children at age ~10 y (prior or proximate to puberty) with continued prospective follow up from fetal life through the early postnatal period and beyond. The SWIFT Child Study will be one of the first to measure GDM severity under treatment in relation to child metabolic health, and the first prospective study to rigorously assess the lasting independent influences of key early postnatal factors on growth, adiposity, and metabolic health in youth exposed to maternal GDM in utero."
10834899,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The objective of this application is to test the hypothesis that skin sympathetic nerve activity (SKNA) can be used
as a biomarker for physiological events including predicting neurological recovery during therapeutic
hypothermia for cardiac arrest, and to risk stratify patients for recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) following
catheter ablation. The concept that sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) could be determined from recordings
obtained from the skin originated from studies that have shown that sympathetic tone is important in cardiac
arrhythmogenesis. The research labs at the Krannert Institute of Cardiology have successfully developed
methods to record autonomic nerve activity in ambulatory canine models from either subcutaneous tissues or
on the surface of the skin (SKNA). We found that both subcutaneous nerve activity and SKNA closely correlated
with stellate ganglia nerve activity in ambulatory canine models. SKNA recordings were then validated and
translated to human patients and it was recently documented that sympathetic nerve activity correlates to the
onset of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. In this proposal, we will now apply SKNA recordings to be used as a
biomarker for neurological status in patients that are undergoing targeted temperature management (TTM) for
cardiac arrest and to risk stratify patients for AF recurrence after undergoing ablation therapy.
 There are more than 350,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests taking place every year and they are
associated with poor survival rates, with 31% for shockable rhythms and 11% for all rhythms combined. Anoxic
brain injury accounts for a significant majority of morbidity and mortality in post-cardiac arrest patients. In this
context, TTM is one of the only interventions that has been shown to be neuroprotective and improve neurologic
outcomes after cardiac arrest. Despite this, cerebral ischemia may persist for several hours and an accurate
short-term assessment of neurological outcome in patients undergoing TTM remains a challenge. Significantly
low SKNA or an altered SKNA relationship with heart rate during TTM could signify autonomic dysregulation.
 Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a progressive disease that commonly advances into persistent and then
permanent AF. The longer AF continues, the outcome of any associated therapeutic options becomes less
favorable. Percutaneous catheter ablation is commonly used as a therapy for AF, however recurrence of AF
after ablation remains an issue. With SKNA recordings, we can now visualize and analyze the nerve activity that
can trigger AF, and risk stratify patients for AF recurrence post ablation.
 The purpose of this project is to use SKNA recordings as a biomarker for (1) neurologic outcome in
patients undergoing TTM post-cardiac arrest; (2) to risk stratify patients for AF recurrence after catheter ablation.
This present research grant application is designed to test the hypothesis that SKNA is a useful biomarker and
a potential surrogate end point for future clinical investigations in common cardiovascular diseases, and to
provide new insights into the neural mechanisms of diseases."

A combination of entorhinal, hippocampal, and prefrontal pathology has a pivotal role in most neurological
and neurodegenerative diseases and in the emergence of memory impairments that are associated with these
diseases. Despite the knowledge that these brain regions are particularly vulnerable, the diversity of neural
computations within and across these brain regions is only beginning to be revealed. For example, a key
function of the hippocampus and medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) is to bridge events that are discontinuous in
time, and entorhinal and hippocampal cells that are sequentially active (‘time cells’) have been proposed to be
pivotal for memory retention over delay intervals of many seconds. In our previous work, we therefore
investigated the firing patterns over the delay interval in a spatial working memory (WM) task. We
unexpectedly found that hippocampal time cells were not a general mechanism for WM retention in
hippocampus-dependent tasks. Rather, preliminary data indicate that information about past and future
choices during the delay interval is evident during brief population bursts in hippocampus, while mEC cells
may show memory-related activity that persists irrespective of brain state. We therefore hypothesize that
memory retention does not require time-varying activity over the delay interval but is rather evident in
sporadic population bursts in hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) throughout the delay period
and in firing patterns of entorhinal cells that provide continuity irrespective of brain state. To record activity
during the delay period with varying brain states, we will – within each animal – use two variants of a spatial
WM task, one with and one without forced running throughout the delay such that either theta or non-theta
states are predominant. Aim 1 will focus on population bursts in hippocampus and determine whether they are
only informative in non-theta states, as shown in our preliminary data, or a general mechanism across brain
states. In addition, we will selectively interrupt hippocampal activity within the delay period to determine
whether coding of future choices by population bursts and behavior are perturbed. Aim 2 will then perform
recordings across deep and superficial layers and along the dorso-ventral axis of entorhinal cortex to identify
how mEC contributes to WM. Finally, Aim 3 will carry out large-scale combined single-unit and LFP recordings
in hippocampus and mPFC and in mEC and mPFC to reveal the coordination of mechanisms for WM retention
across brain regions and brain states. Taken together, we will identify whether neuronal activity during
population bursts is a general mechanism for memory retention over delay intervals irrespective of brain state,
whether mEC supports WM retention with persistent activity, and how subregions of mPFC are coordinated
with hippocampal and entorhinal subareas along the dorso-ventral axis. Identifying these memory
computations will be the foundation for treatment approaches to restore memory functions when brain circuits
deteriorate in neurological and neurodegenerative diseases."

Age-related trabecular bone loss begins in young adulthood and leads to increased rates of osteoporosis and
fractures in elderly men and women. It is fastest in vertebrae, where it is ~2-fold faster in women than in men,
and then accelerates in post-menopausal women. Stimulation of cAMP/PKA signaling by intermittent Parathyroid
Hormone-like (iPTH) drugs (teriparatide or abaloparatide) is the only FDA-approved osteoporosis therapy that
acts by increasing anabolic bone formation rather than by decreasing bone resorption. However, not all patients
respond, therapy is limited to 24 months, and the anabolic effects are not maintained after cessation. Moreover,
iPTH therapy requires daily injection and is extremely expensive (~$30,000/year). We previously discovered that
knockdown or deletion of Protein kinase inhibitor  (Pkig) increases the anabolic processes induced by PTH/PKA
in vitro. Targeting PKI might therefore increase the magnitude of response, or the percent of patients who
respond, to iPTH therapy. Because the in vivo roles of PKI and the other two PKI family members were
previously unknown, we generated Pkig-/- mice. Our preliminary results indicate that genetic deletion of Pkig
overcomes both the age-related loss of bone volume and the age-related decline in skeletal healing.
Our long-term goal is therefore to determine whether PKI is a potential therapeutic target, either alone or in
combination with iPTH, to overcome age-related bone loss, the age-related decline in skeletal healing, and/or
post-menopausal bone loss. Our overall hypothesis is that PKI mediates age-related bone loss and the
age-related decline in skeletal healing by regulating the balance between osteogenesis and adipogenesis in a
sex- and skeletal site-dependent manner. The overall hypothesis will be tested by the following Aims:
Aim 1: Determine whether the effects of Pkig deletion on bone homeostasis depend on age, skeletal site, sex,
and/or iPTH therapy.
Aim 2: Determine mechanisms that are critical for regulation of age-related bone loss by PKI.
Aim 3: Determine whether Pkig deletion (either alone or in combination with iPTH) overcomes the age-related
decline of fracture healing and/or ovariectomy (OVX)-induced bone loss."
10840270,"Effective diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections is a major unmet clinical challenge. Annotated
genomic sequences of the major fungal pathogens create an opportunity to revolutionize medical mycology
through the application of systematic approaches. To be maximally useful, genome sequences must be coupled
with genome-wide biological resources. The availability of genome-wide knockout and tagged gene collections
as well as a global genetic interaction map have been instrumental in catalyzing research progress in the model
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The generation of analogous resources in pathogenic fungi creates
experimental tools enabling comprehensive approaches to elucidating the basis of fungal virulence in the
mammalian host and to develop drugs. Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated budding yeast that causes
fungal meningitis, resulting in ~200,000 fatalities each year. C. neoformans has haploid genetics, homologous
recombination, and excellent animal models of disease. In the last period, we used biolistic transformation and
long homology targeting constructs to complete a gene knockout collection, performed extensive quality control
work, developed quantitative methods for screening the library in pools, and performed pooled screens both in
mice and in vitro. We have made the strains available without restriction to the community via the Fungal Genetic
Stock Center (FGSC). This resource has already been used in over 30 publications. To accelerate genome
modification, we developed the first short-homology CRISPR-Cas9 methods for C. neoformans. We have also
created an effective combined localization and purification tag. Preliminary work demonstrates that these
methods can be deployed at scale to enable construction of a tagged strain collection. In addition, we have
devised a novel method that enables pooled CRISPR-Cas9 screens in C. neoformans. Capitalizing on these
technical advances, we will 1) complete the Cryptococcus whole-genome tag collection including production of
an image resource, and 2) construct a first-generation genetic interaction map focused on virulence
determinants. Accomplishment of the first aim will enable the cell biological and/or biochemical investigations of
any protein. Completion of the second aim will deorphanize large fraction genes through membership in clusters
of genes with known functions while defining new modules/pathways. This information will be integrated into the
searchable and web accessible VEuPathDB database. Together these new genomic resources will accelerate
the ability of the research community to understand and develop therapies against the most common cause of
human fungal meningitis."

Cancer immunosurveillance ascribes a role of the immune system in repressing tumor development. Cancer
immunotherapy approaches such as checkpoint blockade that revives this function of exhausted T cells have
revolutionized cancer patient care. Nonetheless, many patients do not respond to this modality of cancer
treatment, calling for investigation of a broader spectrum of tumor-elicited immune responses. We have
recently shown that tumor growth induces expansion of tissue-resident cytotoxic innate lymphocytes and
innate-like T cells that share a gene expression program distinct from that of NK cells and exhausted T cells.
Characterized by high expression of the transcription factor Hobit and cytolytic granzymes, these cells are
herein named killer innate lymphoid cells (ILCk) and killer innate-like T cells (ILTCk). Notably, genetic depletion
of ILCk and ILTCk results in accelerated tumor growth. Furthermore, tumor cells express high levels of IL-15
and lose E-cadherin polarity, and IL-15 or E-cadherin deficiency depletes ILCk and ILTCk resulting in
accelerated tumor growth. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that ILCk and ILTCk are novel lineages of
cytotoxic lymphocytes, and they function as sentinels of cell transformation by sensing tumor cell-derived IL-15
and E-cadherin. To test this hypothesis, we will first define the developmental pathways of ILCk and ILTCk. By
performing cell transfer and cell fate-mapping experiments as well as using mice deficient in lineage-specifying
transcription factors, we will assess whether ILCk are differentiated along the innate lymphoid cell lineage. In
addition, we will generate T cell receptor (TCR) retrogenic mice and perform TCR “swapping” experiments to
determine whether distinct thymic selection promotes ILTCk differentiation. Parabiosis and inducible
hematopoietic stem cell-targeted cell fate-mapping experiments will also be performed to determine whether
ILCk and ILTCk are continuously generated throughout tumor progression. Secondly, we will define the
function and regulation of ILCk and ILTCk by initially assessing whether Hobit expression marks a stage of
functional specification, and whether Hobit controls a gene expression program essential for ILCk and ILTCk-
mediated cancer surveillance. In addition, we will utilize conditional null alleles of Il15 and Il2rb and a gain-of-
function allele encoding an active form of the transcription factor Stat5b to determine whether tumor IL-15
functions as an alarmin for ILCk and ILTCk, and whether IL-15 signaling constitutes a rate-limiting step of the
ILCk and ILTCk response. Finally, we will investigate the interactions between tumor cells and ILCk and ILTCk
by intravital imaging, and assess whether E-cadherin is sensed by the TGF-b-induced integrin CD103, and
whether patient CDH1 hot-spot missense mutations promote tumor evasion from ILCk and ILTCk-mediated
cancer surveillance. Successful completion of this project will not only generate mechanistic insights into the
lineage commitment and regulation of tumor-resident ILCk and ILTCk, but also guide the targeting of this novel
cancer immunosurveillance pathway for therapy of a wide range of malignancies."

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global healthcare crisis that in the USA kills about 1 person every
minute. It is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). While respiratory
failure is still the most common cause of mortality in COVID-19 patients, serious manifestations are seen across
multiple organs, including the pancreas. There is an intricate relationship between COVID-19 and pancreatic
diseases such as pancreatitis and diabetes. Understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms that lead to
pancreatic dysfunction and glucose intolerance in infected patients is of utmost importance. The pathogenesis
of diabetes is intimately associated with the dysfunction of the pancreatic islet. There are numerous studies
indicating that SARS-CoV-2 directly attacks the vascular system. However, the possibility that islet microvascular
dysfunction triggers loss of glucose homeostasis in COVID-19 patients has not been explored. This project
focuses on the vascular pericyte because our published and preliminary data show that (a) pericytes in human
islets are very responsive to angiotensin II and express the key host cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2;
(b) pericytes can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-entry viruses; and (c) incubation with a SARS-CoV-2
Spike recombinant protein increases pericyte basal Ca2+ levels. We therefore hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2
infects pancreas pericytes, interfering with their contractile properties and impairing their function. Pericyte
dysfunction will decrease local blood flow, leading to tissue hypoxia and inflammation and compromising
endocrine cell activity. We will test this hypothesis using living pancreas slices from humans and hamsters which
are a suitable animal model for COVID-19 research given the high homology of their ACE2 protein sequences.
This hypothesis will be tested in two Aims: 1) determine if pericytes are cellular targets of SARS-CoV-2 in the
pancreas, and (2) examine the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on islet pericyte function and microvascular responses
ex vivo and in vivo. In Aim 1, we will search for SARS-CoV-2 viral particles, characterize microvascular lesions
and the pericyte phenotype in the pancreas of COVID-19 patients. We will infect living pancreas slices with
SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-entry and live viruses and determine if pericytes are permissive for infection. In Aim 2, we
will assess the functional consequences of manipulating ACE2 expression and activity through interactions with
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on pericyte Ca2+ responses and vasomotion ex vivo in living pancreas slices, and in
vivo by intraductal injections of pseudo-entry viruses in the hamster pancreas. We will follow longitudinally the
effects on glucose metabolism, as well as changes in local hypoxia, inflammation, endocrine cell mass and
function. This research has the potential to identify a mechanism of dysfunction in the endocrine pancreas. If the
hypothesis is correct, pericytes are cellular targets of this coronavirus. Their functional impairment could explain
why COVID-19 is linked to a loss of glucose homeostasis and other pancreatic disorders. We anticipate our
study of COVID-19–related diabetes to uncover novel mechanisms of the natural history of this disease."

RNA serves as the key intermediate for carrying genetic information and translating functional proteins, and
numerous types of non-coding RNAs have also been recently discovered that play critical roles in cellular
processes. While RNAs are directly transcribed from DNA, their sequence, function, and translation efficiency
are all actively modulated in the cell though post-transcriptional localization and editing. These processes are
essential for development and cellular function and are dysregulated in many diseases. Despite the importance
of post-transcriptional localization and modification, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the timing,
mechanisms, and regulation of these events. Several methods have been reported that enable researchers to
label and image specific RNAs in living cells or pull-down and sequence edited transcripts from cell lysates.
However, significant technological limitations still exist, and addressing these gaps holds promise for the
development of new therapeutics and diagnostics. We have previously developed and implemented new
methods for covalent labeling and imaging of specific RNAs in cells as well as pull-down and enrichment of A-
to-I edited transcripts from cellular RNA. The future directions for our program include expanding this chemical
biology toolbox to provide researchers with new and improved technologies for probing these important cellular
processes. Additionally, recent studies have offered groundbreaking evidence for the hypothesis that asymmetric
localization of RNA serves as a mechanism for regulating editing. Thus, a significant focus of the proposed
research is to combine our imaging and editing-specific pull-down methods to advance understanding of the
interplay between these two processes. Together, this research aims to serve the scientific community by
providing insight into the regulation of RNA localization and modification as well as developing and disseminating
robust and well-validated technologies for studying and modulating biological systems."
10836358,"The main goals of this project are to identify mechanisms underlying thrombogenesis in patients with left atrial (LA) fibrosis
and to validate this new knowledge via a prospective proof-of-concept clinical study. Atrial fibrillation (AFib) affects millions
of Americans and carries a five-fold increased risk of stroke, a leading cause of mortality and morbidity. Around 30% of all
ischemic strokes are caused by thromboembolism in AFib patients. In patients without AFib, embolic strokes of undetermined
source (ESUS) account for an additional 30% of ischemic strokes. Current stroke risk stratification tools in AFib and ESUS (e.g.,
CHA2DS2-VASc) are deficient in predictive accuracy, leaving many patients either under-treated for stroke prevention or over-
treated and subjected to unnecessary bleeding risk. The growing evidence that LA fibrosis serves as a mechanistic nexus
between AFib and ESUS is a very promising advance that could open new avenues for stroke prevention. However, taking
advantage of this opportunity requires detailed knowledge of the mechanism(s) by which fibrotic atria are prone to thrombosis,
with or without AFib. Fibrosis has complex structural, electrical, and contractile effects in the LA. These phenomena may
independently or synergistically influence thrombosis risk by altering LA hemodynamics, but prior work has not systematically
assessed inter-dependencies or clarified each factor’s relative importance. This is due to difficulties associated with
experimental manipulation and acquisition of clinical measurements. Advances in computational modeling offer an
unprecedented opportunity to address this critical knowledge gap. Specifically, the stage is set to create a multi-scale, multi-
physics framework that can comprehensively simulate the pro-thrombotic potential of each unique patient-specific LA
fibrosis pattern. Our central hypothesis is that LA fibrosis is a key mechanistic factor in determining each individual’s risk of
thromboembolic stroke due to structural, electrical, and contractile factors. Our approach consists of three specific aims.
Aim 1 will develop and calibrate a computational framework that integrates electrophysiological, biomechanical, and mechano-
fluidic modeling in patient-specific LA models, paying special attention to resolving the effects of fibrosis. We will parameterize
the framework using multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging acquisitions in AFib patients with prior stroke and non-AFib,
non-stroke controls. Aim 2 will use the new computational framework to systematically characterize mechanistic connections
between LA fibrosis and thrombogenesis. We will examine how each individual’s mix of fibrosis extent/pattern, LA anatomy,
and susceptibility to emergent electromechanical phenomena combine (with or without simulated AFib) to create a
thrombogenic milieu that can be characterized by computational modeling. Aim 3 will validate the mechanistic connections
between fibrosis and risk of recurrent stroke/brain microinfarction in a proof-of-concept prospective clinical study. We will
examine a high-risk cohort of ESUS patients, but notably without a current indication for oral anticoagulation. We will test if
model-predicted thrombogenic combinations of LA shape, fibrosis pattern, deranged electromechanics, and disrupted blood
flow exist in patients who experience more adverse outcomes. Our validated multi-physics modeling framework will, for the
first time, yield new insight on fibrosis-mediated stroke mechanisms, and pave the way for new treatments for millions of
patients who are borderline candidates for anticoagulation (e.g., individuals with ESUS or AFib with intermediate risk scores)."
10836469,"Anhedonia is a common transdiagnostic symptom that frequently fails to respond to available psychosocial and
pharmacological treatments and has been linked to disability and suicidal risk. Development of new treatments
for anhedonia has been hindered by its substantial heterogeneity. To address this problem, the NIMH
Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach has emphasized the need to identify circuit-specific sub-domains
of functional impairment. One potential pathway to anhedonic symptoms is through neurobiological changes
associated with prolonged exposure to stress (“stress-induced anhedonia”), characterized neurally by reduced
activation in reward-related regions such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and ventral striatum, and
behaviorally by a failure to pursue rewards and reduced ability to anticipate positive or rewarding outcomes
(i.e. pessimistic biases). While the specific mechanisms by which elevated stress may lead to anhedonia are
not fully understood, two candidate mechanisms are elevated inflammatory cytokines and altered
glutamatergic functioning. Stressors are known to increase glutamate, particularly in mPFC, leading to
numerous negative effects including excito-toxicity, shrinkage of dendrites, and reduction of spine synapse
density. Stressors have also been shown to activate immune responses, elevating proinflammatory cytokine
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-1b. Critically, a growing body of work has
suggested that elevated inflammation and altered glutamate functioning may be linked. The goal of the current
proposal is therefore to explore the independent and additive contributions of inflammation and glutamatergic
functioning to the experience of pessimistic expectations in stress-induced anhedonia. We propose to employ
plasma analysis of peripheral inflammatory markers and MRS glutamate in 40 healthy control participants
without anhedonia and 60 participants with anhedonia stratified by level of peripheral inflammation. In Aim 1
we will analyze associations between perceived stress, inflammation, and an ecological momentary
assessment (EMA) measure of pessimistic expectations. In Aim 2, we will use an acute stress manipulation
and MR spectroscopy to examine changes in mPFC glutamate in response to acute stress, examining
associations between perceived stress, glutamatergic response to stress, and pessimistic expectations.
Finally, in Aim 3 we will examine whether glutamatergic response to stress is related to individual differences in
inflammation and will test a serial mediation model of inflammation and glutamate response to stress on
pessimistic expectations. This work will provide insight into the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie
stress-induced anhedonia and the results will be used to inform future work using targeted treatments."

Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common genetic heart disease with a projected burden of ~2
million genetically at risk in the United States. Approximately ⅓ of HCM patients have no left ventricular outflow
obstruction and we have challenged the conventional thinking that HCM symptoms and complications are
primarily driven by left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. We have shown that non-obstructive HCM is
associated with high rates of ventricular arrhythmias, abnormal myocardial mechanics, poor exercise tolerance
and adverse clinical outcomes, higher frequency of microvascular ischemia (by positron emission tomography;
PET) and large scar burden (by cardiac magnetic resonance; CMR). How changes in myocardial mechanics
and perfusion mediate exercise capacity in HCM remains poorly understood. Exercise training improves
exercise capacity in HCM but the mechanism(s) for improved exercise capacity are unclear.
 The overall objective of this proposal is to determine the role of myopathy and microvascular ischemia in
contributing to exercise tolerance in non-obstructive HCM. Our central hypothesis is that both these
mechanisms are important determinants of exercise capacity in non-obstructive HCM. The rationale for our
proposal is that if exercise favorably modifies myocardial perfusion and function it may provide the basis for
considering structured exercise as a therapy for non-obstructive HCM patients, who as we demonstrated have
high risk for an adverse clinical course and no effective therapy at this time. We will test our hypothesis with
the following aims: Aim 1: To determine the role of myocardial function in exercise limitation in non-obstructive
HCM. We will use echo-based myocardial strain to determine regional and global myocardial function at rest
and peak stress (peak exercise). We will examine the relationship between regional/global strain and exercise
capacity, specifically the relative importance of rest and peak exercise strain on exercise capacity. Aim 2: To
evaluate the relationship between myocardial perfusion and exercise capacity in non-obstructive HCM. Using
Ammonia-13 (13N) PET scanning we will characterize myocardial perfusion and flow reserve on a segmental
basis. Aim 3: To understand the effects of moderate intensity exercise training (MIET) on myocardial function
and perfusion - the EXerCise traIning To rEcovery in HCM (EXCITE-HCM) trial. Patients will be randomized
1:1 to 24 weeks of MIET versus no exercise with measurement of VO2max at baseline and end-study. The
overall goal of this proposal is to build on convincing observational data and harness sophisticated and well-
validated modern imaging techniques to better understand the factors underlying exercise intolerance in non-
obstructive HCM. Concurrently we will evaluate if MIET-induced improvements in exercise tolerance are
mediated through favorable effects on these key pathophysiologic processes. The results of this trial will inform
whether MIET is a viable intervention in non-obstructive HCM and the potential mechanisms by which exercise
may mediate its beneficial effects."

 The fundamental role of neutrophils in host defense against pathogens is well established from animal
models of infection and the increased susceptibility to infection in neutropenic patients. Despite this, many
aspects of neutrophil biology remain underexplored. The metabolic programs needed to support antimicrobial
neutrophil functions are poorly understood and the degree of plasticity these cells may achieve in disease
states is not known. We have leveraged unique approaches to identify a novel association between increased
infection risk in patients and a polymorphism in Cpt1a. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (Cpt1a) is required for
mitochondrial metabolism of long chain fatty acids. Using a pharmacologic inhibitor of CPT1a and multiple
murine models of bacterial pneumonia, we have demonstrated that CPT1a inhibition increased susceptibility to
infection by decreasing neutrophil mobilization to, and activation at, the site of infection. We provide additional
preliminary data to support a model whereby neutrophil mitochondria metabolize fatty acids to generate ATP,
which is necessary for amplification of activating signals required for neutrophil activation, chemotaxis, and
antibacterial functions. Based on these findings, we will test the overall hypothesis that fatty acid metabolism is
an essential metabolic program for neutrophil trafficking and antibacterial defense in the lung. Specifically, we
will test the sub-hypotheses that (i) fatty acid metabolism is an important mechanism for mitochondrial ATP
production in neutrophils, (ii) fatty acid-derived mitochondrial ATP is required for amplification of neutrophil
activating signals, and (iii) disruption of fatty acid metabolism impairs neutrophil activation, chemotaxis,
antibacterial defenses, and neutrophilic lung inflammation. Specific Aim 1 will define the role of fatty acid
metabolism on neutrophil energetics, migration, and effector functions. This work will establish the contribution
of fatty acid metabolism to mitochondrial ATP production in neutrophils, define the role of fatty acid metabolism
in neutrophil activation, and determine the importance of fatty acid metabolism for neutrophil antibacterial
functions. Specific Aim 2 will determine the effect of inactivation of fatty acid metabolism on neutrophilic lung
inflammation. This work will use multiple single-cell approaches to define neutrophil plasticity and activation
heterogeneity in the infected lung microenvironment. Further, this Aim will determine the effects of fatty acid
metabolism inhibition on neutrophilic lung inflammation. Completion of these Aims will establish fatty acid
oxidation as an essential metabolic program to support antimicrobial neutrophil functions and add to the
current prevailing paradigm that neutrophils rely solely on aerobic glycolysis as a metabolic program. Further,
these studies will determine the functional consequences of neutrophil heterogeneity at the site of infection and
establish neutrophil plasticity as a potential contributor to disease states. Finally, these aims will provide a
mechanistic framework for the clinical association between a Cpt1a polymorphism existing in the human
population and increased infection risk."

 Comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder (PTSD+MDD) is the most
common pathological response to trauma and represents a major public health burden. Unfortunately,
knowledge regarding the neurobiological mechanisms underlying this comorbidity is extremely limited. Without
such an understanding, treatment outcomes for this common constellation will remain poor.
 This K23 Career Development Award aims to provide the PI with the necessary training to become an
independent investigator conducting programmatic research delineating the mechanisms underlying
PTSD+MDD. Toward this end, the candidate proposes the following training objectives: (1) to acquire expertise
in the assessment of executive dysfunction, (2) to gain the requisite knowledge and skills in neuroimaging to
conduct independent research of a neurobiologically-based model of PTSD+MDD, and (3) to obtain advanced
training in statistical methods. An expert team of mentors has been assembled to support these training goals.
The overall research objective of the proposed project is to use an experimental medicine conceptualization of
repeated ketamine infusions as a probe to (1) characterize neurobiological factors underpinning PTSD+MDD,
(2) demonstrate that modulation of corticolimbic functional connectivity generates clinical improvement and (3)
validate a coherent model of PTSD+MDD to inform future research, treatment, and conceptualizations.
 The central hypothesis is that corticolimbic dysconnectivity is associated with clinical symptoms,
rumination and cognitive dysfunction in PTSD+MDD and that ketamine infusions correct dysconnectivity
thereby improving clinical symptoms, rumination, and cognition. The specific aims of this research are (1) to
examine how baseline PTSD+MDD clinical presentation, cognitive function and neurocircuitry predicts clinical
response to ketamine infusions, (2) to examine the association of changes in corticolimbic circuitry with
changes in clinical symptoms and cognition following either ketamine or saline infusions, and (3) to examine
cognition, rumination, and neurocircuitry in a larger cohort of trauma exposed subjects and healthy controls.
 Innovative aspects of this project include: (1) Method: Use of ketamine as an experimental medicine
probe to characterize biological substrates underlying a coherent model of PTSD+MDD; (2) Design:
Application of pre- and post-treatment neuroimaging assessments to identify biomarkers predicting response to
an empirically validated treatment for PTSD+MDD; (3) Concept: Proposing a novel model of PTSD+MDD that
is built on neuroanatomical and cognitive functioning systems implicated in the pathophysiology of
PTSD+MDD. The proposed research is significant because it proposes a coherent model of PTSD+MDD that
has the potential to advance our understanding of individuals with pathological responses to trauma."

ANNUAL TRANSLATIONAL HIV EARLY STAGE INVESTIGATOR (ESI) CONFERENCE
This R13 application requests continued NIH support for four annual conferences for Early Stage Investigators
(ESIs) conducting translational HIV vaccine, cure, immunology, and co-infection research with non-human
primates (NHPs). These meetings are organized contiguous with the NHP AIDS Symposium and gather ESIs
and mentors for scientific networking, career development, and training in translational science skills. In Year
1, the meeting will be held at the Tulane National Primate Center in New Orleans, LA in conjunction with the
NHP AIDS Symposium. The conferences are planned by a diverse advisory group of experts in the field
including scientists at all stages of their careers. K01 HIV/AIDS Scholars and mentors complete a needs
assessment to determine priority topics for the meeting. The advisory committee develops the meeting agenda
using the input from this needs assessment. Attendees at the ESI Conferences will participate in training and
skill-building activities on important translational scientific topics (e.g., cure, prevention, vaccine, and
therapeutic research; NHP models of TB and coinfections); mentoring opportunities with senior and peer
investigators (e.g., panel discussions on career development); skill building for research career development
training (e.g., ESI funding landscape, how to conduct research with HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN),
manuscript writing); “Works in Progress” presentations; and organized networking opportunities with other ESIs
and senior investigators (e.g., receptions, speed dating, and small group discussions). The meeting has no
registration fee and travel scholarships will be awarded to talented ESIs, with priority for underrepresented
applicants, and K01 Scholars and mentors, thus providing opportunities for these groups to continue to interact
and support translational science. The inclusion of women, underrepresented minorities and individuals with
disabilities will be supported as speakers, attendees, and advisors, with a goal of creating a meeting
environment that is welcoming to diverse scientists. HVTN staff will organize the conference and will provide
further translational research opportunities by facilitating participation for 3 K01 Scholars at the annual HVTN
Full Group Meeting in Washington, DC. These conferences will fill a critical gap in scientific knowledge and
workforce development by ensuring that the next generation of diverse ESI are able to facilitate greater
translation of research between preclinical NHP studies and clinical trials. Building a workforce for the future
composed of scientists with strong translational skills is critical to ending the HIV epidemic and developing HIV
vaccines, therapeutics, and cure strategies."
10837066,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Black individuals have a higher prevalence of insulin resistance and are more likely to have
cardiometabolic diseases, which is associated with an increased risk of mortality. The reasons for the
increased insulin resistance in Blacks are incompletely understood. The natriuretic peptide hormonal
system contributes to the regulation of glucose utilization and energy homeostasis, and is one of the major
determinants of cardiometabolic health. We have shown that Black individuals have 30-40% lower
natriuretic peptide levels compared with Whites, and this is evident at a young age. Black individuals also
have an impaired glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) response to meals. Both these metabolic regulators are
cleared by the neprilysin enzyme. We have shown that Blacks have a higher expression of neprilysin, and
the neprilysin mediated clearance pathway in Blacks may be a biological contributor to their higher
cardiometabolic disease risk. Sacubitril/valsartan is a Food & Drugs Administration approved inhibitor of
neprilysin that augments natriuretic peptide and GLP-1 levels. Increasing NP and GLP-1 concentrations in
Black individuals who have relatively low levels or impaired activity of these hormonal regulators of
metabolism may be an attractive strategy to improve their cardiometabolic health. We hypothesize that
neprilysin inhibition using sacubitril/valsartan will improve cardiometabolic health as measured by insulin
sensitivity and energy expenditure in Black adults. We propose to conduct a patient-oriented physiological
trial in Black individuals with insulin resistance to test the hypotheses that sacubitril/valsartan will (1)
improve insulin sensitivity, (2) increase resting and exercise energy expenditure, (3) improve GLP-1
response to meal as compared with neprilysin neutral medication (valsartan). In our aim 1 of the study, we
will enroll 200 self-identified Black individuals with insulin resistance and randomize them in a 1:1, double-
blind manner to sacubitril/valsartan (neprilysin inhibitor) or valsartan alone (neprilysin neutral) for 12 weeks.
We will compare the difference in the change in insulin sensitivity, as measured by the intravenous glucose
tolerance test, between those receiving sacubitril/valsartan and those receiving valsartan only for 12 weeks.
In the second aim of the study, we will compare the difference in change in resting energy expenditure after
12 weeks of the study drug between the two treatment arms. We will also assess the difference in the
change in exercise energy expenditure after 12 weeks. In our aim 3, we will assess the difference in the
change in the GLP-1 response to standardized mixed meals after 12-weeks of treatment with study
medications. This study targets a potentially important and innovative approach to understand and improve
the regulation of cardiometabolic indices among Black individuals through multiple mechanisms. The
findings from this study will provide a therapeutic pathway that may help in controlling the high
cardiometabolic disease burden in Black individuals."

The prevalence of dry eye disease (DED) ranges from ~5 to 50% of the general population with an
estimated US$ 3.8 billion dollars in associated medical costs. Symptoms of DED include pain, fatigued
and/or sore eyes, photophobia and blurred vision, which lead to a decrease in productivity and reduce the
quality of life. Unfortunately, treatment options for DED are limited. Clinical studies suggest 85% of overall
DED cases are caused by Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). As humans and mice age, their Meibomian
glands (MGs) undergo age-related changes, including decreased acinar basal cell proliferation and atrophy,
and these changes result in age related-MGD (ARMGD). The precise cause of ARMGD remains elusive,
which makes the development of therapies extremely challenging.
 Hyaluronan (HA) is a major extracellular component that interacts and binds to a myriad of
molecules forming complex macromolecules which regulate major physiological functions, such as
development and stem cell specification. Our recently published work shows that compound HA synthase
(Has)-1 and -3 null mice, namely Has1-/-;Has3-/- mice, have enlarged MGs when compared to age matched
wild-type (wt) mice. Our preliminary data show that the MGs of Has1-/-;Has3-/- mice continue to increase in
size throughout life, and, interestingly, these mice do not develop ARMGD. At 1 year of age, Has1-/-;Has3-/-
mice have a striking 4-fold increase in MG volume and an overall 10-fold increase in lipid production,
compared to age matched wt mice. We hypothesize that the increase in HA expression in and around the
MGs of Has1-/-;Has3-/- mice is capable of maintaining viable progenitor cells as they age, which in turn
prevents ARMGD. Specific aim 1 of this proposal will characterize the extracellular matrix in the MGs of wt
and Has1-/-;Has3-/- mice with a focus on the composition of the HA matrix. Specific aim 2 of this proposal
will analyze the distribution of MG progenitor and proliferating cells in order to identify how the MGs of Has1-
/-;Has3-/- mice enlarge over time. This aim will also characterize the lipid composition of the meibum, and
verify whether enlarged glands can prevent DED. Importantly, although Has1-/-;Has3-/- mice lack two
isoforms of the enzyme responsible for HA biosynthesis, they up-regulate the third isoform (Has2), and, in
turn, present a significant increase in HA expression in and around MGs when compared to wt mice.
Therefore, we also hypothesize that increasing Has2 expression and HA bioavailability within MGs could
prevent ARMGD in aged wt mice. Specific aim 3 will test whether Has2 overexpression and FDA approved
HA-based treatment regimens to increase the bioavailability of HA within tarsal plates and MGs can prevent
ARMGD in wt mice."
10837071,"Reproductive health is not only critical for fertility and propagation of the species, but also underlies many key
parameters of human health and longevity. As such, our understanding of the genetic and molecular basis of
key events in reproduction is critical for our ability to improve reproductive health, fertility, and the physiological
well-being of our species. Thus, the primary goal of the current R13 Conference Proposal is to provide a small
local two-day annual conference focusing on reproductive biology and infertility. This event has emerged out of
similar long-standing symposia held by Cornell University’s Center for Reproductive Genomics (CRG) and by
the University of Pennsylvania’s Center for Research in Reproduction and Women’s Health (CRRWH), which
make up two of the tripartite group, the third being the Center for Reproductive Genetics and Therapy (CRG&T)
at Magee-Womens Research Institute (MWRI) at the University of Pittsburgh. The Cornell and MWRI groups
initiated combined symposia in 2018, and over two years, these have been hugely successful. With the inclusion
of UPenn, we have renamed this annual two-day symposium Tri-Institutional Symposium on Reproductive
Biology & Infertility, or Tri-Repro. The second goal of Tri-Repro is to focus on trainee career development by
encouraging participation and leadership from our trainees, and by emphasizing trainee peer-to-peer interactions
through the formation of a tri-institutional Trainee Organizing Committee. Trainees will select up to seven invited
speakers, including renowned leaders in reproductive science from around the world, but also including new
faculty from each of the three institutions. The venue for the symposium will rotate each year, providing a shift
in location, but also encouraging changes in emphasis reflecting the varying interests of each Center. Most of
the talks, and all of the posters, will feature trainee presenters selected by the committee from submitted
abstracts, while a career development lunch forum on day 1 will feature invited speakers who will discuss specific
areas of career development for all trainees. The third goal of Tri-Repro is to provide a local environment to
promote localized interactions and networking with an aim to forge new collaborations between institutions in the
Northeast. This has been the most successful component of our previous symposia: by inviting our neighboring
guest institutions to join us at very low cost (the Tri-Repro group provides all registration and food to our guests,
leaving them with only modest travel and accommodation costs to cover), we provide a rich environment in which
neighboring institutions with interests and expertise in reproductive sciences can come together to discuss
collaborative ideas and provide feedback to each other. Such an environment is often more comfortable and
intimate than large national conferences, allowing even the most timid of trainees to interact with peers and
faculty alike. The fourth goal of Tri-Repro is to champion the inclusion and active participation of women and
people from underrepresented groups in our field, a feature that has been a major focus of our previous
symposia, and which we will continue to prioritize at future events."

10845661,"The long term objective of this work is to understand the molecular genetic basis for how the retina
transmits and processes the signals produced when lights are turned off. Cone photoreceptors
mediate vision during daylight and use glutamate as their transmitter. The cone signals are carried
across the retina by two functional classes of bipolar cells, On and Off, which have different
glutamate receptors that cause them to depolarize (ie, signal) either at light-on or -off, respectively.
Each functional class of bipolar cell can be subdivided into 5-6 anatomical types. This study
focuses on the Off bipolar cells that chiefly express sign-preserving kainate-type glutamate
receptors (subunits GluK1-5). Surprisingly, while AMPA receptors predominate at most CNS
synapses, kainate receptors predominate at the cone synapses of most of the Off bipolar cell
types. They are important to study for at least four reasons. First, the temporal signaling properties
of kainate receptors differ from those of AMPA receptors, and these differences are likely to
change the size and timing of the Off signals traversing the retina in as yet poorly understood
ways. Second, the kainate receptors at most well-studied synapses almost always contain the
GluK2 subunit, whereas the Off bipolar cells choose the less well-studied GluK1 subunit as their
main subunit instead. Third, Off bipolar cells express Neto1, an auxiliary receptor subunit that
profoundly alters the in vivo responses of GluK2-containing receptors. The effect of Neto1 on
endogenous GluK1-containing receptors has not yet been studied. And fourth, while the functional
properties of different kainate receptors on the Off bipolar cell have been described, the molecular
basis for their diverse responses has not been established. To determine the subunit basis for
signaling at the Off bipolar cell synapse, we propose to study synaptic responses in mice in which
receptor subunits (GluK1-GluK5) are individually knocked out either permanently or acutely.
Similar studies will be performed to define the role of the auxiliary subunit Neto1 in communication.
Three specific aims will 1) determine the subunits that mediate synaptic responses in Off bipolar
cell types 1a, 2, and 3a; 2) determine the function of Neto proteins in signaling at the Off bipolar
cell synapse; and, 3) determine the physiological function of the GluK1-1d subunit, which is unique
to the retina, the molecular factors that localize the GluK1-1d subunit to the synapse."

Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is a common, debilitating, and distressing complication in surgical
patients over the age of 65. Sleep disorders or insufficient sleep are highly prevalent among surgical patients
and sleep disturbances are an important factor associated with the development of PND. However, there are
scarce mechanistic studies or data on the precise relationship between disrupted sleep and cognitive
impairment after surgery and anesthesia. The preoptic region of the hypothalamus is a critical node for the
control of sleep onset and sleep homeostasis. Additionally, recent work from our group identified a subset of
glutamatergic neurons in the medial and lateral preoptic (MLPO) region that promote wakefulness. Importantly,
preliminary data obtained for this application show that chemogenetic activation of neuronal subpopulations in
the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) can improve (GABAergic stimulation) or impair (glutamatergic
stimulation) memory performance after anesthesia. Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms by
which sleep- and wake-related networks influence cognitive function after surgery and anesthesia. The goal of
the proposed research is to investigate the role of preoptic neurons in sleep-dependent cognition after surgery.
The proposed studies will test the central hypothesis that preoptic neurons in the hypothalamus that regulate
sleep-wake states also regulate cognitive disturbances after surgery. Aim 1 will use chemogenetic stimulation
and inhibition of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in the MnPO and MLPO to investigate the role of these
neurons in acute and long-term postoperative cognitive function in a mouse model of surgery. Aim 2 will use
calcium imaging technology to assess the activity patterns of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in the
MnPO and MLPO in relation to sleep-wake states during the postoperative period. Additional experiments will
use chemogenetic inhibition to demonstrate a causal role of these neurons in postoperative sleep disturbances
and altered cortical dynamics in a mouse model of surgery. Aim 3 will test the effect of caffeine administration
on postoperative cognitive function, MnPO and MLPO neuronal activity, sleep-wake architecture, and cortical
oscillations and dynamics. In a separate set of experiments, we will test whether chemogenetic modulation of
preoptic GABAergic and glutamatergic activity mitigates the effect of caffeine on postoperative cognitive
performance. The proposed experiments will significantly advance the field by providing a systems-level
mechanistic understanding of the relationship between sleep and cognitive function after surgery and
anesthesia. Furthermore, the proposed studies will test a pharmacological approach to improve postoperative
cognitive function that can be translated to surgical patients."

Project Summary
A comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the process of adaptation that is predictive of
outcomes is a fundamental goal in evolutionary biology and advances towards this goal have profound
implications for human health. Adaptation, particularly in animal populations, is primarily studied
retrospectively through the patterns it produces. Yet, decades of research have demonstrated that
adaptation in natural populations occurs quickly. A growing number of field experiments, including
much of my recent work, have demonstrated key insight into the process of adaptation by observing as
it occurs. With advances in sequencing and bioinformatics it is now tractable to use forward-in-time
experimental approaches to directly observe the process of adaptation in sexually reproducing diploid
animals by studying repeated changes across independent populations, which is amongst the strongest
evidence of adaptation. Combining a forward-in-time experimental approach with manipulations of
aspects of genetic diversity, the selective landscape, or demography can directly test hypotheses
about the genomic architecture, constraint, and pace of adaptation providing key insight into the
process of rapid adaptation. I propose experiments united by an approach that leverages existing
molecular and population genetics tools in Drosophila melanogaster for replicated field experiments that
directly test key hypotheses about the relationship between genetic variation, adaptation, and the
predictability of evolution in animal populations. The primary questions are: 1) Are genotype-phenotype
relationships of complex traits predictive of the outcomes of adaptation; 2) Are large effect loci essential
for rapid adaptation from standing genetic variation; 3) What is the relationship between the amount of
genetic diversity and the pace and parallelism of adaptation; and 4) Does gene flow into locally adapted
but declining populations promote or constrain adaptation and population persistence and does this
depend on the amount of genetic diversity in the recipient population. In addition to directly answering
these questions, these experiments will provide data on the pace, predictability, and importance of
adaptation in shaping both genomic diversity and the persistence of populations inhabiting rapidly
changing environments. The work I propose here is part of building a research program that tests
fundamental questions in evolutionary biology by manipulating factors hypothesized to influence
adaptation and directly observing their effects with the ultimate aim of building a mechanistic
understanding of adaptation."

 Although aging is a conserved phenomenon across evolutionary distant species, key aspects of biological
process have been found to differ between males and females of the same species during aging. For instance,
accumulating evidence suggests that immune cells of male vs. female individuals are clearly distinct
throughout life. Despite these clear differences and their potential significance, biomedical research has
historically focused exclusively on male individuals. Thus, sex- driven differences, their molecular
underpinning and impact on various aspects of adult health, including lifelong immune responses, are still
poorly understood. Interestingly, both sex hormones (i.e. androgens vs. estrogens) and sex-chromosomes
(i.e. XX vs. XY) have key impact outside of reproduction and gonadal development. Indeed, accumulating
evidence supports the notion of widespread sex-dimorphism in biological processes. For example, immune
responses differ between biological sexes, with a more robust immune response in females vs. increased
susceptibility to infection in males. Neutrophils are a major leukocyte population serving as a “first line of
defense” against infections. We have observed strong sex-dimorphism in the transcriptome, metabolome and
lipidome of murine neutrophils, as well as changes in neutrophil-mediated immune phenotypes. Together, our
results suggest that mechanisms involving gonadal hormones and/or sex chromosomes can regulate
neutrophil-based immunity. We hypothesize that mechanisms involving both sex chromosomes and
lifelong exposure to gonadal hormones independently modulate neutrophil-based genomic networks
and immune phenotypes throughout life. To test our hypothesis, we will investigate how neutrophil-based
phenotypes are fine-tuned as a function of sex throughout life. Sex hormones and sex chromosome
complement are intimately linked in wild-type animals, complicating the study of determinants of sex-dimorphic
phenotypes. To address this shortcoming, we will leverage an innovative model of adult somatic-sex
reprogramming (the adult Foxl2-iKO) to assess the impact of hormonal vs. genetic sex on neutrophil
phenotypes throughout life. This unique and tractable system will enable us to understand the consequences
of adult exposures to higher levels of estrogens vs. androgens on immune responses. Together, our proposed
experiments will provide insights on sex-dimorphic mechanisms of immune regulation and reveal how
hormonal inputs may exert lifelong impact on immune cells."

Department of Veterans Affairs’ medical record data. This is an ideal ‘laboratory’ to test our hypotheses. In a
10 year observation period (2012-2022) we will sample 15,193 patients with PTSD and comorbid T2D and
17,442 patients with PTSD and comorbid CVD. Our aims are 1) determine if separate PTSD phenotypes
(derived from latent class analysis of PTSD symptoms), and symptom change, in patients with comorbid PTSD-
T2D/CVD, are differentially associated with an increased risk for adverse T2D and CVD outcomes, including
disease related and all-cause mortality, 2) determine whether risks for adverse T2D and CVD outcomes, all-
cause and cause specific mortality are lower in patients with vs. without a clinically meaningful PTSD
improvement
; 3) determine if measures of T2D/CVD management, such as good glycemic control, statin
medication adherence and improved depression, mediate the association between clinically meaningful PTSD
improvement and T2D/ CVD outcomes.
and 4) conduct planned age, gender, and race sub-group
comparisons. Decades of research on depression and T2D/CVD led to guidelines that acknowledge
depression as a risk factor for poor CVD outcomes. Positive results and confirmatory studies may eventually
lead to similar guidelines that advise providers to screen and treat PTSD to improve T2D/CVD outcomes."
10850702,"The identification of postnatal neural stem cells is essential to understand neural development, adult
neurogenesis and gliogenesis, and the origin of brain tumors. Neural stem cells (NSCs) have been identified
as a subpopulation of ventricle contacting astroglial (B1) cells in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) of
the adult rodent brain. Our recent work has shown that B1 cells give rise to a second population of V-SVZ
astroglial (B2) cells that do not contact the ventricle. The function of B2 cells is not known, but it has been
suggested that B2 cells could function as secondary NSCs in rodents. Whether similar NSCs exist in the V-SVZ of the postnatal human brain remains unknown. Our studies in humans have revealed an extensive
migration and recruitment of new neurons in the anterior forebrain of children younger than 6 months of age.
Interestingly, astroglial cells with B1-like (hB1) and B2-like characteristics are present in the walls of the lateral
ventricles in the human brain. hB1 cells are present at birth, but rapidly disappear within the first five months
after birth. During this period, a sub-ependymal ribbon of human B2-like (hB2) cells forms next to the lateral
ventricle walls. Preliminary data show that these hB2 cells are distinct from parenchymal astrocytes, continue
to proliferate postnatally and have marker expression similar to embryonic radial glial. Our hypothesis is that
hB2 cells lose apical attachment with the ventricle, but retain neural stem cell (NSC) properties to generate
new neurons in the infant human brain. We hypothesize that this transformation of hB1 to hB2 cells is similar
to the apical-basal transition that occurs in mice as B1 cells give rise to B2 cells, and that these secondary
mouse (relay) progenitors retain NSC functions. Our objective is to characterize mouse and human B2
cells, trace their origin and determine if they have NSC properties. We propose three specific aims: Aim
1: We will use single cell genomics and high-resolution light and electron microscopy to define
morphological and transcriptomic profiles of mouse and human B2 cells. Aim 2: We will use selective
labeling, cell purification and transplantation to determine the function of mouse B2 cells. Aim 3: We
will purify human V-SVZ astrocytes and test their progenitor potential in vitro and by
xenotransplantation into the adult mouse brain. This new knowledge will impact our understanding of
human brain development and postnatal neurogenesis, aiding in the discovery of developmental origins of
neurological disorders in children and adults. The precise identification of a new human cell type with
neurogenic potential could also be key for regenerative medicine and to trace the origin of brain tumors."
